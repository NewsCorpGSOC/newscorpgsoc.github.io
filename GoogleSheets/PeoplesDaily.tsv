Regional coordinated development and urban-rural integrated development showed new features. Looking at the world, China is still an important engine of global economic growth.

Xi's Liaoning Visit - Wang-Rubio Call - Zhang Youxia & He Weidong Stress Combat Readiness - Deep Dive: Chinese Scholars Discuss China's Role as 'Defen...	Before we get to today's edition, let me cover some of the big reports from the weekend. First, Saturday's front page was dedicated to Xi Jinping's visit to Liaoning ahead of the Spring Festival. Xi was accompanied by Liaoning Party Secretary Hao Peng and Governor Li Lecheng. Xi visited Huludao, Shenyang, Benxi and other areas from January 22 to 24. Also Cai Qi and He Lifeng traveled with Xi. First in Huludao, Xi visited Zhujiagou Village, which had suffered severe floods in August. Xinhua says: -At the entrance to the village, Xi looked at the affected areas, asking in detail about the summer flooding and the relocation of villagers at that time, as well as the subsequent relief work. He urged local officials to ensure the villagers stay warm throughout the winter. During visits to two village households, the president inspected the structural integrity of their homes, checked their preparations for holiday celebrations, and asked whether government subsidies for rebuilding had been adequately provided. He also inquired about the villagers' main sources of income.- Among the villagers whose home Xi visited was Wang Baowei. Wang -told the General Secretary that the new house was bright and warm, and all the New Year's goods had been prepared.

The Party and the government will always be the strong support of the masses.- ，，，，、。，。，，. The next day Xi visited Shenyang, where he went to a vegetable market. As per the report, he -acknowledged the significant improvements in living conditions following a general revamping there-. He also visited a local housing community that had undergone renovation.

Xi also visited a community service center, where there was lots of fun to be had with writing of couplets, flute performances, etc. Later in the day, Xi visited Bensteel Group in the city of Benxi. Xi said that -the manufacturing industry must adhere to the direction of high-end, intelligent, and green development, continuously improving the technological content and added value of products. State-owned large enterprises like Bensteel should contribute more to Chinese-style modernization.- ，、、，，. On the final day, Xi listened to work reports from the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government. He -affirmed the achievements made in Liaoning's various works.- -Xi Jinping pointed out that Liaoning has a relatively complete industrial system, and must coordinate the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries with the cultivation and strengthening of strategic emerging industries, accelerating the construction of a modern industrial system. Traditional industries must strengthen industrial foundation reconstruction and major technical equipment breakthroughs, continuously enhancing core competitiveness. Cultivating and strengthening strategic emerging industries focuses on strengthening the deep integration of technological innovation and industrial innovation, developing new quality productive forces according to local conditions. The heavier the development tasks, the more attention must be paid to ecological environmental protection, promoting comprehensive green transformation of economic and social development.- ，，，。，。，。，，。 Xi Jinping stressed that the comprehensive revitalisation of northeast China ultimately depends on reform and opening up. In order to grasp the reform, it is necessary to further focus on problems, emphasize priorities, and break through difficulties, putting more effort into building a law-based government, optimizing the business environment, adhering to and implementing the ‘two unwaverings', and improving the modern enterprise system with Chinese characteristics. Now, the door of our country's opening up is opening wider and wider. Cadres at all levels must improve their ability to think about problems, make decisions, and do work under open conditions. ，，。、、，、、--、。，，、、. He then talked about the need to -adhere to the integrated development of urban and rural areas, promote the construction of new urbanization with county towns as an important carrier, optimize the allocation of public resources and industrial chain layout in counties and villages, and solidly promote the comprehensive revitalization of rural areas-. ，、，，，，.

We must thoroughly implement the spirit of the Central Committee's eight-point regulations and their implementation rules, and encourage cadres at all levels to truly seek truth and be pragmatic, honest and self-disciplined.- ，，。，，，。，、. Share Tracking People's Daily Also on Saturday, the paper carried a report on Wang Yi's call with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This has been extensively covered in the press. The Chinese readout says: -Wang Yi stated that President Xi Jinping had an important phone call with President Trump last Friday, during which a series of consensuses were reached. The development of China-US relations has reached a new critical juncture. President Xi Jinping comprehensively elaborated on China's policy toward the US, and President Trump responded positively, expressing his expectation of maintaining a good relationship with President Xi and emphasizing that US-China cooperation could resolve many global issues. Wang Yi said that the two heads of state have set the direction and established the tone for China-US relations. Both teams must implement the important consensus reached by the two leaders, uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation, maintain communication, manage differences, expand cooperation, and promote the stable, healthy, and sustainable development of China-US relations, finding the proper way for the two countries to interact in the new era. ，，。。，，，。，、。，、、，、、，、、，. Wang -emphasised that the leadership of the Communist Party of China is the choice of the Chinese people, and China's development follows a clear historical logic and possesses strong internal momentum. Our goal is to enable the people to live better lives and to contribute more significantly to the world. We have no intention of surpassing or replacing anyone, but we must defend our legitimate right to development. Wang Yi articulated China's principled stance on the Taiwan issue, demanding that the US handle it with caution. He stressed that Taiwan has been a part of China's territory since ancient times, and China will never allow Taiwan to be separated from the country. The US has made solemn commitments to the one-China policy in the three China-US Joint Communiqués and must not breach its word/break its promise . ，，，，。，。，。，，。，. Finally, this bit caught everyone's attention. Wang said that -major countries should act like major countries and should take on their due international responsibilities, safeguard world peace and help all countries achieve common development. He expressed hope that Rubio would conduct himself responsibly/behave well , playing a constructive role in the future of the peoples of China and the US, as well as in maintaining global peace and stability.- ，，，，。，，. In the official English translation, this was reported as Wang calling on Rubio to -make the right decisions.- As Lingling Wei's report for WSJ says, this is -an idiom that conveys a sense of caution that one should consider the consequences of one's actions.- The report adds: -The sleight of hand shows China's leader Xi Jinping wants to strike a balance between trying to deal with the Trump administration and maintaining his strongman posture to the Chinese public.- The State Department's readout was brief. Rubio told Wang that -the Trump Administration will pursue a U.S.-PRC relationship that advances U.S. interests and puts the American people first. The Secretary also stressed the United States' commitment to our allies in the region and serious concern over China's coercive actions against Taiwan and in the South China Sea. The Secretary also discussed other issues of bilateral, regional, and global importance with his Chinese counterpart.- The Chinese readout has Rubio saying that: -The United States and China are two great nations. The U.S.-China relations are the most important bilateral relationship of the 21st century and will shape the future of the world, he said. The United States is willing to engage in candid communication with China, resolve differences properly, manage bilateral relations in a mature and cautious way, jointly address global challenges and maintain world peace and stability, he said. Rubio said the United States does not support ‘Taiwan independence' and hopes the Taiwan question can be resolved by peaceful means which are acceptable to both sides of the Taiwan Strait.- Share Tracking People's Daily On Sunday, the lead report was on Xi's inspection tour of the PLA's Northern Theater Command on Friday.

Finally, there's a report (English report) informing that China's electricity consumption rose by 6.8 percent year on year in 2024, according to data released by the National Energy Administration. The total figure for the year was 9.85 trillion kilowatt-hours (kWh), the data showed. During 2024, power consumption by the country's primary industries increased by 6.3 percent year on year, while that of its secondary and tertiary sectors rose by 5.1 percent and 9.9 percent, respectively.

A total of 44,334 people (including 2 provincial and ministerial officials and 79 prefecture-level officials) were criticized and educated, and 33,372 people were handed Party discipline and administrative sanctions. Subscribe now Page 9: On the theory page today, there's a full-page interview-based article making the point that China is a staunch defender of the international order. It's not surprising that Beijing is making this argument. This will be a big part of China's pitch to the world, given the policies that we are already witnessing from the Donald Trump administration in Washington. In this piece, the three guests who are commenting are: Chen Dongxiao, President of Shanghai Institutes for International Studies Professor Zhai Kun, School of International Relations, Peking University Wu Hao, Associate Professor of the Academy of Regional and Global Governance at Beijing Foreign Studies University My brief take: The conversation is divided into four parts. I am doing a deep dive into each of these. This was an interesting read. There is little in this conversation around China's engagement with specific major powers or regions. This is largely about China's broad approach to multilateral institutions, globalisation and global governance with an emphasis on morality and support for the Global South. There is, of course, sharp and thinly-veiled criticism of the US and its economic policies. Another interesting aspect of this conversation is a reaffirmation about China's revisionist — not revolutionary — approach to multilateral institutions. This approach is only going to be further boosted with the US under Trump ceding space to Beijing at international forums and on issues of global significance, such as health and climate change. The final point that I'd like to make here is that the conversation also underscores deep anxiety about the emergence of disorder and geopolitical contestation, which are weakening institutions and presenting challenges for deal-making even on issues of shared interests. The first bit of the conversation is around the UN and structure of the international order. The moderator asks the speakers to describe the current international order, adding that what is the significance of abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter for maintaining the current international order? Chen says: -The current international order is a set of international rules and its guarantee mechanisms established by countries around the world after World War II, drawing on the painful lessons of the two world wars suffered by mankind in the 20th century, based on the results of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War, and with the fundamental goals of maintaining world peace, promoting common development and universal human rights. The UN Charter laid the foundation for the current international order. To maintain the current international order, the first thing is to adhere to the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. As the world enters a new period of turbulence and volatility, the importance of abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter has become more prominent. Hegemonism, unilateralism and protectionism are the main sources of chaos in the world today; they run counter to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. To ensure an equal and orderly process of world multi-polasization, we must jointly abide by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and jointly uphold the universally recognised basic norms of international relations. To ensure a process of economic globalisation that is inclusive and beneficial and to effectively respond to new challenges such as climate change, we must strengthen the authority of the United Nations and practice true multilateralism.- ：20，，、。。，。，。、、，。，，。，，，。 Zhai defines the international order as comprising ‘three ones': there is only one system in the world, that is, the international system with the United Nations at its core; there is only one order, that is, the international order based on international law; there is only one set of rules, that is, the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. Adhering to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter has multiple meanings for maintaining the current international system. First, inclusiveness; currently, the United Nations has 193 member states, covering the vast majority of countries in the current international system. Second, legitimacy; the UN Charter must be adhered to by all UN member states. Third, baseline standard; the purposes and principles of the United Nations are the benchmark/baseline standard for ‘working together to overcome difficulties' . Fourth, unity; have proposals for a future new order, which underscores the urgency of adhering to the UN Charter to ensure cohesion. ：，，，--：，；，；，。：，193，；，；，--；，，. The next question is about the challenges of implementing the purposes and principles of the UN Charter because the work of the UN -is sometimes obstructed by unilateralism, hegemonism and power politics. A few countries advocate for a so-called ‘rules-based international order', which has caused serious harm to the effectiveness and authority of the United Nations. In the current international context, how does China support and strengthen the role of the UN as the core platform of multilateralism? Wu Hao doesn't really answer the question. Wu calls the UN Charter the ‘textbook' of fairness and justice, saying that it must be implemented and one must remember the original aspirations. The moderator then reminds us that -this year marks the 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations and the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. President Xi Jinping has pointed out: ‘Our predecessors gathered wisdom from all parties to formulate the UN Charter, laid the cornerstone of the modern international order, and established the basic norms of contemporary international relations'. As one of the anti-fascist allies with the largest casualties in World War II and the first founding member to sign the UN Charter, China has always regarded defending the authority of the United Nations and maintaining the post-World War II international order as its sacred duty.- In response, Zhai says that -as the core platform of multilateralism, the United Nations has never stopped facing challenges. The logic of multilateralism is to serve the interests of the majority of countries, which inevitably stands in opposition to unilateralism and hegemonism. Therefore, the UN needs to advocate and maintain true multilateralism. China has explored a set of systematic measures: first, resolutely supporting and defending the UN, clearly proposing the aforementioned ‘three ones'; second, increasing its contributions to UN funding, supporting UN peacekeeping operations, promoting South-South cooperation, and strengthening the ‘Global South', thereby making multilateral forces more balanced; third, continuously launch global governance initiatives and putting them into practice.- ：，。，、。，。：，--；，，，--，；. Chen adds that one of the most significant aspects of China's support for the UN is that its -financial contribution to the United Nations has continued to increase over the past decade. China has become the second largest contributor to the United Nations dues and peacekeeping contributions, and will bear more than 20% of the United Nations' regular budget expenditures between 2025 and 2027.- Wu adds that -China is the largest contributor of troops to peacekeeping operations among the permanent members of the UN Security Council.- ：，10，，2025202720%。：：。35. The next question is on international agreements. Chen says that -In the face of the United States beginning a new round of withdrawing from UN mechanisms, China has taken concrete actions to firmly support the United Nations and other organizations in playing a greater role in international affairs. For example, China strictly fulfills its obligations of the NPT and is the only one among the five nuclear-weapon states to pledge unconditionally not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states and regions.- ：，。，《》，。(Note: I guess Chen hasn't heard about the Pakistani and North Korean nuclear programmes.) Wu talks about the Paris climate accord, linking it personally to Xi Jinping, as a means of demonstrating commitment at the highest level. -In 2016, President Xi Jinping personally deposited the legal instruments of China's ratification of the Paris Agreement…-, he stresses. Share Tracking People's Daily The second part of the conversation is around China's call for -equal and orderly world multi-polarisation-. This implies -insisting on the equality of all countries, big and small, opposing hegemony and power politics, and effectively promoting the democratisation of international relations.- ，，，. The moderator asks that -at present, the international community is increasingly concerned about the ‘cooperation deficit' and ‘order deficit'.- He also talks about the discussions around a new Cold War and balance of power. Zhai argues that the current situation with geo-political contestation becoming evident and explicit, prevailing deficit in global governance, major power relations ‘polarization', and international situation ‘volatility' pose significant challenges to the process of world multipolarization. First, there is the inversion of cause and effect, wherein the geopolitical drivers of global disorder are attributed to be the product of ‘the rise of the East and decline of the West' and the impact of ‘Global South' countries challenging the Western-dominated order. Second, there is a neglect of the role of multipolar forces; for instance, the Eurasia Group's 2025 global risk forecast highlights a ‘G0' world, implying a ‘poleless/leaderless world'. Third, it results in coordination difficulties among multipolar forces, impacting the achievement of substantive consultation results within the multilateral framework by countries that are considered to be multipolar forces. ：，--、--、--、--，。，--，--；，2025-G0-，--；，。 Chen adds that -unity and cooperation are the only correct choices for maintaining international order stability and addressing global challenges. Currently, the ‘new Cold War' mentality and hegemonic practices primarily damage international cooperation and mutual trust, exacerbating the risk of bloc confrontations in the international community, harming global partnerships, and making trust-building mechanisms difficult to establish. Cooperation requires all parties to balance their own national interests with the legitimate demands of other countries to achieve mutual benefits. Excessive pursuit of self-interest or blind pursuit of absolute security will inevitably lead to a decline in the willingness to cooperate, and the ‘cooperation deficit' will become more prominent. While some countries may appear to gain short-term benefits on specific issues, they ultimately will fall into a cycle of isolation and confrontation. In order to maintain their dominance in international affairs, hegemonic countries often use means such as interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and creating divisions. This not only worsens the regional and international security situation but also makes the process of world multi-polarization unstable. Hegemonic countries are guided by the desire to maintain monopoly interests and absolute security, and adopt the utilitarian and opportunistic principles of ‘use when it suits you, and abandon if it doesn't' for international rules and order, resulting in the existing international order facing a crisis of collapse.- ：。，--，，，。，。，--，，。，、，，。，-，-，. The next question that the moderator asks is what are China's considerations when actively advocating for equal and orderly world multi-polarisation? What specific measures have been taken? What does it mean for maintaining the current international order? In asking this, the moderator also offered a quote from Henry Kissinger. I am mentioning, since Kissinger gets referenced in one of the responses below too. In response, Wu stresses the principle of sovereign equality as being fundamental. Zhai adds that -as I understand it, the general direction of the world order is the result of a multitude of forces and is joint governance based on multipolarity. This is an assessment based on the superposition of three facts. Western countries can no longer constructively promote the building of world order. Acknowledging and accepting the role of ‘multipolar' countries in world order is a historical trend. Second, countries called ‘multipolar' will inevitably play a major role in the evolution of the world order as Kissinger had expected. Third, the expansion of the BRICS and the emergence of the concept of ‘Global South' show that China actively advocates equal and orderly world multipolarity. This is not to exclude the ‘old poles' and to win over ‘new poles', but about calling for global governance of global issues by multipolar forces, including both old and new poles. This is fundamentally different from the old order and a watershed in history.- ：，，。：，--；--，，；--，，--，--，。，. (Note: This is really interesting. The argument is not about replacing the West but about accommodating Chinese interests. It is essentially a case for spheres of influence although couched in rather inclusive language.) The next question that the moderator asks is about the Global South and China's advocacy around the Global South. Chen responds by saying that -China is a natural member of the ‘Global South' and has always promoted openness, inclusiveness and cooperation in the ‘Global South'. He then points to GSI, GCI and BRI. He says that the -global governance concept advocated by China has won widespread response from the countries of the Global South, and has effectively promoted the process of world multi-polarisation and democratisation of international relations.- Share Tracking People's Daily The third part of the conversation is on the theme of inclusive economic globalisation. The moderator asks: -How does inclusive economic globalisation reflect the voice of the Global South countries and embody the interests of the Global South countries? What role has China played in it? What specific measures have been taken?- In asking this question the moderator also talked about the North-South gap, presenting this data point: -during the COVID-19 pandemic, the G7 received a total of $280 billion in funds from the International Monetary Fund, while some of the least developed countries with a population far exceeding that of the G7 received only about $8 billion in total.- (Note: Such disparity is, of course, unconscionable.) ：，、。，，，2800，80。，--，。--、--？？? Wu says that inclusive economic globalisation -is about supporting each country to independently and autonomously find a development path that suits their own national conditions, opposing the monotonisation/homogenisation of development models, rejecting all forms of unilateralism and protectionism, promoting the liberalisation and facilitation of trade and investment, maintaining the stability and smooth flow of global industrial and supply chains, and preserving the vitality and momentum of global economic growth.- ，，，，，，. The moderator then asks about BRI and GDI. Chen says that GDI has -gathered consensus among all parties, promoted North-South dialogue and South-South cooperation, and has been supported and participated by more than 100 countries and multiple international organizations, including the United Nations.- ：，，，100。 The next bit is interesting: Moderator: Faced with the shadow of protectionism, and with some countries frequently advocating for ‘decoupling' and ‘building walls', how has China continued to adhere to and maintain the rules and systems of trade liberalisation and multilateral trading system that have been fully proven to be correct and effective in practice, and constantly innovated, improved and developed, and worked to build an open world economic system? ：，----，、，、，？ Wu outlines four points. First, maintaining the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core: since joining the WTO in December 2001, China has fully fulfilled its WTO commitments, unswervingly expanded opening up, and continued to promote the liberalisation and facilitation of global trade and investment. Second, accelerating the implementation of the free trade zone strategy and steadily expanding institutional opening up. China has built and operated 22 free trade pilot zones. Third, focusing on expanding the global high-standard free trade zone network. China has signed 23 free trade agreements with 30 countries and regions, and has implemented the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with high quality. Fourth, holding events like the China International Import Expo to inject new impetus into the open world economy. ：，，200112，，，；，，22；，3023，《》；，. Zhai says that China's approach has been to maintain integrity while seeking innovation. This has two meanings. One is to uphold integrity and make innovations within the existing international system and multilateral mechanisms. The most typical example is China's accession to the WTO and its efforts to promote the reform of the WTO, as well as to innovate rules and standards that better meet the development needs of the Global South countries. The other is to uphold integrity and make innovations outside the existing international system and multilateral mechanisms. Currently, multilateral mechanisms and institutions face challenges such as development stagnation and institutional dilemmas. Building an open global economic system requires multilateral mechanisms that can adapt to new characteristics, solve new problems, and promote new developments. China has excelled in this aspect, for example, by initiating the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Silk Road Fund, and others. ：，--。，。，--。。、。，、、。，、. Moderator: The Central Foreign Affairs Work Conference pointed out that inclusive economic globalisation ‘must the attempt to roll back globalisation and abuse the concept of security, oppose all forms of unilateralism and protectionism, firmly promote trade and investment liberalisation and facilitation, overcome the structural problems hindering the healthy development of the world economy, and make economic globalisation more open, inclusive, universally beneficial and balanced'. How should one interpret the concepts of being open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all? What is the significance of the value concepts demonstrated by these four ‘keywords' for maintaining the current international order? ：，-、，、，，，、、、-。、、、？--？ Chen says: The current world economic order is facing severe challenges of anti-globalisation and pan-securitisation. Advocating the construction of an open world economic system and promoting economic globalisation in a more open, inclusive, balanced and universally beneficial direction are important international public goods provided by China. Openness aims to deepen international division of labor and cooperation, so that commodities, services, capital, technology, personnel, data and other factors can flow and be allocated more freely, conveniently and in an orderly manner on a global scale, thereby promoting the deep integration and development of the economies of countries around the world. Inclusiveness means recognizing the differences in history, culture, social systems and development level among countries around the world, respecting the development paths and models chosen independently by countries, abandoning discriminatory and exclusive standards and rules, and achieving common development. Universally beneficial emphasises that the fruits of economic globalization should benefit more countries around the world, especially the Global South countries, so that different countries, classes and people can participate in and share the fruits of economic and social development, and achieve mutual benefit and common prosperity. Balanced entails being committed to alleviating the imbalance of development between countries and within countries caused by differences in resource endowments and unfair global resource allocation, as well as addressing the balance between economic growth, social development and environmental protection among countries, and promoting the coordinated development of the world economy. These four ‘keywords' reflect the value pursuit in the era of economic globalization and are of great significance to promoting human progress. In sum, openness has injected a steady stream of strength into human progress, inclusiveness has promoted international cooperation and mutual trust, universally beneficial has turned the promise of not leaving anyone or any country behind into reality, and balanced has continuously improved the fairness and sustainability of world economic development. ：。，、、、，。，，、、、、、，。，、、，，、，。，--，、，。，，、、，。--，。，，，、，. Wu Hao added: -As mentioned earlier, equal multipolarity and orderly multipolarity correspond in a certain sense to ‘democracy' and ‘justice' among the common values of humanity. Universally beneficial economic globalisation and inclusive economic globalisation correspond in a certain sense to ‘fairness' and ‘freedom' among the common values of humanity. Additionally, openness and peace, balance and development are each a dialectically unified organic whole: peace is the prerequisite for openness, balance is the ideal state of development. Promoting economic globalisation toward a more open, inclusive, universally beneficial, and balanced direction, achieving equal and orderly world multi-polarisation—openness, inclusiveness, universal benefit, balance, equality, and order truly interpret the connotations of the common values of humanity of ‘peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy, freedom', and serve as a ‘fixed star/guide/stabilising force' for the current international order.- ：，，----。，、：，。、、、，——、、、、、-、、、、、-，--. Share Tracking People's Daily The fourth and final part of the conversation is around the reform of the global governance system. In this the moderator makes the point that Xi has said that -promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind is not to replace one system with another, nor is it to replace one civilisation with another, but rather about countries with different social systems, different ideologies, different historical cultures, and different development levels sharing interests, rights, and responsibilities in international affairs, forming the greatest common denominator for jointly building a better world.- ：：-，，，、、、、、，.- Chen responds by saying that -strengthening and reforming the global governance system is an objective requirement for the development and progress of human society. In the face of global challenges, especially when some countries wield the big stick of unilateralism and protectionism, the global governance system can only be strengthened, not weakened. At the same time, the global governance system must also reflect the changes in the world economic landscape, developing in a more just and reasonable direction. For a long time, some important international organizations have been dominated by a small number of developed countries, and the legitimate interests and demands of Global South countries have not been fully reflected. For this reason, China advocates true multilateralism, advocates increasing the representation and voice of Global South countries, and advocates respecting the cultural traditions and developmental stage differences of various countries, promoting the establishment of a more fair, reasonable, and effective international rules system.- ：。，、，，。，，。，，--。，，--，，、、. The moderator then chimes in to say that -the starting point and end goal of China's participation in and promotion of the reform of the global governance system is to continuously enhance the inclusiveness, legitimacy and effectiveness of the global governance system on the basis of adhering to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter-. ：，，，，、。 In response, Wu Hao outlines four points about China's approach to global governance. -First, it takes the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind as its value guide, advocating that all countries jointly discuss global affairs, jointly build governance systems, and jointly share governance results. Second, it focuses on the most prominent development, security, and civilizational issues in the world today, and provides international public goods represented by the ‘three major global initiatives'. Third, it takes the high-quality joint construction of BRI as a practical platform, continuously expanding the scope of cooperation, innovating cooperation models, and achieving fruitful results. Fourth, it provides new aspects to global governance system reform, proposing concepts such as building a community of common health for mankind and a community of life between humans and nature, which have become new highlights in the reform of the global governance system.- ：，：，、、；、、，--；--，、，；，、，. Finally, the moderator asks that given that the reform of the global governance system is at a historical turning point, going forward, how can China further play the role of a responsible major country, firmly safeguard the current international order, and promote the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction? Chen responds: In the future, the world will face an increase in instability, uncertainty, and unpredictable factors. To further demonstrate the role of a responsible major power, China must adhere to true multilateralism, maintain the United Nations' core position and leading role in international affairs, promote the practical adherence to the UN Charter's purposes and principles, support reasonable UN reform, and make the UN better adapt to changes in the international situation. It is essential to practice a global governance approach based on consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits, push for reforms in the global governance system, deepen and expand global partnerships, strengthen important platforms and mechanisms such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the ‘G77 and China', and unite the consensus and efforts of the Global South countries. It is essential to proactively take the lead in rule-making, ensuring that rules fully reflect the interests and demands of the vast developing countries. It is essential to continuously enhance comprehensive national strength, consolidate capabilities and foundations, continuously release the dividends of Chinese-style modernization, and provide a solid material foundation for playing a greater role in global governance. ：，、。，，，，，。，，，、-77-，--。，。，，，。 Zhai ends by saying that -a just and reasonable international order can bring a good external environment to the greatest majority of people globally…The Pact for the Future adopted at the UN's Summit of the Future in September 2024 shows that countries can unite to reshape a multilateral system that serves all people and all nations. China will join hands with all parties to recall the original intention of the establishment of the UN, firmly maintain the UN's authority and role, advocate for equal and orderly world multipolarity and inclusive economic globalisation, and build a solid foundation for world peace and development. In this sense, China maintains the current international order and also shapes the future international order.- ：。，：-，……，。-。9《》，，。，，、，。，，.

Xi-Putin Meeting - New Rural Revitalisation Plan - Getting Long-term Funds into Stock Market - China-Bangladesh Ties - Zhong Caiwen Article on Balanci...	Let me begin with a brief announcement, owing to the requests that we've received, we've extended the deadline for final applications for the Watching China course. Please complete the application and payment by Monday, January 27, 2025, 11:59 PM India Time. The course begins on Saturday, February 1, 2025. Course and application details are available here. Before I get to today's edition, let me cover Xi Jinping's meeting with Vladimir Putin and Ding Xuexiang's remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The Chinese readout of the meeting between Xi and Putin says: -President Xi recalled the three meetings he had with President Putin in 2024 and the many important common understandings they reached. In 2024, the two countries celebrated the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic ties. The bilateral relationship, centering on the spirit of lasting good-neighborliness and friendship, comprehensive strategic coordination, and mutually beneficial cooperation, demonstrated renewed vitality. The China-Russia Years of Culture had many highlights. Practical cooperation made steady progress. Two-way trade maintained growth momentum. Close coordination in such multilateral fora as the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and BRICS provided more positive energy to the reform and development of the global governance system. President Xi stressed his readiness to work with President Putin and guide China-Russia relations to a new height in 2025, to respond to external uncertainties with the stability and resilience of China-Russia ties, to boost the development and prosperity of both countries, and to uphold international fairness and justice. He underscored the need for the two countries to deepen strategic coordination, firmly support each other, and defend their legitimate interests. He also noted the need to cement and expand bilateral relations with a view to deepening practical cooperation. This year marks the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression, the Soviet Union's Great Patriotic War and the World Anti-Fascist War. It also marks the 80th anniversary of the United Nations. China and Russia should take the opportunities presented by the anniversaries to jointly safeguard the U.N.-centered international system and the fruits of victory in World War II, and to call on all countries to observe the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, uphold universally recognized basic norms of international relations, and follow true multilateralism. As the rotating president of the SCO, China will work with Russia and other member states to take the organization to a new stage featuring higher-quality development and greater responsibility and contribution. China and Russia should also work together to advance greater BRICS cooperation and write a new chapter of the Global South pursuing strength through unity.- The Russian readout of Putin's remarks is available here, if you are interested. Putin told Xi: -I agree with you that the basis of cooperation between Moscow and Beijing is a broad community of national interests and a coincidence of views on what relations between major powers should be. We build our ties on the basis of friendship, mutual trust and support, equality and mutual benefit. These ties are self-sufficient and do not depend on domestic political factors and the current global situation. Their comprehensive strengthening fully meets the objectives of the comprehensive development of Russia and China, increasing the well-being of the peoples of both countries.- He also said: -We jointly advocate for the construction of a more just multipolar world order, and work to ensure indivisible security in the Eurasian space and in the world as a whole. It is safe to say that foreign policy relations, the joint work of Russia and China objectively play an important stabilizing role in international affairs.- Reuters' report is interesting. It adds: The two leaders discussed -how to build ties with Donald Trump, prospects for a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine and Moscow's firm support for Beijing's position on Taiwan. Xi and Putin, who spoke for an hour and 35 minutes by video call after Trump was sworn in as U.S. president on Monday, proposed a further deepening of the strategic partnership between their countries which worries the West…Xi and Putin ‘have indicated a willingness to build relations with the United States on a mutually beneficial, mutually respectful basis, if the Trump team really shows interest in this,' Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters in Moscow. ‘It was also noted from our side that we are ready for dialogue with the new U.S. administration on the Ukrainian conflict.' Ushakov said Putin wanted long-term peace in Ukraine, not a short-term ceasefire, but any deal must take into account Russia's interests. No specific proposals for a call with Trump have been received, he said.- Share Tracking People's Daily Next, speaking at the WEF, Ding made a pitch for economic globalisation. I am going to use a mix of the text on the WEF's website and the report in the People's Daily yesterday. This is because some bits of the speech available on the WEF's website are not quoted in the PD report and some of the language of the speech on the WEF website is not the same as what the Chinese version carries. Ding said: Economic globalisation is -an overwhelming trend of history. Over the years, despite some headwinds and setbacks, economic globalization has demonstrated strong resilience and dynamism. According to WTO [World Trade Organization] statistics, the total volume of global trade has grown by an average of 5.8% per year since 1995, and reached $30.4 trillion in 2023. Between 1995 and 2022, the share of middle- and low-income countries in global export rose from 16% to 32%. And developed countries did not lose out from this. Their growth rates and the well-being of their peoples have also been effectively boosted. Economic globalization is not a ‘you lose, I win' zero-sum game, but a universally beneficial process where all can benefit and win together. Admittedly, economic globalization will bring some tensions and disagreements on distribution. These issues can only be resolved in the process of promoting economic globalization. Protectionism leads nowhere. Trade war has no winners. We must seize all opportunities to steer economic globalization in the right direction, tackle the development challenges with universal benefit, and pool strengths with inclusive cooperation, so as to usher in a new phase of economic globalization that is more dynamic, more inclusive and more sustainable.- -We must hold high the banner of multilateralism, pursue the vision of global governance featuring extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefit, and ensure equal rights, equal opportunities and equal rules for all countries in international affairs … We should firmly uphold the multilateral trading system with WTO at its core, uphold its role as the main channel for rules-making on international trade, and foster an open, inclusive and nondiscriminatory environment for international economic cooperation.- -We need to jointly foster new drivers and strengths for global economic development…In today's world, the new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation is deepening, cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), quantum technology and biomedicine are flourishing, and digital, green and intelligent development is picking up pace. We should seize and make the most of these opportunities to enhance connectivity in the digital age, promote international cooperation on scientific and technological innovation, help countries strengthen emerging and future industries, and accelerate the cultivation and development of new quality productive forces…we should help developing countries build AI, intelligent transportation, smart energy and other new infrastructure, and promote the application of information technology in key livelihood sectors, so that more countries can get on board the fast train of digital economic development.- He talked about -challenges such as climate change, food security and energy security- and pitched GDI, GSI and GCI. He also said that -The international community should work together to accelerate the energy transition in an equitable, orderly and just manner, keep the new energy industrial chain stable, and promote green products and technologies. We must follow a consistent approach in addressing climate change and improve the consistency of environmental and climate policies and economic and trade policies, so as to prevent economic and trade frictions from impeding the process of green transition, and avoid erecting green barriers that could disrupt normal economic and trade cooperation.- Then on the Chinese economy, Ding said that it -has rebounded and turned for the better. The headwinds encountered by the Chinese economy are due to both the external environment and temporary pains brought by our own economic restructuring.- -China will further increase the intensity of macroeconomic policies, implement more proactive fiscal policy and a moderately loose monetary policy, and promote the effective improvement of economic quality and reasonable growth in quantity. Second, the green and low-carbon transformation is accelerating. China has built the world's largest and most complete new energy industry chain. Seventy percent of the photovoltaic components and 60% of wind power equipment worldwide come from China. This high-quality production capacity has served as a strong boost to global green development and climate response…China's pursuit of green transition is a long-term commitment rather than an act of expediency. No matter how the international landscape may evolve, China's determination and action for proactive climate response will not change. We will make tireless efforts to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate pollution while expanding green transition and promoting economic growth, accelerate the comprehensive transition to green economic and social development, observe the goals and principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement, and make greater contributions to global climate response. Third, reform and opening up are constantly moving towards a higher level…We will build a high-standard socialist market economy, foster a fairer and more dynamic market environment, and make resource allocation as efficient and productive as possible…Last year, China lifted all restrictions on foreign investment in manufacturing and established a negative-list system for cross-border trade in services. And we have been taking systematic steps to further open important sectors like telecom, the internet, education, culture and medical services. In terms of foreign trade, we don't seek trade surplus; we want to import more competitive quality products and services to promote balanced trade. China's overall tariff level has been cut to 7.3% – a fairly low level in the world – and we give all least developed countries having diplomatic relations with China zero-tariff treatment for 100% tariff lines…In terms of business environment, we know issues like China's IPR [intellectual property rights] protection, equal participation in government procurement, cross-border data flow, access to factors of production, qualification approval and standard setting are of great interest to multinationals. In these areas, we are continuously improving relevant institutions and policies…China's door of opening up will not be closed and will only open even wider, and our business environment will only get better. We sincerely welcome more foreign enterprises to invest and do business in China, and achieve greater success in sharing China's opportunities.- Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, January 23, 2025. Page 1: Xi Jinping is currently visiting Liaoning. I'll cover his visit as the paper does, i.e., once it's complete. In the meantime, the lead report today is about the new Plan for Comprehensive Rural Revitalization (2024-2027). The full plan is published in the paper. I am only going to summarise some key points: It promises -substantial progress- in rural revitalization by 2027 and -decisive progress- by 2035. The latter also means that -agricultural modernization will be basically achieved and rural areas will basically have modern living conditions.- 、。2035，，，. With regard to food security, the plan says that it will be treated as -the primary task of modern agricultural development-. In terms of targets, the plan calls to: ensure that grain planting areas remain stable at about 1.75 billion mu, and cereal areas remain around 1.45 billion mu increase grain production capacity by 100 billion jin and promote the steady increase of grain production capacity to 1.4 trillion jin implement the national soybean and oilseed production capacity improvement project improve the market monitoring and early warning system, coordinate the market-oriented policy-based grain procurement and storage system, improve the reserve system… increase investment in high-standard farmland construction strengthen agricultural science and technology and equipment support… construct major scientific and technological infrastructure, strengthen original research; increase efforts in key core technology breakthroughs, enhance technological integration and application; improve agricultural technology extension service system…accelerate the revitalisation of the seed industry by building facilities and platforms for germplasm resource preservation and identification; expedite breakthroughs in core seed source technologies, reinforce the role of enterprises as the main drivers of technological innovation, and cultivate large-scale seed enterprises…develop large-scale high-end intelligent agricultural machinery… 。，，。，；，；。，；，，。，；；. One of the stated goals is to cultivate civilised rural areas. The top priority in this regard is to -organise study of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, widely carry out propaganda and education on Party history, New China history, reform and opening-up history, and socialist development history, deeply conduct ‘Listen to the Party, Feel the Party's Grace, Follow the Party' propaganda and education activities. Strengthen ethnic unity and progress propaganda and education, forge a solid consciousness of the Chinese national community. Implement the civilised rural style construction project, take the socialist core values ​​as the guide, and strengthen the work of cultivating, practicing, and creating civilisation.- ，、、、，-、、-。，。，，、、。 It also calls to -do a good job in popularising law and science, and oppose feudal superstitions…address prominent issues like high bride prices, extravagant weddings, and disorderly burials, improve restrictive norms and advocative standards for simplified wedding and funeral practices, and filial piety.- 、，...，，，、、，、、。（），，。 The plan also calls to improve overall rural infrastructure, public utilities, community service facilities, digital connectivity, etc, among other things. Moving on, there's a long article on the -two new- policy. The officials quoted in this essentially see the policy as useful to: stimulate the potential of domestic demand move manufacturing industry towards a ‘new'/intelligent and ‘green' future accelerate the overall green transformation through green consumption and recycling Some excerpts from the report: Since the implementation of the trade-in policy in March 2024, sales of consumer goods in the fields of automobiles and home appliances have improved. Statistics show that the retail sales of passenger cars in 2024 reached 22.894 million units, a year-on-year increase of 5.5%; the retail sales of household appliances and audio-visual equipment in units above the designated size reached 1030.7 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 12.3%. In addition to boosting consumption growth, the old-for-new exchange has also promoted industrial upgrading and green transformation. Li Gang, Director General of the Department of Market Operation and Consumption Promotion of the Ministry of Commerce, presented this set of data: In the old-for-new exchange of cars, the proportion of new energy vehicles exceeded 60%, and more than 6.6 million old cars were replaced with new energy vehicles or energy-saving vehicles; in the old-for-new exchange of home appliances, the sales of first-class energy-efficient products accounted for more than 90%, driving the retail sales of high-efficiency grade and smart home appliances to grow by double digits for four consecutive months; in the old-for-new exchange of home decor, kitchen and bathroom products, nearly 10 million smart home products, such as smart toilets, sweeping robots, and smart door locks were replaced; more than 1 million old electric bicycles were updated to safer lead-acid battery-powered vehicles.- 3，、。：20242289.4，5.5%；10307，12.3%。，、。：，60%，660；，90%，4；，、、1000；100. In 2024, among the 4,600-plus equipment renewal projects supported solely by funds from ultra-long-term special government bonds, the volume of equipment renewal in industries such as manufacturing, energy usage, energy and power, and transportation exceeded 2 million units (sets). Zhao Chenxin, NDRC's Deputy Director, said that preliminary estimates indicate that, driven by the ‘Two New' policies, the total volume of equipment renewal in key sectors nationwide exceeded 20 million units (sets). Investment in the purchase of equipment and tools has been strongly boosted: in 2024, it increased by 15.7% year-on-year, accelerating by 9.1 percentage points compared to the previous year, contributing 2.2 percentage points to overall investment growth…In 2024, over 11,000 new smart community recycling facilities for discarded materials were added nationwide, and the number of scrapped motor vehicles recycled reached 8.46 million, a year-on-year increase of 64%. Data from key enterprises monitored by the Ministry of Commerce show that the recycling volume of used household appliances achieved year-on-year growth for five consecutive months starting in July. By the end of 2024, a total of 168 important national standards under the ‘Two New' framework for fields such as household appliances, furniture, automobiles, and consumer drones were successively released. -2024，4600，、、、200（）。-，，--，2000（）。：202415.7%，9.1，2.2。、。2024，1.1，846，64%。，75。2024，、、、--168. In terms of expansion and changes in the Two New policy for 2025, the report says: Already there have been steps to strengthen support for the trade-in of household appliances like microwave ovens, water purifiers, dishwashers, rice cookers within the subsidy scope; the maximum subsidy for purchasing air conditioners has increased from one unit per consumer to three units; subsidies are being provided for the purchase of new mobile phones, tablets, smart watches and bracelets; and the scope of support for scrapping and updating of automobiles, including fuel vehicles that meet the National IV emission standards has been expanded Li Gang said that -detailed implementation rules for five sectors: automobiles, home appliances, home furnishing and kitchen/bathroom equipment, electric bicycles, and digital products such as smartphones- will be issued soon while considering connection with 2024 policies. Liu Dechun from the NDRC said that domains like electronic information, production safety, and facility agriculture will be included in ultra-long-term special bonds for support; there will be support for National IV emission standard commercial trucks scrapping and updating; rice transplanter and other 6 agricultural machinery types will be included in the support list; in terms of raising standards, the subsidy standards for new energy city buses and power battery renewal will be increased, and the average subsidy per vehicle will be increased from 60,000 yuan to 80,000 yuan. The total monetary allocation for the ‘two new' policy will be made clear at the NPC in March.

Xinhua reports that Ding met with Karin Keller-Sutter, president of the Swiss Confederation and head of the Federal Department of Finance, and held talks with Guy Parmelin, vice president of the Federal Council and head of the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research. Ding -urged joint efforts to strengthen complementarity of advantages, seek mutual benefits, and accelerate negotiations on upgrading the free trade agreement, and strive for substantive results at an early date. ‘We should strengthen cooperation on innovation, jointly explore and promote the development of life sciences, artificial intelligence and green technology, and foster new growth areas for practical cooperation' … The vice premier also called for deepening financial connectivity and promoting people-to-people exchanges. He highlighted Switzerland's unique role in international and regional affairs as a permanently neutral country and host to many international organizations. This year marks the 80th anniversary of the United Nations, Ding said, noting China is willing to continue to make good use of existing mechanisms and channels with Switzerland, maintain communication and coordinate positions on multilateral affairs and international and regional hotspot issues, jointly practice genuine multilateralism, and contribute further to building a community with a shared future for mankind.- Share Next, there's a report on Wang Huning's remarks at a CPPCC meeting preparing for their March meeting. -Wang Huning said that it is necessary to thoroughly study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech on the work of the CPPCC, earnestly study and formulate implementation measures, and promote the high-quality development of the work of the CPPCC.

The meeting decided to submit the two draft reports for consideration to the 10th session of the Standing Committee of the 14th CPPCC National Committee, which is to be convened on March 1 and 2.- The meeting also revoked the membership of Lu Jin, former chairman of China National Gold Group. Lu has been under investigation since September 2024. Page 2: There's a brief report informing that the Central Financial Commission and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, along with other departments, has recently issued the implementation plan for promoting the entry of medium and long-term capital into the stock market. Global Times' report says: -The plan emphasized the importance of encouraging medium- and long-term investment funds - such as commercial insurance funds, the national social security fund, basic pension funds, enterprise annuity funds and public funds - to boost their presence in the stock market… The plan aims to enhance the proportion and stability of commercial insurance funds that are invested in A-shares. It seeks to guide large state-owned insurance companies to expand their A-share investments (including equity funds) in both scale and proportion. A long-term performance assessment cycle of at least three years will be introduced for state-owned insurance companies, with annual net asset returns weighted no more than 30 percent and three- to five-year performance indicators weighted at least 60 percent, the plan said. The plan also proposes optimizing the investment management mechanisms for the national social security fund and basic pension funds. This includes gradually increasing the proportion of equity investments by the national social security fund and implementing detailed long-term performance assessment mechanisms, such as a five-year cycle for the national social security fund and a three-year cycle for basic pension funds. Efforts will also focus on improving the market-oriented operation of enterprise annuity funds. This includes accelerating the introduction of three-year or longer performance assessment guidelines for enterprise annuity funds and supporting eligible employers in exploring individual investment options for annuities. Moreover, the plan aims to expand the scale and proportion of equity funds. The plan also seeks to optimize the capital market investment ecosystem. This includes encouraging listed companies to increase share buybacks and implement policies for multiple dividend distributions annually, per the plan.- Reuters' report on this says: -Authorities will in the first half of this year call on insurers to invest at least 100 billion yuan ($13.75 billion) of long-term funds into stocks, China Securities Regulatory Commission head Wu Qing said at a press conference. The regulator will encourage both state-owned and commercial insurers to invest 30% of new annual premiums in A-shares, and encourage mutual funds to increase their A-share holdings' tradable market value by at least 10% annually over the next three years, Wu said. The plan also involves guiding mutual fund managers to increase equity funds under their management, cut fund sales fee and promote the development of exchange-traded fund products.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: There's a report on ILD chief Liu Jianchao meeting with Bangladesh interim government's Advisor for Foreign Affairs Touhid Hossain.

I am not sure which institution this byline is attached to, but Bill Bishop has in the past suggested that it might be the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission. The article today does a deep dive into the five relationships, which were outlined in the 2024 CEWC readout. These must be balanced well going forward for economic development to progress. These are: It is necessary to balance the relationship between an effective market and a capable government, forming an economic order that is both ‘let loose/engender freedom or autonomy' () and ‘regulated/controlled'(). It is necessary to balance the relationship between total supply and total demand to ensure smooth circulation in the national economy. It is necessary to balance the relationship between cultivating new drivers of growth and renewing old ones, developing new quality productive forces according to local conditions. It is necessary to balance the relationship between improving incremental additions and revitalising existing stock, and comprehensively enhance resource allocation efficiency. It is necessary to balance the relationship between improving quality and expanding total quantity and consolidate the material foundation of Chinese-style modernisation. ，----。，。，。，。，. This will be a long summary. So buckle up. For the first point, the author argues: -Managing the relationship between the government and the market is the core issue of economic system reform. The combination of an effective market and a proactive government is a key factor in the success of China's socialist market economy. Historical experience since the reform and opening-up shows that the socialist market economy can leverage the strengths of the market economy, allowing the market to play a decisive role in resource allocation, while also demonstrating the advantages of the socialist system by better enabling the government's role. This dual approach has provided institutional support for achieving the -two miracles- of rapid economic growth and long-term social stability in China. As the Chinese economy transitions from a phase of high-speed growth to high-quality development, higher demands are being placed on balancing the relationship between an effective market and a proactive government.- ，。，。，，，，，--。，. -Better leverage the role of the government, address the problems of absence and overreach… Leveraging the role of the government better does not mean expanding the role of the government, rather it refers to adhering to doing what should be done, not doing what should not be done, grasping the boundary between doing and not doing, and doing well the things the government should do, doing them thoroughly. Doing what should be done means continuously building a rule-of-law economy, a credit economy, perfecting market rules and taking the lead in following rules, focusing on correcting market failures, regulating competitive order, building a unified national big market, and providing a fair competitive grand stage for various business entities including state-owned enterprises, private enterprises, foreign-funded enterprises, and individual industrial and commercial households. It means leveraging the government's important role in planning guidance, industrial layout, innovation leadership, promoting technological innovation and industrial transformation. It means improving the macroeconomic governance system, strengthening macroeconomic regulation, smoothening the economic cycles, preventing large economic fluctuations, and promoting long-term sustainable and healthy economic development. It means strengthening quality supervision, standard construction, and driving product and service quality improvement through rules and standards. Not doing what should not be done means preventing inappropriate intervention in the activities of micro-subjects, not engaging in local protectionism and self-circulation, not pursuing law enforcement for personal gain, not engaging in arbitrary fines, inspections, and confiscations. The more standardized the government behavior, the more effective the market role will be. We must fully incorporate government behavior into the track of the rule of law, comprehensively build a law-based government, improve the government's trustworthiness and commitment mechanism, increase the protection of property rights, standardize law enforcement involving enterprises, reduce the institutional costs of market operation, and organically combine market-oriented mechanisms and legal principles to complement each other.- ，、。：-，，。-，、，，。，、，，，，，、、。、、，。，，，，。、，。，，，，、、。，。，，，，，，、. The author also calls to -create a fairer and more dynamic market environment.- The section ends with this: -In the relationship between government and market, the government is the subject, the market is the object. The government's role is proactive and the market's role is spontaneous. The key lies in regulating government behavior and transforming government functions. Only when the government plays a better role in its own responsibilities can the market play a decisive role in resource allocation.- ，，，，，，。，. Share Tracking People's Daily For the second point, the author says that achieving balance in supply and demand requires actions to be taken with regard to both. -Under the new development environment and conditions, there are many new requirements for deepening the supply-side structural reform. In terms of quality, it is necessary to adhere to the leadership of science and technology and innovation-driven development, promote the accelerated development of emerging industries, and promote the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries. In terms of quantity, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of advancing and retreating, ensuring protection (such as to ensure stability and continuity) and pressure (to address inefficiencies or undesirable practices) and increase (some aspects such as investment) and decrease (some aspects like overcapacity or waste). Comprehensively rectify the 'involution-style' competition for some industries, maintain a reasonable capacity utilization rate, and form a healthy, sustainable industrial development ecology. We must encourage enterprises to improve the quality of supply, promote superior quality and price, stimulate ‘upward competition', offer more high-quality products and services, enhance the adaptability and balance of supply to demand, and strive to create and stimulate new demand through new supply.- ，。，、，，。，、、，--，，、。，，--，，、，. It is necessary to adhere to expanding domestic demand as a long-term strategic measure. Owing to various international and domestic factors, insufficient domestic demand, unstable external demand, and an imbalance between total supply and demand have become the greatest constraints on the smooth circulation of the national economy. China's domestic demand potential is large but has not yet been fully released. Due to geopolitical conflicts and the rise of global protectionism, the recovery of the world economy has been weak, and the instability and uncertainty of external demand have significantly increased. In this broader context, expanding domestic demand is a strategic move for the long-term stability and development of the economy, not a stopgap measure to cope with short-term fluctuations. Especially as a super-large economy, the foundation of stable and healthy economic development must be built on the strong support of domestic demand. It is necessary to adopt strong and effective macroeconomic policies, accelerate filling the shortcomings in domestic demand, especially the consumption gap, and make domestic demand the main driving force and stabilizing anchor for economic growth. It is necessary to establish and improve a long-term mechanism to expand household consumption, particularly expanding consumption demand supported by income, so that residents can consume with stable income, have a good experience and willingness to consume, and dare to consume without concerns. It is necessary to improve the mechanism for expanding investment, innovate and optimize investment and financing mechanisms, expand investment demand with reasonable returns, and coordinate investments in both infrastructure and human resources. We should increase both government investment and lead social investment, ensuring that effective investment not only stimulates current demand but also transforms into advanced productivity and new quality productive forces for the future. 。，、，。，。，，。，，。，。，，。，，、、。，，，，，，、. The section ends by calling to clear obstacles in domestic circulation, stabilise foreign trade and investment and open up diversified international markets, expand exports, increase imports, smooth and enhance international circulation… Share Tracking People's Daily For the third point, the author argues: -We must take major scientific and technological innovation as the fundamental support for developing new productive forces and cultivating new momentum, strengthen basic research and key core technology research, strengthen the construction of national strategic scientific and technological forces, carry out large-scale application demonstration actions of new technologies and new products, and strive to create a batch of new industrial engines with high technological content, strong market competitiveness and great driving force, and forge the ‘new long board' of China's economy.- 、，，，，、、，--. -We must continue to promote the rejuvenation of traditional industries. In developing new quality productive forces, traditional industries cannot be simply abandoned, the economic structure cannot be broken, and it cannot be divorced from reality and become virtual or bubble-like. After years of development, China's traditional industries are leading globally in terms of scale, structural system, technological level, and international competitiveness. They are an important material and technological foundation and decisive factor for China's economic strength, comprehensive national power, and the standard of living of the people. As the foundation of the modern industrial system, traditional industries are the basic support for economic growth and employment income. When developing new quality productive forces, traditional industries must never be treated as ‘low-end industries' or ‘backward industries' and simply withdrawn from. It is necessary to actively use digital technologies and green technologies to transform and upgrade traditional industries, implement large-scale equipment upgrades and replace old consumer goods with new ones. Through digital empowerment, process upgrades, management innovation, and various other paths, we must drive traditional industries to transform towards high-end, intelligent, green, and integrated directions, constantly enhancing their vitality and competitiveness through continuous updates and iterations.- 。，，，、。，、、、，、、。，，，----。、，，、、，、、、，。 This section ends with the author calling for grasping the -dialectical relationship between cultivating new drivers and updating old drivers.- The next bit is essential and echoes some of the anxiety that's so loudly being expressed across the developed world. From international experience, the hollowing-out of traditional industries often limits technological and industrial innovation capabilities, weakening economic competitiveness. There are significant differences in resource endowments and industrial development levels across different regions of our country. Developing new types of productive forces should not blindly follow a single industry or apply a uniform model; it is crucial to avoid ‘herding without prior preparation'/ ‘act in rush or haste' . It is necessary to fully consider the actual situation of a particular region, give play to its distinctive advantages, find the best path, and establish a new quality productive forces cultivation model with local characteristics… 。。，，。，、，--。，，，。--，--，。--，，，，. Leave a comment The fourth point deals with the relationship between improving incremental additions and revitalizing existing stock, and comprehensively enhancing resource allocation efficiency. The author calls this an -urgent- task. The steps proposed are: effectively revitalising basic assets such as land via renewal of industrial parks, better use of inefficient land in urban areas, optimizing the structure of production and living spaces, and increasing public service facilities. transformation of urban villages, and transformation and utilization of old neighbourhoods, old communities, and old buildings. making full use of funds such as local government special bonds and central bank re-lending facilities, purchasing existing commercial housing at reasonable prices and converting them into affordable housing and other uses, and effectively meeting the housing needs of new citizens, young people and other groups. developing a circular economy standardising the development of the second-hand car and second-hand housing markets through leasing, equity participation, and cooperation activate and utilize the idle housing legally owned by farmers idle infrastructure such as small and medium-sized school buildings in rural areas can have their uses converted in a regulated manner ，----，，，。，，、、。、，，、。，，--。、，、。、、，。，。，. Towards the end, the author calls to -compile macro balance sheets for households, businesses, and the government, accurately portraying the asset and liability situation at the national, local, and sectoral levels.- This should provide a baseline understanding of the -family assets.- Based on this, -conduct a comprehensive analysis of economic growth potential, identify economic and financial risk hidden dangers, evaluate debt repayment capacity, and develop policy measures to optimize the scale and structure of macro assets and liabilities, improving the systematic, targeted, and effective nature of macroeconomic governance.- 、、，、，，--，，，，，、、。 Share Tracking People's Daily The fifth and final relationship to balance is the one between improving quality and expanding total quantity. The article argues that it is essential to -unify the effective improvement of quality and the reasonable growth of quantity in the whole process of high-quality development.- The author reiterates that high-quality development is the -primary task- for the country's modernisation. The author argues that: It is necessary to persist in leading and expanding the total economic volume through qualitative improvements. Improvements in quality can open up new realms and new spaces for quantitative growth. Every scientific and technological and industrial revolution brings new investment and consumption opportunities because of the qualitative enhancement of productivity, allowing the economy to break through the earlier equilibrium and produce leapfrog growth in quantity. In the era of a scarcity economy, in order to quickly resolve the contradictions of quantity, the development model was relatively extensive. In other words, ‘when radishes are selling fast, one doesn't take the time to wash the soil off them' . Entering the stage of high-quality development, winning with quality becomes the only way forward. Whether at the micro or macro level, without effective improvement in quality, there can be no reasonable growth in quantity. Even if there is rapid growth in the short term, it is difficult to sustain over time. Therefore, it is necessary to fully and accurately implement the new development concept, adhere to innovative, coordinated, green, open, and shared development, focus on implementing an innovation-driven development strategy, focus on enhancing the overall and coordinated nature of development, focus on promoting the harmonious coexistence of man and nature, focus on forming a new system of opening up, focus on practicing a people-centered development philosophy, coordinate development and security, and promote higher quality, more efficient, fairer, more sustainable, and safer development. Enterprises and industries must also enhance their innovation capabilities, increase investment in new technologies, actively carry out digital and green transformation of traditional industries, and rely more on improving product and service quality to enhance market competitiveness and expand market share. 。、。，，，。，，，--。，，，，，。，，、、、、，，，，，，，、、、、。，，、，、. At the same time, it is necessary to expand the total economic volume to provide fertile ground and space for improving quality. The full accumulation of quantitative changes can trigger qualitative changes. Therefore, the scale of total quantity itself has unique value in improving quality. In many cases, ‘big' itself is a form of ‘strength'; this has been repeatedly verified in the marketplace. The development of emerging industries and new quality productive forces can take advantage of economies of scale and scope. The demand pull of a super-large-scale market combined with rich application scenarios, a complete industrial system, and diversified business organizational models can create more industrial applications, accelerate technology iteration, and cultivate more world-class companies and advanced technologies. The development of high-speed railways, nuclear power, mobile communications, platform economy, artificial intelligence, drones, new energy vehicles, low-altitude economy and other domains provide confirmations of this law. We must further leverage the advantages of China's size, effectively transform the advantages of having a large population and talent pool, vast territory, diverse resources, and high savings rate into economic scale, and form an economic scale that matches the modernization of a huge population, constantly promote qualitative changes on the basis of quantitative changes, continuously enhance economic strength, scientific and technological strength and comprehensive national strength, and consolidate the material and technological foundation of Chinese modernization. 。，，----，。，、、，，，。、、、、、、、，。，、、、，，，、，。 Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

On the agenda was deliberation over the ‘Comprehensive Report on the Politburo Standing Committee Hearing and Studying the Work Reports of the Party Groups of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the State Council, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the Work Report of the Central Secretariat' and the ‘Opinions on Fully Promoting Ecological Protection and High-Quality Development in the Yellow River Basin'. 120，《、、、、》《》. The meeting -fully affirmed the work- of each of these agencies and agreed with their work arrangements for 2025. The meeting held that in the past year, the five party groups adhered to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, firmly safeguarded the authority and centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, strengthened their mission, fulfilled their duties, strengthened the construction of the Party group, and conscientiously fulfilled the main responsibility of comprehensive and strict Party governance, making new contributions to comprehensively promoting the construction of a strong country and the great cause of national rejuvenation through Chinese-style modernization. Under the leadership of the Politburo and the Politburo Standing Committee, the Central Secretariat has fulfilled its duties and taken positive actions, and has carried out extensive work in promoting the implementation of relevant decisions and arrangements of the CPC Central Committee, strengthening the construction of Party regulations, guiding the construction and reform of mass organizations, and rectifying formalism to reduce the burden on the grassroots. ，，5，，，，，，、。、，、，、、、. The meeting emphasized that in the new year, the five Party Groups must take Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as their guide, adhere to the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee as the highest political principle, and ensure unity of thought, consistency of direction, and strict compliance with orders. It is necessary to establish and practice the correct view of political achievements, prioritize action, strive for progress, work diligently and effectively, and work together to promote reform and breakthroughs, steadily advance high-quality development, and demonstrate new responsibilities and new accomplishments on the new journey of comprehensively advancing Chinese-style modernization. The Central Secretariat must focus on its responsibilities, enhance political capabilities, ensure the implementation of key tasks, rigorously strengthen self-construction, and complete the tasks entrusted by the Party Central Committee with high quality. ，，5，，、、。，，、，，，。，，，，。 It adds that the -ecological protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin are long-term agenda items related to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and sustainable development.- Xinhua English summarises the rest: The meeting called -for promoting the full enforcement of the Yellow River Protection Law. Work should be done to systematically enhance the water source conservation capacity in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, strengthen soil and water conservation in the middle reaches, and advance wetland protection and ecological governance in the lower reaches, according to the meeting. The meeting also urged efforts to ensure the safety of important dams, reservoirs and infrastructure, strengthen the synergy of the Yellow River's high-quality development with strategies of the large-scale development of the western region and the rise of the central region, improve the holistic and systematic protection of cultural heritage, and promote the integration of culture and tourism development.- In this context, the Central Leading Group for Coordinated Regional Development is tasked with key work. Share Tracking People's Daily Xi Jinping also met with people from non-CPC political parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC), personages without party affiliation, and other members of the united front ahead of the Spring Festival. Cai Dafeng spoke on behalf of the invitees. -He said that in 2024, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core united and led the entire Party and people of all ethnic groups in the country to hold high the banner and forge ahead, successfully held the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, made major decisions to further comprehensively deepen reform and promote Chinese-style modernization, calmly responded to challenges, and achieved hard-won new accomplishments in reform and development. In the new year, the democratic parties, the Federation of Industry and Commerce and non-party personages must consciously maintain a high degree of alignment with the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, focus on the central tasks of the Party and the state, pool wisdom and strength, offer advice and suggestions, and jointly write a new chapter in building a strong nation and achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. 、。，2024，，、，，、，，。，、，，、，、. Xi Jinping spoke after this. He emphasised that 2024 was a year to overcome difficulties and forge ahead steadfastly. Over the past year, the CPC Central Committee has united and led the people of all ethnic groups across the country, responding calmly and implementing comprehensive measures, successfully completing the main objectives and tasks of economic and social development, with Chinese-style modernisation taking new solid steps. We guided all sectors to correctly grasp favourable conditions and unfavourable factors, maintained strategic determination, and strengthened confidence in victory. We effectively implemented various existing policies, intensified efforts to launch a package of incremental policies, and solidly promoted high-quality development. The Chinese economy has rebounded and improved, with the gross domestic product growing by 5%. We have strengthened independent innovation, achieved a series of new breakthroughs at the frontiers of science and technology, and powerfully driven the development of new quality productive forces. We further comprehensively deepened reform, emphasised coordinated progress in various undertakings, provided solid and strong livelihood protection, and ensured that the people enjoy a greater sense of gain. We coordinated development and security, maintaining overall social stability. We deeply advanced major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, injecting more positive energy into maintaining world peace and stability and promoting human development and progress. We solidly carried out Party discipline learning and education, unswervingly improved conduct, enforced discipline and fought corruption, with continuous improvement in Party and government conduct. These achievements are the result of the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, and also the result of united struggle and tenacious efforts by people of all ethnic groups across the country, including various democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and non-party personages. ，。，2024、。，，、，，。，，。，，，，5%。，，。，，，。，。，、。，，。，，、、. He then talked about the goals for 2025. -Xi Jinping emphasised that 2025 is the final year of the ‘14th Five-Year Plan.- We must adhere to the general tone of seeking progress while maintaining stability, implement more proactive and impactful macro policies, focus wholeheartedly on promoting high-quality development, promote high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-strengthening, maintain sound momentum in economic and social development, successfully complete the objectives and tasks of the ‘14th Five-Year Plan', and lay a solid foundation for a good start to the ‘15th Five-Year Plan'. Xi called on non-CPC political parties, the ACFIC, and personages without party affiliation to focus on the central tasks, serve the overall interests of the country, and leverage their respective strengths to more broadly rally support, build consensus, and pool wisdom and strength. ，2025--。，，，，，--，--。、、，，、、、. (Note: I wonder why Xi Jinping did not talk about implementing a moderately loose monetary policy; instead, he chose -more proactive and impactful- as the descriptor for policy direction. Moderately loose was the approach that emerged from the Politburo meeting ahead of the CEWC and then from the CEWC.) He then expressed three hopes for the attendees: First, elevate political position, and further draw the concentric circles. We must firmly grasp the fundamental characteristic of the Chinese Communist Party's leadership in China's new type of political party system, deeply study the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era, do more work to strengthen confidence, unite people's hearts, warm people's hearts, and build unity of hearts, and effectively transform positive factors from all sectors into development results.，。，，、、、，。 Second, closely focus on central work, and actively contribute suggestions and efforts. We must closely center around further comprehensive deepening of reform, promoting high-quality development, formulating suggestions for the 15th Five-Year Plan and other matters to conduct in-depth research and political consultation, and continue to focus on key and difficult issues in the Yangtze River ecological environmental protection to carry out democratic supervision. The ACFIC should guide private economy personnel to maintain entrepreneurial enthusiasm and boost development confidence, guide private enterprises to establish and improve modern enterprise systems with Chinese characteristics, and strive to achieve high-quality development. ，。、、--，。、，、。 Third, strengthen self-construction and improve the ability to perform duties. Under this, he called to consolidate and deepen the results of discipline learning and education, continue to implement the spirit of the eight-point central regulations in order to promote the transformation of work style, and consolidate and develop a good political ecology. ，，. Subscribe now Li Qiang, meanwhile, presided over a symposium with experts, entrepreneurs and representatives from the fields of education, science, culture, health and sports. He listened to their views on the draft government work report. After listening to the attendees, Li Qiang said that: -In the past year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the entire country has worked hard and overcome difficulties. The overall economic operation has been stable and steady, and the main development goals and tasks for the whole year have been successfully completed. High-quality development has been steadily promoted, and the foundation of ‘stability' has become more solid, and the momentum of ‘progress' has been continuously strengthened. At the same time, it should be noted that China's development still faces many difficulties and challenges, especially the rising uncertain and unstable factors in the external environment. We must accurately grasp the situation and be good at turning crises into opportunities. China possesses comprehensive advantages in systems, markets, industries, and talents. The basic trend of long-term economic improvement has not changed and will not change. As long as we unswervingly manage our own affairs well, we will surely promote the stable and healthy development of the Chinese economy. ，，，，、，、，，，--，--。，，，，。、、、，，，。 The next paragraph says: Li Qiang stressed that it is necessary to fully implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee and promote new achievements in high-quality development. It is necessary to implement a more proactive fiscal policy and a moderately loose monetary policy. Fiscal policy should proactively exert force in advance and form actual expenditure as soon as possible, monetary policy should maintain abundant liquidity and promote funds to fully flow to the real economy, focus on policy coordination and cooperation, provide strong policy support for responding to challenges and promoting development. At the same time, it is necessary to closely follow the changes in domestic and international situations, adjust policy measures in a timely manner, and enrich and improve the policy toolbox. It is necessary to further deepen reform and expand opening up, clear bottlenecks and blockages around expanding and strengthening the domestic circulation, create a first-class business environment, stimulate the vitality of various business entities, and expand independent opening up and unilateral opening up in an orderly manner. It is necessary to promote the transformation of new and old drivers through scientific and technological innovation, concentrate on making breakthroughs in key core technologies and cutting-edge technologies, accelerate the industrialization of scientific and technological achievements, and strive to cultivate more new economic growth points. It is necessary to make greater efforts to protect and improve people's livelihood, promote residents to increase income and reduce burdens, and improve the quality of life. ，，。，、，、，，、。，，，。，，，，、。，，，。，、.

Page 2: There's a report with data from the National Energy Administration, which says that China's domestic oil and gas production exceeded 400 million tons for the first time in 2024. This is the eighth consecutive year of rapid growth at the scale of tens of millions of tons. Among this, crude oil production reached 213 million tons, an increase of 24 million tons compared to 2018; natural gas production reached 246.4 billion cubic meters, with an average annual increase of over 13 billion cubic meters in the past six years. Page 3: Just one report to note; on January 18, a seminar titled -China's New Development: Prospects and Challenges- was held in Baghdad, Iraq. The seminar was hosted by the Iraqi Communist Party, with over 200 representatives from the Iraqi government, parliament, think tanks, media and other sectors attending. The purpose of the seminar was to -exchange and learn from China's development experience-. Share Tracking People's Daily Let's look at Xinhua's coverage of Han Zheng's engagements in Washington. Xinhua reports: During his stay in the United States, Han, a special representative of Chinese President Xi Jinping, met with then U.S. Vice President-elect J.D. Vance, representatives of the U.S. business community, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Elon Musk, Chair Emeritus of the U.S. Brookings Institution John Thornton and others. -During his meeting with Vance on Sunday, Han first conveyed Xi's greetings to Trump and congratulated Vance on his election. He noted that Xi recently had an important phone call with Trump, during which the two leaders have reached many important consensuses on the development of China-U.S. relations in the next stage. China is ready to work with the United States to adhere to the strategic guidance of the head-of-state diplomacy and follow through on the important consensus reached between Xi and Trump, so as to push for the steady, healthy and sustainable development of bilateral ties, Han said. Han said that the two sides are currently working hard to achieve their respective development goals and dreams. As long as the two sides uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, they will contribute to each other's progress, bring benefits to the two countries, and make important contributions to world peace and development, said Han. Economic and trade relations are important issues of common concern to both sides, he noted. Despite differences and frictions between China and the United States, they share huge common interests and space for cooperation, and the two sides can strengthen dialogue and consultation in this regard, Han added.- The report adds: -While meeting with representatives of the U.S. business community, Han said a good start and stable development of China-U.S. relations align with the common well-being of both peoples and meet the shared expectation of the international community. As an enduring backbone supporting China-U.S. relations, the U.S. business community has been a participant, witness, contributor and beneficiary of China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation as well as China's reform and opening-up, Han said. China will unswervingly advance reform and opening-up, and continue to improve and optimize the business environment, he added. Han said it is hoped that U.S. companies will continue to invest and take root in China, play an active role as a bridge, and make greater contribution to the development of China-U.S. relations. Representatives of the U.S. business community said that as the world's two largest economies that are most dynamic and technologically advanced, the United States and China should engage in mutually beneficial cooperation and find a constructive and steady way to get along with each other. The U.S. business community is optimistic about the prospect of the Chinese economy and the opportunities to grow in China, and supports the two sides in strengthening dialogue and communication to move forward their bilateral relations as well as economic and trade cooperation.- Next, Nigeria has become a BRICS partner country. China's Foreign Ministry said: Nigeria is a major developing country and a significant country of the Global South, noted Mao, while adding that the country's participation in BRICS cooperation will not only serve Nigeria's development, but also the common interests of the bloc's members and partners and those of the Global South, which will make contributions to the development of the BRICS mechanism. The inclusion of a new partner country in the BRICS family marks an expansion of the representativeness of BRICS -- widening its appeal and influence, Mao added. Finally, let's look at Xinhua's report stating that the Myanmar government and Kokang's Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) have reached and signed a formal ceasefire agreement, which came into effect on Jan. 18. Foreign Ministry's Mao Ning said: -Under China's mediation, the Myanmar government and MNDAA held their seventh round of peace talks in Kunming, China's Yunnan Province, in mid-January, and that both parties expressed gratitude for China's efforts to facilitate the successful outcome of the talks. She said the easing of the tensions in northern Myanmar is in the common interests of various parties in Myanmar and regional nations, and will contribute to the security, stability and development of the China-Myanmar border area. ‘China and Myanmar are friendly neighbors, and China firmly opposes any conflict or unrest in Myanmar,' Mao said, adding that it is hoped that all parties would maintain the momentum of the ceasefire and peace talks, earnestly implement the consensus reached, de-escalate tensions proactively, and resolve related issues through further dialogues and consultations. China will firmly support Myanmar's efforts to safeguard its independence, sovereignty, national unity, and territorial integrity, firmly support Myanmar's efforts to secure domestic peace, stability, and economic development, and firmly support Myanmar's efforts to achieve political reconciliation and advance its domestic political agenda within the constitutional framework, the spokesperson said. ‘China will continue to actively promote peace talks and provide support and assistance for the peace process in northern Myanmar'.

Xi-Trump Call & TikTok - 2024 Economic Data - New Guideline on Building Education Power - South China Sea Drills	There were a couple of interesting reports over the weekend that I'll look at before going into today's paper. First, Xi Jinping had a phone call with US president-elect Donald Trump on Friday. Xinhua says that the call was at Trump's request. -Xi congratulated Trump on his re-election as U.S. president. He pointed out that both he and Trump attach great importance to interaction with each other, hope that China-U.S. ties will have a good start in the new U.S. presidential term, and stand ready to push China-U.S. relations to make greater progress from a new starting point. Xi stressed that both China and the United States, two great countries, are pursuing their own dreams and are committed to making the lives of their people better. China and the United States share extensive common interests and broad space for cooperation, and the two countries can become partners and friends, contribute to each other's success, and enjoy common prosperity, which will benefit both countries and the whole world, Xi said. Xi said that it is inevitable that China and the United States, two major countries with different national conditions, have some differences, and the key is to respect each other's core interests and major concerns, and find appropriate ways to solve issues. He said that the Taiwan question concerns China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and it is hoped that the U.S. side handles it with caution. The nature of China-U.S. economic and trade relations is mutually beneficial and win-win, and confrontation and conflict should not be the choice of the two countries, Xi said. He also called on both sides to step up cooperation and do more great, practical and good things that are conducive to the two countries and the world at large based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, so as to keep the two giant ships of China and the United States moving forward on the course of stable, healthy and sustainable development.- The report adds: -Trump thanked Xi for his congratulations, saying that he cherishes his great relationship with Xi, hopes to continue to maintain dialogue and communication, and looks forward to meeting Xi at an early date. The United States and China are the most important countries in the world today, and they should maintain long-lasting friendship and work together to safeguard global peace, Trump said. Xi and Trump exchanged views on major international and regional issues of common concern, such as the Ukraine crisis and the Israel-Palestine conflict. They agreed to establish strategic communication channels and maintain regular contact on major issues of common concern.- Here's CNN's report on how Trump described the call: -I just spoke to Chairman Xi Jinping of China,- Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social. -It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.- Trump said the pair discussed trade, fentanyl, TikTok and other subjects, and that the call was -very good- for both countries. -President Xi and I will do everything possible to make the World more peaceful and safe!- he wrote.- Of course, things have moved at a dizzying pace since the call with regard to TikTok. The app went off and then seemingly back on in the US. At a rally on Sunday ahead of his inauguration, this is what Trump said: -Frankly, we have no choice. We have to save it.- Reuters reports that he added that the US will seek a joint venture to restore the short-video sharing app used by 170 million Americans. Thinking Aloud: The question, of course, is what's the bargain? Trump doesn't need the young voter any more; this is his last term in office. The Indian experience on TikTok also shows that the market often rather quickly creates new options and the consumer too rapidly moves to other alternatives. Moreover, getting the app back creates a legal crisis, given the Supreme Court's 9-0 verdict upholding the law banning the app. So, one wonders if there's a quid pro quo in the works to allow say X or Facebook, perhaps in an alternate/deeply sanitised/heavily censored version into China's information ecosystem. That would be a really interesting proposition, given how the Communist Party under Xi has viewed this domain as a battlefield. Xi has over the years insisted on ensuring strict ideological alignment and expressed deep concerns with regard to the -infiltration- of Western ideas. He has viewed the information domain as being of existential significance to the Party. So giving on this would be rather big. But then, the devil will always lie in the details, and a quid pro quo might not always be like-for-like. Anyway, Xinhua also quotes a WSJ report saying that Trump wants to visit China during his first 100 days in office. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, over the weekend, we got China's 2024 economic data.

Steering the Wild Horses of American Power	As Donald Trump is sworn in for a second term as president, American politics and foreign policy are undergoing profound upheaval. A reassessment of the nation's global interests and international engagement is underway. This growing dissatisfaction with the world order was starkly articulated by Trump's Secretary of State nominee, Marco Rubio, during his Senate confirmation hearing. Rubio remarked, -The postwar global order is not just obsolete; it is now a weapon being used against us.- In this episode of The Great Power Show, Manoj Kewalramani speaks to Edward Luttwak, renowned military strategist, historian, and geopolitical analyst, about this turn in American foreign and security policies. In his inimitable style, Luttwak argues the American political system to in which one is driving a cart with the horses at the back and all one is doing is trying to avoid being overrun by your own horses. He contends that American foreign policy today is in a correction phase after the excesses that began with the 2003 war in Iraq.

Share Tracking People's Daily Back to the front page, there's an article discussing macroeconomic policies. It says that: -In 2025, additional ultra-long-term special treasury bonds will be issued, with funds optimised for allocation to ‘two major' projects. More funds will be arranged, and more consumer goods will be included in the support list under the ‘two new' policies. At the same time, the fiscal deficit ratio will be increased, local government special bonds will be issued in greater quantities, and the scope of their application and use as project capital will be expanded.- 2025，，--，、--。，，. The article says that -a moderately loose monetary policy will be implemented- in 2025. For the private sector, this is what's on offer: -Promote the introduction of the Private Economy Promotion Law; advance the fair opening of competitive infrastructure sectors to business entities; make good use of policies such as newly-issued local government special bonds to accelerate the repayment of arrears to enterprises; and focus on rectifying arbitrary charges, fines, inspections, and seizures…this year, efforts will further target key issues and implement precise measures to create a safe and stable development environment for all types of business entities, helping more enterprises weather the winter, welcome the spring, and grow robustly.- ；；，；、、、……，、，，、. On real estate, the piece says: -This year, on the demand side, we will vigorously implement urban renewal policies, intensify the renovation of urban villages and dilapidated houses, implement the policies and measures that have been issued, and effectively reduce the cost of buying houses; on the supply side, we will use local government bonds to support the revitalisation of idle stock land and the acquisition of stock commercial housing, promote the construction of a new model of real estate development, and resolutely win the battle to ensure the delivery of houses.- ，，，，，；，、，，. Subscribe now Page 3: On the eve of Donald Trump taking over as US President, with the threat of tariffs and deeper global fissures, there's a long article in the bylined Huán Yǔ Píng, making a pitch for economic globalisation. My Brief View: I found this to be a very interesting read. It makes a strong data-driven — and ideological — argument about the resilience of global trade. Beijing, of course, must also walk the talk on issues related to trade, subsidies and surpluses. That said, going back to a world in which fences for capital and labour are higher is self-defeating for everyone. Likewise, while one understands that there is securitisation around certain select emerging technologies, new clubs that result in broad-based denial regimes will indeed set a bulk of the world back by a couple of generations. Politicians and bureaucracies need to guard against mission creep in this era of securitisation. This is not simply about China; this is about the broader developing world. Obviously, the consequences of development failures in the developing world will also be felt by the developed world. Anyway, the first section of the article says: Economic globalisation has not stagnated, let alone reversed; it continues to develop against headwinds. Trade is an important indicator of the state of economic globalisation. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development's Global Trade Update, global trade volume is projected to reach a historic high of $33 trillion in 2024, a year-on-year increase of 3.3%. Global trade has demonstrated strong resilience, particularly with the increasing dynamism of digital trade and service trade. Despite the spread of unilateralism and protectionism, and the enthusiasm of certain countries for pursuing ‘decoupling and breaking chains' or building ‘small yards with high fences,' the global picture shows that enterprises in various countries continue to coexist and thrive within global supply chains, industrial chains, and value chains. According to the World Openness Report 2024, global value chains have maintained an overall expansion trend in recent years, with digitalization, the green economy, and the service sector driving the process of global openness. Humanity still lives in a world shaped by economic globalisation. Global logistics giant DHL and New York University calculated a composite index reflecting the globalisation process based on data on trade, capital, information, and personnel flows. Examining changes since 2001, the index has remained at its highest level of around 25% in recent years. John Pearson, CEO of DHL Express, stated: ‘This latest finding clearly refutes the notion that globalisation is reversing. Globalisation has profoundly reshaped our world and still holds enormous potential for further development'. ，，。。《》，202433，3.3%。，、。、，----，，、、。《2024》，，、、。。、、，。2001，25%。·：-。，。- From the perspective of policy orientation, the so-called ‘shock theory' and ‘stagnation theory' of economic globalisation are also untenable. The high-quality implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement is bringing huge development dividends to regional countries. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership has not declined due to the withdrawal of some countries, but rather has attracted more countries to join. African countries have accelerated the pace of free trade zone construction. The African Continental Free Trade Agreement was implemented between South Africa, Ghana, Kenya and other countries last year. In 2024, the negotiations on the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area 3.0 will be substantially completed; China and Peru will sign a protocol to upgrade the free trade agreement; and the China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement will be upgraded again. The 31st APEC Leaders' Informal Meeting reached important consensus on supporting the multilateral trading system and promoting regional economic integration in the Asia-Pacific region. Looking at the world, the political consensus and policy measures to promote open development are increasing. ，----。《》，《》，。，《》、。2024，—3.0，，—。、。，. The role of the ‘Global South' in promoting the construction of an open world economic system is also expanding. According to the World Openness Report 2024, from 2008 to 2023, the openness index of developed economies fell by 7.7%, while that of emerging markets and developing economies rose by 5.0%. In 2023, the openness index of BRICS countries increased by 0.5% year-on-year, and increased by 8.0% compared with 2008. The latest World Investment Report released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development shows that in 2023, developing economies accounted for 65% of global foreign direct investment flows. The Global South is increasingly becoming an important force in promoting economic globalization. --。《2024》，20082023，7.7%，5.0%。2023，0.5%，20088.0%。《》，2023，65%。. The second section discusses the headwinds to economic globalisation. Historically, the two World Wars plunged the global economy into chaos, cut off cross-border trade routes, and led to the collapse of international cooperation mechanisms. The nearly half-century-long Cold War confrontation divided the world into two distinct blocs, obstructing economic exchanges and impeding resource flows. However, from the perspective of the long arc of history, none of these disruptions prevented the world from returning to the path of economic globalisation. Fundamentally speaking, economic globalisation is an objective requirement of the development of social productive forces, and is an inevitable result of scientific and technological progress; it is not subject to any person's will. ，。，，，。，，，。，，。，，，. The current headwinds facing economic globalisation are the product of domestic political shifts in a few countries, and do not mean that the fundamental logic of economic globalization promoting global welfare has changed. Data from the World Trade Organization show that from 1996 to 2021, the higher the proportion of trade in GDP, the faster the economic growth of low- and middle-income economies. This fully demonstrates that openness is the only way for a country to prosper and develop. ，。，19962021，，。，. Although there exists a tug-of-war between the forces driving economic globalization and those resisting it, the driving forces still outweigh the resistance. The current acceleration of global economic digitalization, green development, and intelligent transformation is building strong momentum for the re-acceleration of economic globalization. The rapid development of global e-commerce and the rise of overseas warehouses are just glimpses of the digital trade wave. According to WTO statistics, global digitally delivered services exports reached $4.25 trillion in 2023, a 9% year-on-year increase, accounting for 54.2% of global service exports, setting a new historical high. Green and sustainable development has become a global consensus, with the ‘green content' of the world economy continuously increasing and new opportunities for open cooperation emerging. Data shows that in 2023, global newly-installed renewable energy capacity increased by 50% year-on-year, and green bond sales grew by over 10%. China's advancements in the new energy vehicle industry and autonomous driving technology are fostering a new wave of deep collaboration in the global automotive industry. As Mark Leonard, Director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, points out, due to accelerating changes in energy and technology, the world is experiencing ‘re-globalization' rather than ‘de-globalisation'. ，。、、，。，，。，20234.25，9%，54.2%，。，--，。，2023，50%，10%。，。·，，----. The third section says that: Economic globalisation is at a new crossroads, and only by guiding it well, taking advantage of the benefits, and avoiding harm can it develop healthily and progress steadily over the long term. ‘In terms of achieving inclusiveness, protectionism is neither efficient nor cost-effective. Only more and better trade can enable more people and regions to integrate into the mainstream of the global economy', said the WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. The 2024 World Trade Report warns that intensified protectionism may set back the process of narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor by 30 years. Both the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund have recently warned that raising tariffs may affect global economic growth. Countries, especially major economies, must adhere to the general direction of open development, resist protectionism, and promote the construction of an open world economic system. ，、，、。-，，，。-。《2024》，30。，。，，. The key to solving the problems brought about by economic globalisation is to promote inclusive economic globalisation. Only by solving the imbalanced development between countries and within countries caused by the global allocation of resources, allowing different countries, different classes and different groups to participate in and enjoy the fruits of economic and social development, so that development is both full and balanced, is the way to drive economic globalisation into a more dynamic, inclusive, and sustainable new phase. This requires governments to show wisdom and take action. As World Economic Forum Chairman Klaus Schwab once pointed out: ‘The challenge and responsibility of today's leaders is to counter trade protectionism while making trade the driving force for inclusive growth.' The process of promoting inclusive development of economic globalization may not be smooth and may not yield immediate results, but all parties must maintain confidence with the belief that ‘progress will come with action and success will follow with perseverance'. ，。，、、，，、、。。：-，，。-，，-、-. China is pursuing a path of seeking common development through opening up. Its participation in economic globalisation has promoted China's development and brought vast opportunities to other countries. China's development proves that promoting an inclusive and equitable economic globalisation can promote common development for all countries. This is why China firmly pursues a mutually beneficial and win-win opening-up strategy, orderly expands independent and unilateral opening-up, steadily expands institutional opening-up, and promotes the construction of an open world economic system. Economic globalization is an inevitable path for human society and an irreversible trend of the times. Countries must have the wisdom to recognize the overall situation, the determination and confidence to follow the trend, and work together to promote inclusive and equitable economic globalization. ，，。，。、、、。、。，，.

Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, January 16, 2025. Page 1: The lead story on the page is about Xi Jinping's meeting (English report) with Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. Xi talked about the -traditional friendship- between the two countries. He added that -with joint efforts, China and Sri Lanka have continuously promoted strategic cooperative partnership featuring mutual assistance and ever-lasting friendship. High-quality Belt and Road cooperation and cooperation in various fields have achieved fruitful results, bringing tangible benefits to the two peoples-. Xi told Dissanayake that China-Sri Lanka ties today face -a historical opportunity-. -The two countries should have a keen grasp of bilateral relations from a strategic perspective and jointly build a China-Sri Lanka community with a shared future- He added: -China takes Sri Lanka as a priority in its neighbourhood diplomacy. China will continue to support Sri Lanka in safeguarding its national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, support Sri Lanka in independently exploring a development path that suits its national conditions, and is willing to deepen political mutual trust with Sri Lanka, exchange experiences in state governance, and enhance dialogue and communication between various departments of the two countries. China's further comprehensive deepening of reform and promotion of Chinese-style modernization will bring new opportunities for Sri Lanka's development. China will actively support Sri Lanka in focusing on economic construction, promoting high-quality joint construction of the ‘Belt and Road', modern agriculture, digital economy, marine economy and other fields of cooperation, and create new highlights. It is necessary to strengthen cultural exchanges between the two sides and enhance linkages between the two peoples. China is willing to strengthen coordination and cooperation with Sri Lanka in multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, jointly address major issues concerning human development such as climate change, adhere to the solidarity and development of the Global South, and contribute to regional peace, stability, development and prosperity.- ，，、，，，，。、，。，--、、、，。，--。，，，.

During this visit, deals were signed in such areas as Belt and Road cooperation, agricultural products, social welfare, and news and broadcasting. Share Tracking People's Daily Another report on the page discusses Xi's call with CPV General Secretary To Lam. Xinhua reports: Xi -called on China and Vietnam to step up connectivity, jointly build frontier platform for new quality productive forces cooperation, and build stable and smooth cross-border industrial and supply chains.- -Xi said he is glad to hold phone talks with To Lam at the turn of the year and on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties, recalling that during To Lam's state visit to China last August, the two leaders had in-depth exchanges and reached broad consensus on deepening relations between the two parties and the two countries, as well as jointly promoting the development of socialist cause. Over the past six months, the two sides have been active in implementation of the consensus, and the cooperation issues the two leaders agreed on have achieved positive progress, Xi said. The year 2025 marks the conclusion of China's 14th Five-Year Plan period, and a key year for the preparation of 14th National Congress of the CPV, Xi said, noting it is a year of great significance for both countries that serves as both a point of continuity and a new starting point. The two sides should continue to rejuvenate and strengthen the two parties, deepen exchanges of socialist theory and practical experience, and promote the development of the socialist cause amid great changes unseen in a century, said Xi. It is necessary to fully leverage the political guidance of high-level exchanges and continue to maintain close exchanges, Xi said, adding the two countries should push for more results in mutually beneficial cooperation. The two sides should carry out warm and down to earth people-to-people and cultural exchanges that connect people's hearts, and strengthen exchanges and cooperation in areas such as media, culture and tourism, as well as between the youths of the two nations and at the sub-national level, creating more projects that win the hearts of the people, Xi said. The two countries should also strengthen international and regional coordination, safeguard international fairness and justice, and jointly build a community with a shared future for mankind, he added.- Among other things, To Lam reportedly said -that with the goal of preparing for the 14th National Congress of the CPV, Vietnam is set to embark on a new era of development, which envisions a prosperous, powerful, democratic, equitable, and civilized nation. In this process, Vietnam will learn from China's development experience as much as possible, especially the new theoretical and practical innovation of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, he added.- Subscribe now Next, there's a report on Xi's latest article in Qiushi. I'll look at the original article. The article is an extract from Xi's speech at the special seminar for leading provincial and ministerial-level cadres on studying and implementing the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee on October 29, 2024. In the first part of the article, Xi talks about the achievements of reform since the 18th Party Congress. He says that -comprehensively deepening reform in the new era has achieved major practical, institutional and theoretical results, which have attracted worldwide attention and have far-reaching influence.- 、、，，. In terms of practical results, Xi says that: -The new development concept was formed through reforms, the ideological concepts and institutional mechanisms that influence and constrain high-quality development were eliminated through reforms, and the effective qualitative improvement and reasonable quantitative growth of economic development were gradually achieved through reforms. It is through the comprehensive deepening of reform that China's economic strength, scientific and technological strength, and comprehensive national strength have leaped to a new level…- ，，。，、、... In terms of institutional results, Xi says that: -China's fundamental systems, basic systems, and important systems have become more complete. In particular, the Party's leadership system has been established as the country's fundamental leadership system. A systematic, well-structured, scientifically regulated, and effectively functioning institutional framework is gradually maturing and taking shape. We have strengthened the implementation of systems, focusing on transforming institutional advantages into the efficiency of national governance. These efforts are not only aimed at addressing immediate needs but also at ensuring the long-term stability and security of the nation.- 、、，、、，，、、。，。，. Finally, in terms of theoretical results, Xi says that the current phase of reform, i.e., comprehensive deepening of reform in the new era, has been conceived and advanced against the backdrop of China's reform entering a critical stage and deep waters, characterized by its broad scope, deep impact on interests, high difficulty in implementation, and strong interconnectivity and synergy. We have continuously promoted theoretical innovation in reform, scientifically grasped the timing and situation, risks and opportunities that reform faces, summarised fresh experiences in a timely manner, continuously deepened our understanding of reform patterns, and formed a series of new ideas, new perspectives, and new assertions about comprehensively deepening reform. For example, it is emphasized that reform must adhere to the leadership of the Party; it is emphasized that reform must adhere to the people-centered approach; it is emphasized that reform must adhere to the principle of maintaining integrity while making innovations, neither returning to a closed and rigid old path nor deviating to the evil path of changing flags and banners; it is emphasized that reform must adhere to the overall goal of improving and developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities; it is emphasized that reform must adhere to problem orientation; it is emphasized that it must adhere to the reform of the economic system as the driving force; it is emphasized that reform must be promoted on the track of the rule of law; it is emphasized that top-level design must be combined with crossing the river by feeling the stones; it is emphasized that the relationship between reform, development and stability must be properly handled, among other things. The ‘Six Adherences' outlined in the Decision of the Third Plenum are distilled from these new ideas, perspectives, and assertions. These theoretical achievements provide important guidelines for further advancing comprehensive deepening of reform. 。，、、、。，、，，，、、。，；；，，；、；；；；；，。《》--，、、。，. The second section of the article discusses the importance of maintaining integrity while pursuing innovation. This is important: Reform is not about changing flags and banners. I have said many times that our reform has direction and principles. Upholding the Party's comprehensive leadership, upholding Marxism, upholding socialism with Chinese characteristics, upholding the people's democratic dictatorship, taking the promotion of social fairness and justice and enhancement of people's wellbeing as the starting point and ultimate goal—these are all fundamental, directional, and long-term matters that reflect the Party's nature and purpose, conform to China's national conditions, and align with the fundamental interests of the people. These principles must remain unwavering, regardless of circumstances. Therefore, we must uphold the overall reform goal of continuing to improve and develop the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and advance the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity, always moving forward in the direction guided by the overall goal, resolutely reforming what should be reformed and not reforming what should not be reformed. 。，、。、、、，、，、、，，，，。，、，，，。 The central task of the Party and the country in the new era and on the new journey is to comprehensively promote the construction of a strong country and the great cause of national rejuvenation with Chinese-style modernization. Further comprehensive deepening reform must be carried out closely around this central task. We must move forward with unwavering boldness and courage, align with the new trends of the times, meet the new requirements of practice, and respond to the new expectations of the people. We must vigorously promote theoretical innovation, practical innovation, institutional innovation, cultural innovation, and innovation in all other areas, providing strong momentum and institutional guarantees for Chinese-style modernization. 、，。，、、，、、、，. Share Tracking People's Daily We must focus on economic system reform as the key point. Adhering to the reform direction of the socialist market economy, efforts should be made to fully leverage the decisive role of the market in resource allocation while better exerting the role of the government, accelerate the establishment of a unified national market and improve the macroeconomic governance system; adhere to and implement the ‘two unwaverings', and provide a fair and just legal environment for the development of various types of ownership economies; resolutely eliminate the institutional and mechanism obstacles that hinder and restrict high-quality development, improve production relations that are more compatible with new quality productive forces, and shape new development momentum and advantages; resolutely break through bottlenecks and blockages affecting and restricting comprehensive innovation, coordinate and promote the integrated reform of education, science, technology and talent systems and mechanisms, firmly grasp the strategic initiative in the new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation. 。，、，，；--，；，，；，，. The section ends with an emphasis on the requirement of coordinated reforms in other domains too, such as -democracy, rule of law, culture, society, ecological civilisation, national security, national defense and military construction, as well as the reform of the party building system.- Subscribe now In the third section, Xi argues that reform is a -systematic project- that requires scientific methods and proper handling of various relationships. First, uphold the unity of reform and the rule of law. Reform and rule of law are like two wings of a bird or two wheels of a car; they are interdependent and indispensable. It is necessary to use the power of reform to improve the rule of law, further deepen reforms in the field of the rule of law, and continuously refine the system of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics. The scope of the role of the rule of law should be expanded to better leverage its positive role in eliminating resistance to reform and consolidating reform achievements. We must be good at using the rule of law thinking and the rule of law approach to promote reform, safeguard the authority of the rule of law, and ensure that major reforms are based on the law. We must uphold the principle of equal treatment before the law, and equally protect the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, legal persons and other organizations. We must not engage in selective law enforcement, let alone extrajudicial leniency. 。、，、。，，。，、。，，。，、，，. Second, adhere to the dialectical unity of breaking and establishing. Reform is a process of breaking down the old and establishing the new - breaking down is the means, establishing is the purpose. Further comprehensively deepening reform must uphold system building as the main thread, and should emphasize the simultaneous process of breaking down and establishing, by establishing first before breaking. All reform measures must be fully demonstrated and carefully designed, deeply conduct risk assessments, and grasp the timing, degree, and effectiveness well. What should be established should be actively and proactively established, and must be established stably and firmly. It should be feasible and truly effective. What should be broken should be broken in a timely manner, resolutely, and thoroughly on the foundation of establishment, achieving steady and swift reform progress in the unity of breaking down and establishing. We must not break before establishing, resulting in institutional vacuums that leave people at a loss, causing disorder and chaos. 。，，。，，、。、，，。，、，、；、、，。，，，. Third, uphold the unity of reform and opening up. Further deepening reform and high-level opening up complement and promote each other. The deeper the reform, the higher the level of opening up required; the higher the level of opening up, the greater the role of promoting reform. We must steadily expand institutional opening up, actively connect with international high-standard economic and trade rules, deepen the reform of foreign trade, foreign investment and outbound investment management systems, and create a world-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based, and internationalized. We must implement the free trade pilot zone promotion strategy, encourage innovative and integrated exploration, and create a new highland of reform and opening up with a higher level of opening up and a stronger radiation effect. 。、。，；，。，，、，、、。，、，、. Fourth, we must properly handle the relationship between planning and implementation. ‘One part deployment, nine parts implementation'. The deployments made in the Plenum's ‘Decision' are mainly considered from broad perspectives, many measures are strategic, forward-looking, and directional, and implementation requires formulating practical and feasible specific measures. In designing reform plans, we must grasp objective laws, fully promote democracy, conform to social expectations, pay attention to the coordination and matching of various reform measures, enhance the consistency of reform orientation, and prevent and overcome departmentalism. We must establish and improve a work mechanism with clear responsibilities, complete chains, and interlocking links, strengthen tracking and performance evaluation, promote the implementation of reform measures in detail, prevent the phenomenon of focusing on document formulation and neglecting supervision and implementation, and prevent ‘the water on the beach never reaches the end'. . 。-，-。《》，、、，。，，，，，，。、、，，，、，--。 This section ends with Xi issuing a stern warning: Leaders, especially senior cadres, bear important responsibilities for promoting reform. We must enhance our sense of political responsibility and historical mission, and with the political courage to overcome difficulties and rise to the challenge, face up to contradictions and problems without evasion, eradicate stubborn diseases without ambiguity, and respond to risks and challenges without retreating, and strive to open up a new world of reform and development. We must be good at using scientific methods to promote reform, make systematic arrangements, and act after careful planning to avoid blind actions and confusion. 。、，、，，，，。，、，、. In the final section, Xi calls to: correctly understand and interpret the spirit of the ‘Decision' of the Plenary Session. reasonably guide reform expectations, i.e., -reform is a process of adjusting the interests structure, and it is impossible to simultaneously satisfy the interests of everyone. We must guide both officials and the public to strengthen their awareness of the overall situation and correctly handle the adjustment of interest relationships and individual gains and losses during the reform. Reform is also a gradual process; it cannot be accomplished overnight, nor can all problems be solved at once. We must avoid being hasty, setting unrealistically high goals, or raising expectations excessively. Instead, we must be practical, base everything on reality, move forward steadily, and accumulate small successes to achieve greater victories. We must also recognize that reform is the people's own cause, requiring the participation of all people, united in tackling difficulties and overcoming challenges. During the reform process, we must adhere to a people-centered approach, using actual results and the satisfaction of the people to assess the effectiveness of reforms. This will ensure that the people's sense of gain, happiness, and security continuously increases through the reform.- 。，，。、，。，、，、，、，，，，。，，，。，，，、、. promote positive propaganda around reform, and -continue to pay attention to and respond to social concerns, and promptly resolve doubts and confusion.- Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on the front page about Li Qiang meeting with the visiting Japanese political delegation led by Secretary-General Hiroshi Moriyama of the Liberal Democratic Party and Secretary-General Makoto Nishida of the Komeito Party.

It is hoped that China and Japan will continue working together to enhance mutual trust, deepen cooperation, manage differences, and promote the sound and steady development of bilateral relations that will bring more benefits to the two peoples, Li said. He noted that ruling parties of the two countries should focus on safeguarding the long-term fundamental interests of the two countries and adopt a responsible attitude towards the people and history.

We must focus on strengthening the consciousness of the Chinese national community, and actively promote the construction of the Chinese national community. We must systematically advance the sinicisation of religion in China, strengthen the rule of law in religious affairs governance, and maintain harmony and stability in the religious sector. We need to strengthen the ideological and political guidance of non-Party intellectuals and individuals from new social strata, encouraging them to make contributions to the construction of Chinese-style modernisation. We must promote the healthy development of the non-public economy and the healthy growth of non-public economy individuals, guiding private enterprises and private businesspeople to build confidence, overcome challenges, and drive development. We must strengthen the unity of Chinese people at home and abroad, and leverage the United Front work in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and overseas to win the hearts of the people. We must enhance the Party's overall leadership over United Front work, ensuring that the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee are fully implemented and effectively executed. 。，2025--，，、、、。，。，。、，。，。，、、。，。，.

Xi Reaches Out to EU's Costa - China & Japan Resume Ruling Parties Dialogue after 6 Years - Tibet Quake Response vs California Wildfires Bickering - 2...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, January 15, 2025. Page 1: There's a report on Xi Jinping's phone call with European Council President Antonio Costa. Xinhua reports: Xi extended his congratulations once again to Costa on assuming the presidency of the European Council, noting that this year marks the 50th anniversary of China-EU diplomatic relations, an important milestone that serves as both a point of continuity and a new starting point. The history of China-EU relations demonstrates that as long as both sides uphold mutual respect, treat each other as equals, and engage in candid dialogue, they can advance cooperation and make significant achievements, Xi said. Xi said that like-mindedness makes for partnership, and seeking common ground while respecting differences also defines partnership. The key lies in respecting each other's choice of social systems and development paths, as well as each other's core interests and major concerns, Xi said, adding that China has always regarded Europe as an important pole in a multipolar world, firmly supported European integration, and backed the EU's pursuit of strategic autonomy. Both sides should summarize the experiences of China-EU relations, draw important lessons, jointly safeguard the political foundation of their relations, and advance their relationship, so as to bring greater benefits to the peoples of China and Europe and contribute more stability and certainty to an increasingly turbulent international landscape.- The report adds: Xi Jinping stressed that China and Europe have no fundamental conflicts of interest or geopolitical contradictions, and are partners of mutual achievement. Over the past 50 years, China-EU relations have not only contributed to their respective development but also made significant contributions to global peace and prosperity, Xi said, adding that the more severe and complex the international situation becomes, the more China and Europe should adhere to the original aspirations of their diplomatic ties. Calling on both sides to strengthen strategic communication, enhance strategic mutual trust, and uphold their partnership, Xi said that China remains confident in the EU and hopes the EU will also prove to be a trustworthy cooperation partner for China.- (Note: This is quite a remarkable and rather condescending comment.) -The economic and trade cooperation between China and the EU is mutually complementary and beneficial, with both sides serving as defenders of the multilateral trading system, Xi said, adding that the two sides have already formed a strong economic symbiotic relationship. Noting that China remains committed to high-quality development and high-level opening up, Xi said that it will bring new opportunities for China-EU cooperation. The two sides should expand mutual openness, consolidate existing cooperation mechanisms, and foster new growth points in their cooperation, Xi said. Both sides should also ensure the success of activities celebrating the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties, enhance cultural exchanges and people-to-people interactions, encourage mutual visits between their people, and support local exchanges and educational cooperation, so as to strengthen the foundation of public goodwill in China-EU relations, Xi added.- As per Xinhua, Costa said: -The EU is ready to properly address economic and trade differences with China through dialogue and consultation, Costa said. Both the EU and China respect the principles of the UN Charter, uphold multilateralism, safeguard free trade, and oppose bloc confrontation, and they should cooperate rather than compete.- The two also discussed the war in Ukraine. Share Tracking People's Daily Costa summarised the call in a post on X. Meanwhile, Politico reports that -the European Union is considering holding a Brussels summit with China in May in a bid to soothe ties with Beijing early in Donald Trump's second term as U.S. president. The news comes as António Costa, who took office in December as president of the European Council, held an introductory phone call Tuesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two agreed that ‘the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties could be a good opportunity for a successful EU-China Summit later in the year,' said an EU official, who was granted anonymity as they were not authorized to speak on the record.- On trade issues, the report adds: -Trade relations between Brussels and Beijing remain tense, however, with the European Commission ruling on Tuesday that China's market access rules for medical devices are unfair to EU exporters. The decision followed a nine-month probe.- Subscribe now Next, there's a report on Xi's congratulatory message to Joseph Aoun on assuming the presidency of Lebanon. Xinhua reports: -Xi said that he attaches great importance to the development of China-Lebanon ties and is ready to work with President Aoun to promote the friendly relations between the two countries and mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields, so as to better benefit the two peoples. China will, as always, firmly support Lebanon in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and continue to provide assistance within its capacity for Lebanon's economic development and improvement of people's livelihood, Xi said.- Third, there's a report on Wang Huning's meeting with a delegation of Japan's ruling coalition, led by Secretary General Hiroshi Moriyama of the Liberal Democratic Party and Secretary General Makoto Nishida of the Komeito Party. Xinhua says: Wang said the -ruling parties of the two countries should carry out in-depth exchanges, deliver on the common understandings between the two countries' leaders, make joint efforts to develop bilateral relations, and promote the prosperity and development of the region and the world. ‘The CPPCC National Committee is ready to make positive contributions to this end,' said Wang. Representatives of the Japanese delegation said that Japan and China are important neighbors of each other. They said Japan is willing to promote people-to-people exchanges at all levels, including among young parliamentarians and local leaders, in accordance with the important consensus between the two countries' leaders and in the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences, in order to reduce differences and promote cooperation.- Another report in the paper, on Page 3, discusses the delegation's meeting with Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Wang told the delegation that -last November, President Xi Jinping met with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and reached an important consensus on comprehensively promoting the China-Japan strategic and mutually beneficial relationship and striving to build a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship that meets the requirements of the new era. At present, China-Japan relations are facing an important opportunity for improvement and development. It is hoped that both sides will make good use of the ruling party exchange mechanism platform to play a positive role in the development of China-Japan relations. The Japanese side expressed its willingness to work with the Chinese side to implement the consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, strengthen dialogue between the ruling parties, and promote concrete results in practical cooperation in various fields.- ，，11，，、、。，。，。，，，. Another report offers the official Chinese readout of the ninth meeting of the exchange mechanism between the Chinese and Japanese ruling parties. More than 60 representatives from Chinese central ministries, local governments, and Japan's ruling coalition participated. ILD chief Liu Jianchao led this meeting from the Chinese side. Liu said that -China was willing to work with Japan to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, adhere to peaceful coexistence, harmonious symbiosis, and harmony amid diversity, and promote the building of a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship that meets the requirements of the new era. The ruling parties of the two countries should strengthen dialogue and communication and take concrete actions to promote the sound and stable development of China-Japan relations.- ，，、、，、。，。 Finally, there's a report on the agreements reached during the delegation's visit. The report says: Both sides believe that the China-Japan ruling party exchange mechanism has played an important political guiding role in promoting the development of China-Japan relations since its first meeting in 2006, and welcomed the resumption of the inter-party talks after a period of 6 years and 3 months. Focusing on the mission and responsibilities of ruling parties, both sides engaged in candid discussions on the important responsibilities and roles that the two countries should assume to maintain international order based on international law amid global upheavals. The two sides had in-depth discussions and candidly exchanged views on enhancing mutual trust, expanding cultural exchanges and deepening mutually beneficial cooperation. The two sides agreed to follow the direction indicated by the leaders of the two countries, principles established in the four China-Japan political documents, work together to comprehensively promote the China-Japan strategic, mutually beneficial relations, and build a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship that meets the requirements of the new era. To this end, the ruling parties of the two countries will continue to strengthen dialogue. The two sides agreed that no matter what situation China-Japan relations face, they must maintain close dialogue and communication, strengthen exchanges between the two countries' political parties, political leaders and young politicians, enhance mutual understanding and trust, and lay a solid political foundation for improving and developing China-Japan relations and building a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship. The two sides exchanged views on issues such as the discharge of Fukushima nuclear contaminated water into the sea and the import of Japanese aquatic products, and agreed to promote the implementation of the consensus reached by the two governments, accelerate communication and consultations, and properly handle each other's concerns. The two sides confirmed that they will continue to promote practical cooperation between the two countries through exchanges between the ruling parties, and agreed in principle to hold the 10th meeting of the China-Japan ruling party exchange mechanism in Japan this autumn. ，2006，63。-——-，。、、，。，，，、。，。，，、，，，、。，，，。，。 Share Tracking People's Daily Back to the front page, there's a report informing that China implemented 46,967 water conservancy projects in 2024, with a total investment of 1.35 trillion yuan. The effort created 3.147 million jobs. Finally, there's a long feature talking about the earthquake rescue and relief work that has been carried out in Tibet. It says that -at present, the earthquake relief work is at a critical stage. All parties are working tirelessly to win the tough battle…- The piece offers an official relay of events in terms of the state's response. So -after the earthquake, General Secretary Xi Jinping attached great importance to it and issued important instructions … In accordance with General Secretary Xi Jinping's instructions and the request of Premier Li Qiang, Politburo member and Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing led relevant department officials on January 7 to the earthquake-stricken area in Shigatse, Tibet, to guide emergency rescue and response efforts on site. The safety and well-being of the affected people has always been close to the General Secretary's heart. On January 9, Xi Jinping presided over a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee to discuss and plan the earthquake relief efforts in Dingri, Tibet. The meeting emphasised the need to handle the work with even greater precision and to resolutely win the tough battle of earthquake relief.- ，，-，--，--，-。，、7。，。9，，。，，. The next bit in this section of the article essentially and rather emphatically talks about the Party's flag flying high at the forefront of the earthquake relief effort. There's no useful information, just charged rhetoric. For instance, -‘Be together with the masses', this is the solemn promise of Communist Party members when faced with a disaster-. --，. The next section is even more dramatic, with rescuers, with blistered hands, pulling people out of the rubble; doctors and volunteers working long hours with bloodshot eyes, etc. It also informs that -less than two days after the earthquake, a total of more than 12,000 rescue forces from various parties rushed to the scene and rescued 407 trapped people.- Another relevant data point is that as of 18:00 on January 12, a total of 2,198 prefabricated houses had been built to relocate people…166,200 blankets, 40,737 stoves for heating, and 118,000 sets of clothing had been provided. So whom should we thank for all this? -‘The smooth progress of earthquake relief work fully demonstrates the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, fully displays the magnificent scene of Chinese nation's unity as one family, watching out for and helping each other, and fully reflects the remarkable superiority of the socialist system and the incomparable warmth of the motherland's big family', said Wang Junzheng, Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee.- -，，、，。-. The next section has some details on response times and processes. Note: This is really important not just in itself — i.e., to understand the approach and mobilisation during a disaster — but also from a propaganda point of view. One cannot help juxtaposing this narrative from China with the political bickering that has taken place in the US in the past few months around natural disasters, be it with the storms before the election or the fires in California. Now, that said, this article does not mention the US or draw that comparison directly. But Chinese media has prominently covered the political back and forth in the US over the LA fires. For instance, this Xinhua report says that while wildfires rage, American politicians are busy spitting at each other/exchanging verbal attacks ( ). Ta Kung Pao's coverage talks about officials shirking responsibility. Also checkout this VOA report discussing Chinese media and social media comments on the California wildfires. It discusses the different approaches of Chinese media when covering the two natural disasters in California and Tibet. Anyway, the PD article says that: -On the morning of the 7th, just after 9 a.m., an earthquake alarm sounded at the National Emergency Command Center, and within 30 seconds, the internal response mechanism was activated… The heads of the Ministry of Emergency Management and other departments remotely connected with the local emergency command and rescue teams in the Tibet Autonomous Region. The emergency mechanism was launched immediately. The State Council's Earthquake Relief Headquarters set up a working group to strengthen overall coordination, bringing together various departments to fully carry out disaster relief efforts. The coordinated ‘game of chess' approach was clear, highlighting the advantages of the emergency management system with Chinese characteristics… Within 10 minutes of the earthquake, rescue aircraft had already flown over the disaster area; in less than 30 minutes, rescue teams began breaking through debris at the epicenter, the olive green, fire rescue orange, and emergency blue—various units entered the disaster-stricken area in an orderly manner and began their work. The effectiveness of China's emergency rescue system was immediately evident. Within a single day, local communication, networks, roads, and power supplies were gradually restored, and the affected residents were housed in emergency tents, enjoying hot meals three times a day… Emergency disaster relief supplies from the central government were immediately dispatched!On the evening of the 7th, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Emergency Management allocated 100 million yuan of central natural disaster relief funds, and the first batch of central disaster relief materials arrived in the disaster area… Whatever Tibet lacked, the central government allocated. On the evening of the 11th, the Tibet Autonomous Region requested the State Council's Earthquake Relief Headquarters for an additional 2,000 prefabricated shelters. By the morning of the 12th, the emergency management departments of Sichuan and Gansu provinces had begun organizing shipments… As of now, the Ministry of Natural Resources has completed 3,841 emergency inspections of geological hazard risks; the National Energy Administration has completed emergency power connections for 278 resettlement sites; and the National Health Commission and the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine continue to develop treatment plans for the injured on a ‘one person, one policy' basis. ‘Earthquake relief measures the leadership capacity of the ruling party, tests the government's execution ability, evaluates national mobilization capacity, and demonstrates national cohesion. The superiority of our socialist system is most evident in handling urgent, difficult, and critical challenges,' said Ma Liang, a professor at Peking University's School of Government.- 7，9，，，。-？--，，，。-。。，，，。--，。——。10，；，，、、……，。。，、、、，，。——。！7，、1，……，。11，2000；12，、。——。-，200，。-10，，，。，3841；278；、--……-，、、、。，。-.

Zhong Sheng to Trump: Let's Talk Business - 2024 Trade Data - India's China Trade Deficit over $100 Bln - Whitelisted Property Projects Get RMB 5 Trln...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, January 13, 2025. Page 1: On Sunday, there was a report on Xi Jinping issuing instructions for the high-quality development of audit-based oversight to provide safeguards for the country's high-quality economic and social development. The report had said: -Xi Jinping emphasised that on the new journey, it is necessary to be guided by the Thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, adhere to the centralised and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee over audit work, focus on main responsibilities and main tasks, deepen reform and innovation, strengthen self-construction, and strive to build a centralized, unified, comprehensive, authoritative, and efficient audit supervision system, continuously improve the quality and effectiveness of audit supervision, use high-quality audit supervision to support high-quality economic and social development, and make new contributions to comprehensively advancing the building of a strong country through Chinese-style modernization and the great cause of national rejuvenation.- ，，，，，，，、、，，，、. Today, there's an article discussing some of the deliberations at the National Audit Work Conference and the National Audit Institutions Advanced Collectives and Advanced Workers Commendation Conference that was held in Beijing. Here's an interesting excerpt from the report: -Deputy Director of the Policy Research Office of the National Audit Office, Lin Hai, stated that these achievements are a vivid practice of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era in the field of auditing. They represent significant results in the governance of the country by the Party Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, within the auditing domain. These accomplishments fully demonstrate and validate the truth and practical power of the Party's innovative theories. In the first 11 months of 2024, over 50,000 entities and more than 19,000 leading cadres were audited nationwide, resulting in the promotion of revenue growth, expenditure savings, and the recovery of losses totaling over 310 billion yuan. More than 20,000 rules and regulations were refined and perfected, and over 10,000 major issue clues identified through audits were transferred for further handling… Auditing is playing an increasingly important role in advancing the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity. Lin added: ‘We must bear in mind the instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping, take the implementation and effectiveness of the Party Central Committee's macro-control decisions and arrangements as the main line of work, and continue to carry out audits around promoting more active and effective macro policies and improving the efficiency of government investment, promoting the development of new quality productive forces and enhancing regional development vitality, and effectively preventing and resolving risks in key areas, so as to better serve the overall situation of economic and social development'.- ，，，。202411，5、1.9，3100；2，1……。-，，、、，。-.

Currently, China's inflation rate, fiscal deficit ratio, and government debt ratio are relatively low, and the policy toolbox remains well-stocked. Furthermore, as major global economies enter an interest rate reduction cycle, it will create greater room for China's policies to take effect, said Zhang Bin, Deputy Director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. -，、、，，，。-. The issuance of a 2 trillion yuan quota for replacing existing implicit debts has been completed; the management mechanism for special bonds has been improved, with an expansion of the areas where local special bonds can be directed; the reserve requirement ratio has been further reduced ... fiscal and monetary policies are being deployed intensively.

Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: Two pieces to note on the page. First, there's a Zhong Sheng commentary on China-US ties. It argues that this year's Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show showed how China-US cooperation is in mutual interest. It informs that at this year's show more than 1,300 Chinese companies participated, accounting for about 27% of all exhibitors. -Under the current circumstances, the common interests between China and the United States have not decreased but have instead increased. This is a shared perception among the vast majority of businesses and people in both countries and serves as an important foundation for both sides to move towards each other and engage in mutually beneficial cooperation. Looking back at 2024, China hosted over 3,800 economic and trade exhibitions. Whether it was U.S. companies having the largest exhibition area at the Import Expo, or U.S. companies ranking first among overseas exhibitors at the Supply Chain Expo, or the frequent visits to China by many US business executives, the business communities of China and the US have been creating opportunities and achieving mutual success through their exchanges. The cooperation between enterprises from both sides shows that as long as we adhere to mutual respect, mutual benefit, equal consultation, follow economic laws and market rules, and expand and deepen mutually beneficial economic and trade cooperation, China and the US can absolutely achieve win-win results. ，，，，、。2024，3800，，，，、。，、、，，，. It adds: -no matter from which angle we look at Sino-US relations, we can find that China and the United States have extensive common interests, and mutual benefit and win-win are the essential characteristics of Sino-US relations. This is sufficient to enlighten both sides that they should be partners, not opponents; should achieve success together, not harm each other; should seek common ground while reserving differences, rather than engage in malicious competition. China has proposed that both sides should uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation to find a correct way for China-U.S. relations in the new era. This is both a profound summary of past experience and an important guide toward the future.- 46，，，，，。，；，；，。、、，，，. The next paragraph says: -Ancient Chinese said, ‘trade is a path of mutual benevolence and a path of mutual benefit.' There is an inscription at the entrance of the US Department of Commerce Library: ‘Promoting peace and commerce with all people.' Mutual benefit is a principle that holds true both in ancient times and today, and is the consensus of the business communities of China and the US. In 2024, Tesla's sales in China exceeded 657,000 vehicles, an 8.8% year-on-year increase, setting a record high. In the fourth quarter, Starbucks added a net of 290 new stores in mainland China, entering 78 new county-level markets. By the end of 2024, the number of US companies established in China reached 73,000, with a total investment exceeding $1.2 trillion, covering fields such as electronics and communications, automobile manufacturing, consumer goods, and financial services. Countless cases show that US companies investing and doing business in China not only make profits but also benefit the people of both countries. China is committed to advancing Chinese-style modernisation, while the US is working to revitalise its economy, creating boundless space for cooperation between both sides. By focusing on common interests, the list of China-US cooperation can be made longer, and the cake of cooperation can be made bigger.- ，-，，-。--。，，。2024，65.7，8.8%，；290，78……2024，7.3，1.2，、、、。，，，。，，。，，. The interests of China and the US are deeply intertwined, and it is normal for contradictions and differences to arise, but this should not become an obstacle to the two countries' cooperation. Facing the new situation and changes in Sino-US economic and trade relations in recent years, both sides should respect each other, seek common ground while reserving differences, and adopt constructive ways to enhance understanding and expand consensus. Starting tariff wars, trade wars, and technology wars for various reasons goes against historical trends and economic laws, and there will be no winners. Artificially setting limits or engaging in protectionism will only interfere with normal trade exchanges and the stability of global industrial and supply chains, which does not serve the interests of any party. Gary Shapiro, CEO of the US Consumer Technology Association, organizer of the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show, said that raising tariffs will threaten the growth of the US technology industry. The report published by the association predicts that if the new US government implements its proposed high tariff policy, the purchasing power of US consumers for consumer technology industry products and services will decrease by $90 billion to $143 billion in 2025. Maurice Obstfeld, former Chief Economist of the International Monetary Fund, also recently stated that attempting to use tariffs to enhance US influence in the global economy could backfire and harm the US economy. ，，。，、，、。、、，，。，，。、·，。，，20259001430。·，，.

Page 9: There's an article by Dong Zhiyong who is a Vice President at Peking University and a member of the Standing Committee of the PKU Party Committee. Dong writes about China's approach of AI+ development. I don't usually cover such pieces, but I thought this was a good read for an overview of the policy direction with regard to AI. Dong writes: In recent times, driven by policy guidance, technological breakthroughs and industrial applications, China has made remarkable achievements in the development of AI. AI technology development in China has achieved continuous breakthroughs, especially in the fields of speech recognition, image processing, intelligent manufacturing, and autonomous driving. In these domains, China is at the international leading level. At the same time, with the continuous maturity of technology and the continuous expansion of application scenarios, AI development in China is steadily advancing toward deep integration and innovation-driven development, contributing Chinese wisdom to the development of the global intelligent economy. ，、，。，、、、。，，，. He added that -in recent years, China has accelerated the construction of new information infrastructure and laid a solid foundation for the development of AI. As of November 2024, China has built a total of 4.191 million 5G base stations; there are around 1.002 billion 5G mobile phone users. It has also built the world's largest 5G network, accumulating rich technology, data, industry, scenarios and market foundations for the development of AI. For example, some e-commerce platforms and social platforms have relied on new information infrastructure and massive user data to deeply integrate big data analysis, AI algorithms, cloud computing and other technologies to promote the intelligent upgrading of industries and form a virtuous circle. From ‘Internet+' and digitalisation to ‘AI+', this is not only a leap in the ‘technology-economy' paradigm but also a profound transformation in development models, capable of fostering new economic growth points and injecting new momentum into high-quality economic development.- 。，。，，。202411，5G419.1，5G10.02，5G，、、、。，、，、、，，。-+-、-+-，-—-，，，. The continuously optimised policy environment provides support for AI development. China places great emphasis on AI development, evidenced by initiatives like the New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan, the Three-Year Action Plan to Promote the Development of the New Generation AI Industry (2018–2020), and the ‘AI+' Action. These efforts have strengthened the top-level design for AI development. At the same time, local governments are encouraged to integrate their unique characteristics into exploratory practices, creating AI development hubs. For example, Beijing released its ‘AI+' Action Plan, focusing on creating benchmark applications in robotics, education, healthcare, culture, transportation, and other fields. Shenzhen introduced measures to build itself into a pioneer AI city, emphasizing advanced manufacturing, modern services, and scientific research to enable AI to empower a wide range of industries. Shanghai advanced its ‘AI+' initiative in government services, creating a convenient and efficient ‘Smart Easy Service' brand for public administration. Other regions have successively launched special action plans to promote the deep integration of AI with local economies, accelerate the creation of AI ecosystems with regional characteristics, and establish development patterns with demonstrative effects. 。，《》《（2018—2020）》-+-，。，，。，-+-，、、、、；，、，；-+-，--；。，，，. Rich application scenarios have expanded the space for the development of AI. In terms of technology research and development, innovative applications of AI technology have not only driven the optimisation of algorithms but also facilitated breakthroughs in intelligent chips and hardware. According to statistics from the World Intellectual Property Organization, from 2014 to 2023, China filed more than 38,000 patents for generative AI, ranking first globally. At present, China has initially established a relatively comprehensive AI industrial system, with an industry chain covering key upstream and downstream segments such as chips, algorithms, data, platforms, and applications. Several large AI models independently developed by China have been widely applied in areas such as transportation, online shopping, learning, and office work. From an industry perspective, AI technology has been widely used in fields such as intelligent manufacturing, smart cities, and autonomous driving, promoting the growth and strengthening of emerging industries. It has also facilitated the intelligent upgrading and digital transformation of traditional industries. According to the 2023–2024 China Intelligent Manufacturing Development Annual Report, in 2023, the scale of industries related to smart manufacturing in China grew by 14.9% year-on-year, reaching 2.88416 trillion yuan, with high growth expected to continue over the next three years. From a regional perspective, China has formed several internationally competitive AI industry clusters centered in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. These clusters have provided strong momentum for the development of the AI industry while promoting coordinated regional economic development. The abundance of application scenarios has explored new models and paths for AI development. 。，，。，2014—2023，3.8，。，，、、、、。，、、。，、、，，、。《2023—2024》，202314.9%，28841.6，3。，、、，，。，. Subscribe now In the next section, Dong talks about the utility of AI for China's economic, security and social policies. -At present, global scientific and technological competition is becoming increasingly fierce, and the external environment is becoming increasingly complex and severe. Only by coordinating development and security and giving equal importance to both can we ensure that the ship of China rides winds and waves and moves steadily toward the future. AI opens up new development space for new quality productive forces. Empowering the development of new quality productive forces with ‘AI+' is of great significance for achieving high-quality development and high-level security.- ，，。，，、。。-+-，. Inject momentum into economic transformation and upgrading. At present, China's economy is at a critical juncture of high-quality development, and the task of achieving the transformation of development drivers, mode change, and structural adjustment is arduous. AI promotes comprehensive changes in production methods, business models, and consumption patterns through in-depth analysis and processing of various types of data, providing strong impetus for economic transformation and upgrading. In traditional industries, using AI to promote intelligent transformation and digital transformation can improve production efficiency, reduce production costs, and develop towards high-end, intelligent, and green development. For example, some intelligent garment factories have achieved seamless integration of integrated production processes from cutting, sewing, ironing to warehousing matching by introducing auxiliary design large models, greatly increasing the proportion of customized clothing in total production. In the field of emerging industries, AI has created a large number of business opportunities and development space, giving birth to new industries and new models such as autonomous driving and smart medical care, and creating new economic growth points. 。，，、、。，、、，。，，、，、、。，，、、，。，，、，. Providing support for economic security. As the profound changes unseen in a century accelerate, ensuring economic security is crucial for continuously enhancing China's economic competitiveness, innovation capacity, and resilience to risks. The application of AI can, on the basis of promoting industrial structure optimization and upgrading, increase the overall added value of industries, enhance the diversity of industrial entities, reduce dependence on single markets or resources, improve the ability to cope with uncertainty, and thereby enhance the resilience and security level of industrial and supply chains. As AI integrates more deeply with the real economy, data security has become a global and systemic issue. The application of AI helps build a secure and controllable technological framework, enhances real-time responses to cybersecurity threats through automated monitoring systems, prevents risks such as data leaks and hacker attacks, and ensures information security across various fields. 。，、、。，，，，，，。，、。，，，、，. Lay a solid foundation for improving the inclusiveness of development. As an important force for empowering new quality productive forces, AI improves the inclusiveness of development by improving resource allocation and service efficiency. For example, in the field of rural revitalization, AI provides more accurate demand forecasting and resource allocation plans for poverty-stricken areas through big data analysis and intelligent algorithms, which helps to increase farmers' income and improve local production and living conditions. In the field of education, AI has improved the popularity and fairness of educational resources through personalized teaching and intelligent tutoring. In terms of public services, the application of AI in data governance, intelligent decision-making and other fields can improve the efficiency and accuracy of social governance and help promote the modernization of national governance. 。，，。，，，，，。，、，。，、，，. Share Tracking People's Daily In the final section, he writes: At present, China's AI development has entered a new stage. It is necessary to be cognisant that there is still a gap between the overall development level of AI in China and that of developed countries. To implement the task of ‘launching the -AI+- action and cultivating future industries' proposed by the Central Economic Work Conference, we must…firmly grasp the major historical opportunities for the development of AI, and accelerate the innovative development of AI. ，。，。-‘+'，-，、、，，。 The tasks, therefore, are to: Build a healthy and complete industrial ecology: -It is necessary to establish a market-oriented innovation system that promotes deep cooperation and collaboration among multiple stakeholders, including technology researchers, investors, and market participants, forming a digital innovation ecosystem with integrated development of industry, academia, research, and application. Build an industrial ecology with technology research and development, scenario application, and industrial upgrading as the core, and create an interconnected and resource-sharing ecosystem. Based on the resource endowments and industrial foundations of each region, differentiated industrial cluster development strategies should be formulated to promote the distinctive development of local industrial clusters. Give full play to the leading role of leading enterprises in the cluster, drive innovation and resource integration of upstream and downstream enterprises, enhance the overall competitiveness of the cluster, encourage small and medium-sized enterprises to integrate into the AI industry cluster, and form competitive advantages in their respective segments through collaborative innovation A regional coordination development mechanism should be established to promote cross-regional exchange and dissemination of AI technologies, gradually expanding the application scenarios and coverage of ‘AI+'. 。，。，、、，。、，、。，，。，，，，。，，-+-. Build an effective data factor market: Building an efficient, open and innovative data factor market is an important guarantee for the development of AI. It is necessary to explore the establishment of a data property rights system, promote the structural division and orderly circulation of data property rights, and coordinate the construction of standardized and efficient data trading platforms. As an important part of social resources, public data plays an irreplaceable role in promoting the application and innovation of AI. To this end, we should promote the implementation of the public data rights confirmation and authorization mechanism, further increase the intensity of data openness, and promote the expansion of the supply and use scope of public data that does not carry personal information and does not affect public safety according to its purposes. Respect the labor and other factors of data processors such as data collection and processing, and fully guarantee the rights of data processors to use data and obtain benefits. 。、。、，。，，。，。，，，，。、，. Build a multi-level talent training system. -It is necessary to strengthen the reform of basic education and higher education in AI, strengthen the popularization of basic knowledge of AI in primary and secondary schools, strengthen vocational training, focus on improving the digital literacy of workers, and adjust and optimize the curriculum in colleges and universities according to the needs of the development of the AI industry. Optimize talent introduction policies, improve talent incentive mechanisms, and attract and retain top global talents. Pay attention to the career development and subsequent security of talent, ensuring that more high-end talent can be introduced and retained, strengthening their sense of belonging and creativity. Actively promote cooperation and exchanges between domestic institutions and international organizations or overseas universities, utilizing global intellectual resources to advance China's AI innovation and development. 。，。，，，，。，，。，、，。、，。 Optimize AI regulatory policies: It is necessary to promote the standardized development of AI and optimize regulatory policies. Improve the legal framework in terms of data privacy protection, algorithm transparency, and technical ethics, clarify the red lines for technology development and application and the boundaries of responsibility of each subject, and ensure the safety and fairness of technology.Establish a multi-party communication mechanism, establish a cross-departmental and cross-field regulatory coordination mechanism, and form a joint force in technology research and development, data use, and ethical assessment.Strengthen international cooperation, promote global coordination of rules and unified technical standards, accelerate the construction of an inclusive and prudent governance mechanism, encourage all sectors to actively participate in the ethical and safety supervision of AI, and ensure that the development of AI technology is in line with human welfare.。。，，。、、，，。，、，、、。，，，，。 Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Deng Li has been appointed ambassador to France and Monaco, replacing Lu Shaye. Xiao Junzheng has been appointed ambassador to Israel, replacing Cai Run. Zhang Wei has been appointed ambassador to Benin, replacing Peng Jingtao. Dai Bing has been appointed ambassador to the Republic of Korea, replacing Xing Haiming. Jiang Xuebin has been appointed ambassador to Türkiye, replacing Liu Shaobin. Lyu Jian has been appointed ambassador to Oman, replacing Li Lingbing.

Guo Haiyan has been appointed ambassador to Kenya, replacing Zhou Pingjian. Han Chunlin has been appointed ambassador to Kazakhstan, replacing Zhang Xiao. Liu Jiangping has been appointed ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, replacing Du Dewen. Li Fan has been appointed ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, replacing Ji Ping. Finally, there's a commentary drawing from the CCDI plenary's outcomes. The commentary says that currently China is in a critical period. -How to turn the grand blueprint of Chinese-style modernisation into a beautiful reality? How to ensure that the Party always remains the strong leadership core of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics? The key to answering these major questions is to persist in governing the Party with the spirit of reform and strict standards, deepen the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party, and carry out the Party's great self-revolution to the end.- ，，，、。？？，，，. History and practice have repeatedly proved that the unity of the Party is the life of the Party, and the strong and powerful leadership of the Party Central Committee is the fundamental guarantee for us to overcome all difficulties and risks. General Secretary Xi Jinping has emphasised that ‘maintaining a high degree of alignment with the Party Central Committee must be carried out in words and deeds'. This is not only an intrinsic requirement for ensuring the Party's unity and cohesion but also an urgent necessity for overcoming challenges and seizing the initiative. In the new era and on the new journey, we must unremittingly use Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era to unite our hearts and forge our souls, promote political supervision to focus on specific issues, pursue precise results, and implement it as regular practice, ensuring that the whole Party maintains a high degree of unity with the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core in terms of thought, politics, and actions and ensuring that all decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee are effectively implemented, and work together to promote reform and promote high-quality development. ，，。：-。-，、。，，、、，、、，，、. The commentary then calls for strict self-discipline. It says that -strengthening the Party's discipline is an ongoing task. Only by establishing a normalised and long-term discipline education mechanism, strictly enforcing the Party's discipline, and accurately applying the ‘four forms' can we guide Party members and cadres to transform external restraint into self-discipline, internalizing it as a subconscious standard for daily words and actions. The Party's discipline and the pursuit of reform and innovation are inherently unified. The Party's discipline not only serves as a tool for education and constraint but also provides protection and encouragement. It is both an ‘incantation for control' and a ‘protective talisman'. Efforts must unify strict management and supervision with encouragement for taking responsibility, enabling cadres to pursue reform and innovation while adhering to rules and discipline.- ，，，，--，、，。，，，--，--。，、。 The next bit calls for a focus on top leaders and for all institutions to fulfill their responsibilities.

The Chinese readout on the Wang-Tinubu meeting says: -Wang Yi said that last September, His Excellency paid a successful state visit to China and jointly announced with President Xi Jinping that they would build a comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Nigeria, achieving a new leap in bilateral relations. China and Nigeria have always respected each other and treated each other as equals. Mutual understanding and mutual support on issues of core interests, mutual benefit and win-win cooperation on the road of development and revitalization, the relationship between the two countries is at the forefront of China-Africa relations. Wang Yi said that he was very happy to see Nigeria's ‘Renewed Hope Agenda' on the road of development, played an important role in regional peace, and became a stabilizing force in Africa. He believes that under His Excellency's leadership, Nigeria's national development will achieve greater achievements. China-Nigeria relations have gone beyond the bilateral scope. The two sides should promote the continuous development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries, and work together to build an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era, and play a demonstration role in the solidarity and cooperation of the Global South.- 。，9，，。、。、，、，。，--，，。，。，，，.

Nigeria, as a major African country with global influence and an important member of the Global South, plays an irreplaceable role in Africa's pursuit of peace and development.- The report adds: Wang -called on both countries to support each other on issues concerning their core interests and to achieve mutual benefit and win-win results in their development and revitalization processes. China is ready to work with Nigeria to implement the outcomes of the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) and advance the 10 partnership action plans in Nigeria, paving the way for new progress in bilateral relations, Wang said. He emphasized China's willingness to align Belt and Road cooperation and the 10 partnership action plans with the priority areas of Nigeria's Renewed Hope Agenda. By leveraging traditional strengths in infrastructure development, expanding trade and financial collaboration and creating new highlights in investment cooperation, China aims to deepen practical ties with Nigeria, Wang stated. He also urged Nigeria to safeguard the safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises and personnel operating in the country. China appreciates Nigeria's support for its three major global initiatives: the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative, Wang noted. He reiterated China's unwavering support for Africa in advocating for climate justice at the United Nations Climate Change Conference. Wang added that China is ready to strengthen coordination with Nigeria and other African countries on climate change issues to protect the development interests of the Global South.- Among other things, Tuggar reportedly -expressed admiration for China's remarkable achievements in economic development and technological innovation, praised its global influence and reaffirmed Nigeria's commitment to fostering friendship and cooperation to create a brighter future for their people. He also reiterated Nigeria's unwavering adherence to the one-China principle and pledged continued support for China's stance on the international stage, emphasizing that it is the right thing to do.- Wang and Tuggar later met the press. In that interaction, Wang talked about China being ready to work with African countries to implement the GSI. He added: -China firmly supports Africans in solving African problems in an African way. The African people are the real masters of this continent, and they have the wisdom, ability and right to solve their own problems. China opposes external forces interfering in the internal affairs of African countries in any form, supports the African Union and various sub-regional organizations to play a constructive role, supports African powers to strengthen leading actions, promote the resolution of problems and differences through dialogue and consultation, and resolve hot-spot issues through political means.- 。，、。，，，，. -China will firmly support Africa in strengthening its capacity building for peace and security. It will establish a partnership with Africa to implement the Global Security Initiative, build a demonstration zone for cooperation under the initiative, promote the security partnership action, provide RMB 1 billion in grants in military assistance to Africa, and help African countries train 6,000 military personnel and 1,000 police law enforcement personnel. China will also continue to support the construction of the African Standby Force and rapid response units, and support African countries in peacekeeping and counter-terrorism operations. China will firmly support Africa in safeguarding its legitimate interests. China will practice genuine multilateralism and will not allow hegemonism and power politics to disrupt Africa. China's vote in the United Nations Security Council will always belong to Africa, and China will continue to speak out for the reasonable demands of African countries in multilateral forums. As the second-largest contributor to peacekeeping, China will continue to support United Nations peacekeeping operations in Africa. China will firmly support Africa in promoting security through development. We are willing to carry out 10 major partnership actions with Africa, make good use of the RMB 360 billion in funding support announced at the FOCAC summit, deepen cooperation in various fields, help African countries eliminate the soil of insecurity, and achieve long-term peace and stability through development and revitalization. Nigeria, as a major African country and the rotating chair of ECOWAS, plays an important role in maintaining peace in West Africa and the Sahel region. China supports Nigeria in uniting regional countries, adhering to unity and self-reliance, gathering strength through reconciliation, promoting security through development, and maintaining regional peace and stability.

Share Tracking People's Daily Another report (English report) on the page informs that Prime Minister of Grenada Dickon Mitchell will pay an official visit to China from January 11 to 17. One other report to note, although it's not in the paper today. China's Ministry of Commerce has said that the EU's practices in its foreign subsidy investigations against Chinese enterprises have constituted trade and investment barriers. The announcement followed the conclusion of a six-month probe, which was initiated at the request of the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products. Xinhua reports: -Under its foreign subsidies regulation, the EU has conducted preliminary, in-depth and raid investigations into Chinese companies in sectors such as locomotives, photovoltaics, wind power and security check equipment, said the ministry when initiating the probe into trade and investment barriers last July. The EU's investigations involved unreasonable practices that violated the World Trade Organization's core principles, including non-discrimination, the ministry said, citing stakeholders who participated in the probe. The stakeholders believe that the EU's investigations consisted of inappropriate penalties and unreasonable time constraints, and lacked procedural transparency and legitimacy, according to the ministry. The probe found that during the investigations, regulations were ‘selectively enforced' and the criteria used to determine foreign subsidies were vague. It also noted that the scope of the EU's investigations was overly broad, placing an ‘immense burden' on the companies, and that key concepts, such as market distortion, were defined in a ‘subjective and arbitrary' manner. Such investigations have harmed trade and investment between China and the EU by restricting Chinese companies' products, services and investments from entering the EU market, thereby damaging the competitiveness of relevant Chinese companies and products, the ministry said. The probe results revealed that Chinese enterprises have incurred significant economic losses, both directly and indirectly, due to the EU's investigations, including approximately 7.6 billion yuan (about 1.06 billion U.S. dollars) in abandoned bidding projects, with other affected projects valued at over 8 billion yuan.- It adds: -The ministry will take measures, including bilateral consultations, to urge the European side to adjust or change relevant practices in order to ensure an open, fair, just, non-discriminatory and predictable environment for Chinese enterprises to invest and operate in Europe.- Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

CCDI Plenary Communiqué Outlines Tougher Action Plans in Anti-Corruption Struggle - Boosting Support for 'Two New' Policies in 2025	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, January 9, 2025. Page 1: Let's begin with the full communique after the CCDI plenary session. 131 CCDI members and 247 observers attended the plenary session. The first substantive paragraph outlines what was done during the plenary. It begins by saying that the -session thoroughly studied and implemented Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.- The next bit says: The plenary session earnestly studied and deeply understood the important speech by General Secretary Xi Jinping. It unanimously held that the speech fully affirmed the new progress and achievements in comprehensive and strict Party governance over the past year, grasped the basic laws of the anti-corruption struggle from the strategic height of realizing the Party's mission and tasks in the new era and new journey, and deeply analyzed the current situation of the anti-corruption struggle, unequivocally clarified erroneous understandings and cleared ideological fog with a clear-cut stance, put forward clear requirements for resolutely fighting the tough, protracted, and comprehensive battles against corruption, made strategic plans to provide strong guarantees for advancing Chinese-style modernization with new achievements in comprehensive and strict Party governance, and placed high expectations on discipline inspection and supervision cadres. 、。，，，，，、，、、，，. The speech is far-sighted, profound, confronted problems directly, and was striking in clarity/would arouse even the apathetic. It demonstrates strong political nature, ideological nature, and guiding nature, pointing out the forward direction and providing important guidelines for deeply advancing comprehensive and strict Party governance, Party conduct and clean government construction, and the anti-corruption struggle. They all expressed that they will be guided by the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech, strengthen their confidence, dare to struggle, resolutely shoulder the responsibility of supervision, promote the implementation of the main responsibility, focus on the ‘' (matters of national interest/significance) in strengthening political supervision, unswervingly rectify the work style/conduct and discipline, and deepen the anti-corruption struggle with the tenacity and perseverance of always being on the road, and strive to eliminate the soil and conditions where corruption breeds through the integration of efforts to ensure that officials and cadres do not dare to be corrupt, are not being able to be corrupt, and do not want to be corrupt. A sense of reverence must always be maintained, efforts must be intensified to strengthen the standardization, legalisation, and professionalization of discipline inspection and supervision work, and truly achieve loyalty, cleanliness and responsibility, and dare to struggle and be good at struggle. 、、、，、、，、、。，，、，、，--，，，、、，。，，、. The long paragraph below gives a recap of the work from 2024. The plenary session pointed out that in 2024, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the Party adhered to leading the great social revolution through self-revolution, united and guided the entire Party and people of all ethnic groups to focus their efforts and overcome challenges and took new and solid strides in advancing Chinese-style modernisation. The CCDI, NSC and discipline inspection and supervision agencies at all levels adhered to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, firmly supported the Two Establishments and resolutely implemented the Two Safeguards'; focusing on the central tasks of the Party and the country, they continued to deepen political supervision, rectify work styles, discipline and the fight against corruption; promoted the improvement of the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party system, improved the supervision system of the Party and the country, consolidated and expanded the results of thematic education and education rectification, and ensured that the high-quality development of discipline inspection and supervision work in the new era and new journey achieved new results. The CCDI Standing Committee made the study and implementation of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, especially Xi Jinping's important thought on the Party's self-revolution, the central theme and focus throughout the year, leading the whole system to deeply study and understand the Party's innovative theories, and firmly follow the correct direction of discipline inspection and supervision work. The mechanism for making political oversight more specific, precise, and normalised were improved, with political supervision being focussed around the major decisions of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee to ensure the effective implementation of the Party Central Committee's policies and plans. In the study and education of Party discipline, efforts are made to excel as the ‘first phalanx', thoroughly studying and comprehending General Secretary Xi Jinping's important discourses on comprehensively strengthening the Party's disciplinary construction. Focusing closely on the ‘Six Disciplines', each was studied item by item and discussed in depth, guiding the entire system to learn more profoundly, become familiar with and effectively apply the knowledge, and promote the entire Party to study, understand, respect, and abide by discipline. We continued to severely curb hedonism and extravagance, severely rectified formalism and bureaucratism, and ensured the implementation of the eight-point central regulation in an in-depth and practical manner through effective and long-term governance. The anti-corruption struggle was pushed forward in depth, with intensified efforts in key sectors such as finance, state-owned enterprises, energy, tobacco, pharmaceuticals, sports, infrastructure projects, and bidding processes; corruption involving collusion between officials and businesses were severely investigated and dealt with; new and hidden forms of corruption were thoroughly investigated and deal with; efforts to investigate both bribe-taking and bribe giving were strengthened, and reforms based on cases were deepened to eliminate the soil and conditions that breed corruption. Focused rectification was carried out on misconduct and corruption directly affecting the people, with extraordinary measures being taken to punish ‘fly and ant' corruption, resolutely safeguarding the interests of the people and consolidating the Party's governance foundation. Political inspections were deepened, with routine inspections conducted for 68 departments and units, the first-ever coordinated inspections in the financial sector, and higher-level inspections conducted in prefecture-level cities. Immediate investigations and corrections were carried out during inspections, further highlighting the comprehensive supervisory role of inspections. The discipline inspection and supervision system and legal framework were further improved. The CCDI cooperated with the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to amend the Supervision Law, comprehensively advanced the construction of a digital discipline inspection and supervision system, and promoted the better transformation of institutional advantages into the effectiveness of rectifying misconduct and combating corruption. While affirming the achievements, the plenary session conducted a realistic analysis of existing problems in discipline inspection and supervision work and in the building of the cadre team, calling for great attention and practical solutions to address these issues. ，2024，，、，。，--、--，，、，、，，。，，。、、，，。--，，--、，、，。、，、，。，、、、、、、，，，，，。，--，，。，68，、，、，。，，，。，，、. The plenary session emphasized that comprehensively promoting the development of a strong country and the great cause of national rejuvenation through Chinese-style modernization has placed new and higher requirements for the fight against corruption. The discipline inspection and supervision organs should: truly unify their thoughts and actions with the accurate judgment of the situation and the scientific deployment of tasks by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core deeply grasp the historic achievements made in the fight against corruption in the new era, and firmly believe in winning the tough battle against corruption; deeply grasp the current situation of the anti-corruption struggle, which is still severe and complex, and firmly maintain the determination to win the protracted battle against corruption; deeply grasp the policy and strategy of promoting the principle of not daring to be corrupt, not being able to be corrupt, and not wanting to be corrupt, and firmly maintain the strong determination to win the overall battle against corruption. ，、，。、，，；，；、、，. The plenary session proposed that 2025 is the final year of implementing the 14th Five-Year Plan. To do a good job this year, it is necessary to adhere to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, fully implement the spirit of the 20th Party Congress and the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the 20th Central Committee, thoroughly study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping's important thoughts on Party building and the Party's self-revolution, deeply understand the decisive significance of the Two Establishments, strengthen the four consciousnesses, enhance the four self-confidences, and achieve the Two Safeguards, persist in governing the Party with the spirit of reform and strict standards, promote the implementation of the political responsibility of comprehensive and strict Party governance, promote the improvement of the system of comprehensive and strict Party governance, deepen the rectification of work style, discipline and anti-corruption struggle, and continuously promote the high-quality development of discipline inspection and supervision work in the new era and new journey, thereby providing strong guarantees for promoting Chinese-style modernization with new achievements in comprehensive and strict Party governance. ，2025--。，，、，、，--，--、--、--，，，，，，. After this, the communique makes 8 points for work going forward: First, strengthen political supervision around the major arrangements of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, and strive to promote further comprehensive deepening of reform and steady progress in China-style modernization. Resolutely safeguard the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee over the further comprehensive deepening of reform, closely focus on the progress of achieving the overall reform goal and progress in the ‘seven focuses' and 13 goals, refine and substantiate the content of supervision, driving Party organizations at all levels to concentrate efforts on reform and focus on implementation. ，，、。，--、13，，、.

Consolidate and deepen in implementing party discipline study and education, emphasise key content and key objects, advance discipline education method innovation, guide Party members and cadres to internalise discipline in their hearts and externalise it in actions. Consolidate and deepen the strict implementation of discipline, investigate and deal with violations of discipline as soon as they are discovered, and effectively maintain the rigidity and seriousness of discipline.

Through ‘joint rectification', eliminate the common roots of misconduct and corruption, and strengthen timely warning and supervision of situations where leading cadres' spouses, children, and their spouses illegally engage in business activities. Promote the establishment of a political ecology analysis and assessment mechanism with unified leadership of the Party Committee, organizational coordination of the CCDI, and coordinated linkage of relevant departments. Improve the joint punishment mechanism for key bribe-givers, formulate a three-year action plan for the construction of a clean culture in the new era (2025-2027), and tell the story of China's anti-corruption struggle well. Use ‘investigation' and ‘rectification' in a coordinated manner to block the evolution of misconduct and corruption, formulate opinions on advancing the simultaneous investigation and rectification of misconduct and corruption issues, and leverage big data and informatization to empower efforts to rectify misconduct and combat corruption. ，，。--，，--，、、、，、；，，、、、、、、、、、，、、，、、，、，。--，、，、、，，（2025—2027），。--、--，，. Fourth, continue to deepen the rectification of unhealthy practices and corruption around the masses, and strive to promote the reform and development results to benefit the general public better and more equitably. Continue to work hard to punish ‘fly-level corruption' (petty corruption) and ‘ant-level corruption' (low-level corruption), focusing on the key and weak links below the county level and continuing to address them. Deepen the governance of outstanding issues in ‘campus meals', rural collective management of ‘three resources', supervision of rural revitalization fund usage, medical insurance fund management, and elderly care services, and solidly advance the special campaign to address corruption and irregularities in the funeral sector. Guide local governments to select pain points and difficult issues related to people's livelihood and carry out rectification according to local conditions, so that the masses can perceive the impact and benefit. ，，。--，、。--、--、、、，。，.

Assist the Party's Central Committee in formulating the working methods for Party Committees (Party Groups) to conduct supervisory talks with lower-level ‘top leaders' and in drafting the Anti-cross-border Corruption Law. Promote the improvement of the Party and state supervision system with intra-Party supervision as the leading factor, specialized supervision as the main body, grassroots supervision as the support, and coordination of various types of supervision as the guarantee. ，，。，、，，、--。（）--，。、、、，. Seventh, strengthen the political responsibility for comprehensive and strict Party governance, striving to maintain a consistent tone of strictness from start to finish. With the ‘two responsibilities' as the guide, promote the main responsibility of the Party committee (Party group), the regulatory responsibility of functional departments, and the supervision responsibility of discipline inspection commissions (or discipline inspection teams), ensuring that all work in the same direction, thereby improving the responsibility pattern of managing and governing the Party with each entity assuming their responsibility and maintaining coordination. Urge Party organizations at all levels to use systematic thinking and scientific methods to advance Party governance, further improving the comprehensive and strict Party governance system. ，，。--，（）、、（），、。、，.

First, there's a report on Wang meeting with President of the Republic of the Congo Denis Sassou Nguesso and Foreign Minister Jean-Claude Gakosso. Xinhua's report on th Wang-Denis Sassou Nguesso meeting says: -Noting that Sassou is a renowned African politician and one of the African leaders who have visited China the most and met with Xi the most, Wang said the deep friendship between the two leaders serves as a vital political guarantee for China-Congo and China-Africa relations. The Chinese foreign minister's tradition of starting the year with a visit to Africa is a testament to China's unwavering solidarity with African nations, Wang said. Calling the Republic of the Congo a staunch friend and important partner of China, Wang praised the country's vibrant development under Sassou's leadership. China will remain the country's most reliable friend and partner during its development and revitalization journey, he said. The Republic of the Congo's role as the FOCAC's co-chair reflects Africa's confidence in the country, Wang said. As the best platform for deepening China-Africa cooperation and achieving common development, the FOCAC has been leading global cooperation with Africa, Wang said, noting that China is willing to work closely with the Republic of the Congo to comprehensively implement the outcomes of the FOCAC Beijing Summit, support Africa's development and jointly pursue modernization. These efforts will also enhance the Republic of the Congo's development and elevate its global standing, he added.- The report on Wang's meeting with Jean-Claude Gakosso says that the two sides pledged to implement the outcomes of FOCAC. Wang -said that it has long been a tradition for China's foreign minister to make Africa the destination of the first overseas trip each year. The longstanding tradition, which underscores China's enduring solidarity and cooperation with Africa, is the cornerstone of China's foreign policy and a firm strategic choice. He added that regardless of changes in the international landscape, China will remain committed to deepening its relations and cooperation with Africa. Describing the Republic of the Congo as a steadfast friend of China, Wang said that the two countries have shared an unbreakable bond for more than 60 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties, which is characterized by consistent mutual understanding and support through challenges… As co-chair of the FOCAC, the Republic of the Congo reflects the high-level partnership between the two nations and embodies the aspirations of the African continent, Wang said, expressing his confidence in the Republic of the Congo's active fulfillment of its responsibilities as chair, contributing to the implementation of the FOCAC Beijing Summit's outcomes and advancing China-Africa cooperation. These efforts, Wang added, will not only strengthen the Republic of the Congo's development but also enhance its international influence. Wang also reaffirmed China's commitment to working with African nations toward building an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era.- As per Xinhua, -Gakosso emphasized that the two nations have forged a unique and enduring bond, making their relationship a model for international relations. He attributed this success to their shared dedication to safeguarding global peace, upholding international justice, and pursuing common development…Gakosso reaffirmed the Republic of the Congo's unwavering support for the one-China principle and China's efforts to achieve national reunification, stressing that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. He also voiced support for the Belt and Road Initiative and China's three global initiatives, namely the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative, and expects to learn from China's governance experience.- Second, Wang met with Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno on Wednesday. Mahamat reportedly said that -Xi is a visionary leader, steering China toward remarkable economic achievements and a pivotal role on the global stage…China's cooperation with Africa has always been based on mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit, yielding fruitful results, he said. He also expressed gratitude to China for its enduring support for Africa's development, particularly Chad's progress. China is Chad's important strategic partner and a reliable friend, with their bilateral relations serving as a model of mutual respect and win-win cooperation, Mahamat said. Chad firmly supports China's efforts to safeguard its territorial integrity and achieve national unity while opposing interference in its internal affairs, he stressed. China is committed to upholding global fairness and justice, playing a constructive role in addressing key international issues, the Chadian president said, noting that Chad is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with China to uphold shared positions and protect common interests.- Xinhua adds: -China has always advocated that all countries, big or small, strong or weak, are equal, Wang said, noting that China opposes all forms of hegemony, bullying, and unilateralism. He expressed China's willingness to strengthen strategic coordination with Chad and continue to provide steadfast mutual support. China appreciates Chad's efforts in staying independent and self-reliant, and pursuing development and revitalization that suits its national conditions and is ready to work with Chad to actively implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state and the outcomes of the FOCAC Beijing Summit, Wang said.

Tibet Quake - Elderly Care Services Guideline - Tasks to Build a Unified National Market - Guideline for Government Investment Funds - Japanese Politi...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, January 8, 2025. Page 1: The lead report on the page is about Xi Jinping's instructions following the 6.8-magnitude earthquake that hit Shigatse in Tibet yesterday. Xi -ordered all-out rescue efforts to save lives and minimize casualties.- Xinhua adds that he called for -utmost efforts to carry out search and rescue and provide medical treatment for the injured. He also urged efforts to prevent secondary disasters, properly resettle affected residents, and handle the aftermath effectively. It is essential to strengthen earthquake monitoring and early warning, promptly allocate disaster relief supplies, expedite the repair of damaged infrastructure, ensure the basic needs of residents are met, and guarantee a safe and warm winter for all-. In addition, Li Qiang issued instructions. Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing is leading officials in Tibet, it seems. The Office of the State Council's Earthquake Relief Headquarters and the Ministry of Emergency Management have launched the national earthquake level 3 emergency response. Of course, the story says nothing about the impact of the earthquake or casualties. As per reports, the death toll is at around 126. If you are interested in the official details of the emergency response, there's a report that provides those. Next, there's a commentary drawing from Xi's speech at the CCDI plenary. Some key excerpts: -Over the past year, ‘tigers' have been targeted without exception, while ‘flies' and ‘ants' (minor corrupt officials) have also been punished, with more than 700,000 cases of unhealthy practices and corruption among the masses being investigated and dealt with. Since the new era, the Party, military, and public have experienced unprecedented cohesion and unity; one important reason is that our Party has always punished corruption with a zero-tolerance attitude. ，--，--，70。，，. And then we have a new slogan: -In his important speech, General Secretary Xi Jinping made encapsulated the Party's achievements as the ‘two historical initiatives' (): we secured the historical initiative to ensure the Party does not deteriorate, change colour, or change flavour, and won the historical initiative for the Party to unite and lead the entire people in the joint endeavor of building a strong nation and achieving national rejuvenation-. --：-、、，、.- The article reiterates that the current situation of the fight against corruption remains severe and complex, and the task of eradicating the soil and conditions that breed corruption is still arduous. The key point is to -dispel the ideological fog- so that one can -further build consensus and enhance the awareness of action.- ，，。，，。，。，，、。 The next bit says that -corruption and power often go hand in hand, which makes the fight against corruption a long-term historical process. As long as the soil and conditions that breed corruption exist, the fight against corruption will remain ongoing … deeply analyzing the corrupt elements investigated and dealt with since the 20th Party Congress shows that the vast majority of their disciplinary violations and illegal behaviors continued from before the 18th Party Congress and till after the 20th Party Congress, indicating both new and residual corruption. With new anti-corruption technologies, tools, and methods, corrupt officials are finding it increasingly difficult to hide. Corruption undermines fairness and justice, disrupts the business environment, and disturbs economic order. Only by resolutely removing this malignant tumor can we enable cadres to work cleanly and boldly and allow various economic actors to innovate and develop with confidence. ，，。，。，，，。、、，。、、。，、，. The next paragraph discusses what Xi means when he says that combating corruption requires adopting a historical perspective. -It means learning lessons from history, grasping the core values from the Party's century-long struggle, and understanding that to remain true to its original mission, the Party must eliminate corruption—the greatest threat. From a strategic perspective, we are in the critical period of China's modernisation construction, with the domestic and international environments undergoing profound and extensive changes, only by unswervingly combating corruption and ensuring the Party health, advanced nature, and purity can we steadily and successfully follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and remain invincible amid the profound changes unseen in a century. For Party members and cadres, when faced with temptations and enticements, they must reflect on the Party's revolutionary ideals, think about the countless revolutionary ancestors who have sacrificed their lives and shed their blood, the weight of the Party and people in their hearts, think about the weight of the party and the people in their hearts, think about the consequences and harm of corruption, and think about the different fates of Marxist parties around the world. Only by rectifying their ideological roots and clearing the muddied waters, they can truly stay steady, maintain their integrity, and always uphold the political character of a Communist Party member.- ：-，、，。-？，，，。，，，，、，，。，、，，、，，，。、，、，. The piece ends by calling on the Party to never slacken or ease up in what is a tough, protracted, and comprehensive battle against corruption. Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, the full guidelines on Deepening the Reform and Development of Elderly Care Services is published in the paper. As per the document, the main goals are: by 2029, the elderly care service network will be basically established, service capabilities and levels will be significantly enhanced, significant progress will be made in expanding capacity, improving quality and increasing efficiency, and the supply of basic elderly care services will be continuously optimized; by 2035, the elderly care service network will be more complete, service supply and demand will be more coordinated and adapted, all elderly people will enjoy basic elderly care services, and an elderly care service system suitable for my country's national conditions will be mature and established. ：2029，，，，；2035，，，，. I am not detailing the full document, but Xinhua reports: -According to the guidelines, basic elderly care services consist of material assistance, nursing, and caregiving services, among others. They are provided directly by the government or by parties supported by the government. The guidelines noted that the system should follow the principles of meeting essential needs and be universally accessible. In the meantime, the system should also allow families with financial difficulties to be supported in elderly care and ensure all institutional resources regarding elderly care are optimized and integrated. The guidelines listed five key aspects where more work should be done. They include forming and implementing a list of elderly care services, establishing an active response mechanism for providing accurate services, enhancing the mechanism that ensures sound elderly care services, improving service capacity, and making such services more accessible.- China Daily's report says: -The government will pay more attention to the nursing and care work of elderly people living in countryside or rural areas, especially those at older elderly, those who lost their self-care ability or with disabilities. Supervision over elderly care service companies or nursing houses will be further tightened, to make sure these companies and nursing house operators have proper fee-charging and caring behaviors. According to the guidelines, the government will encourage foreign companies to invest in the domestic pension industries by giving them some preferential treatment. The government also encourages companies to develop and promote products for the elderly and enrich their services to the elderly, aiming for a prosperous silver economy. The government will cultivate more talent for the elderly care industry by optimizing the nursing workers' evaluation system and setting up pioneer training programs for nursing workers at designated vocational schools, according to the guidelines. Also, the nation will channel resources and investment into technological programs on elderly care services such as humanoid robots and artificial intelligence. The State-level elderly care service information platform will be optimized to better balance the market's supplies and the elderly's needs.- This bit might be useful for businesses: -Actively cultivate specialized service organizations, and encourage communities, domestic service providers, Internet platform enterprises, and others to offer diverse door-to-door services such as meal assistance, bathing assistance, cleaning assistance, mobility assistance, medical assistance, and emergency assistance for the elderly, to better meet the needs of home-based care services. Accelerate the construction of elderly-friendly housing, promote home modifications for aging, support the installation of elevators in old residential communities, and strengthen the construction of barrier-free environments.- ，、、、、、、，。，，，. -Encourage social forces to newly build or renovate and expand elderly care service facilities, support expanding high-quality institutional elderly care service supply through methods such as public construction and private operation. Fully utilize elderly care institutions' roles in technical innovation demonstration, service skills training, equipment promotion and application, promote professional services extending to homes and communities.- ，。、、，. Take the development of rural elderly care services as an important part of implementing the rural revitalization strategy, and include rural elderly care service facilities in the land space planning or village planning at the township level. ，. Guide urban elderly care service institutions to operate rural elderly care service facilities and promote the balanced development of urban and rural elderly care services. ，. Encourage state-owned enterprises and public institutions to revitalize idle assets to carry out elderly care services. For those implementing entrusted operations, the lease term shall be determined based on the principle of stable operational expectations; if the operator makes significant investments, the lease term may be appropriately extended. 、，，；，. Encourage foreign investment in the domestic elderly care service industry and grant it national treatment. Vigorously develop the silver economy, strengthen the research, development, and promotion of products for the elderly, enrich elderly care service scenarios, and unlock the consumption potential of elderly care. Develop the residential tourism elderly care market, adapt to local conditions to develop new formats such as wellness-oriented residential tourism, and promote the construction of residential tourism elderly care destinations. 。，，，。，，. Another point later worth noting, since it can be part of the common prosperity agenda: -Encourage supporting the provision of elderly care services through the establishment of charitable trusts and social donations.- 、.

The report says that the guidelines put forward 25 measures across 7 areas. It calls for the -operation of government investment funds in accordance with the principles of marketisation, rule of law, and specialisation, developing patient capital, and focusing on achieving practical results. Reasonably coordinate the layout of funds to prevent homogeneous competition and the crowding-out effect on social capital. Improve the responsibility mechanism with aligned rights and obligations and compatible incentives and constraints, to promote the formation of a high-quality development pattern for government investment funds with moderate scale, reasonable layout, standardised operation, scientific efficiency, and controllable risks.- 《》，，、，，、、，，。，。、，、、、、. The article then makes seven points: First, identify the correct positioning to better serve the overall development of the country. Focus on major strategies, key areas, and weak links where the market cannot fully play its role, attract and drive more social capital, support the construction of a modern industrial system, and accelerate the cultivation of new productive forces. Leverage the role of funds as long-term and patient capital for cross-cycle and counter-cyclical adjustments. Second, improve the tiered and categorized management mechanism. Specify tiered management requirements for fund establishment, refine differentiated management mechanisms for different types of funds, and standardize budget management for various government investments. Third, strengthen coordination and optimize fund allocation. Achieve synergy between national-level and local-level funds, with provincial governments enhancing the overall management of funds within their regions. Fourth, improve the level of professional and market-oriented fund operations. Standardize fund operation management, optimize fund investment methods, and fully utilize the role of fund managers. Enhance fund performance management, establish and improve an error-tolerance mechanism, and optimize a full-chain and life-cycle assessment system that avoids relying on a single project or a single year's profit and loss as the basis for assessment, and create a good atmosphere that encourages innovation and tolerates failure. Optimize the fund development environment, emphasize positive incentive policies, and boost market investment confidence. Fifth, optimize the exit mechanism to promote a virtuous investment cycle. Broaden fund exit channels, encourage the development of private equity secondary market funds, mergers and acquisitions funds, etc., improve the multi-level capital market system, and explore ways to simplify the project exit process. Sixth, strengthen internal control construction to prevent and resolve risks. Improve the risk prevention and control system and enforce financial discipline. Seventh, strengthen organizational guarantees. Adhere to and strengthen the leadership of the Party, strengthen departmental coordination, and standardize regulatory behavior. ，。、，，，。、。。，，。，。，。。，，。，，、，，、。，，。，。，、，，。，。，。。，，.

Some data from Xinhua English: -Key measures outlined in the guideline include unifying the underlying institutions and rules of the market, improving the high-standard market infrastructure connectivity, building a unified market for factors and resources, advancing the high-standard integration of goods and services markets, enhancing fair and unified regulation, and curbing unfair market competition and improper intervention.- It adds: -Liu Rihong, an official from the Research Office of the State Council, noted that the relatively weak domestic demand, especially in consumption, is a vital bottleneck for economic circulation. Liu emphasized that building a unified national market is essential to unleashing domestic demand potential, facilitating the efficient flow of goods and factors, improving resource allocation, and fully harnessing the market's industrial and demand advantages. The guideline aims to tackle these challenges by drawing firm -red lines- to eliminate local protectionism, regional barriers, and unfair practices in market access, bidding and government procurement, NDRC official Wang Shancheng told a press conference on Tuesday. Local authorities are prohibited from using administrative or penal measures to intervene in economic disputes or infringe on business rights illegally, the guideline said, adding that unlawful cross-jurisdictional law enforcement or administration are also banned. It stated that the cross-regional flow of goods and factors must not be restricted, and bidding and government procurement should avoid limiting or designating specific patents, trademarks, brands, parts, origins or suppliers. The document also calls for establishing a unified national social security public service platform, allowing people to access social security in the locality where they work even if they do not hold local residency. Wang said work is underway to revise and publish a new negative list for market access to further optimize market access management.- The PD report says that Wang also told reporters that the Guidelines put forward specific requirements and goals from three perspectives: required to do, prohibited from doing and encouraged to do. Under required to do, Wang placed the following: Breaking bottlenecks in regional transportation infrastructure, including highways and waterways Unification of data collection standards, formats and fields between different regulatory departments so as to address the problem of inconsistent regulatory standards in various regions Addressing inconsistencies in government service standards Under prohibited from doing, Wang talked about the -red lines- that I have mentioned above. In the context of encouraged actions, Wang said: -Different regions have different resource endowments. Regions with good basic conditions and high marketization can benchmark higher standards to accelerate the construction of unified markets in their regions and across regions… Wang said that the guidelines ‘encourage qualified regions to carry out regional market integration, promoting the strengthening of communication and coordination of systems, rules and major policies in key areas, and increasing the exploration of cost sharing and benefit sharing in regional cooperation'.- -，、。-，《》-，，-. For future work, Wang said: We will revise and issue the Negative List for Market Access (2025 Edition), further reduce the items on the list, and optimise market access management. We will improve the management system for business entity registration and improve the efficiency of enterprise relocation services. We will build a unified urban and rural construction land market, improve the basic system to promote the standardised development of the capital market, accelerate the formation of a unified and interconnected national technology trading network, cultivate a national integrated data market, and accelerate the construction of a unified national power market system. We will further promote the mutual recognition of medical examination and inspection results, returns and exchanges in different places and stores, withdrawals from housing provident funds in different places, and settlements of medical insurance accounts in different places. We will continuously improve the high-standard connectivity of market facilities. This entails improving the comprehensive three-dimensional transportation network. Going forward. new Implementation Measures for the Fair Competition Review Regulations shall be issued to further refine the review standards, consolidate the review responsibilities, and maintain a unified fair competition system. Clean up and abolish various regulations and practices that hinder the national unified market and fair competition. Break down market access barriers that business entities strongly reflect on and that the masses closely follow. Advance special rectification in areas such as bidding and tendering, enterprise relocation. Improve the long-term mechanism for transferring, investigating and rectifying clues to problems that violate the unified large market, and report typical cases in due time. The Ministry of Commerce will focus on improving foreign investment market access, optimising the business environment, connecting with international high-standard economic and trade rules, and accelerating the integration of domestic and foreign trade. ，。。《（2025）》，，。，。，。，，、，，。、、、。，。-、、、、。，，。-。----，。，，。-2024，《》，，7299。-，《》，，，。。、。、。，。、。，--、--、、，-，。- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: A couple of reports to note.

Xi's Anti-Corruption Warning at CCDI Plenary - Qu Qingshan on Zunyi Conference Anniversary & the Importance of Xi as Core - National Data Infrastructu...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Tuesday, January 7, 2025. The lead story covers Xi Jinping's speech at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CCDI of the CPC on Monday. Xi -emphasized that since the new era, the intensity of advancing comprehensive and strict Party governance and the fight against corruption has been unprecedented, with results being obvious to all. It is necessary to always maintain tenacious perseverance that the fight against corruption is always ongoing, maintain strategic determination and sustain a high-pressure stance, move forward without pausing for a single step or retreating even half a step. Efforts must be made to integrate the goals of ensuring that officials dare not be corrupt, cannot be corrupt, and do not want to engage in corruption, resolutely winning this tough, protracted, and comprehensive battle against corruption.- ，，，。，，、，、、，、、. Xi Jinping pointed out that in 2024, the Central Committee of the Party adhered to leading the social revolution through the Party's self-revolution, consistently advancing the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party, and achieving new progress and results. The entire Party has gained a clearer understanding and stronger determination regarding the major issue of self-revolution. Solid efforts have been made in carrying out the Party discipline education campaign, with all Party members' awareness of abiding by rules and discipline having been significantly enhanced; the fight against corruption has been intensified, eradicating the soil and conditions that breed corruption; deeply carried out concentrated rectification of unhealthy trends and corruption problems around the masses, addressing a large batch of prominent problems strongly reflected by the masses; the governance of the Party through systems and regulations has been further advanced, improving the Party's ability to lead the fight against corruption and promote comprehensive and strict governance. ，2024，，，。、；，；，；，；、，、. Xi Jinping emphasized that corruption is the greatest threat facing our Party, and the anti-corruption campaign is the most thorough form of self-revolution. In the new era, facing prominent problems in Party conduct, clean governance construction and anti-corruption struggle within the Party, we have adhered to the principles of resolutely opposing corruption wherever it exists and punishing corruption wherever it arises, continuously purifying the cadre ranks, safeguarding the Party's image, consolidating the red country, securing the historical initiative to ensure the Party does not deteriorate, change color, or change flavor, and winning the historical initiative for the Party to unite and lead the entire people in the joint endeavor of building a strong nation and achieving national rejuvenation. ，，。，，、，，，，、、，、. Xi Jinping pointed out that the current situation of the fight against corruption remains grim and complex. The existing corruption has not yet been eliminated, new cases continue to occur, and the task of eradicating the soil and conditions that breed corruption remains arduous and heavy. Understanding the fight against corruption requires adopting a historical perspective and a strategic vision, focusing on achieving the Party's mission and tasks. The fight against corruption must remain unswerving; any hesitation and wavering, laxity and softness, or abandoning midway would constitute subversive mistakes. It is necessary to resolutely clarify various misconceptions, dispel ideological confusion, and further strengthen the determination and confidence in the fight against corruption. ，。，，。，、，。，、，。，，. He then called for maintaining the -spirit of reform and strict standards- for Party governance in the new era, and -ensure the implementation of the arrangements of the 20th Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee, ensure that the Party always remains the strong leadership core of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and promote the steady and long-term development of Chinese-style modernization.- ，，，，，，. Xi Jinping pointed out that it is necessary to promote the specificity, precision and normalization of political supervision. Maintaining a high degree of alignment/consistency with the Party Central Committee must be reflected in both words and actions. In terms of ideology, it is necessary to unremittingly strengthen the Party's innovative theoretical armament, accurately grasp the Party Central Committee's goals, positioning and deployment requirements for reform and development in this region, department and domain, ensuring unity in thought and consistency in direction. Politically, it is necessary to adhere to the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, strictly enforce political discipline and political rules, and absolutely forbid engaging in the ‘seven types of conduct' to ensure consistency between words and actions, with orders being followed and prohibitions strictly observed. In terms of actions, it is necessary to adhere to making the implementation of the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee the focus of political supervision, and work together to drive reform breakthroughs and promote high-quality development. ，、、。。，，，、。，，，--，、。，，、. Xi Jinping emphasised that strengthening the Party's discipline construction is a regular task and that it is necessary to guide Party members and cadres to transform external discipline into self-discipline, internalising it as daily and unconscious standards of behavior. A regularised and long-term discipline education mechanism should be established, ensuring that discipline education runs through the entire growth cycle of cadres and is integrated into the whole process of organizational management. Strictly enforce the Party's discipline, accurately apply the ‘four forms', adhere to seeking truth from facts, neither being unjust or indulgent, identify and address problems early when they are nascent, prevent minor issues from growing, and unify strict management and supervision with encouragement of responsibility, enabling cadres to innovate reforms and pursue achievements while complying with regulations and discipline. ，，、，。，、。，--，、，、，，、。 Xi Jinping pointed out that we must deeply promote the simultaneous investigation and treatment of both formalism and corruption. Always adhere to zero tolerance, treat the eight-point central regulations as iron rules and hard limits, seriously investigate and punish the ‘four winds' problems that defy discipline and undergo hidden mutations, supervise Party members and cadres to resolutely oppose privileged thinking and phenomena, and firmly establish correct views of power, performance, and career. Always maintain high-pressure posture against corruption, focus on grasping and investigating key problems, key areas, and key targets, deepen the simultaneous investigation of both taking and giving bribes, and resolutely eliminate systemic corruption risks and hidden dangers. Enhance the effectiveness of using cases to promote reform and governance, promote the improvement of the constraints and supervision mechanisms for the allocation and operation of power, and enrich effective methods for preventing and controlling new types of corruption and hidden corruption. Adhere to the integration of rectifying conduct, enforcing discipline, and fighting corruption, use ‘joint investigation' to severely punish intertwined problems of unhealthy work styles and corruption, use ‘joint treatment' to eliminate common roots of unhealthy work styles and corruption.- ，。，、，、--，、，、、。，、、、，，。，，。，--，--. Xi Jinping emphasized it is necessary to strengthen the primary responsibility and supervisory responsibility for comprehensively governing the Party with strict discipline. The Party committee must take the initiative to grasp and manage, the discipline inspection commission must carry out its specialized supervisory duties well, focus on its main responsibilities, and perform its primary tasks. All responsible entities must know their responsibilities, take responsibility, and fulfill their duties. It is necessary to optimize the responsibility implementation and evaluation mechanisms, and precisely and scientifically hold accountable those who fail in their duties and responsibilities. ，。、，，、，、、。，. Xi Jinping pointed out that it is necessary to continue to promote the extension of comprehensive and strict Party governance to the grassroots level. Party committees at all levels, especially municipal and county Party committees, should take the rectification of unhealthy practices and corruption around the masses as an important and routine task, making it tangible and perceptible to the people. We must deepen the reform of the grassroots supervision system and mechanism, combine discipline inspection and supervision with grassroots inspections, and coordinate supervision from all aspects. Implement a long-term mechanism to reduce the burden on the grassroots by rectifying formalism, allowing grassroots cadres to have more energy to focus on implementation. ，。，。，、。，. Xi Jinping emphasized that the disciplinary inspection and supervision organs are an important force in advancing the Party's self-revolution, and that the Party and the people have full trust and high expectations for this team. We must deepen the reform of the disciplinary inspection and supervision system, adhere to combining authorization and control of power, and put power in the cage of institutional regulations. We must focus on strengthening the standardization, legalization and regularization of discipline inspection and supervision work, and continuously improve the ability to rectify conduct, ensure discipline and fight corruption. We must consolidate and expand the results of the thematic education campaign and education rectification, adhere to ‘those who forge iron must themselves be strong', strengthen strict management and supervision, build an iron army of disciplinary inspection and supervision that is loyal, clean, responsible, and dares to struggle and is good at struggle. ，，、。，，。，。，，，、. In his remarks, Li Xi said that Xi's speech -with a lofty historical perspective, deeply grasped the basic laws of the anti-corruption struggle, deeply analyzed the current situation of the anti-corruption struggle, put forward clear requirements for resolutely fighting the tough, protracted, and comprehensive battle against corruption, and made strategic arrangements for deepening the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party.- The speech was -far-sighted, profound, confronted problems directly, and was striking in clarity/would arouse even the apathetic-. -It has provided important guidance for deepening the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party and the fight against corruption.- He added: It is necessary to thoroughly study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech, deeply understand the decisive significance of the Two Establishments, enhance the four consciousnesses, strengthen the four self-confidences, and achieve the Two Safeguards, strengthen confidence, dare to struggle, conscientiously perform the political responsibility of comprehensive and strictly Party governance, and promote the integration of the goals of ensuring that officials dare not be corrupt, cannot be corrupt, and do not want to engage in corruption, and unswervingly advance the anti-corruption struggle in depth. ，，，，，、、，。、、、，。，--，--、--、--，、，，、、，.

The NPC of China is willing to work with the Congress of Peru to strengthen exchanges between high-level officials, special committees, bilateral friendship groups and more, deepen mutual learning on governance experience, enhance mutual understanding and friendship, and support each other in pursuing development paths suited to their respective national conditions, he said. Chancay port in Peru, a landmark China-Peru cooperation project, will help promote the high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road between China and Peru as well as China and Latin America, Zhao said, adding that it is hoped that the Congress of Peru will continue to support the construction of the port. ‘China and Peru have carried out fruitful cooperation in fields such as energy, mining, infrastructure construction and communications, and are actively exploring ways to expand cooperation on digital economy, green development and artificial intelligence. It is hoped that the legislatures of the two countries will jointly create a sound legal environment for China-Peru practical cooperation,' Zhao said.- The report on Wang's meeting with him says: Wang -said China is willing to make joint efforts with Peru to push for more achievements in China-Peru relations and bring more benefits to the two peoples, and the CPPCC is ready to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with Peru to make contributions to promoting the joint advance of the two countries on the road of national modernization.- Subscribe now Page 2: There's a report on the new guidelines for the construction of national data infrastructure.

Xinhua reports: -Indonesia, as a major developing country and an important force in the Global South, highly recognizes the BRICS spirit and has taken an active part in ‘BRICS Plus' cooperation. The spokesperson said Indonesia's official entry into BRICS serves the common interests of BRICS countries and the Global South, adding that ‘we believe that Indonesia will make active contribution to the development of BRICS.'

Xinhua reports: -Despite the geographical distance, the bond between China and Africa has remained strong, Wang said. The China-Africa relationship has withstood the test of changing global circumstances and is showing new promising prospects, he said, stressing that China remains a trustworthy partner for Africa, consistently prioritizing Africa in its overall diplomatic strategy. For 35 years, Chinese foreign ministers have made Africa the destination of their first overseas visit of each year, a tradition that reflects China's unwavering commitment, Wang said, adding that this tradition will continue because strengthening China-Africa cooperation is more crucial than ever for the world, and their joint development symbolizes the rise of the Global South and the growing influence of justice. Namibia, an important member of the African family, is also a comprehensive strategic cooperation partner of China, he noted. At the Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) held in Beijing last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed 10 partnership action plans to jointly advance modernization and announced that the overall characterization of China-Africa relations was elevated to an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era. This has charted the course for the future development of China-Africa relations, Wang said, noting that China is ready to work with Namibia to implement the 10 partnership action plans, helping Namibia accelerate its modernization process. Acknowledging Namibia's unique resources and vast development potential, Wang said that the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) Party of Namibia has adopted a people-centered governance philosophy and guided the country along a development path suited to its national conditions. China is willing to strengthen exchanges on governance with Namibia and deepen cooperation in various fields to achieve common development, Wang said.- Apart from reportedly supporting the -one-China principle-, Mbumba also said that -Namibia supports the three global initiatives proposed by Xi, namely the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, and looks forward to continued mutual support and collaboration with China in international and regional affairs to safeguard shared interests.- Wang also met with President-elect Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah.

Qu reminds us that the conference was a -vital turning point ()- in the Party's history and process. Qu writes that the CCP's history during the New Democratic Revolution period lasted for 28 years. This period can be divided into two halves of 14 years each, with the Zunyi Conference lying in the middle. In the first 14 years, our Party made one right-leaning mistake and three ‘left-leaning' mistakes, leading to two major setbacks in the Chinese revolution: one being the failure of the Great Revolution and the other being the failure of the fifth counter-'encirclement and suppression' campaign in the Central Revolutionary Base, forcing the Red Army to undertake a strategic retreat. In the latter 14 years, starting from the Zunyi Conference, our Party rose again, united and led the people to overcome one difficulty after another and triumph over one challenge after another. First, it achieved victory in the Long March, survived the most difficult period, and pioneered a new phase of the Chinese revolution. Subsequently, it successively achieved victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, overthrew the ‘three mountains' of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic-capitalism, and finally established the People's Republic of China, achieving national independence and people's liberation, inaugurating a new era in Chinese historical development. 28，28，1414。14，、--，，，--，；14，，，、，，，，、，、、，，、，. Qu adds: So, why did such a tremendous historical transformation occur before and after the Zunyi Conference? What are its profound historical reasons and internal logic? Regarding this, the ‘Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on the Major Achievements and Historical Experience of the Party over the Past Century' adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Party made a profound summary: The Zunyi Conference ensured that -Comrade Mao Zedong was confirmed as the de facto leader of the Central Committee and the Red Army. The meeting laid the groundwork for establishing the leading position within the Central Committee of the correct Marxist line chiefly represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, as well as for the formation of the first generation of the central collective leadership with Comrade Mao Zedong at its core. The meeting opened a new stage in which the Party would act on its own initiative to address practical problems concerning the Chinese revolution, and saved the Party, the Red Army, and the Chinese revolution at a moment of greatest peril.- ，？？，《》，：-，，，-. And then he writes this: -The history of the Party shows that the issue of having a core is of paramount importance. The core is the banner, the core is the direction, and the core is the strength. Marxism tells us that the core arises from practice, the core represents the people, the core guides the way forward, and the core is the choice of history and the people.- ，，，，。，，，，. -The development of history has its inherent logic and essential laws. The materialist conception of history holds that the masses create history. Great figures embody the will of the people and are faithful representatives of the fundamental interests of the masses. Great figures do not appear out of thin air, but are produced in practice and are the product of history and the times. It is no accident that Comrade Mao Zedong became the core of the first generation of the central leadership of our Party. During the Great Revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong conducted a profound analysis of the structure of Chinese society and the class situation and engaged in deep thought on issues such as the nature, targets, tasks, and driving forces of the Chinese revolution. After the failure of the Great Revolution, he thoroughly summarized the experiences and lessons of the revolutionary struggle, proposing the idea that ‘political power grows out of the barrel of a gun'; organized and launched the Autumn Harvest Uprising in the border regions of Hunan and Jiangxi and led the uprising forces to Jinggangshan, where he directed the establishment of China's first rural revolutionary base. This laid the foundation for the correct revolutionary path of encircling the cities from the countryside and seizing power through armed struggle. He emphasized that the ‘textbooks' of Marxism must be studied, but must be combined with China's actual conditions. He proposed, ‘what is the true iron bastion? It is the masses, it is the millions of masses who sincerely support the revolution.' Comrade Mao Zedong's profound analytical power of China's revolutionary situation, deep insight into historical development trends, and scientific judgment of the direction of the era's progress have been tested by practice and verified by history. 。，。，。，，。，。，，、、。，，--，，，，、。，-‘'，。-，-？，。-、、，. And then Qu writes: -The materialist view of history also holds that every person has a certain role in the development of history, but the nature and magnitude of their role differ. Great figures usually stand higher and see farther than ordinary people, are able to concentrate collective wisdom, listen to the voice of the people, conform to the trends of the times, grasp the laws of history, propose and solve major historical tasks, and guide the direction of historical progress. Therefore, their role is unique and special, and they can play an accelerating and promoting role in the development of history.- ，，、。、，，，，，，，、，. The examples he gives for this are the success of Mao's strategies through the first to third anti-encirclement and suppression campaigns in the Central Revolutionary Base Area. He argues that Zhou Enlai and Zhu De sustained Mao's tactics during the fourth campaign too, and achieved victory. But Li De or Otto Braun and others deviated from these during the fifth campaign and thus suffered defeat. Consequently, -due to the erroneous leadership of ‘left' dogmatism- several revolutionary bases were lost. The lessons from the failure of the fifth counter-encirclement and suppression campaign were painfully profound! At the critical juncture and key moment of historical transition, the Party chose Mao Zedong, the Red Army chose Mao Zedong, the Chinese revolution chose Mao Zedong, and history and the people chose Mao Zedong. This chapter of history concerning the Party and the Red Army must not be forgotten but should be remembered forever! --！，，，，。，，! He then talks about 2012, with the 18th Party Congress being historic, and marking a new historical orientation for the Party. In other words, -after long-term efforts, socialism with Chinese characteristics entered a new era.- -Since the beginning of the new era, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, with a great spirit of historical initiative, immense political courage, and a strong sense of responsibility, coordinated the domestic and international situations, implemented the Party's basic theories, line, and strategies, and taken charge of the great struggle, the great project, the great cause, and the great dream, adhered to the general principle of seeking progress while maintaining stability, issued a series of major policies, launched a series of major initiatives, advanced a series of major works, overcome a series of major risks and challenges, solved many tough problems that were long on the agenda but never resolved and accomplished many things that were wanted but never got done, and promoted historic achievements and historic shifts in the cause of the Party and the country.- 2012。，。。：，。，，、、，，、、，、、、，，，，，，，，、. -In the practice of governing the country, General Secretary Xi Jinping, with the magnificent spirit, foresight, and grand strategy of a Marxist statesman, thinker, and strategist, has calmly handled various complex situations, effectively responded to various domestic and foreign risks and challenges, fully demonstrated outstanding political wisdom, strong strategic determination, intense mission responsibility, deep feelings for the people, and superior leadership skills, winning the heartfelt support of the entire Party, military, and people of all ethnic groups, receiving high praise from the international community, becoming the widely supported and well-deserved core of the Party, people's leader, and commander-in-chief of the military.- ，、、、、，，，、、、、，，，、、、. He then quotes the third history resolution again, saying: -The Party has established Comrade Xi Jinping's core position on the Party Central Committee and in the Party as a whole, and defined the guiding role of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. This reflects the common will of the Party, the armed forces, and Chinese people of all ethnic groups, and is of decisive significance for advancing the cause of the Party and the country in the new era and for driving forward the historic process of national rejuvenation.- He also doubles down on the Two Establishments as the -greatest certainty, confidence and guarantee for the Party and the people to deal with all uncertainties.- Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Xinhua Commentary on Biden Blocking Nippon Steel Deal - Sun Zhuangzhi on 'Window of Opportunity' for Ukraine Deal - Shen Yi: BRICS Expansion Allows Gl...	The People's Daily today was rather uninteresting. The front page had a feature previewing the CCDI plenary session, which begins today. I am going to wait for reporting from the session to get something substantive to cover. In the meantime, I thought I'd highlight three interesting pieces that I read in Chinese media today. First, there's a Xinhua commentary on the Biden administration's decision to block Nippon Steel's acquisition of US Steel. It argues that the move is another example of the US -putting political considerations above economic logic and generalising the concept of ‘national security' to practice protectionism.- ，、--. The commentary says: -Tetsuo Kotani, a professor at Meikai University in Japan, argues that the US government's claim of security risks is merely a pretext. Hidetoshi Tashiro, chief economist at Infinity LLC., says that the essence of this acquisition is an ‘economic action' by Nippon Steel aimed at maximizing profits, while the US obstruction is entirely driven by ‘political considerations'. ‘From a historical perspective, this is yet another instance of the US implementing trade protectionist measures to suppress Japan'. In recent years, the US has been obsessed with wielding the ‘tariff stick', continuously escalating unilateral sanctions, pursuing a ‘small yard, high fence' approach and ‘decoupling and breaking chains'. From the slogan of ‘America First' to the signing and implementation of the ‘Inflation Reduction Act' and ‘CHIPS and Science Act', to the unlimited expansion of the concept of ‘national security' ... the US has infused protectionism into an increasing number of industries.- ，。，--，--。-，。-，--，，----。--《》《》，--……. -Any enterprise or country that threatens America's hegemonic position can become a target of the US hunt, and even allies are not immune. The US signed the Plaza Accord with Japan using coercion. This dealt a heavy blow to Japan's economic vitality and led Japan to experience the ‘lost 30 years'; it adopted ‘long-arm jurisdiction' and other means to ‘dismember' the French manufacturing firm Alstom, which eventually led to its main power business being acquired by its American competitor General Electric; it imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum products from the European Union and other countries and regions; it restricted the free trade of ASML, a Dutch lithography giant, and included more foreign companies in the export control ‘Entity List' ... such unilateral and protectionist measures disrupt the normal operation of global industrial and supply chains, seriously infringe upon enterprises' legitimate rights and interests, destroy the fairness and stability of international economic and trade cooperation, and show none of the free market spirit of openness, inclusiveness, and cooperation that the US preaches to other countries.- ，，。--，，--；----，；；，--……，，，，、、. The commentary adds that this year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the WTO. It says that the US -has become the biggest ‘violator' of WTO rules, with -two-thirds of the WTO's violations caused by the US.- -As a consequence, the US has simply refused to implement the WTO's rulings, paralysing the WTO's Appellate Body. The US approach to international law and international rules is ‘use if it suits, abandon if it doesn't suit', ‘liberalism when prospering and protectionism when facing adversity'; the essence is to seek its own selfish interests. 。、，--：。，，--。-、--，-，. The commentary then says that US Steel's failings are due to -over-protectionism-. It adds: -The decline of the US steel industry from prosperity is deeply connected to the US economy's development path of ‘moving away from the real towards the virtual', while the long-term trade protection policies implemented to cope with overseas competition have led to persistently high domestic steel prices in the US, no improvement in steel mills' profitability, and caused downstream industries like automobiles and construction to pay a heavy price in global competition. Bloomberg reported last year that in the past decade, US protectionist measures related to the steel industry have not prevented the loss of manufacturing jobs, and have rather increased costs in other areas of the US economy, reducing industry competitiveness.- ，。10，，，？，。--，，，，、。，，，，. (Note: The emphasis on real to virtual is as much a comment about the US economy as it is a message domestically. One of the primary concerns articulated by Xi Jinping has been about the flow of capital in China to what he calls the virtual and speculative economy.) Towards the end, the article quotes from Nippon Steel and US Steel's joint statement, saying that the Biden administration's decision -sends a chilling message to any company based in a U.S. allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States.- Share Tracking People's Daily Subscribe now Second, Sun Zhuangzhi, Director of the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, discussed the prospect of a deal to end the war in Ukraine. Sun argued there may be a -window of opportunity- to achieve a ceasefire or end the conflict in 2025. He believes -that the goals of both sides have changed. In the past, the goal was to win at all costs, but now it is about not losing, and both sides feel enormous pressure.- Sun argues that the reasons for the change in goals are: First, the immense consumption on the battlefield, with human and material resources being stretched to their limits. For Russia, it is difficult to maintain this wartime economy for an extended period of time. For Ukraine, the continuous large fiscal deficits and the need for more Western aid are pressing issues. If US aid were to stop, it would be a huge problem for Ukraine. Second, there is tremendous political pressure. Both sides realise that fully defeating the other is difficult, but neither can afford to retreat. For the leaders of both countries, compromise would mean total failure, so there is no room for concession. Third, there are huge escalation costs. Both sides understand that escalating the conflict would mean paying an even higher price. So on the one hand, both sides are continuing to test each other's bottom line, and on the other, they have reservations. 3，，，，，。，，，、。，。，，。，。。，。，，。。，。，. Sun adds that for both sides things are already rather bad and it shouldn't get any worse than this. From this perspective, there may be a ‘window of opportunity' to resolve the conflict or achieve a ceasefire; both sides realize that it is actually very difficult to ultimately defeat the other side. ，，，。，--，. -Sun believes that this year, there is a possibility of high-level talks between Russia and the US. Trump will actively strive for this, and Putin has also said he is ready and can meet with Trump anytime, as long as the conditions are appropriate. In addition to Russia-US talks, Russia-EU dialogue is also possible, and Ukraine might even be invited to participate. However, he also pointed out that dialogue does not equate to peace talks. It is difficult for Russia and Ukraine to negotiate face to face and come up with a solution to the conflict. Currently, both sides claim they are open to talks, but the conditions they propose are far apart.- ，。，，，，。，，。，。，。，.

In the first episode, I speak to former Indian National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon about the churn in the world order. You can also access the podcast via my Substack, on Apple Podcasts via Substack or Spotify below. Third, in an article dated January 1, 2025, in the Global Times, Director of the Centre for BRICS Studies at Fudan University, Shen Yi, discussed the evolution of the BRICS with new partners joining. He writes that on January 1, 2025, nine countries, including Belarus, Bolivia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Thailand, Cuba, Uganda, Malaysia and Uzbekistan, officially became BRICS partner countries. Shen adds: This is -another successful strategic practice of the ‘BRICS+' mechanism proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the BRICS Xiamen Summit in 2017. Nine countries from the Global South becoming BRICS partner countries not only reflects the trend of the global economic centre of gravity shifting towards the Global South but also provides an important perspective for understanding the deep driving forces of restructuring of power in the international system.- ...2017-+-。9--，--，. -The concept of BRICS cooperation partners transcends the traditional economic cooperation framework. As representatives of emerging economies and developing countries, the BRICS cooperation mechanism has carried the call for establishing a more equitable international order since its inception, and countries joining this mechanism are regarded as important partners sharing this vision. Partnership not only implies collaboration in economic and financial fields but also includes joint efforts in global governance reform, technological innovation, and social development. The addition of new members enhances BRICS' geopolitical and economic representation, injecting new momentum into the formation of a multipolar world.- 。，，。，、。，，. -The backdrop of BRICS' expansion is the pursuit and desire of the ‘Global South' for a more fair and reasonable international order in the new era. In the past decades, after the end of the Cold War, although the first round of globalisation led by Western countries, stressing on the so-called ‘common values' and ‘rules', did promote economic development, it also made all parties generally realise the intensification of global inequality, as well as Western countries' increasingly apparent lack of sustainable and effective leadership capability. There is a large amount of evidence proving that the international economic system dominated by Western countries is structurally unfair to the Global South countries, including but not limited to insufficient representation of developing countries in decision-making in organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, which objectively puts Global South countries at a long-term disadvantage.- ，--。，，、----，，。，--，（IMF），--. At the same time, the world is increasingly feeling the negative impacts and shocks that can come from the abuse of hegemony by dominant Western countries, especially the structural hegemonic power with dollar hegemony at the core. In sharp contrast, the achievements made by the BRICS countries in their own development and collaborative development, their adherence to and promotion of the multi-polarization of the international system, and the development needs and preferences for participating in international mechanisms faced by Global South countries including BRICS countries. As a result, joining the BRICS mechanism in a flexible and adaptable manner has naturally become a widely recognised and increasingly accepted pragmatic model for global cooperation. ，，。，，，--，。，，、、. -From a practical perspective, against the backdrop of continuously rising traditional geopolitical risks, becoming a BRICS partner country provides Global South countries with a more inclusive, flexible and resilient set of diversified choices. Joining the ‘Greater BRICS' as partner countries not only provides opportunities for economic cooperation, but also creates conditions for developing countries to voice opinions and participate in global governance reform. Through the BRICS platform, the Global South' can break free from the so-called pressure to ‘choose sides' within the traditional geopolitical framework and pursue greater autonomy in a multipolar world.- ，，--、。--，，。，----，. -At the level of development philosophy and pathways, BRICS emphasizes inclusive development, which aligns closely with the development aspirations of many Global South countries. It is reasonable to believe that the inclusion of new members will help BRICS' pragmatic cooperation continuously improve global representation, garnering more support and recognition. At the same time, the addition of new members has infused vitality and diversity into the BRICS cooperation mechanism. This expansion has enhanced BRICS' global influence, significantly strengthening its voice in international affairs. The BRICS mechanism is no longer confined to traditional economic cooperation but is gradually expanding into areas such as international security, technological innovation, and cultural exchange. The nine new partner countries, with their wide geographic distribution and diverse historical and cultural backgrounds, on the one hand, help enhance the global representation of BRICS; on the other hand, the BRICS cooperation mechanism has not adopted Western-style ideological confrontations or bloc divisions. Its advocacy for a multilateral cooperation model avoids zero-sum games between major powers, offering a more inclusive paradigm for international relations. This openness and flexibility encourage more countries to join the BRICS family, collectively advancing reforms in global governance.- ，，--。，，，。，。，。，、。9，，；，。，。，。 Shen then adds: The impact of the BRICS expansion on the international system can be analysed from three aspects. First, it has injected new impetus into international multilateral cooperation. Against the backdrop of an increasingly dysfunctional multilateral system dominated by the West, the BRICS mechanism provides an alternative to bridge the global governance deficit. By promoting multipolar development, the BRICS countries have provided certain possibilities for reshaping the international order. Second, the BRICS cooperation mechanism has initiated internal discussions on healthier operational models and mechanisms for the global financial system beyond the US dollar system. The addition of new members not only enhances the stability of the BRICS currency basket but also supports the advancement of related initiatives. Although this process remains in its early stages, its potential systemic impact cannot be ignored. Finally, the expansion of the BRICS has enhanced the representativeness and fairness of global governance. As a collective action of developing countries and emerging economies, the BRICS mechanism has broken the monopoly of Western countries in rule-making in traditional international institutions and brought a more balanced perspective to global governance. The expansion of the BRICS countries marks the deepening of cooperation among the ‘Global South' countries and the acceleration of the global multi-polarisation process. In the face of various challenges in the current international system, the BRICS mechanism provides a potential cooperation platform. By promoting inclusive development, advocating multilateralism and reforming the global governance system, the BRICS countries and their partners have made important contributions to shaping a more equitable international order. Although this process is constrained by many complex factors, its prospects undoubtedly bring hope for building a multipolar world. 。，。，。，。，，。，。，。，。，，。--。，。、，。，.

US Companies on Export Control & Unreliable Entities Lists - New Center on Building a Community with a Shared Future - 58 Tigers Taken Down in 2024 - ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, January 3, 2025. Page 1: The lead story today is about Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan sending a New Year card in return to representatives of middle school teachers and students in the US State of Washington. Xinhua reports: -In the card, Xi and Peng said the year 2025 marks the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. During the Second World War, China and the United States fought together for peace and justice, and the friendship between the two peoples stood the test of blood and fire and is growing ever stronger, they said. The couple expressed their hope that the youth of China and the United States will continue to participate in China's initiative of inviting 50,000 young Americans to China for exchange and study programs in a five-year span, strengthen exchanges and interactions, enhance mutual understanding, carry forward traditional friendship, and contribute to the development of China-U.S. relations and world peace.- China's Ministry of Commerce didn't get that friendship memo. Although it is not in the paper today, in a first-ever development, Beijing on Thursday put 28 American companies on its export control list. This was done in order to -safeguard national security and interests and fulfil international obligations, including non-proliferation commitments.- As a consequence, -it is prohibited to export dual-use items to the 28 US entities; related export activities currently underway should be stopped immediately. Also, -in exceptional cases where export is deemed necessary, the exporter must apply for approval.- The 28 entities are: 1. General Dynamics 2. L3 L3 Harris Technologies） 3.

In addition, the Ministry placed 10 American companies on its unreliable entities list for selling arms to Taiwan. Xinhua reports that these companies: Will be prohibited from engaging in China-related import or export activities Will be barred from making new investments in China Senior executives of these companies will be banned from entering China The work permits and visitor or residency status of senior executives of these companies will be revoked, and any related applications they submit will not be approved. The report adds: -The MOC stated that these companies have engaged in arms sales to the Taiwan region and conducted so-called cooperation on military technologies in recent years, despite China's strong opposition. Their actions severely undermined China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, severely violated the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiques, and severely undermined peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, the ministry said, adding that the companies will be legally held accountable. Noting that China's unreliable entity provisions only target a few foreign entities that undermine China's national security, the ministry said the Chinese government will always welcome foreign companies to invest and expand their businesses in China, and is committed to providing a stable, fair and predictable business environment for law-abiding companies operating in China.- The 10 companies that have been added to the list are: Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Lockheed Martin Missile Systems Integration Laboratory Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories Lockheed Martin Ventures Javelin Joint Venture Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems General Dynamics Information Technology General Dynamics Mission Systems Share Tracking People's Daily Back to news about Xi. The Chinese president exchanged messages of congratulations with Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa on the 45th anniversary of bilateral ties. Xinhua reports: Xi said that -In recent years, the political mutual trust between the two sides has been strengthened, practical cooperation in various fields has delivered fruitful results, and the China-Ecuador friendship has become more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people…Notably the China-Ecuador Free Trade Agreement, which has been successfully signed and entered into force, has given a strong boost to upgrading economic and trade cooperation and injected fresh impetus into the development of bilateral relations, the Chinese president said. ‘I attach great importance to the growth of China-Ecuador relations and stand ready to work with President Noboa to take the 45th anniversary as a new starting point to renew the traditional China-Ecuador friendship and deepen exchanges and cooperation in various fields so as to lift China-Ecuador relations to a higher level,' Xi said.- Subscribe now Next, there's a report on Li Qiang's visit to Jinan in Shandong Province. Li said that -entering the new year, we must thoroughly implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Central Economic Work Conference, with a sense of responsibility and urgency that time waits for no one, seize every moment, promote early implementation of policies, quick advancement of projects, ensure tangible outcomes of measures, and strive to achieve a good start to this year's economic development.- ，，，，、，、、，. Xinhua English summarises the rest well. Visiting a home appliance store, Li said that -the government's consumer goods trade-in scheme is of great significance to meet the needs of people for high-quality life, unlock consumption potential, promote industry upgrades and facilitate economic circulation. China will continue to implement this initiative with greater support, Li said, adding that procedures will be optimized to facilitate consumer spending.- He also visited a charging and battery-swapping station. Li -encouraged exploratory and innovative efforts in developing charging and battery-swapping services and related areas. Measures should be taken to deepen reform of the energy management system, transform the energy sector and foster new drivers of growth,- he added. Li then visited a sports stadium and a water management project. He said that -stadiums and modern water networks are not only significant infrastructure projects, but also important for public welfare, and called for efforts to strengthen supply of resources such as funds and land. Concerning urban renewal, it is important to stress the planning and layout of drainage networks and maintain strict oversight throughout the entire construction process to ensure that the project quality is able to stand the test of time, Li added. Efforts should be made to attract more private investment to participate in the construction of infrastructure and public services, he said.- Finally, there's a long, long article reviewing the development of work related to propaganda, ideology and culture in 2024. I am not detailing this. But the most significant development of course was the establishment of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and Xi Jinping Thought on Culture in particular, which was formally established in October 2023. Patriotism is also a key trait that is highlighted in the article. Subscribe now Page 2: Wang Yi spoke at the opening ceremony of the new Research Center on Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind in Beijing. This has been established by the China Foreign Affairs University. Wang said: -Building a community with a shared future for mankind is a significant original concept proposed by General Secretary Xi Jinping. It is the core idea of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy and represents China's answer to the era's question of ‘What kind of world to build and how to build it?' It holds valuable theoretical significance, major contemporary relevance, and profound global influence.- ，，，，-、-，、. -Wang Yi said that the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind highlights the original mission of the CPC. General Secretary Xi Jinping clearly pointed out that the CPC is a party that seeks happiness for the Chinese people and strives for the cause of human progress. Building a community with a shared future for mankind reflects our Party's innate internationalist sentiment, organically combines the fundamental interests of the Chinese people with the fundamental interests of the people of all countries, and closely links the future and destiny of China with the future and destiny of the world; transcends the differences in social systems and ideologies, and transcends the differences in history, culture, and development stages, and establishes a banner and direction for China's major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics on the new journey.- ，。，，。，，，、，、，、. The concept of a community with a shared future for mankind promotes the fine traditions of Chinese culture. This major initiative is a vivid practice of the ‘two integrations' and an innovative achievement of the sinicization of Marxism. It embodies the Chinese nation's worldview of ‘Great Unity' , the value of ‘harmony is the most precious' , and the perspective of righteousness/morality and interests that ‘puts righteousness first' . It demonstrates the peaceful, inclusive and innovative nature of Chinese civilization. It is the promotion and sublimation of China's excellent traditional culture under new historical conditions. It will surely unleash the timeless appeal and inspiration of Chinese culture, and will surely promote Chinese civilization to make new contributions to the progress of human civilization. 。--，，--、--、--，、，，，. -The concept of a community with a shared future for mankind demonstrates the profound power of scientific theory. Since its proposal in 2013, this concept has evolved into a broad and complete structure, with the construction of ‘five worlds' (these are: building a world of lasting peace, building a world of universal security, building a world of common prosperity, building an open and inclusive world, and building a clean and beautiful world) as its goal, global governance through consultation, joint construction, and shared benefits as its implementation path, the practice of universal human values as its guiding principle, the building of a new type of international relations as its foundational support, the ‘three major global initiatives' as its strategic guidance, and high-quality joint construction of the ‘Belt and Road' as its practical platform It enriches and develops Marxist theories of international relations, transcends traditional theories of international relations, and illuminates the path forward for global governance.- 。2013，、，--，，，，--，--，，，. The concept of a community with a shared future for mankind clarifies China's proposition amid the once-in-a-century changes that are unfolding. Facing changes of the times and historical questions, building a community of shared future for mankind clearly advocates the spirit of ‘working together for this one and only planet Earth', an open and inclusive mindset, and a vision of win-win cooperation. It proposes transcending conflict and confrontation through peaceful development, replacing absolute security with common security, discarding zero-sum games for mutual benefit and win-win results, preventing clashes between civilizations through exchanges and mutual learning, and protecting the homeland of Earth through green development, promoting state-to-state relations from peaceful coexistence toward shared destiny, injecting strong momentum into promoting world peace and development cause.- 。、，--、、，，，，，，，.

He Lifeng attended and spoke at this event. Xinhua English summarises the report well: -Xi's important discourses provide a fundamental guidance for natural resources work in the new era, He noted, adding that upholding and strengthening the Party's overall leadership over natural resources work is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in this regard. He also stressed adhering to the people-centered development philosophy, serving the modernization featuring harmonious coexistence between man and nature, and improving development of China's geographical space while doing the natural resources work. Efforts should also be made to effectively translate learning outcomes into practical work results, he added.- Finally, a report informs that Li Dianxun has been appointed as acting Governor of Hubei.

It says that in 2024, the number of cadres under central management ( or so-called ‘tigers') who have been -publicly announced as fallen- by the CCDI reached 58. The last to fall in the year was Zhou Jiabin, Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Congress, and Secretary of the Guilin Municipal Party Committee, on December 28, 2024. The piece reiterates that the fight against corruption -has no endpoint, only a constant process.- It adds that it is necessary to -persevere in purifying the political environment.- -In the past year, the CCDI, the NSC and discipline inspection and supervision agencies at all levels have continuously consolidated and built upon the overwhelming victory in the anti-corruption struggle, promoted the normalization and long-term effectiveness of preventing and combating corruption, and further improved the effectiveness of combating corruption.- ，，，。，，、，.

Xinhua informs: -The national average reading in 2024 stood at 10.9 degrees Celsius, 1.01 degrees Celsius above the annual average, breaking the previous record set in 2023, which was 10.71 degrees Celsius. A total of 19 provincial-level regions logged record-high temperatures last year -- including Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Henan and Shaanxi. Average precipitation across the country reached 697.7 mm in 2024, 9 percent more than the annual average- Outside of the People's Daily, I found this article by Xiang Haoyu, a research fellow at the Asia-Pacific Institute, China Institute of International Studies, making the pitch for a Pan-Asian Railway Network, rather interesting. It points to continued Chinese interest in pursuing railway connectivity projects abroad. Xiang also makes the case that this is not simply about economic efficiency but also a strategic requirement. The article begins by discussing the history of this idea, dating it back to the 1960s. Back then, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) had proposed a plan for constructing a freight railway network spanning the Eurasian continent, known as the Trans-Asian Railway project. Fast forward to April 2010, when representatives from 18 Asian countries signed the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Trans-Asian Railway Network in Busan, proposing the construction of a Trans-Asian Railway network spanning 81,000 kilometers. 60，、，（ESCAP），。，。，，19999，，。20104，18《》，8.1。，. Apart from making the economic argument for such a network, Xiang writes that for Asian countries -collaborating on the construction and operation of cross-border railways can strengthen economic interests and cultural ties, while fostering mutual understanding and trust, reducing conflicts, and maintaining regional peace and stability.- ，，，，，. He then discusses the challenges, writing that indeed, advancing such a grand project -not only requires gathering the political will and cooperative consensus of various countries, but also overcoming difficult and complex practical problems.- -The planning of the Pan-Asian Railway Network will first have to deal with the complexity and diversity of countries in the region, which have differences in terms of development levels and interests, making coordination costs high and difficulties great in aspects like route planning, construction standards, and operational management. Additionally, railway construction requires enormous investment, has long construction periods, and slow capital recovery. For cross-border railways, different countries will also have disputes surrounding benefit distribution and operational models, affecting cooperation enthusiasm and smooth project implementation. At the same time, engineering and technical problems cannot be ignored. Eurasian countries' railways have multiple track gauges; if cross-border connectivity is only based on the existing different track gauges, it will inevitably significantly constrain transportation efficiency. Whether ‘trains running on the same track gauge' can be achieved is a significant test of the quality of the Pan-Asian Railway Network. And to lay new electrified tracks, Asia's terrain is complex, some railway sections need to traverse mountains, deserts, rivers, tropical rainforests and other challenging sections, construction difficulty is high, engineering technical requirements are high, this will not only increase construction costs, but also involve many thorny environmental and socio-cultural issues. ，，，。，、，、、、。，，，。，、，。，，，，。--，。，，、、、，，，，. But Xiang sounds optimistic, citing China's high-speed rail network development as an example that has -demonstrative and radiative effect, encouraging neighbouring countries to accelerate their railway construction plans.- He adds: -Through BRI's framework for interconnectivity cooperation, China and its neighbours have launched numerous benchmark projects for the Pan-Asian Railway Network. In addition to the operational China-Laos Railway and Jakarta-Bandung HSR, there are over a dozen cross-border railway projects under construction or planning. A groundbreaking development is the China-Europe Railway Express, which, since its launch in 2016, has exceeded 100,000 cumulative trips, connecting 227 cities in 25 European countries and over 100 cities in 11 Asian countries. ，4.6，，--，--，。，。--，。，。，201610，25227、11100. He adds: -As an ‘infrastructure fanatic' , China's experience and technology can help the Pan-Asian Railway Network ‘dream come true'. The China-Laos Railway and the Jakarta-Bandung HSR have activated the ‘high-speed rail dream' of ASEAN countries. The three lines of the Pan-Asian Railway Network in Southeast Asia, namely the East Line, the Central Line and the West Line, have all made progress to varying degrees. China and ASEAN are deeply integrating the Pan-Asian Railway Network planning with development plans such as the ‘ASEAN Connectivity Master Plan 2025', jointly formulating detailed construction plans and timetables, and solidly promoting pragmatic cooperation, committed to complete the strategic jigsaw puzzle of land and sea connectivity among ASEAN countries as soon as possible, and laying a solid foundation for the development of the ASEAN Community. --，--。--。、、，。《2025》，，，，. Currently, with the rise of trade protectionism and anti-globalization trends, major power competition, and geopolitical tensions, Asia-Pacific regional cooperation is facing bottlenecks and constraints. The more this is the case, the more urgent it becomes for regional countries to build consensus around connectivity, and the construction of the Pan-Asian Railway Network is also most timely. Under the new circumstances, the construction of the Pan-Asia Railway will help break down trade barriers, provide an efficient and low-cost cross-border transportation channel for the Asia-Pacific region, inject new impetus into economic and trade exchanges within the region, and help integrate resources in the Asia-Pacific region, promote the process of regional economic integration, and enhance the overall competitiveness of the regional economy. For countries prioritizing security and development, cross-border railway cooperation can strengthen strategic collaboration, increase political trust, reinforce a sense of shared destiny, hedge against geopolitical risks and challenges, and can also reduce dependence on maritime energy transportation through opening up land energy channels, thereby better ensuring their energy security, enhancing regional strategic stability, and improving the collective ability to respond to complex challenges.- ，、，。，，。，、，，，，。，，，，，，，，，.

Previewing CCDI Plenary - How Xi Has Led Reform - China's Flexible Retirement System - Commemorating Shen Junru's Life to Support for Xi - Wang Shida ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, January 2, 2025. Page 1: There's a long, long Xinhua article on how Xi Jinping led China in 2024 to take new and solid steps towards modernisation. It says that in 2024, Xi visited -more than 10 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities and the Macao Special Administrative Region, made four visits abroad, presided over a series of important meetings, attended a series of major events, delivered a series of important speeches, and put forth a series of important instructions, which promoted new achievements in the theory and practice of governing the country.- I am not going to detail the full article. Rather, let me just point to some key extracts: The piece says that -this is an era of great changes, and even more so an era of great possibilities.- ，。 Xi Jinping -personally served as the head of the drafting group for the documents of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Party Congress, throughout the process laying out plans, organizing research, carefully guiding, and taking the pulse/setting the direction.- 2023，2024，7。，、、、. The article specifically references this speech that Xi delivered towards the end of October on the subject of reform. In it, Xi outlined the approach to properly handle four key relationships. In it, Xi had also called on leading cadres to -strengthen our sense of political responsibility and historical mission, and with the political courage to overcome difficulties and rise to the challenge; we must face up to contradictions and problems without evasion, eradicate stubborn problems without ambiguity, and respond to risks and challenges without retreat, and strive to open up a new world of reform and development.- The article reiterates that -high-quality development- remains the Party's -primary task.- The article touches upon policy shifts since the September 26, 2024, Politburo meeting, praising Xi for demonstrating -great foresight- and -extraordinary wisdom and ability in steering China's economy.- 、，、，、，. What are new quality productive forces? General Secretary Xi Jinping provided a profound explanation: ‘Its characteristic is innovation, its key lies in high quality, and its essence is advanced productivity. How to develop new quality productive forces? General Secretary Xi Jinping put forward clear requirements: ‘Cannot rush in hastily, surge up in a rush all together and disperse in a rush together, must adapt measures to local conditions, each having their own strengths'.- ？：-，，。-？：-、、，，.- The piece then discusses China's achievements in technology and innovation, progress in regional coordinated development, and coordinating development and security. The last of these includes -preventing and resolving financial risks, especially systemic risks-, -development of new energy and national energy security- and -food security.- The third section of the article deals with employment, rural revitalisation, urban-rural integrated development, and the work done to -narrow the urban-rural gap, regional gap, and income gap, and promote the common prosperity of all people-. Two bits to note in the foreign policy section. -China's poverty alleviation process shows that with the tenacity, perseverance and a fighting spirit of ‘dripping water wears away a stone and following a blueprint to the end', the poverty problem in developing countries can be solved, and weak birds can fly first and fly high. If China can succeed, other developing countries can also succeed. This is the global significance of China's successful victory in the battle against poverty.- -，、、，，、。，。.- Also: -‘We admire the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of President Xi Jinping and are willing to learn from the experience of the Communist Party of China.' ‘We will continue to deepen cooperation with China and actively participate in the process of Chinese-style modernization.' ‘President Xi Jinping seeks the well-being of the people, maintains social fairness and justice, advocates peace rather than war, cooperation rather than confrontation, and creation rather than destruction, and has set an example for the world' ... This is the echo of the times of Chinese-style modernization, and this is the global significance of the new form of human civilization created by China today.- -，--，--，，、、，-……，. Subscribe now Next, there's a piece that previews the upcoming CCDI plenary session. It says that: In 2024, the CCDI and the National Supervisory Commission along with discipline inspection and supervision agencies at all levels adhered to making the implementation of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important instructions and directives, and the major decisions of the Party Central Committee, the top priority of political supervision, focusing on key tasks such as the implementation of a package of incremental policy deployments, keeping watch on important deployments such as high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-strengthening, strengthening supervision and inspection, ensuring proper implementation, and resolutely preventing disobedience of orders and violations of prohibitions. 2024，，，，，，、. Then we get some data: In terms of inadequate supervision and abuse of power in the field of ecological and environmental protection, -from January to November 2024, more than 24,000 related issues were investigated and dealt with, and more than 34,000 people were criticized, educated and dealt with, of which more than 19,000 were handed disciplinary and administrative sanctions.- ，、。2024111，2.4，3.4，1.9. The CCDI and NSC made -special arrangements to strictly investigate corruption in the field of grain purchase and sales.- -From January to November 2024, discipline inspection and supervision agencies at all levels across the country investigated and dealt with more than 14,000 related issues, criticized and educated more than 21,000 people, of which more than 13,000 people were handed disciplinary and administrative sanctions.- 2024111，1.4，2.1，1.3. The piece talks about how supervision is following the agenda outlined at the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, with -discipline inspection and supervision organs actively performing political supervision duties to clear obstacles and further the development of new quality productive forces.- --。，. How does it do this? Here's an example: -Shanghai's Shibei Hi-Tech Service Industry Park has gathered a batch of technological innovation enterprises. Shanghai Jing'an District's Discipline Inspection Commission and Supervisory Commission, through visits, learned that small and micro enterprises face problems of having few tangible assets and difficulty in financing. They actively promoted functional departments and financial enterprises to fulfill their duties and responsibilities, provided enterprises with personalized financing loan solutions, while also supervising the park to accelerate the systematic construction of intellectual property operation and maintenance services. As of now, nearly 20 enterprises have received intellectual property pledge financing services, and their funding problems have been effectively solved.- 。、，、，，。，20，. (Note: I don't think that this is the norm for the CCDI and NSC to facilitate financing solutions for enterprises. It also is an example of significant political and Party interference in financing decisions. But then the piece also talks about the CCDI engaged in supervision with regard to cultural relics protection.) Towards the end, the article says: Inspection tours are a strategic institutional arrangement for strict and comprehensive Party governance. In 2024, according to the Party Central Committee's deployment, the Central Inspection Work Leading Group organized two rounds of inspections, inspecting 68 units in total. As of now, the completion rate of the 20th Central Committee's full-coverage inspection task is nearly 50%. The Central Inspection Groups put the implementation of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches and important instructions and directives in the primary position, closely monitored power and responsibility to strengthen political supervision, deeply understood the inspected Party organizations' situations regarding fulfilling functional responsibilities, implementation of major reform deployments, preventing and resolving major risks, deepening strict and comprehensive Party governance, strengthening leadership teams and cadre talent team building, and carefully finding political deviations. 。2024，，，68。，50%。，，、、、、，. Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, there's a report (GT's English report) informing that the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Central Organization Department, the Ministry of Finance and other three departments issued the ‘Interim Measures for the Implementation of a Flexible Retirement System' on January 1, 2025. It says that: -Starting from January 1, 2025, the statutory retirement age for men will be gradually raised from 60 to 63 in the course of 15 years, while that for women cadres will be raised from 55 to 58, and that for women blue-collar workers will be raised from 50 to 55.- The document adds that: -Starting from January 1, 2025, employees who have reached the minimum years of contribution required by the state to receive a basic pension on a monthly basis may voluntarily choose flexible early retirement. The maximum early retirement period is up to three years before the statutory retirement age, and the retirement age cannot be lower than the original statutory retirement ages of 50 years for women blue-collar workers, 55 years for women cadres, and 60 years for men. When employees reach the statutory retirement age, the employer can flexibly delay retirement by reaching an agreement with the employee, with the delay time no longer than 3 years from the statutory retirement age.- 《》，202511，，，3，50、5560。，，，3. Page 3: There's a brief report informing that the China-Maldives FTA has taken effect from January 1, 2025. Also on the page, there's a report based on comments by MoFA's Mao Ning on China's focus on the Global South. I guess this is signalling for the year ahead. Mao said: -As Foreign Minister Wang Yi pointed out, the collective rise of the Global South in the current chapter of history is a distinctive feature of the great transformation across the world. In the past year, greater BRICS cooperation made a good start, the new model of ‘SCO plus' came into shape, and the African Union took part in the G20 Summit for the first time. Global South countries have joined hands to take part in multilateral cooperation more actively and extensively, bringing new impetus for the transformation of economic globalization, and adding new dynamism to global governance. China will always be an important member of the Global South and always be committed to unity and invigoration of the Global South. President Xi Jinping called for more open and inclusive Global South cooperation, and announced eight measures in support of Global South cooperation. He articulated the vision for countries in the Global South to work together as the staunch force for peace, the core driving force for open development, the construction team of global governance, and the advocates for exchange among civilizations. China will continue to practice true multilateralism, firmly safeguard the common interests of developing countries, and bring the Global South together in solidarity for greater strength, so as to leave the mark of the Global South on the progress of humanity.- Leave a comment Page 6: There's a long piece marking the 150th birth anniversary of Shen Junru, who among other things was the chairman of the China Democratic League. One key excerpt from the article, given that history is never about history, but rather about the present. -We commemorate Mr. Shen Junru in order to learn from his spirit of loving the motherland, loving the people, being selfless and fearless, and having the courage to struggle; to learn from his admirable qualities of advocating democracy, pursuing the rule of law, seeking truth, and striving for progress; more importantly, it is to learn from his steadfast political conviction of close cooperation and solidarity with the Communist Party of China and sharing weal and woe. Throughout the long revolutionary struggle, he forged deep friendships with CPC leaders such as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, becoming a trustworthy and candid friend of the Party. In his later years, Mr. Shen Junru held even deeper affection for the CPC. During the 1962 National Day celebration, Mao Zedong inquired about his health on the Tiananmen Rostrum and personally supported him as they descended the elevator after the event. Upon returning home, he emotionally declared, ‘We must always listen to Chairman Mao and always follow the Communist Party of China.' This was not only Mr. Shen's earnest exhortation to the younger generations but also a vivid embodiment of the Democratic League's close alignment and resolute support for the CPC. Today, in the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, members of democratic parties should take Mr. Shen Junru and other predecessors as role models, inherit and carry forward the fine tradition of multi-party cooperation, unite more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, thoroughly study and implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, implement the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress and the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the 20th CPC Central Committee, deeply understand the decisive significance of the ‘Two Establishments', strengthen the ‘Four Consciousnesses' and ‘Four Confidences', and achieve the ‘Two Safeguards', remain unwavering in thinking together, standing together, and working together with the CPC, upholding, developing, and perfecting China's new political party system, and unite and strive for the great cause of comprehensively promoting the construction of a strong country and national rejuvenation through Chinese-style modernization.- ，、、、，、、、，、。，、，。。1962，，，：-，。-，、。，，，，，、，--，--、--、--，、、，、、，、. Share Tracking People's Daily On December 26, 2024, there was a piece by Wang Shida from China Institute of Contemporary International Relations in Global Times in Chinese, arguing that while the world marks the 20th anniversary of the Indian Ocean tsunami, even today countries are realising that they need to -work together to overcome difficulties, as the region faces many new challenges requiring urgent attention.- Wang writes: -On one hand, the risk of bloc confrontation in the Indian Ocean region is intensifying. The Indian Ocean region is vast and densely populated, encompassing about 20% of the world's water bodies, a quarter of its landmass, and three-quarters of its oil, iron, and tin reserves. More importantly, the region is crucial for ensuring the safety and stability of global shipping lanes and trade routes, carrying over one-third of the world's bulk cargo and two-thirds of its oil shipments. International chokepoints such as the Strait of Malacca, the Strait of Hormuz, and the Bab el-Mandeb are located in the region, underscoring its significance in both economic and geopolitical terms. It is precisely because of the political and economic importance of the region that some countries have increased their involvement or interference in the Indian Ocean in recent years. The United States has been particularly active, pushing its ‘Indo-Pacific Strategy' to unite and integrate so-called ‘Indo-Pacific' allies and partners in an attempt to strengthen the containment of China. Currently, 3 of the US Unified Combat Commands are related to the Indian Ocean region, US military frequently conducts various joint exercises with regional countries, and has become the largest weapons supplier to the Indian Ocean region. Additionally, the US is leveraging mechanisms such as the Quad and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework to bolster its influence and presence. Obviously, such actions amount to forming cliques in the Indian Ocean region, binding regional countries to America's war chariot, with growing risks of regional countries being ‘forced into camp confrontation'.- ，。、，20%、1/43/4、。，，1/3、2/3，、，。，。，--，--。，3，，。--、--。，，，--. On the other hand, the Indian Ocean region today is in urgent need of achieving sustainable development. At present, countries in the region are having to shoulder the heavy responsibility of developing the national economies and improving people's well-being, while at the same time facing several new and old challenges, such as environmental and climate change. Over the past few decades, climate change has caused countries in the region to experience increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts and heat waves. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations reported in 2021 that since the 1950s, the Indian Ocean has warmed faster than any other waters, which will lead to decreased fishing yields across the entire ocean, harming countries that are highly dependent on fisheries and lack the ability to adapt to climate shocks. In addition, by 2030, the population density of the Indian Ocean coastal areas is expected to reach the highest level in the world, with 340 million people living in potentially dangerous coastal areas. Obviously, avoiding risks of camp confrontation, opposing external power interference, or achieving regional stability and sustainable growth, including resolving lingering sovereignty disputes left behind from the decolonisation period, cannot be accomplished by any single country alone. It requires joint efforts from all Indian Ocean countries and regions as well as external () ‘positive energy countries'.- ，。，、，，。，、。2021，2050，，，。，2030，，3.4。，、，，，，--. -Although the US and other countries have been exaggerating the ‘China threat' and intensifying the containment and suppression of China under the framework of the so-called ‘Indo-Pacific Strategy', China has always developed relations with the countries in the Indian Ocean region with an attitude of equal cooperation and mutual benefit and win-win. In recent years, China's trade cooperation with the region has developed well, with increasing trade scale and growing mutual trade dependence. Currently, China is the largest import partner for over 20 countries in the Indian Ocean region, and the largest export partner for 13 countries in the region, with many regional countries joining high-quality Belt and Road Initiative cooperation. At the same time, China actively participates in multilateral cooperation in the Indian Ocean region and has hosted three China-Indian Ocean Regional Development Cooperation Forums. When the Indian Ocean tsunami occurred 20 years ago, China was a firm supporter of ‘working together to rebuild a beautiful home'. Looking to the future, China and the Indian Ocean region have broad cooperation space and huge development potential, with prospects to further advance bilateral and multilateral cooperation with regional countries, working together to achieve lasting peace, stability and prosperity in the region.- ----、，、。，，，。，20，13，--。，，—。20，-，-。，，，，、.

Xi's New Year's Message & Warning - Putin-Xi Exchange Greetings - New Party Chiefs for Henan, Hubei, Guangxi & Qinghai	Wish all of you a very Happy New Year. Here's to another year of China-watching and analysis! If you work in a domain that requires you to conduct open-source China analysis, do please consider applying for my Watching China course. The course begins on February 1, 2025. Students and Takshashila alumni are eligible for discounts. Click here or on the image below for all the details. Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, January 1, 2025. The front page today is dominated by Xi Jinping. The lead story is based on Xi's annual new year message. The speech (English text) essentially was a positive recap of 2024. He said: -We have adopted a full range of policies to make solid gains in pursuing high-quality development. China's economy has rebounded and is on an upward trajectory, with its GDP for the year expected to pass the 130 trillion yuan mark. Grain output has surpassed 700 million tons, and China's bowls are now filled with more Chinese grain. Coordinated development across regions has gained stronger momentum, and mutually reinforcing advances have been made in both new urbanization and rural revitalization. Green and low-carbon development has been further enhanced. Indeed, a more beautiful China is unfolding before us. We have fostered new quality productive forces in light of actual conditions. New business sectors, forms and models have kept emerging. For the first time, China has produced more than 10 million new energy vehicles in a year. Breakthroughs have been made in integrated circuit, artificial intelligence, quantum communications and many other fields. Also for the first time, the Chang'e-6 lunar probe collected samples from the far side of the moon. The Mengxiang drilling vessel explored the mystery of the deep ocean. The Shenzhen-Zhongshan Link now connects the two cities across the sea. The Antarctic Qinling Station is now in operation on the frozen continent. All this epitomizes the lofty spirit and dreams of the Chinese people to explore stars and oceans.- For 2025, he said: -In 2025, we will fully complete the 14th Five-Year Plan. We will implement more proactive and effective policies, pursue high-quality development as a top priority, promote greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology, and maintain sound momentum in economic and social development. The Chinese economy now faces some new conditions, including challenges of uncertainties in the external environment and pressure of transformation from old growth drivers into new ones. But we can prevail with our hard work. As always, we grow in the wind and rain, and we get stronger through hard times. We must be confident. Of all the jobs in front of us, the most important is to ensure a happy life for our people. Every family hopes that their children can have a good education, their seniors can enjoy good elderly services, and their youngsters can have more and better opportunities. These simple wishes are our people's aspirations for a better life. We should work together to steadily improve social undertakings and governance, build a harmonious and inclusive atmosphere, and settle real issues, big or small, for our people. We must bring more smiles to our people and greater warmth to their hearts. On the eve of the 25th anniversary of Macao's return to the motherland, I visited the city again, and I was gratified to see the new progress and changes there. We will unswervingly implement the policy of One Country, Two Systems to maintain long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao. We Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same family. No one can ever sever the bond of kinship between us, and no one can ever stop China's reunification, a trend of the times. As changes unseen in a century accelerate across the world, it is important to rise above estrangement and conflict with a broad vision, and care for the future of humanity with great passion. China will work with all countries to promote friendship and cooperation, enhance mutual learning among different cultures, and build a community with a shared future for mankind. We must jointly create a better future for the world.- Another report on the page covers Xi's meeting with representatives of retired officials and groups who received awards for their outstanding work. Li Ganjie spoke at this meeting. He called on everyone to -thoroughly study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping's important discourses and instructions on the work of veteran cadres; deeply understand the decisive significance of the ‘Two Establishments', resolutely implement the ‘Two Safeguards', and do a good job in the work of veteran cadres in the new era and new journey with high standards and high quality.- ，，--，--，. Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the page is a report on Xi's remarks at the tea party arranged by the CPPCC on Tuesday morning. The full text of this speech is published on Page 2. Xi said: 2024 was a critical year for achieving the goals and tasks of the 14th Five-Year Plan. Over the past year, in the face of challenges brought by domestic and international situations, we have responded calmly and adopted comprehensive measures to successfully complete the main goals and tasks of economic and social development.
