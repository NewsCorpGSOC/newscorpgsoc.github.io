India’s Tryst With Destiny: Time to Get Real	For most Indians, deep in their psyche is embedded a belief that a global role for India is part of its tryst with destiny. The roots of this international vision can be traced back to ancient history — among empires and rulers that emerged from the land that is modern India to those that came to make it their home. Even today, the echoes of this past reverberate in the international affairs of the modern Indian republic. So how have the leaders of modern India conceptualised the country's place in the world? How have their views of power and order evolved? More significantly, what opportunities and challenges does the current distribution of power globally present for India. In this episode of The Great Power Show, Manoj Kewalramani speaks to Dhruva Jaishankar, Executive Director of ORF America, and author of the excellent new book Vishwa Shastra: India and the World. Jaishankar argues that the world today reflects aspects of unipolarity, bipolarity, and multipolarity at the same time. Such an environment calls for a realist vision of India's approach to the world, he contends, arguing that historical evidence shows that whenever interest was subordinated to values in Indian foreign policy, it has served the country poorly. Within this context, he outlines a vision for India's engagement with the US, China and world at large.

The Design of Miscalculations: My Review of Tyler Jost's 'Bureaucracies at War'	Many parallels can be drawn about the state of the world today and that in the 19th century. These range from the re-emergence of great power confrontation and drive toward some form of multipolarity to the return of nationalism and protectionism. Likewise, there appears to be an excessive focus on individuals and leaders nowadays. In China, it is Xi Jinping who has ushered in a new era. Writings in Chinese media often describe his leadership as the core as pivotal to navigate the profound changes unseen in a century that are taking place in the world. In India, Narendra Modi has dominated politics and the news cycle for over a decade. Vladimir Putin has steered Russia for 25 years, while in the US, Donald Trump serves today as a demagogue-in-chief. Each, at different times, has wrapped themselves in the mantle of destiny—whether invoking an omniscient cosmic force or the apparently immutable laws of historical materialism. In essence, the 19th-century Great Man Theory of History is back in vogue, accompanied by growing disdain for bureaucracy and institutional processes. Yet this leader-centric view obscures the intricate machinery of political decision-making, especially in matters of war and peace. Leaders matter, but they are only as effective as the institutions they build and sustain. This argument lies at the heart of Tyler Jost's insightful Bureaucracies at War: The Institutional Origins of Miscalculation. The book postulates an institutional design theory to understand how and why states miscalculate or succeed in their objectives when initiating or contending with a crisis. This theory is compared to alternate explanations such as the bureaucratic interest group theory, leader-based explanation, and accountability theory. Jost contends that institutions are critical to understanding why some states are better positioned to manage uncertainty in international affairs than others. The argument is that bureaucracies within a state often operate as -islands of information- and these -gaps require bridges.- This is because access to quality information and competitive deliberations are what eventually yield the best national security outcomes. In making this case, he posits that -national security institutions help explain when and why states miscalculate on the road to war.- However, the choice of national security institutions entails a trade-off. Leaders -can design institutions that ensure they receive the best possible advice or they can design institutions that ensure the bureaucracy is powerless to threaten them- politically. Jost defines national security institutions as follows: -National security institutions refer to a comparatively stable and connected set of formal and informal rules that prescribe the roles that bureaucracies play, constrain their actions, and shape their expectations. Institutions do not refer to any single organization, such as a specific bureaucracy or advisory body, but rather the rules that govern how such organizations interact with the leader. If democratic and autocratic institutions are the rules shaping how political leaders are selected for office, national security institutions are the rules shaping how leaders manage the national security bureaucracy.- The different types of institutions are then plotted on a framework taking into account leader information search capacity and bureaucratic access to information. The former ranges from inclusive to insular, the latter from open to closed. At their intersections emerge four distinct institutional options. Integrated Institutions: These are characterised by a combination of inclusive information and open bureaucratic access. They reduce risk of miscalculation through competitive dialogue. Integrated institutions hinge on the inclusion of diplomatic, defense, and intelligence bureaucracies in deliberations. Siloed Institutions: These entail inclusive structures in terms of the availability of information for a leader but limit the bureaucracy's search capacity. In other words, key national security bureaucracies might have access to the leader but tend to operate in silos, hindering competitive dialogue and scrutiny. One key consequence of this is that -bureaucrats are more likely to provide leaders with information that reflects their parochial interests.- Fragmented Institutions: These engender systemic vertical and horizontal limitations. Jost argues that such institutions -introduce the possibility of functional failures in information exchange between the bureaucracy and the leader.- In other words, exclusion of certain bureaucracies could limit access to information that is essential to decision-making. The more pernicious effect of fragmented institutions, however, is that they -cause bureaucrats to censor their counsel and manipulate the information that they supply to match the leader's beliefs. Fragmentation does not simply create barriers to information provision. It also shapes a bureaucrat's understanding of types of behaviors that the leader deems appropriate and will therefore reward…- Dictatorial Institutions: These engender a mix of insularity and open bureaucratic access to information. Jost argues that dictatorial institutions tend to achieve outcomes -quite similar to fragmented institutions. Limited search capacity means that leaders should be more likely to miscalculate because they base their decisions on incomplete information. Yet dialogue and information sharing between bureaucracies should have comparatively little effect on the likelihood of miscalculation because higher quality information cannot reach the leader.- The theory and the case studies that the book provides support the argument that integrated institutions are the most effective in avoiding miscalculation and achieving national security objectives. Yet, leaders may not necessarily always opt for integrated institutions. In order to understand why leaders chose a particular type of institution, Jost says that it is important to understand the incentives of political leaders. -Leaders make decisions that maximize the likelihood of remaining in office. Political survival is not determined solely by avoiding miscalculation in international crises. It is also determined by winning political debates about their performance in office,- he argues. Two key factors are critical to the choice around integration: the political threat that bureaucrats pose and the focus of the leader's agenda. -When bureaucrats pose a limited threat to political survival, leaders can adopt integrated institutions regardless of what issues keep them in office. When the level of bureaucratic threat is high, however, how leaders respond depends on the issues that are most important to them. Leaders whose agendas prize domestic issues can choose fragmented institutions to neutralize the threat posed by national security bureaucrats, curbing both their access to the leader's decision-making and to information in other bureaucratic silos. Leaders whose agenda is instead dominated by international issues choose the middle path of siloed institutions. They accept some political risk of censure via more competent and well-informed bureaucrats in order to get better advice, but restrict the amount of information which the bureaucracy might use to inflict political damage.- The book tests the theory by leveraging the National Security Institutions Data Set. Subsequently, specific case studies are undertaken, discussing cases from China, India, the US and Pakistan. These are deeply researched and offer really engaging reads. They also allow for testing Jost's theory across states with different governance systems and cultures, economic and administrative capacities and divergences in national power. Two of these chapters cover China. The first one discusses China during the Mao years, with a specific focus on the 1962 war with India, the Nationalist Invasion Scare of 1962 and the 1969 Sino-Soviet Border Conflict. The second discusses Chinese decision-making during the war against Vietnam and the 2001 EP-3 incident. These offer detailed application of the institutional design theory across different periods and under different leaders. Jost argues that in the early years of the PRC Mao Zedong opted for inclusive and open institutions -because the bureaucracy possessed minimal capability and intent to challenge his leadership.- These served China well, as the outcomes of the events of 1962 demonstrated. However, as the political landscape in China shifted heightening Mao's perception of threat from the bureaucracy, he opted for fragmented institutions, which resulted in incomplete and biased information flow. Mao's death did not alter this institutional structure, which Jost argues accounts for China's failure in the 1979 conflict with Vietnam. In the decades that followed, he argues that Chinese leaders opted for siloed institutions, which have served them better comparatively, but still resulted in miscalculations in the specific incident, i.e., the EP-3 case, discussed. The chapter on India was also particularly of interest to me. It charts India's journey from a stage where it had fragmented institutions under a dominant leader to developing a siloed set-up before moving towards a more integrated institutional architecture. The role of bureaucratic threat perception from a leader's perspective in a democracy is really well brought out in this chapter. Finally, some of my takeaways from the book: I found the theory that Jost has articulated very compelling. I think the depth of research that he brings forth is truly remarkable. The theory does add a lot to current IR discourse around conflict decision-making, the interplay between leaders and bureaucracies and the importance of understanding how institutional design can impact information flow. The book also does a great job in juxtaposing the institutional design theory with other alternatives. It allows for a more nuanced understanding of the key arguments and makes the book that much more persuasive. Jost concludes that existing frameworks offer -an incomplete explanation of why states miscalculate and demonstrates that bureaucracy exerts more systematic and less deleterious effects on international politics than the conventional wisdom would suggest.- Third, information flows and incentives matter, and there can be substantive political costs for information search and access and providing and acquiring higher quality information. It is essential to take into account these incentives and costs for both leaders and bureaucrats when thinking about why states make certain decisions in the foreign policy or national security domain. Finally, for China analysts, it is important to delineate the changes in foreign and security policy institutional arrangement under Xi Jinping and gather data points about the nature and extent of integration that has taken place. In doing so, one must note that merely the presence of a bureaucracy, such as the Central National Security Commission, does not imply integration. Composition, leadership, diversity and weightage of different bureaucracies and regularity of meetings are important factors. Another point to consider is the threat-level that Xi perceives from the bureaucracy today. What metrics should one use to make this assessment of threat perception? If the book's argument about the adoption of integrated institutions in the early years of the PRC under Mao are taken into account, then there is no reason why Xi cannot achieve greater integration. Once again, information about the composition of key bodies, meeting schedules and discussion agenda along with reportage on how Xi responds to ideational challenges or counter viewpoints is critical to make such assessments. This, however, is increasingly challenging given the opacity of China's information ecosystem. Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Xi's Liaoning Visit - Wang-Rubio Call - Zhang Youxia & He Weidong Stress Combat Readiness - Deep Dive: Chinese Scholars Discuss China's Role as 'Defen...	Before we get to today's edition, let me cover some of the big reports from the weekend. First, Saturday's front page was dedicated to Xi Jinping's visit to Liaoning ahead of the Spring Festival. Xi was accompanied by Liaoning Party Secretary Hao Peng and Governor Li Lecheng. Xi visited Huludao, Shenyang, Benxi and other areas from January 22 to 24. Also Cai Qi and He Lifeng traveled with Xi. First in Huludao, Xi visited Zhujiagou Village, which had suffered severe floods in August. Xinhua says: -At the entrance to the village, Xi looked at the affected areas, asking in detail about the summer flooding and the relocation of villagers at that time, as well as the subsequent relief work. He urged local officials to ensure the villagers stay warm throughout the winter. During visits to two village households, the president inspected the structural integrity of their homes, checked their preparations for holiday celebrations, and asked whether government subsidies for rebuilding had been adequately provided. He also inquired about the villagers' main sources of income.- Among the villagers whose home Xi visited was Wang Baowei. Wang -told the General Secretary that the new house was bright and warm, and all the New Year's goods had been prepared. He said that everyone in the village was sincerely grateful to the Party and to the General Secretary. Xi Jinping asked him if he had any other requests or hopes, to which he replied that his hope was to live an even better life. Xi Jinping happily responded that your hopes are also our hopes. The Party and the government will always be the strong support of the masses.- ，，，，、。，。，，. The next day Xi visited Shenyang, where he went to a vegetable market. As per the report, he -acknowledged the significant improvements in living conditions following a general revamping there-. He also visited a local housing community that had undergone renovation. He said that -urban renewal should be adapted to local conditions, combined with community building, everything should focus on benefiting, serving, and providing security to the people, and special attention should be paid to better caring for ‘the elderly and young children'.- ，，，、、，--. Xi also visited a community service center, where there was lots of fun to be had with writing of couplets, flute performances, etc. Later in the day, Xi visited Bensteel Group in the city of Benxi. Xi said that -the manufacturing industry must adhere to the direction of high-end, intelligent, and green development, continuously improving the technological content and added value of products. State-owned large enterprises like Bensteel should contribute more to Chinese-style modernization.- ，、、，，. On the final day, Xi listened to work reports from the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government. He -affirmed the achievements made in Liaoning's various works.- -Xi Jinping pointed out that Liaoning has a relatively complete industrial system, and must coordinate the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries with the cultivation and strengthening of strategic emerging industries, accelerating the construction of a modern industrial system. Traditional industries must strengthen industrial foundation reconstruction and major technical equipment breakthroughs, continuously enhancing core competitiveness. Cultivating and strengthening strategic emerging industries focuses on strengthening the deep integration of technological innovation and industrial innovation, developing new quality productive forces according to local conditions. The heavier the development tasks, the more attention must be paid to ecological environmental protection, promoting comprehensive green transformation of economic and social development.- ，，，。，。，。，，。 Xi Jinping stressed that the comprehensive revitalisation of northeast China ultimately depends on reform and opening up. In order to grasp the reform, it is necessary to further focus on problems, emphasize priorities, and break through difficulties, putting more effort into building a law-based government, optimizing the business environment, adhering to and implementing the ‘two unwaverings', and improving the modern enterprise system with Chinese characteristics. Now, the door of our country's opening up is opening wider and wider. Cadres at all levels must improve their ability to think about problems, make decisions, and do work under open conditions. ，，。、、，、、--、。，，、、. He then talked about the need to -adhere to the integrated development of urban and rural areas, promote the construction of new urbanization with county towns as an important carrier, optimize the allocation of public resources and industrial chain layout in counties and villages, and solidly promote the comprehensive revitalization of rural areas-. ，、，，，，. He called on governments at all levels to -strengthen cultural self-confidence and the socialist spiritual civilization-. The aim is to -inspire the passion and struggle spirit of cadres and the masses for reform, innovation, and revitalization and development.- ，，，。、，，、、，、. The final point is about discipline. He called to -unswervingly adhere to the leadership of the Party- and to -unswervingly ensure the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party.- -It is necessary to firmly grasp the political and organizational functions of the Party organizations, create and maintain a clean and upright political ecology, and educate and guide Party members and cadres to be loyal, clean and responsible at all times. We must thoroughly implement the spirit of the Central Committee's eight-point regulations and their implementation rules, and encourage cadres at all levels to truly seek truth and be pragmatic, honest and self-disciplined.- ，，。，，，。，、. Share Tracking People's Daily Also on Saturday, the paper carried a report on Wang Yi's call with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This has been extensively covered in the press. The Chinese readout says: -Wang Yi stated that President Xi Jinping had an important phone call with President Trump last Friday, during which a series of consensuses were reached. The development of China-US relations has reached a new critical juncture. President Xi Jinping comprehensively elaborated on China's policy toward the US, and President Trump responded positively, expressing his expectation of maintaining a good relationship with President Xi and emphasizing that US-China cooperation could resolve many global issues. Wang Yi said that the two heads of state have set the direction and established the tone for China-US relations. Both teams must implement the important consensus reached by the two leaders, uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation, maintain communication, manage differences, expand cooperation, and promote the stable, healthy, and sustainable development of China-US relations, finding the proper way for the two countries to interact in the new era. ，，。。，，，。，、。，、、，、、，、、，. Wang -emphasised that the leadership of the Communist Party of China is the choice of the Chinese people, and China's development follows a clear historical logic and possesses strong internal momentum. Our goal is to enable the people to live better lives and to contribute more significantly to the world. We have no intention of surpassing or replacing anyone, but we must defend our legitimate right to development. Wang Yi articulated China's principled stance on the Taiwan issue, demanding that the US handle it with caution. He stressed that Taiwan has been a part of China's territory since ancient times, and China will never allow Taiwan to be separated from the country. The US has made solemn commitments to the one-China policy in the three China-US Joint Communiqués and must not breach its word/break its promise . ，，，，。，。，。，，。，. Finally, this bit caught everyone's attention. Wang said that -major countries should act like major countries and should take on their due international responsibilities, safeguard world peace and help all countries achieve common development. He expressed hope that Rubio would conduct himself responsibly/behave well , playing a constructive role in the future of the peoples of China and the US, as well as in maintaining global peace and stability.- ，，，，。，，. In the official English translation, this was reported as Wang calling on Rubio to -make the right decisions.- As Lingling Wei's report for WSJ says, this is -an idiom that conveys a sense of caution that one should consider the consequences of one's actions.- The report adds: -The sleight of hand shows China's leader Xi Jinping wants to strike a balance between trying to deal with the Trump administration and maintaining his strongman posture to the Chinese public.- The State Department's readout was brief. Rubio told Wang that -the Trump Administration will pursue a U.S.-PRC relationship that advances U.S. interests and puts the American people first. The Secretary also stressed the United States' commitment to our allies in the region and serious concern over China's coercive actions against Taiwan and in the South China Sea. The Secretary also discussed other issues of bilateral, regional, and global importance with his Chinese counterpart.- The Chinese readout has Rubio saying that: -The United States and China are two great nations. The U.S.-China relations are the most important bilateral relationship of the 21st century and will shape the future of the world, he said. The United States is willing to engage in candid communication with China, resolve differences properly, manage bilateral relations in a mature and cautious way, jointly address global challenges and maintain world peace and stability, he said. Rubio said the United States does not support ‘Taiwan independence' and hopes the Taiwan question can be resolved by peaceful means which are acceptable to both sides of the Taiwan Strait.- Share Tracking People's Daily On Sunday, the lead report was on Xi's inspection tour of the PLA's Northern Theater Command on Friday. Xi held a video call with troops from a task unit of a brigade of the Southern Theater Command Army, an on-duty team from a coastal missile regiment of the Eastern Theater Command Navy, a surface-to-air missile battalion of the Central Theater Command Air Force, a monitoring and early-warning station of the military space force, the 2nd Battalion of a transport regiment under the Zhengzhou Joint Logistic Support Center, and the officers and soldiers 3rd Duty Battalion of the Shigatse Detachment of the Tibet Armed Police Corps. Xi listened to their briefings, fully affirmed their work, and expressed warm regards to them. ，。、、、、2、3，。，，. Okay, now to today's paper. The top story is about the top leadership wishing older comrades on the Spring Festival. The report says that -President Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders have visited or entrusted others to visit retired senior officials to extend greetings ahead of the Spring Festival.- As per the report, this is what the senior comrades said: -The old comrades expressed their gratitude, highly praised the work of the Party Central Committee over the past year, and wholeheartedly supported General Secretary Xi Jinping as the core of the Party Central Committee and the core of the entire Party. Everyone unanimously believed that in this key year for achieving the goals and tasks of the ‘14th Five-Year Plan', the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core united and led the whole Party, military, and people of all ethnic groups to calmly respond to changes and implement comprehensive policies, successfully completing the main economic and social development goals and tasks for the year, with Chinese-style modernization taking new solid steps. The old comrades hope that the whole Party, military, and people of all ethnic groups will unite more closely around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, adhere to Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as guidance, fully implement the spirit of the 20th Party Congress and the Second and Third Plenums of the 20th Central Committee, deeply understand the decisive significance of the ‘Two Establishments', enhance the four consciousnesses, strengthen the four self-confidences, achieve the two safeguards, face difficulties with confidence, seek truth and be realistic, work vigorously, and strive to advance the great cause of building a strong country and national rejuvenation through Chinese-style modernisation.- ，，、。，--，、，，.，，、，--，--、--、--，、，、，、. Next, Cai Qi met with people working in the culture and science and technology domains. Li Ganjie, Li Shulei and Jiang Xinzhi accompanied Cai Qi for these visits. The report says that he visited: the home of Wang Meng, former Minister of Culture and recipient of the national honorary title People's Artist the home of Ouyang Ziyuan, academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and astrochemist and geochemist the home of Liu Daxiang, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and aviation power expert Zhang Zhuoyuan, member of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and recipient of the national honorary title Outstanding Contributor to Economic Research The report adds: -Several well-known cultural figures and scientific experts expressed gratitude for the cordial care from the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, and expressed agreement with the Party Central Committee's strategic deployment of building a strong cultural nation and strong science and technology nation. Cai Qi stated that the Third Plenum of the 20th Party Congress made systematic arrangements for comprehensively deepening the reform of cultural systems and mechanisms, and we must deeply study and practice Xi Jinping Thought on Culture, actively promote new atmosphere and new accomplishments in propaganda, ideological and cultural work. When science and technology prosper, the nation prospers; when science and technology are strong, the country is strong. For our country to achieve high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-strengthening, it ultimately depends on high-level innovative talents. The broad masses of cultural workers and scientific and technological workers must bravely shoulder their responsibilities and missions, be determined to pioneer and innovate, integrate their personal ideals and pursuits into the cause of the Party and the country, and contribute wisdom and strength to the great cause of building a strong country and national rejuvenation.- ，。，，，。，，，。、，，、. Third, Li Qiang, along with Ding Xuexiang, met with foreign experts who have won the 2024 Chinese Government Friendship Award and those who are working in China. Xinhua reports: -Noting that the world needs communication and the process of globalization is irreversible, Li said China consistently advocates strengthening international dialogue and will continue to uphold openness and inclusiveness while actively promoting international exchanges in various fields. The premier stressed that innovation requires cooperation, and as the new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation deepens, scientific research has become increasingly complex and systematic, making open cooperation both a trend and an inevitable choice. China will continue to expand openness in science and technology, broaden and deepen joint research, actively participate in global technology governance, collaborate with all nations to solve practical problems and jointly address global challenges, he said. He said China's doors will always remain open to talents from all countries. The Chinese government will further optimise relevant policies, enhance service guarantees, and build more international exchange and cooperation platforms, continuously creating favourable conditions for foreign talents to work in China, said the premier.- Subscribe now Page 2: There's a report on the Central and State Organs Party Work and Discipline Inspection Work Conference, which was held in Beijing on Sunday. Cai Qi attended this meeting. The meeting called on all departments to -study and understand- Xi's important speeches and instructions on Party building in government organs -in a coherent manner and implement them as a whole.- -The meeting noted that this year marks the conclusion of the 14th Five-Year Plan, and efforts should be made to promote high-quality development of Party building in government organs with a spirit of reform and innovation. Continuously use the Party's innovative theory to forge souls and unite hearts, work hard to deepen transformation, grasp the key points of learning, improve the learning mechanism, and truly learn deeply and thoroughly. Strengthen Party political construction, enhance political leadership, strengthen political experience, increase political consciousness, and strictly implement the responsibility system for ideological work. Forge strong and powerful battle fortresses, enhance the political functions and organisational functions of grassroots Party organizations, and stimulate the motivation of Party members and cadres to take responsibility and act. Consolidate the main responsibility for Party building in government organs, adhere to secretaries taking charge and managing secretaries, implement ‘one post, dual responsibilities', strengthen work committee guidance and supervision, and construct a responsibility system with clear responsibilities, proper fulfillment, strong supervision, and precise accountability.- ，--，。，，，，。，，，，。，，。，、，--，，、、、. The meeting also called to implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th CCDI. Subscribe now CMC Vice chairmen Zhang Youxia and He Weidong also met with the troops ahead of the Spring Festival. Zhang visited a unit of the Information Support Force. Zhang said that: -We must resolutely implement Chairman Xi's decisions and deployments, focus on fighting the tough battle to achieve the centenary goal of army building, strengthen political leadership, deepen combat training and preparedness, ensure reform implementation, and strive to create a new situation in the construction of the troops.- ，，，，，，。 Zhang -emphasized the need to truly learn, understand, believe in, and use Xi Jinping Thought on Strengthening the Military, thoroughly implement the spirit of the CMC's political work conference, continue to deepen political training, highlight the building of a strong party committee, and tightly grasp discipline rectification, strict rules, and strengthening work style, and further build a political character of obeying the Party's command and being loyal to the Party. Zhang Youxia pointed out that we must focus on enhancing service support capability for combat readiness, strengthen coordination of war preparation and construction, promote planning breakthroughs, strongly enforce practical combat training, and accelerate integration into the system, drive the system, and empower the system. We must steadily advance the implementation of reform tasks, innovate construction management models, enrich new domain and new quality combat forces, and implement transformation and development requirements in all aspects of construction.- ，，，，，、、，、。，，，，，、、。，，，. He also called to -strengthen the political and organisational functions of grassroots Party organizations, rectify formalism and bureaucracy to reduce the burden on the grassroots, and seriously investigate and deal with corruption and unhealthy practices among officers and soldiers. We must improve the risk warning and prevention mechanism, do a solid job in security and stability, and ensure high-quality development with high-level security.- ，，，、，。，，. Share Tracking People's Daily He Weidong visited the troops stationed in Beijing. These included an Air Force radar unit and a brigade of the transport and search and rescue aviation unit. He too stressed the importance of achieving the 100th anniversary goal of the PLA. The report adds: He said that -the troops stationed near the capital hold a significant position and carry a heavy mission. They must unswervingly hold high the banner and forge the soul persistently apply Xi Jinping Thought on Strengthening the military to guide unit-building and personnel development, earnestly implement the spirit of the CMC's Political Work Conference, deepen political training, guide officers and soldiers to deeply understand the decisive significance of the two establishments, resolutely achieve the two safeguards, implement the CMC chairman responsibility system, and ensure that the troops are loyal, pure and reliable.- ，，、，，，，，--，--，，。 He added that -we must concentrate on training and preparing for war, maintain a constant state of combat readiness, increase the intensity of actual combat military training, strengthen the construction of new-quality combat effectiveness, cultivate a fighting spirit of daring to fight and win, and forge combat abilities that are trustworthy, reliable, and ready for use at any time.- ，，，，，，、. Finally, there's a report (English report) informing that China's electricity consumption rose by 6.8 percent year on year in 2024, according to data released by the National Energy Administration. The total figure for the year was 9.85 trillion kilowatt-hours (kWh), the data showed. During 2024, power consumption by the country's primary industries increased by 6.3 percent year on year, while that of its secondary and tertiary sectors rose by 5.1 percent and 9.9 percent, respectively. Residential power usage saw strong growth of 10.6 percent last year. Page 4: There's a report informing that in December, there were 33,100 violations of the spirit of the eight-point central regulations that were investigated and punished. A total of 44,334 people (including 2 provincial and ministerial officials and 79 prefecture-level officials) were criticized and educated, and 33,372 people were handed Party discipline and administrative sanctions. Subscribe now Page 9: On the theory page today, there's a full-page interview-based article making the point that China is a staunch defender of the international order. It's not surprising that Beijing is making this argument. This will be a big part of China's pitch to the world, given the policies that we are already witnessing from the Donald Trump administration in Washington. In this piece, the three guests who are commenting are: Chen Dongxiao, President of Shanghai Institutes for International Studies Professor Zhai Kun, School of International Relations, Peking University Wu Hao, Associate Professor of the Academy of Regional and Global Governance at Beijing Foreign Studies University My brief take: The conversation is divided into four parts. I am doing a deep dive into each of these. This was an interesting read. There is little in this conversation around China's engagement with specific major powers or regions. This is largely about China's broad approach to multilateral institutions, globalisation and global governance with an emphasis on morality and support for the Global South. There is, of course, sharp and thinly-veiled criticism of the US and its economic policies. Another interesting aspect of this conversation is a reaffirmation about China's revisionist — not revolutionary — approach to multilateral institutions. This approach is only going to be further boosted with the US under Trump ceding space to Beijing at international forums and on issues of global significance, such as health and climate change. The final point that I'd like to make here is that the conversation also underscores deep anxiety about the emergence of disorder and geopolitical contestation, which are weakening institutions and presenting challenges for deal-making even on issues of shared interests. The first bit of the conversation is around the UN and structure of the international order. The moderator asks the speakers to describe the current international order, adding that what is the significance of abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter for maintaining the current international order? Chen says: -The current international order is a set of international rules and its guarantee mechanisms established by countries around the world after World War II, drawing on the painful lessons of the two world wars suffered by mankind in the 20th century, based on the results of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War, and with the fundamental goals of maintaining world peace, promoting common development and universal human rights. The UN Charter laid the foundation for the current international order. To maintain the current international order, the first thing is to adhere to the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. As the world enters a new period of turbulence and volatility, the importance of abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter has become more prominent. Hegemonism, unilateralism and protectionism are the main sources of chaos in the world today; they run counter to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. To ensure an equal and orderly process of world multi-polasization, we must jointly abide by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and jointly uphold the universally recognised basic norms of international relations. To ensure a process of economic globalisation that is inclusive and beneficial and to effectively respond to new challenges such as climate change, we must strengthen the authority of the United Nations and practice true multilateralism.- ：20，，、。。，。，。、、，。，，。，，，。 Zhai defines the international order as comprising ‘three ones': there is only one system in the world, that is, the international system with the United Nations at its core; there is only one order, that is, the international order based on international law; there is only one set of rules, that is, the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. Adhering to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter has multiple meanings for maintaining the current international system. First, inclusiveness; currently, the United Nations has 193 member states, covering the vast majority of countries in the current international system. Second, legitimacy; the UN Charter must be adhered to by all UN member states. Third, baseline standard; the purposes and principles of the United Nations are the benchmark/baseline standard for ‘working together to overcome difficulties' . Fourth, unity; have proposals for a future new order, which underscores the urgency of adhering to the UN Charter to ensure cohesion. ：，，，--：，；，；，。：，193，；，；，--；，，. The next question is about the challenges of implementing the purposes and principles of the UN Charter because the work of the UN -is sometimes obstructed by unilateralism, hegemonism and power politics. A few countries advocate for a so-called ‘rules-based international order', which has caused serious harm to the effectiveness and authority of the United Nations. In the current international context, how does China support and strengthen the role of the UN as the core platform of multilateralism? Wu Hao doesn't really answer the question. Wu calls the UN Charter the ‘textbook' of fairness and justice, saying that it must be implemented and one must remember the original aspirations. The moderator then reminds us that -this year marks the 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations and the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. President Xi Jinping has pointed out: ‘Our predecessors gathered wisdom from all parties to formulate the UN Charter, laid the cornerstone of the modern international order, and established the basic norms of contemporary international relations'. As one of the anti-fascist allies with the largest casualties in World War II and the first founding member to sign the UN Charter, China has always regarded defending the authority of the United Nations and maintaining the post-World War II international order as its sacred duty.- In response, Zhai says that -as the core platform of multilateralism, the United Nations has never stopped facing challenges. The logic of multilateralism is to serve the interests of the majority of countries, which inevitably stands in opposition to unilateralism and hegemonism. Therefore, the UN needs to advocate and maintain true multilateralism. China has explored a set of systematic measures: first, resolutely supporting and defending the UN, clearly proposing the aforementioned ‘three ones'; second, increasing its contributions to UN funding, supporting UN peacekeeping operations, promoting South-South cooperation, and strengthening the ‘Global South', thereby making multilateral forces more balanced; third, continuously launch global governance initiatives and putting them into practice.- ：，。，、。，。：，--；，，，--，；. Chen adds that one of the most significant aspects of China's support for the UN is that its -financial contribution to the United Nations has continued to increase over the past decade. China has become the second largest contributor to the United Nations dues and peacekeeping contributions, and will bear more than 20% of the United Nations' regular budget expenditures between 2025 and 2027.- Wu adds that -China is the largest contributor of troops to peacekeeping operations among the permanent members of the UN Security Council.- ：，10，，2025202720%。：：。35. The next question is on international agreements. Chen says that -In the face of the United States beginning a new round of withdrawing from UN mechanisms, China has taken concrete actions to firmly support the United Nations and other organizations in playing a greater role in international affairs. For example, China strictly fulfills its obligations of the NPT and is the only one among the five nuclear-weapon states to pledge unconditionally not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states and regions.- ：，。，《》，。(Note: I guess Chen hasn't heard about the Pakistani and North Korean nuclear programmes.) Wu talks about the Paris climate accord, linking it personally to Xi Jinping, as a means of demonstrating commitment at the highest level. -In 2016, President Xi Jinping personally deposited the legal instruments of China's ratification of the Paris Agreement…-, he stresses. Share Tracking People's Daily The second part of the conversation is around China's call for -equal and orderly world multi-polarisation-. This implies -insisting on the equality of all countries, big and small, opposing hegemony and power politics, and effectively promoting the democratisation of international relations.- ，，，. The moderator asks that -at present, the international community is increasingly concerned about the ‘cooperation deficit' and ‘order deficit'.- He also talks about the discussions around a new Cold War and balance of power. Zhai argues that the current situation with geo-political contestation becoming evident and explicit, prevailing deficit in global governance, major power relations ‘polarization', and international situation ‘volatility' pose significant challenges to the process of world multipolarization. First, there is the inversion of cause and effect, wherein the geopolitical drivers of global disorder are attributed to be the product of ‘the rise of the East and decline of the West' and the impact of ‘Global South' countries challenging the Western-dominated order. Second, there is a neglect of the role of multipolar forces; for instance, the Eurasia Group's 2025 global risk forecast highlights a ‘G0' world, implying a ‘poleless/leaderless world'. Third, it results in coordination difficulties among multipolar forces, impacting the achievement of substantive consultation results within the multilateral framework by countries that are considered to be multipolar forces. ：，--、--、--、--，。，--，--；，2025-G0-，--；，。 Chen adds that -unity and cooperation are the only correct choices for maintaining international order stability and addressing global challenges. Currently, the ‘new Cold War' mentality and hegemonic practices primarily damage international cooperation and mutual trust, exacerbating the risk of bloc confrontations in the international community, harming global partnerships, and making trust-building mechanisms difficult to establish. Cooperation requires all parties to balance their own national interests with the legitimate demands of other countries to achieve mutual benefits. Excessive pursuit of self-interest or blind pursuit of absolute security will inevitably lead to a decline in the willingness to cooperate, and the ‘cooperation deficit' will become more prominent. While some countries may appear to gain short-term benefits on specific issues, they ultimately will fall into a cycle of isolation and confrontation. In order to maintain their dominance in international affairs, hegemonic countries often use means such as interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and creating divisions. This not only worsens the regional and international security situation but also makes the process of world multi-polarization unstable. Hegemonic countries are guided by the desire to maintain monopoly interests and absolute security, and adopt the utilitarian and opportunistic principles of ‘use when it suits you, and abandon if it doesn't' for international rules and order, resulting in the existing international order facing a crisis of collapse.- ：。，--，，，。，。，--，，。，、，，。，-，-，. The next question that the moderator asks is what are China's considerations when actively advocating for equal and orderly world multi-polarisation? What specific measures have been taken? What does it mean for maintaining the current international order? In asking this, the moderator also offered a quote from Henry Kissinger. I am mentioning, since Kissinger gets referenced in one of the responses below too. In response, Wu stresses the principle of sovereign equality as being fundamental. Zhai adds that -as I understand it, the general direction of the world order is the result of a multitude of forces and is joint governance based on multipolarity. This is an assessment based on the superposition of three facts. Western countries can no longer constructively promote the building of world order. Acknowledging and accepting the role of ‘multipolar' countries in world order is a historical trend. Second, countries called ‘multipolar' will inevitably play a major role in the evolution of the world order as Kissinger had expected. Third, the expansion of the BRICS and the emergence of the concept of ‘Global South' show that China actively advocates equal and orderly world multipolarity. This is not to exclude the ‘old poles' and to win over ‘new poles', but about calling for global governance of global issues by multipolar forces, including both old and new poles. This is fundamentally different from the old order and a watershed in history.- ：，，。：，--；--，，；--，，--，--，。，. (Note: This is really interesting. The argument is not about replacing the West but about accommodating Chinese interests. It is essentially a case for spheres of influence although couched in rather inclusive language.) The next question that the moderator asks is about the Global South and China's advocacy around the Global South. Chen responds by saying that -China is a natural member of the ‘Global South' and has always promoted openness, inclusiveness and cooperation in the ‘Global South'. He then points to GSI, GCI and BRI. He says that the -global governance concept advocated by China has won widespread response from the countries of the Global South, and has effectively promoted the process of world multi-polarisation and democratisation of international relations.- Share Tracking People's Daily The third part of the conversation is on the theme of inclusive economic globalisation. The moderator asks: -How does inclusive economic globalisation reflect the voice of the Global South countries and embody the interests of the Global South countries? What role has China played in it? What specific measures have been taken?- In asking this question the moderator also talked about the North-South gap, presenting this data point: -during the COVID-19 pandemic, the G7 received a total of $280 billion in funds from the International Monetary Fund, while some of the least developed countries with a population far exceeding that of the G7 received only about $8 billion in total.- (Note: Such disparity is, of course, unconscionable.) ：，、。，，，2800，80。，--，。--、--？？? Wu says that inclusive economic globalisation -is about supporting each country to independently and autonomously find a development path that suits their own national conditions, opposing the monotonisation/homogenisation of development models, rejecting all forms of unilateralism and protectionism, promoting the liberalisation and facilitation of trade and investment, maintaining the stability and smooth flow of global industrial and supply chains, and preserving the vitality and momentum of global economic growth.- ，，，，，，. The moderator then asks about BRI and GDI. Chen says that GDI has -gathered consensus among all parties, promoted North-South dialogue and South-South cooperation, and has been supported and participated by more than 100 countries and multiple international organizations, including the United Nations.- ：，，，100。 The next bit is interesting: Moderator: Faced with the shadow of protectionism, and with some countries frequently advocating for ‘decoupling' and ‘building walls', how has China continued to adhere to and maintain the rules and systems of trade liberalisation and multilateral trading system that have been fully proven to be correct and effective in practice, and constantly innovated, improved and developed, and worked to build an open world economic system? ：，----，、，、，？ Wu outlines four points. First, maintaining the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core: since joining the WTO in December 2001, China has fully fulfilled its WTO commitments, unswervingly expanded opening up, and continued to promote the liberalisation and facilitation of global trade and investment. Second, accelerating the implementation of the free trade zone strategy and steadily expanding institutional opening up. China has built and operated 22 free trade pilot zones. Third, focusing on expanding the global high-standard free trade zone network. China has signed 23 free trade agreements with 30 countries and regions, and has implemented the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with high quality. Fourth, holding events like the China International Import Expo to inject new impetus into the open world economy. ：，，200112，，，；，，22；，3023，《》；，. Zhai says that China's approach has been to maintain integrity while seeking innovation. This has two meanings. One is to uphold integrity and make innovations within the existing international system and multilateral mechanisms. The most typical example is China's accession to the WTO and its efforts to promote the reform of the WTO, as well as to innovate rules and standards that better meet the development needs of the Global South countries. The other is to uphold integrity and make innovations outside the existing international system and multilateral mechanisms. Currently, multilateral mechanisms and institutions face challenges such as development stagnation and institutional dilemmas. Building an open global economic system requires multilateral mechanisms that can adapt to new characteristics, solve new problems, and promote new developments. China has excelled in this aspect, for example, by initiating the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Silk Road Fund, and others. ：，--。，。，--。。、。，、、。，、. Moderator: The Central Foreign Affairs Work Conference pointed out that inclusive economic globalisation ‘must the attempt to roll back globalisation and abuse the concept of security, oppose all forms of unilateralism and protectionism, firmly promote trade and investment liberalisation and facilitation, overcome the structural problems hindering the healthy development of the world economy, and make economic globalisation more open, inclusive, universally beneficial and balanced'. How should one interpret the concepts of being open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all? What is the significance of the value concepts demonstrated by these four ‘keywords' for maintaining the current international order? ：，-、，、，，，、、、-。、、、？--？ Chen says: The current world economic order is facing severe challenges of anti-globalisation and pan-securitisation. Advocating the construction of an open world economic system and promoting economic globalisation in a more open, inclusive, balanced and universally beneficial direction are important international public goods provided by China. Openness aims to deepen international division of labor and cooperation, so that commodities, services, capital, technology, personnel, data and other factors can flow and be allocated more freely, conveniently and in an orderly manner on a global scale, thereby promoting the deep integration and development of the economies of countries around the world. Inclusiveness means recognizing the differences in history, culture, social systems and development level among countries around the world, respecting the development paths and models chosen independently by countries, abandoning discriminatory and exclusive standards and rules, and achieving common development. Universally beneficial emphasises that the fruits of economic globalization should benefit more countries around the world, especially the Global South countries, so that different countries, classes and people can participate in and share the fruits of economic and social development, and achieve mutual benefit and common prosperity. Balanced entails being committed to alleviating the imbalance of development between countries and within countries caused by differences in resource endowments and unfair global resource allocation, as well as addressing the balance between economic growth, social development and environmental protection among countries, and promoting the coordinated development of the world economy. These four ‘keywords' reflect the value pursuit in the era of economic globalization and are of great significance to promoting human progress. In sum, openness has injected a steady stream of strength into human progress, inclusiveness has promoted international cooperation and mutual trust, universally beneficial has turned the promise of not leaving anyone or any country behind into reality, and balanced has continuously improved the fairness and sustainability of world economic development. ：。，、、、，。，，、、、、、，。，、、，，、，。，--，、，。，，、、，。--，。，，，、，. Wu Hao added: -As mentioned earlier, equal multipolarity and orderly multipolarity correspond in a certain sense to ‘democracy' and ‘justice' among the common values of humanity. Universally beneficial economic globalisation and inclusive economic globalisation correspond in a certain sense to ‘fairness' and ‘freedom' among the common values of humanity. Additionally, openness and peace, balance and development are each a dialectically unified organic whole: peace is the prerequisite for openness, balance is the ideal state of development. Promoting economic globalisation toward a more open, inclusive, universally beneficial, and balanced direction, achieving equal and orderly world multi-polarisation—openness, inclusiveness, universal benefit, balance, equality, and order truly interpret the connotations of the common values of humanity of ‘peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy, freedom', and serve as a ‘fixed star/guide/stabilising force' for the current international order.- ：，，----。，、：，。、、、，——、、、、、-、、、、、-，--. Share Tracking People's Daily The fourth and final part of the conversation is around the reform of the global governance system. In this the moderator makes the point that Xi has said that -promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind is not to replace one system with another, nor is it to replace one civilisation with another, but rather about countries with different social systems, different ideologies, different historical cultures, and different development levels sharing interests, rights, and responsibilities in international affairs, forming the greatest common denominator for jointly building a better world.- ：：-，，，、、、、、，.- Chen responds by saying that -strengthening and reforming the global governance system is an objective requirement for the development and progress of human society. In the face of global challenges, especially when some countries wield the big stick of unilateralism and protectionism, the global governance system can only be strengthened, not weakened. At the same time, the global governance system must also reflect the changes in the world economic landscape, developing in a more just and reasonable direction. For a long time, some important international organizations have been dominated by a small number of developed countries, and the legitimate interests and demands of Global South countries have not been fully reflected. For this reason, China advocates true multilateralism, advocates increasing the representation and voice of Global South countries, and advocates respecting the cultural traditions and developmental stage differences of various countries, promoting the establishment of a more fair, reasonable, and effective international rules system.- ：。，、，，。，，。，，--。，，--，，、、. The moderator then chimes in to say that -the starting point and end goal of China's participation in and promotion of the reform of the global governance system is to continuously enhance the inclusiveness, legitimacy and effectiveness of the global governance system on the basis of adhering to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter-. ：，，，，、。 In response, Wu Hao outlines four points about China's approach to global governance. -First, it takes the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind as its value guide, advocating that all countries jointly discuss global affairs, jointly build governance systems, and jointly share governance results. Second, it focuses on the most prominent development, security, and civilizational issues in the world today, and provides international public goods represented by the ‘three major global initiatives'. Third, it takes the high-quality joint construction of BRI as a practical platform, continuously expanding the scope of cooperation, innovating cooperation models, and achieving fruitful results. Fourth, it provides new aspects to global governance system reform, proposing concepts such as building a community of common health for mankind and a community of life between humans and nature, which have become new highlights in the reform of the global governance system.- ：，：，、、；、、，--；--，、，；，、，. Finally, the moderator asks that given that the reform of the global governance system is at a historical turning point, going forward, how can China further play the role of a responsible major country, firmly safeguard the current international order, and promote the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction? Chen responds: In the future, the world will face an increase in instability, uncertainty, and unpredictable factors. To further demonstrate the role of a responsible major power, China must adhere to true multilateralism, maintain the United Nations' core position and leading role in international affairs, promote the practical adherence to the UN Charter's purposes and principles, support reasonable UN reform, and make the UN better adapt to changes in the international situation. It is essential to practice a global governance approach based on consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits, push for reforms in the global governance system, deepen and expand global partnerships, strengthen important platforms and mechanisms such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the ‘G77 and China', and unite the consensus and efforts of the Global South countries. It is essential to proactively take the lead in rule-making, ensuring that rules fully reflect the interests and demands of the vast developing countries. It is essential to continuously enhance comprehensive national strength, consolidate capabilities and foundations, continuously release the dividends of Chinese-style modernization, and provide a solid material foundation for playing a greater role in global governance. ：，、。，，，，，。，，，、-77-，--。，。，，，。 Zhai ends by saying that -a just and reasonable international order can bring a good external environment to the greatest majority of people globally…The Pact for the Future adopted at the UN's Summit of the Future in September 2024 shows that countries can unite to reshape a multilateral system that serves all people and all nations. China will join hands with all parties to recall the original intention of the establishment of the UN, firmly maintain the UN's authority and role, advocate for equal and orderly world multipolarity and inclusive economic globalisation, and build a solid foundation for world peace and development. In this sense, China maintains the current international order and also shapes the future international order.- ：。，：-，……，。-。9《》，，。，，、，。，，.

It is necessary to strengthen ideological and political guidance, promote the fine tradition of patriotism and love for religion, and guide religious circles and believers to enhance the ‘five identifications'. It is essential to systematically promote the sinicisation of religion in China, adhere to the guidance of the core socialist values ​​and the immersion of Chinese culture, and gradually form religious doctrines and thoughts that conform to the characteristics of China's national conditions. It is essential to strengthen law-based governance of religious affairs, promote religious circles and believers to enhance sense of national consciousness, civic consciousness, and legal consciousness, and ensure that their work is law-based and rule-guided. It is essential to continue to promote comprehensive and strict governance of religion, and improve the ability and level of self-education, self-management, and self-discipline of religious circles.- ，，，，，，，。，，--。，、，。，、、，、。，、、。 Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the page is a report (English report) on China's total R&amp;D spending for 2024, which exceeded 3.6 trillion yuan (about $500 billion) in 2024, up 8.3 percent year on year.

Xi-Putin Meeting - New Rural Revitalisation Plan - Getting Long-term Funds into Stock Market - China-Bangladesh Ties - Zhong Caiwen Article on Balanci...	Let me begin with a brief announcement, owing to the requests that we've received, we've extended the deadline for final applications for the Watching China course. Please complete the application and payment by Monday, January 27, 2025, 11:59 PM India Time. The course begins on Saturday, February 1, 2025. Course and application details are available here. Before I get to today's edition, let me cover Xi Jinping's meeting with Vladimir Putin and Ding Xuexiang's remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The Chinese readout of the meeting between Xi and Putin says: -President Xi recalled the three meetings he had with President Putin in 2024 and the many important common understandings they reached. In 2024, the two countries celebrated the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic ties. The bilateral relationship, centering on the spirit of lasting good-neighborliness and friendship, comprehensive strategic coordination, and mutually beneficial cooperation, demonstrated renewed vitality. The China-Russia Years of Culture had many highlights. Practical cooperation made steady progress. Two-way trade maintained growth momentum. Close coordination in such multilateral fora as the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and BRICS provided more positive energy to the reform and development of the global governance system. President Xi stressed his readiness to work with President Putin and guide China-Russia relations to a new height in 2025, to respond to external uncertainties with the stability and resilience of China-Russia ties, to boost the development and prosperity of both countries, and to uphold international fairness and justice. He underscored the need for the two countries to deepen strategic coordination, firmly support each other, and defend their legitimate interests. He also noted the need to cement and expand bilateral relations with a view to deepening practical cooperation. This year marks the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression, the Soviet Union's Great Patriotic War and the World Anti-Fascist War. It also marks the 80th anniversary of the United Nations. China and Russia should take the opportunities presented by the anniversaries to jointly safeguard the U.N.-centered international system and the fruits of victory in World War II, and to call on all countries to observe the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, uphold universally recognized basic norms of international relations, and follow true multilateralism. As the rotating president of the SCO, China will work with Russia and other member states to take the organization to a new stage featuring higher-quality development and greater responsibility and contribution. China and Russia should also work together to advance greater BRICS cooperation and write a new chapter of the Global South pursuing strength through unity.- The Russian readout of Putin's remarks is available here, if you are interested. Putin told Xi: -I agree with you that the basis of cooperation between Moscow and Beijing is a broad community of national interests and a coincidence of views on what relations between major powers should be. We build our ties on the basis of friendship, mutual trust and support, equality and mutual benefit. These ties are self-sufficient and do not depend on domestic political factors and the current global situation. Their comprehensive strengthening fully meets the objectives of the comprehensive development of Russia and China, increasing the well-being of the peoples of both countries.- He also said: -We jointly advocate for the construction of a more just multipolar world order, and work to ensure indivisible security in the Eurasian space and in the world as a whole. It is safe to say that foreign policy relations, the joint work of Russia and China objectively play an important stabilizing role in international affairs.- Reuters' report is interesting. It adds: The two leaders discussed -how to build ties with Donald Trump, prospects for a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine and Moscow's firm support for Beijing's position on Taiwan. Xi and Putin, who spoke for an hour and 35 minutes by video call after Trump was sworn in as U.S. president on Monday, proposed a further deepening of the strategic partnership between their countries which worries the West…Xi and Putin ‘have indicated a willingness to build relations with the United States on a mutually beneficial, mutually respectful basis, if the Trump team really shows interest in this,' Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters in Moscow. ‘It was also noted from our side that we are ready for dialogue with the new U.S. administration on the Ukrainian conflict.' Ushakov said Putin wanted long-term peace in Ukraine, not a short-term ceasefire, but any deal must take into account Russia's interests. No specific proposals for a call with Trump have been received, he said.- Share Tracking People's Daily Next, speaking at the WEF, Ding made a pitch for economic globalisation. I am going to use a mix of the text on the WEF's website and the report in the People's Daily yesterday. This is because some bits of the speech available on the WEF's website are not quoted in the PD report and some of the language of the speech on the WEF website is not the same as what the Chinese version carries. Ding said: Economic globalisation is -an overwhelming trend of history. Over the years, despite some headwinds and setbacks, economic globalization has demonstrated strong resilience and dynamism. According to WTO [World Trade Organization] statistics, the total volume of global trade has grown by an average of 5.8% per year since 1995, and reached $30.4 trillion in 2023. Between 1995 and 2022, the share of middle- and low-income countries in global export rose from 16% to 32%. And developed countries did not lose out from this. Their growth rates and the well-being of their peoples have also been effectively boosted. Economic globalization is not a ‘you lose, I win' zero-sum game, but a universally beneficial process where all can benefit and win together. Admittedly, economic globalization will bring some tensions and disagreements on distribution. These issues can only be resolved in the process of promoting economic globalization. Protectionism leads nowhere. Trade war has no winners. We must seize all opportunities to steer economic globalization in the right direction, tackle the development challenges with universal benefit, and pool strengths with inclusive cooperation, so as to usher in a new phase of economic globalization that is more dynamic, more inclusive and more sustainable.- -We must hold high the banner of multilateralism, pursue the vision of global governance featuring extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefit, and ensure equal rights, equal opportunities and equal rules for all countries in international affairs … We should firmly uphold the multilateral trading system with WTO at its core, uphold its role as the main channel for rules-making on international trade, and foster an open, inclusive and nondiscriminatory environment for international economic cooperation.- -We need to jointly foster new drivers and strengths for global economic development…In today's world, the new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation is deepening, cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), quantum technology and biomedicine are flourishing, and digital, green and intelligent development is picking up pace. We should seize and make the most of these opportunities to enhance connectivity in the digital age, promote international cooperation on scientific and technological innovation, help countries strengthen emerging and future industries, and accelerate the cultivation and development of new quality productive forces…we should help developing countries build AI, intelligent transportation, smart energy and other new infrastructure, and promote the application of information technology in key livelihood sectors, so that more countries can get on board the fast train of digital economic development.- He talked about -challenges such as climate change, food security and energy security- and pitched GDI, GSI and GCI. He also said that -The international community should work together to accelerate the energy transition in an equitable, orderly and just manner, keep the new energy industrial chain stable, and promote green products and technologies. We must follow a consistent approach in addressing climate change and improve the consistency of environmental and climate policies and economic and trade policies, so as to prevent economic and trade frictions from impeding the process of green transition, and avoid erecting green barriers that could disrupt normal economic and trade cooperation.- Then on the Chinese economy, Ding said that it -has rebounded and turned for the better. The headwinds encountered by the Chinese economy are due to both the external environment and temporary pains brought by our own economic restructuring.- -China will further increase the intensity of macroeconomic policies, implement more proactive fiscal policy and a moderately loose monetary policy, and promote the effective improvement of economic quality and reasonable growth in quantity. Second, the green and low-carbon transformation is accelerating. China has built the world's largest and most complete new energy industry chain. Seventy percent of the photovoltaic components and 60% of wind power equipment worldwide come from China. This high-quality production capacity has served as a strong boost to global green development and climate response…China's pursuit of green transition is a long-term commitment rather than an act of expediency. No matter how the international landscape may evolve, China's determination and action for proactive climate response will not change. We will make tireless efforts to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate pollution while expanding green transition and promoting economic growth, accelerate the comprehensive transition to green economic and social development, observe the goals and principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement, and make greater contributions to global climate response. Third, reform and opening up are constantly moving towards a higher level…We will build a high-standard socialist market economy, foster a fairer and more dynamic market environment, and make resource allocation as efficient and productive as possible…Last year, China lifted all restrictions on foreign investment in manufacturing and established a negative-list system for cross-border trade in services. And we have been taking systematic steps to further open important sectors like telecom, the internet, education, culture and medical services. In terms of foreign trade, we don't seek trade surplus; we want to import more competitive quality products and services to promote balanced trade. China's overall tariff level has been cut to 7.3% – a fairly low level in the world – and we give all least developed countries having diplomatic relations with China zero-tariff treatment for 100% tariff lines…In terms of business environment, we know issues like China's IPR [intellectual property rights] protection, equal participation in government procurement, cross-border data flow, access to factors of production, qualification approval and standard setting are of great interest to multinationals. In these areas, we are continuously improving relevant institutions and policies…China's door of opening up will not be closed and will only open even wider, and our business environment will only get better. We sincerely welcome more foreign enterprises to invest and do business in China, and achieve greater success in sharing China's opportunities.- Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, January 23, 2025. Page 1: Xi Jinping is currently visiting Liaoning. I'll cover his visit as the paper does, i.e., once it's complete. In the meantime, the lead report today is about the new Plan for Comprehensive Rural Revitalization (2024-2027). The full plan is published in the paper. I am only going to summarise some key points: It promises -substantial progress- in rural revitalization by 2027 and -decisive progress- by 2035. The latter also means that -agricultural modernization will be basically achieved and rural areas will basically have modern living conditions.- 、。2035，，，. With regard to food security, the plan says that it will be treated as -the primary task of modern agricultural development-. In terms of targets, the plan calls to: ensure that grain planting areas remain stable at about 1.75 billion mu, and cereal areas remain around 1.45 billion mu increase grain production capacity by 100 billion jin and promote the steady increase of grain production capacity to 1.4 trillion jin implement the national soybean and oilseed production capacity improvement project improve the market monitoring and early warning system, coordinate the market-oriented policy-based grain procurement and storage system, improve the reserve system… increase investment in high-standard farmland construction strengthen agricultural science and technology and equipment support… construct major scientific and technological infrastructure, strengthen original research; increase efforts in key core technology breakthroughs, enhance technological integration and application; improve agricultural technology extension service system…accelerate the revitalisation of the seed industry by building facilities and platforms for germplasm resource preservation and identification; expedite breakthroughs in core seed source technologies, reinforce the role of enterprises as the main drivers of technological innovation, and cultivate large-scale seed enterprises…develop large-scale high-end intelligent agricultural machinery… 。，，。，；，；。，；，，。，；；. One of the stated goals is to cultivate civilised rural areas. The top priority in this regard is to -organise study of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, widely carry out propaganda and education on Party history, New China history, reform and opening-up history, and socialist development history, deeply conduct ‘Listen to the Party, Feel the Party's Grace, Follow the Party' propaganda and education activities. Strengthen ethnic unity and progress propaganda and education, forge a solid consciousness of the Chinese national community. Implement the civilised rural style construction project, take the socialist core values ​​as the guide, and strengthen the work of cultivating, practicing, and creating civilisation.- ，、、、，-、、-。，。，，、、。 It also calls to -do a good job in popularising law and science, and oppose feudal superstitions…address prominent issues like high bride prices, extravagant weddings, and disorderly burials, improve restrictive norms and advocative standards for simplified wedding and funeral practices, and filial piety.- 、，...，，，、、，、、。（），，。 The plan also calls to improve overall rural infrastructure, public utilities, community service facilities, digital connectivity, etc, among other things. Moving on, there's a long article on the -two new- policy. The officials quoted in this essentially see the policy as useful to: stimulate the potential of domestic demand move manufacturing industry towards a ‘new'/intelligent and ‘green' future accelerate the overall green transformation through green consumption and recycling Some excerpts from the report: Since the implementation of the trade-in policy in March 2024, sales of consumer goods in the fields of automobiles and home appliances have improved. Statistics show that the retail sales of passenger cars in 2024 reached 22.894 million units, a year-on-year increase of 5.5%; the retail sales of household appliances and audio-visual equipment in units above the designated size reached 1030.7 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 12.3%. In addition to boosting consumption growth, the old-for-new exchange has also promoted industrial upgrading and green transformation. Li Gang, Director General of the Department of Market Operation and Consumption Promotion of the Ministry of Commerce, presented this set of data: In the old-for-new exchange of cars, the proportion of new energy vehicles exceeded 60%, and more than 6.6 million old cars were replaced with new energy vehicles or energy-saving vehicles; in the old-for-new exchange of home appliances, the sales of first-class energy-efficient products accounted for more than 90%, driving the retail sales of high-efficiency grade and smart home appliances to grow by double digits for four consecutive months; in the old-for-new exchange of home decor, kitchen and bathroom products, nearly 10 million smart home products, such as smart toilets, sweeping robots, and smart door locks were replaced; more than 1 million old electric bicycles were updated to safer lead-acid battery-powered vehicles.- 3，、。：20242289.4，5.5%；10307，12.3%。，、。：，60%，660；，90%，4；，、、1000；100. In 2024, among the 4,600-plus equipment renewal projects supported solely by funds from ultra-long-term special government bonds, the volume of equipment renewal in industries such as manufacturing, energy usage, energy and power, and transportation exceeded 2 million units (sets). Zhao Chenxin, NDRC's Deputy Director, said that preliminary estimates indicate that, driven by the ‘Two New' policies, the total volume of equipment renewal in key sectors nationwide exceeded 20 million units (sets). Investment in the purchase of equipment and tools has been strongly boosted: in 2024, it increased by 15.7% year-on-year, accelerating by 9.1 percentage points compared to the previous year, contributing 2.2 percentage points to overall investment growth…In 2024, over 11,000 new smart community recycling facilities for discarded materials were added nationwide, and the number of scrapped motor vehicles recycled reached 8.46 million, a year-on-year increase of 64%. Data from key enterprises monitored by the Ministry of Commerce show that the recycling volume of used household appliances achieved year-on-year growth for five consecutive months starting in July. By the end of 2024, a total of 168 important national standards under the ‘Two New' framework for fields such as household appliances, furniture, automobiles, and consumer drones were successively released. -2024，4600，、、、200（）。-，，--，2000（）。：202415.7%，9.1，2.2。、。2024，1.1，846，64%。，75。2024，、、、--168. In terms of expansion and changes in the Two New policy for 2025, the report says: Already there have been steps to strengthen support for the trade-in of household appliances like microwave ovens, water purifiers, dishwashers, rice cookers within the subsidy scope; the maximum subsidy for purchasing air conditioners has increased from one unit per consumer to three units; subsidies are being provided for the purchase of new mobile phones, tablets, smart watches and bracelets; and the scope of support for scrapping and updating of automobiles, including fuel vehicles that meet the National IV emission standards has been expanded Li Gang said that -detailed implementation rules for five sectors: automobiles, home appliances, home furnishing and kitchen/bathroom equipment, electric bicycles, and digital products such as smartphones- will be issued soon while considering connection with 2024 policies. Liu Dechun from the NDRC said that domains like electronic information, production safety, and facility agriculture will be included in ultra-long-term special bonds for support; there will be support for National IV emission standard commercial trucks scrapping and updating; rice transplanter and other 6 agricultural machinery types will be included in the support list; in terms of raising standards, the subsidy standards for new energy city buses and power battery renewal will be increased, and the average subsidy per vehicle will be increased from 60,000 yuan to 80,000 yuan. The total monetary allocation for the ‘two new' policy will be made clear at the NPC in March.

He highlighted Switzerland's unique role in international and regional affairs as a permanently neutral country and host to many international organizations. This year marks the 80th anniversary of the United Nations, Ding said, noting China is willing to continue to make good use of existing mechanisms and channels with Switzerland, maintain communication and coordinate positions on multilateral affairs and international and regional hotspot issues, jointly practice genuine multilateralism, and contribute further to building a community with a shared future for mankind.- Share Next, there's a report on Wang Huning's remarks at a CPPCC meeting preparing for their March meeting. -Wang Huning said that it is necessary to thoroughly study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech on the work of the CPPCC, earnestly study and formulate implementation measures, and promote the high-quality development of the work of the CPPCC. It is necessary to carefully prepare and organize the convening of the 14th National Committee of the CPPCC, and implement the spirit of the eight-point central regulations and improve the style of writing and meetings throughout all aspects of the conference's work.

The meeting decided to submit the two draft reports for consideration to the 10th session of the Standing Committee of the 14th CPPCC National Committee, which is to be convened on March 1 and 2.- The meeting also revoked the membership of Lu Jin, former chairman of China National Gold Group. Lu has been under investigation since September 2024. Page 2: There's a brief report informing that the Central Financial Commission and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, along with other departments, has recently issued the implementation plan for promoting the entry of medium and long-term capital into the stock market. Global Times' report says: -The plan emphasized the importance of encouraging medium- and long-term investment funds - such as commercial insurance funds, the national social security fund, basic pension funds, enterprise annuity funds and public funds - to boost their presence in the stock market… The plan aims to enhance the proportion and stability of commercial insurance funds that are invested in A-shares. It seeks to guide large state-owned insurance companies to expand their A-share investments (including equity funds) in both scale and proportion. A long-term performance assessment cycle of at least three years will be introduced for state-owned insurance companies, with annual net asset returns weighted no more than 30 percent and three- to five-year performance indicators weighted at least 60 percent, the plan said. The plan also proposes optimizing the investment management mechanisms for the national social security fund and basic pension funds. This includes gradually increasing the proportion of equity investments by the national social security fund and implementing detailed long-term performance assessment mechanisms, such as a five-year cycle for the national social security fund and a three-year cycle for basic pension funds. Efforts will also focus on improving the market-oriented operation of enterprise annuity funds. This includes accelerating the introduction of three-year or longer performance assessment guidelines for enterprise annuity funds and supporting eligible employers in exploring individual investment options for annuities. Moreover, the plan aims to expand the scale and proportion of equity funds. The plan also seeks to optimize the capital market investment ecosystem. This includes encouraging listed companies to increase share buybacks and implement policies for multiple dividend distributions annually, per the plan.- Reuters' report on this says: -Authorities will in the first half of this year call on insurers to invest at least 100 billion yuan ($13.75 billion) of long-term funds into stocks, China Securities Regulatory Commission head Wu Qing said at a press conference. The regulator will encourage both state-owned and commercial insurers to invest 30% of new annual premiums in A-shares, and encourage mutual funds to increase their A-share holdings' tradable market value by at least 10% annually over the next three years, Wu said. The plan also involves guiding mutual fund managers to increase equity funds under their management, cut fund sales fee and promote the development of exchange-traded fund products.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: There's a report on ILD chief Liu Jianchao meeting with Bangladesh interim government's Advisor for Foreign Affairs Touhid Hossain. The Chinese readout of the meeting says: -Liu Jianchao said that China and Bangladesh have been good friends and partners for a long time, and the people of the two countries have deep friendship with each other. Bilateral relations have withstood the test of international situation and the changing domestic situation in Bangladesh and maintained a strong momentum of development. China supports the Bangladeshi people in choosing their own development path and supports the interim government of Bangladesh in advancing political reform and election agenda. I believe that Bangladesh will overcome difficulties and return to the track of unity, stability, prosperity and development. China is willing to work with Bangladesh to promote cooperation in areas such as the joint construction of the ‘Belt and Road' and promote the continued development of the China-Bangladesh comprehensive strategic partnership.

The Xinhua report gives very little away; and I am unable to identify a Brazilian readout of the call. My sense, however, is that the war in Ukraine was the key component of this conversation. Wang said that -as the BRICS family continues to expand, China supports Brazil in assuming the BRICS presidency this year and pushing for new achievements in greater BRICS cooperation, Wang said. China supports Brazil in hosting the UN climate change conference…This year marks the 10th anniversary of the launch of the China-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) Forum, and China is ready to work with Brazil and other countries to build a China-Latin America community with a shared future, Wang said. Noting that the Ukraine crisis has been going on for nearly three years, Wang said that the ‘six-point consensus' jointly issued by China and Brazil on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis and the establishment of the ‘Friends of Peace' platform on the Ukraine crisis are to gather consensus from the Global South and create an atmosphere and accumulate conditions for the realization of peace talks.- The report ends with this: -Noting that the ‘six-point consensus' reached by Brazil and China on the Ukraine crisis is of great significance, Amorim said that the two sides should seize the opportunity to further leverage the role of the ‘Friends of Peace' platform.- Page 4: Some appointments to note.

Share Tracking People's Daily Page 9: There's a full page article under the byline Zhong Caiwen . I am not sure which institution this byline is attached to, but Bill Bishop has in the past suggested that it might be the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission. The article today does a deep dive into the five relationships, which were outlined in the 2024 CEWC readout. These must be balanced well going forward for economic development to progress. These are: It is necessary to balance the relationship between an effective market and a capable government, forming an economic order that is both ‘let loose/engender freedom or autonomy' () and ‘regulated/controlled'(). It is necessary to balance the relationship between total supply and total demand to ensure smooth circulation in the national economy. It is necessary to balance the relationship between cultivating new drivers of growth and renewing old ones, developing new quality productive forces according to local conditions. It is necessary to balance the relationship between improving incremental additions and revitalising existing stock, and comprehensively enhance resource allocation efficiency. It is necessary to balance the relationship between improving quality and expanding total quantity and consolidate the material foundation of Chinese-style modernisation. ，----。，。，。，。，. This will be a long summary. So buckle up. For the first point, the author argues: -Managing the relationship between the government and the market is the core issue of economic system reform. The combination of an effective market and a proactive government is a key factor in the success of China's socialist market economy. Historical experience since the reform and opening-up shows that the socialist market economy can leverage the strengths of the market economy, allowing the market to play a decisive role in resource allocation, while also demonstrating the advantages of the socialist system by better enabling the government's role. This dual approach has provided institutional support for achieving the -two miracles- of rapid economic growth and long-term social stability in China. As the Chinese economy transitions from a phase of high-speed growth to high-quality development, higher demands are being placed on balancing the relationship between an effective market and a proactive government.- ，。，。，，，，，--。，. -Better leverage the role of the government, address the problems of absence and overreach… Leveraging the role of the government better does not mean expanding the role of the government, rather it refers to adhering to doing what should be done, not doing what should not be done, grasping the boundary between doing and not doing, and doing well the things the government should do, doing them thoroughly. Doing what should be done means continuously building a rule-of-law economy, a credit economy, perfecting market rules and taking the lead in following rules, focusing on correcting market failures, regulating competitive order, building a unified national big market, and providing a fair competitive grand stage for various business entities including state-owned enterprises, private enterprises, foreign-funded enterprises, and individual industrial and commercial households. It means leveraging the government's important role in planning guidance, industrial layout, innovation leadership, promoting technological innovation and industrial transformation. It means improving the macroeconomic governance system, strengthening macroeconomic regulation, smoothening the economic cycles, preventing large economic fluctuations, and promoting long-term sustainable and healthy economic development. It means strengthening quality supervision, standard construction, and driving product and service quality improvement through rules and standards. Not doing what should not be done means preventing inappropriate intervention in the activities of micro-subjects, not engaging in local protectionism and self-circulation, not pursuing law enforcement for personal gain, not engaging in arbitrary fines, inspections, and confiscations. The more standardized the government behavior, the more effective the market role will be. We must fully incorporate government behavior into the track of the rule of law, comprehensively build a law-based government, improve the government's trustworthiness and commitment mechanism, increase the protection of property rights, standardize law enforcement involving enterprises, reduce the institutional costs of market operation, and organically combine market-oriented mechanisms and legal principles to complement each other.- ，、。：-，，。-，、，，。，、，，，，，、、。、、，。，，，，。、，。，，，，、、。，。，，，，，，、. The author also calls to -create a fairer and more dynamic market environment.- The section ends with this: -In the relationship between government and market, the government is the subject, the market is the object. The government's role is proactive and the market's role is spontaneous. The key lies in regulating government behavior and transforming government functions. Only when the government plays a better role in its own responsibilities can the market play a decisive role in resource allocation.- ，，，，，，。，. Share Tracking People's Daily For the second point, the author says that achieving balance in supply and demand requires actions to be taken with regard to both. -Under the new development environment and conditions, there are many new requirements for deepening the supply-side structural reform. In terms of quality, it is necessary to adhere to the leadership of science and technology and innovation-driven development, promote the accelerated development of emerging industries, and promote the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries. In terms of quantity, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of advancing and retreating, ensuring protection (such as to ensure stability and continuity) and pressure (to address inefficiencies or undesirable practices) and increase (some aspects such as investment) and decrease (some aspects like overcapacity or waste). Comprehensively rectify the 'involution-style' competition for some industries, maintain a reasonable capacity utilization rate, and form a healthy, sustainable industrial development ecology. We must encourage enterprises to improve the quality of supply, promote superior quality and price, stimulate ‘upward competition', offer more high-quality products and services, enhance the adaptability and balance of supply to demand, and strive to create and stimulate new demand through new supply.- ，。，、，，。，、、，--，，、。，，--，，、，. It is necessary to adhere to expanding domestic demand as a long-term strategic measure. Owing to various international and domestic factors, insufficient domestic demand, unstable external demand, and an imbalance between total supply and demand have become the greatest constraints on the smooth circulation of the national economy. China's domestic demand potential is large but has not yet been fully released. Due to geopolitical conflicts and the rise of global protectionism, the recovery of the world economy has been weak, and the instability and uncertainty of external demand have significantly increased. In this broader context, expanding domestic demand is a strategic move for the long-term stability and development of the economy, not a stopgap measure to cope with short-term fluctuations. Especially as a super-large economy, the foundation of stable and healthy economic development must be built on the strong support of domestic demand. It is necessary to adopt strong and effective macroeconomic policies, accelerate filling the shortcomings in domestic demand, especially the consumption gap, and make domestic demand the main driving force and stabilizing anchor for economic growth. It is necessary to establish and improve a long-term mechanism to expand household consumption, particularly expanding consumption demand supported by income, so that residents can consume with stable income, have a good experience and willingness to consume, and dare to consume without concerns. It is necessary to improve the mechanism for expanding investment, innovate and optimize investment and financing mechanisms, expand investment demand with reasonable returns, and coordinate investments in both infrastructure and human resources. We should increase both government investment and lead social investment, ensuring that effective investment not only stimulates current demand but also transforms into advanced productivity and new quality productive forces for the future. 。，、，。，。，，。，，。，。，，。，，、、。，，，，，，、. The section ends by calling to clear obstacles in domestic circulation, stabilise foreign trade and investment and open up diversified international markets, expand exports, increase imports, smooth and enhance international circulation… Share Tracking People's Daily For the third point, the author argues: -We must take major scientific and technological innovation as the fundamental support for developing new productive forces and cultivating new momentum, strengthen basic research and key core technology research, strengthen the construction of national strategic scientific and technological forces, carry out large-scale application demonstration actions of new technologies and new products, and strive to create a batch of new industrial engines with high technological content, strong market competitiveness and great driving force, and forge the ‘new long board' of China's economy.- 、，，，，、、，--. -We must continue to promote the rejuvenation of traditional industries. In developing new quality productive forces, traditional industries cannot be simply abandoned, the economic structure cannot be broken, and it cannot be divorced from reality and become virtual or bubble-like. After years of development, China's traditional industries are leading globally in terms of scale, structural system, technological level, and international competitiveness. They are an important material and technological foundation and decisive factor for China's economic strength, comprehensive national power, and the standard of living of the people. As the foundation of the modern industrial system, traditional industries are the basic support for economic growth and employment income. When developing new quality productive forces, traditional industries must never be treated as ‘low-end industries' or ‘backward industries' and simply withdrawn from. It is necessary to actively use digital technologies and green technologies to transform and upgrade traditional industries, implement large-scale equipment upgrades and replace old consumer goods with new ones. Through digital empowerment, process upgrades, management innovation, and various other paths, we must drive traditional industries to transform towards high-end, intelligent, green, and integrated directions, constantly enhancing their vitality and competitiveness through continuous updates and iterations.- 。，，，、。，、、、，、、。，，，----。、，，、、，、、、，。 This section ends with the author calling for grasping the -dialectical relationship between cultivating new drivers and updating old drivers.- The next bit is essential and echoes some of the anxiety that's so loudly being expressed across the developed world. From international experience, the hollowing-out of traditional industries often limits technological and industrial innovation capabilities, weakening economic competitiveness. There are significant differences in resource endowments and industrial development levels across different regions of our country. Developing new types of productive forces should not blindly follow a single industry or apply a uniform model; it is crucial to avoid ‘herding without prior preparation'/ ‘act in rush or haste' . It is necessary to fully consider the actual situation of a particular region, give play to its distinctive advantages, find the best path, and establish a new quality productive forces cultivation model with local characteristics… 。。，，。，、，--。，，，。--，--，。--，，，，. Leave a comment The fourth point deals with the relationship between improving incremental additions and revitalizing existing stock, and comprehensively enhancing resource allocation efficiency. The author calls this an -urgent- task. The steps proposed are: effectively revitalising basic assets such as land via renewal of industrial parks, better use of inefficient land in urban areas, optimizing the structure of production and living spaces, and increasing public service facilities. transformation of urban villages, and transformation and utilization of old neighbourhoods, old communities, and old buildings. making full use of funds such as local government special bonds and central bank re-lending facilities, purchasing existing commercial housing at reasonable prices and converting them into affordable housing and other uses, and effectively meeting the housing needs of new citizens, young people and other groups. developing a circular economy standardising the development of the second-hand car and second-hand housing markets through leasing, equity participation, and cooperation activate and utilize the idle housing legally owned by farmers idle infrastructure such as small and medium-sized school buildings in rural areas can have their uses converted in a regulated manner ，----，，，。，，、、。、，，、。，，--。、，、。、、，。，。，. Towards the end, the author calls to -compile macro balance sheets for households, businesses, and the government, accurately portraying the asset and liability situation at the national, local, and sectoral levels.- This should provide a baseline understanding of the -family assets.- Based on this, -conduct a comprehensive analysis of economic growth potential, identify economic and financial risk hidden dangers, evaluate debt repayment capacity, and develop policy measures to optimize the scale and structure of macro assets and liabilities, improving the systematic, targeted, and effective nature of macroeconomic governance.- 、、，、，，--，，，，，、、。 Share Tracking People's Daily The fifth and final relationship to balance is the one between improving quality and expanding total quantity. The article argues that it is essential to -unify the effective improvement of quality and the reasonable growth of quantity in the whole process of high-quality development.- The author reiterates that high-quality development is the -primary task- for the country's modernisation. The author argues that: It is necessary to persist in leading and expanding the total economic volume through qualitative improvements. Improvements in quality can open up new realms and new spaces for quantitative growth. Every scientific and technological and industrial revolution brings new investment and consumption opportunities because of the qualitative enhancement of productivity, allowing the economy to break through the earlier equilibrium and produce leapfrog growth in quantity. In the era of a scarcity economy, in order to quickly resolve the contradictions of quantity, the development model was relatively extensive. In other words, ‘when radishes are selling fast, one doesn't take the time to wash the soil off them' . Entering the stage of high-quality development, winning with quality becomes the only way forward. Whether at the micro or macro level, without effective improvement in quality, there can be no reasonable growth in quantity. Even if there is rapid growth in the short term, it is difficult to sustain over time. Therefore, it is necessary to fully and accurately implement the new development concept, adhere to innovative, coordinated, green, open, and shared development, focus on implementing an innovation-driven development strategy, focus on enhancing the overall and coordinated nature of development, focus on promoting the harmonious coexistence of man and nature, focus on forming a new system of opening up, focus on practicing a people-centered development philosophy, coordinate development and security, and promote higher quality, more efficient, fairer, more sustainable, and safer development. Enterprises and industries must also enhance their innovation capabilities, increase investment in new technologies, actively carry out digital and green transformation of traditional industries, and rely more on improving product and service quality to enhance market competitiveness and expand market share. 。、。，，，。，，，--。，，，，，。，，、、、、，，，，，，，、、、、。，，、，、. At the same time, it is necessary to expand the total economic volume to provide fertile ground and space for improving quality. The full accumulation of quantitative changes can trigger qualitative changes. Therefore, the scale of total quantity itself has unique value in improving quality. In many cases, ‘big' itself is a form of ‘strength'; this has been repeatedly verified in the marketplace. The development of emerging industries and new quality productive forces can take advantage of economies of scale and scope. The demand pull of a super-large-scale market combined with rich application scenarios, a complete industrial system, and diversified business organizational models can create more industrial applications, accelerate technology iteration, and cultivate more world-class companies and advanced technologies. The development of high-speed railways, nuclear power, mobile communications, platform economy, artificial intelligence, drones, new energy vehicles, low-altitude economy and other domains provide confirmations of this law. We must further leverage the advantages of China's size, effectively transform the advantages of having a large population and talent pool, vast territory, diverse resources, and high savings rate into economic scale, and form an economic scale that matches the modernization of a huge population, constantly promote qualitative changes on the basis of quantitative changes, continuously enhance economic strength, scientific and technological strength and comprehensive national strength, and consolidate the material and technological foundation of Chinese modernization. 。，，----，。，、、，，，。、、、、、、、，。，、、、，，，、，。 Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Politburo Meeting - Xi Meets Non-party Personages - Li Qiang Seeks Ideas on Government Work Report - Han Zheng's Washington Visit - China's Oil & Gas ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Tuesday, January 21, 2025. Page 1: While Donald Trump was being sworn in as President in Washington DC, the CPC Politburo met in Beijing on Monday. On the agenda was deliberation over the ‘Comprehensive Report on the Politburo Standing Committee Hearing and Studying the Work Reports of the Party Groups of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the State Council, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the Work Report of the Central Secretariat' and the ‘Opinions on Fully Promoting Ecological Protection and High-Quality Development in the Yellow River Basin'. 120，《、、、、》《》. The meeting -fully affirmed the work- of each of these agencies and agreed with their work arrangements for 2025. The meeting held that in the past year, the five party groups adhered to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, firmly safeguarded the authority and centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, strengthened their mission, fulfilled their duties, strengthened the construction of the Party group, and conscientiously fulfilled the main responsibility of comprehensive and strict Party governance, making new contributions to comprehensively promoting the construction of a strong country and the great cause of national rejuvenation through Chinese-style modernization. Under the leadership of the Politburo and the Politburo Standing Committee, the Central Secretariat has fulfilled its duties and taken positive actions, and has carried out extensive work in promoting the implementation of relevant decisions and arrangements of the CPC Central Committee, strengthening the construction of Party regulations, guiding the construction and reform of mass organizations, and rectifying formalism to reduce the burden on the grassroots. ，，5，，，，，，、。、，、，、、、. The meeting emphasized that in the new year, the five Party Groups must take Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as their guide, adhere to the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee as the highest political principle, and ensure unity of thought, consistency of direction, and strict compliance with orders. It is necessary to establish and practice the correct view of political achievements, prioritize action, strive for progress, work diligently and effectively, and work together to promote reform and breakthroughs, steadily advance high-quality development, and demonstrate new responsibilities and new accomplishments on the new journey of comprehensively advancing Chinese-style modernization. The Central Secretariat must focus on its responsibilities, enhance political capabilities, ensure the implementation of key tasks, rigorously strengthen self-construction, and complete the tasks entrusted by the Party Central Committee with high quality. ，，5，，、、。，，、，，，。，，，，。 It adds that the -ecological protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin are long-term agenda items related to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and sustainable development.- Xinhua English summarises the rest: The meeting called -for promoting the full enforcement of the Yellow River Protection Law. Work should be done to systematically enhance the water source conservation capacity in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, strengthen soil and water conservation in the middle reaches, and advance wetland protection and ecological governance in the lower reaches, according to the meeting. The meeting also urged efforts to ensure the safety of important dams, reservoirs and infrastructure, strengthen the synergy of the Yellow River's high-quality development with strategies of the large-scale development of the western region and the rise of the central region, improve the holistic and systematic protection of cultural heritage, and promote the integration of culture and tourism development.- In this context, the Central Leading Group for Coordinated Regional Development is tasked with key work. Share Tracking People's Daily Xi Jinping also met with people from non-CPC political parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC), personages without party affiliation, and other members of the united front ahead of the Spring Festival. Cai Dafeng spoke on behalf of the invitees. -He said that in 2024, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core united and led the entire Party and people of all ethnic groups in the country to hold high the banner and forge ahead, successfully held the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, made major decisions to further comprehensively deepen reform and promote Chinese-style modernization, calmly responded to challenges, and achieved hard-won new accomplishments in reform and development. In the new year, the democratic parties, the Federation of Industry and Commerce and non-party personages must consciously maintain a high degree of alignment with the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, focus on the central tasks of the Party and the state, pool wisdom and strength, offer advice and suggestions, and jointly write a new chapter in building a strong nation and achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. 、。，2024，，、，，、，，。，、，，、，、. Xi Jinping spoke after this. He emphasised that 2024 was a year to overcome difficulties and forge ahead steadfastly. Over the past year, the CPC Central Committee has united and led the people of all ethnic groups across the country, responding calmly and implementing comprehensive measures, successfully completing the main objectives and tasks of economic and social development, with Chinese-style modernisation taking new solid steps. We guided all sectors to correctly grasp favourable conditions and unfavourable factors, maintained strategic determination, and strengthened confidence in victory. We effectively implemented various existing policies, intensified efforts to launch a package of incremental policies, and solidly promoted high-quality development. The Chinese economy has rebounded and improved, with the gross domestic product growing by 5%. We have strengthened independent innovation, achieved a series of new breakthroughs at the frontiers of science and technology, and powerfully driven the development of new quality productive forces. We further comprehensively deepened reform, emphasised coordinated progress in various undertakings, provided solid and strong livelihood protection, and ensured that the people enjoy a greater sense of gain. We coordinated development and security, maintaining overall social stability. We deeply advanced major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, injecting more positive energy into maintaining world peace and stability and promoting human development and progress. We solidly carried out Party discipline learning and education, unswervingly improved conduct, enforced discipline and fought corruption, with continuous improvement in Party and government conduct. These achievements are the result of the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, and also the result of united struggle and tenacious efforts by people of all ethnic groups across the country, including various democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and non-party personages. ，。，2024、。，，、，，。，，。，，，，5%。，，。，，，。，。，、。，，。，，、、. He then talked about the goals for 2025. -Xi Jinping emphasised that 2025 is the final year of the ‘14th Five-Year Plan.- We must adhere to the general tone of seeking progress while maintaining stability, implement more proactive and impactful macro policies, focus wholeheartedly on promoting high-quality development, promote high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-strengthening, maintain sound momentum in economic and social development, successfully complete the objectives and tasks of the ‘14th Five-Year Plan', and lay a solid foundation for a good start to the ‘15th Five-Year Plan'. Xi called on non-CPC political parties, the ACFIC, and personages without party affiliation to focus on the central tasks, serve the overall interests of the country, and leverage their respective strengths to more broadly rally support, build consensus, and pool wisdom and strength. ，2025--。，，，，，--，--。、、，，、、、. (Note: I wonder why Xi Jinping did not talk about implementing a moderately loose monetary policy; instead, he chose -more proactive and impactful- as the descriptor for policy direction. Moderately loose was the approach that emerged from the Politburo meeting ahead of the CEWC and then from the CEWC.) He then expressed three hopes for the attendees: First, elevate political position, and further draw the concentric circles. We must firmly grasp the fundamental characteristic of the Chinese Communist Party's leadership in China's new type of political party system, deeply study the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era, do more work to strengthen confidence, unite people's hearts, warm people's hearts, and build unity of hearts, and effectively transform positive factors from all sectors into development results.，。，，、、、，。 Second, closely focus on central work, and actively contribute suggestions and efforts. We must closely center around further comprehensive deepening of reform, promoting high-quality development, formulating suggestions for the 15th Five-Year Plan and other matters to conduct in-depth research and political consultation, and continue to focus on key and difficult issues in the Yangtze River ecological environmental protection to carry out democratic supervision. The ACFIC should guide private economy personnel to maintain entrepreneurial enthusiasm and boost development confidence, guide private enterprises to establish and improve modern enterprise systems with Chinese characteristics, and strive to achieve high-quality development. ，。、、--，。、，、。 Third, strengthen self-construction and improve the ability to perform duties. Under this, he called to consolidate and deepen the results of discipline learning and education, continue to implement the spirit of the eight-point central regulations in order to promote the transformation of work style, and consolidate and develop a good political ecology. ，，. Subscribe now Li Qiang, meanwhile, presided over a symposium with experts, entrepreneurs and representatives from the fields of education, science, culture, health and sports. He listened to their views on the draft government work report. After listening to the attendees, Li Qiang said that: -In the past year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the entire country has worked hard and overcome difficulties. The overall economic operation has been stable and steady, and the main development goals and tasks for the whole year have been successfully completed. High-quality development has been steadily promoted, and the foundation of ‘stability' has become more solid, and the momentum of ‘progress' has been continuously strengthened. At the same time, it should be noted that China's development still faces many difficulties and challenges, especially the rising uncertain and unstable factors in the external environment. We must accurately grasp the situation and be good at turning crises into opportunities. China possesses comprehensive advantages in systems, markets, industries, and talents. The basic trend of long-term economic improvement has not changed and will not change. As long as we unswervingly manage our own affairs well, we will surely promote the stable and healthy development of the Chinese economy. ，，，，、，、，，，--，--。，，，，。、、、，，，。 The next paragraph says: Li Qiang stressed that it is necessary to fully implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee and promote new achievements in high-quality development. It is necessary to implement a more proactive fiscal policy and a moderately loose monetary policy. Fiscal policy should proactively exert force in advance and form actual expenditure as soon as possible, monetary policy should maintain abundant liquidity and promote funds to fully flow to the real economy, focus on policy coordination and cooperation, provide strong policy support for responding to challenges and promoting development. At the same time, it is necessary to closely follow the changes in domestic and international situations, adjust policy measures in a timely manner, and enrich and improve the policy toolbox. It is necessary to further deepen reform and expand opening up, clear bottlenecks and blockages around expanding and strengthening the domestic circulation, create a first-class business environment, stimulate the vitality of various business entities, and expand independent opening up and unilateral opening up in an orderly manner. It is necessary to promote the transformation of new and old drivers through scientific and technological innovation, concentrate on making breakthroughs in key core technologies and cutting-edge technologies, accelerate the industrialization of scientific and technological achievements, and strive to cultivate more new economic growth points. It is necessary to make greater efforts to protect and improve people's livelihood, promote residents to increase income and reduce burdens, and improve the quality of life. ，，。，、，、，，、。，，，。，，，，、。，，，。，、.

Page 2: There's a report with data from the National Energy Administration, which says that China's domestic oil and gas production exceeded 400 million tons for the first time in 2024. This is the eighth consecutive year of rapid growth at the scale of tens of millions of tons. Among this, crude oil production reached 213 million tons, an increase of 24 million tons compared to 2018; natural gas production reached 246.4 billion cubic meters, with an average annual increase of over 13 billion cubic meters in the past six years. Page 3: Just one report to note; on January 18, a seminar titled -China's New Development: Prospects and Challenges- was held in Baghdad, Iraq. The seminar was hosted by the Iraqi Communist Party, with over 200 representatives from the Iraqi government, parliament, think tanks, media and other sectors attending. The purpose of the seminar was to -exchange and learn from China's development experience-. Share Tracking People's Daily Let's look at Xinhua's coverage of Han Zheng's engagements in Washington. Xinhua reports: During his stay in the United States, Han, a special representative of Chinese President Xi Jinping, met with then U.S. Vice President-elect J.D. Vance, representatives of the U.S. business community, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Elon Musk, Chair Emeritus of the U.S. Brookings Institution John Thornton and others. -During his meeting with Vance on Sunday, Han first conveyed Xi's greetings to Trump and congratulated Vance on his election. He noted that Xi recently had an important phone call with Trump, during which the two leaders have reached many important consensuses on the development of China-U.S. relations in the next stage. China is ready to work with the United States to adhere to the strategic guidance of the head-of-state diplomacy and follow through on the important consensus reached between Xi and Trump, so as to push for the steady, healthy and sustainable development of bilateral ties, Han said. Han said that the two sides are currently working hard to achieve their respective development goals and dreams. As long as the two sides uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, they will contribute to each other's progress, bring benefits to the two countries, and make important contributions to world peace and development, said Han. Economic and trade relations are important issues of common concern to both sides, he noted. Despite differences and frictions between China and the United States, they share huge common interests and space for cooperation, and the two sides can strengthen dialogue and consultation in this regard, Han added.- The report adds: -While meeting with representatives of the U.S. business community, Han said a good start and stable development of China-U.S. relations align with the common well-being of both peoples and meet the shared expectation of the international community. As an enduring backbone supporting China-U.S. relations, the U.S. business community has been a participant, witness, contributor and beneficiary of China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation as well as China's reform and opening-up, Han said. China will unswervingly advance reform and opening-up, and continue to improve and optimize the business environment, he added. Han said it is hoped that U.S. companies will continue to invest and take root in China, play an active role as a bridge, and make greater contribution to the development of China-U.S. relations. Representatives of the U.S. business community said that as the world's two largest economies that are most dynamic and technologically advanced, the United States and China should engage in mutually beneficial cooperation and find a constructive and steady way to get along with each other. The U.S. business community is optimistic about the prospect of the Chinese economy and the opportunities to grow in China, and supports the two sides in strengthening dialogue and communication to move forward their bilateral relations as well as economic and trade cooperation.- Next, Nigeria has become a BRICS partner country. China's Foreign Ministry said: Nigeria is a major developing country and a significant country of the Global South, noted Mao, while adding that the country's participation in BRICS cooperation will not only serve Nigeria's development, but also the common interests of the bloc's members and partners and those of the Global South, which will make contributions to the development of the BRICS mechanism. The inclusion of a new partner country in the BRICS family marks an expansion of the representativeness of BRICS -- widening its appeal and influence, Mao added. Finally, let's look at Xinhua's report stating that the Myanmar government and Kokang's Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) have reached and signed a formal ceasefire agreement, which came into effect on Jan. 18. Foreign Ministry's Mao Ning said: -Under China's mediation, the Myanmar government and MNDAA held their seventh round of peace talks in Kunming, China's Yunnan Province, in mid-January, and that both parties expressed gratitude for China's efforts to facilitate the successful outcome of the talks. She said the easing of the tensions in northern Myanmar is in the common interests of various parties in Myanmar and regional nations, and will contribute to the security, stability and development of the China-Myanmar border area. ‘China and Myanmar are friendly neighbors, and China firmly opposes any conflict or unrest in Myanmar,' Mao said, adding that it is hoped that all parties would maintain the momentum of the ceasefire and peace talks, earnestly implement the consensus reached, de-escalate tensions proactively, and resolve related issues through further dialogues and consultations. China will firmly support Myanmar's efforts to safeguard its independence, sovereignty, national unity, and territorial integrity, firmly support Myanmar's efforts to secure domestic peace, stability, and economic development, and firmly support Myanmar's efforts to achieve political reconciliation and advance its domestic political agenda within the constitutional framework, the spokesperson said. ‘China will continue to actively promote peace talks and provide support and assistance for the peace process in northern Myanmar'.

Xi-Trump Call & TikTok - 2024 Economic Data - New Guideline on Building Education Power - South China Sea Drills	There were a couple of interesting reports over the weekend that I'll look at before going into today's paper. First, Xi Jinping had a phone call with US president-elect Donald Trump on Friday. Xinhua says that the call was at Trump's request. -Xi congratulated Trump on his re-election as U.S. president. He pointed out that both he and Trump attach great importance to interaction with each other, hope that China-U.S. ties will have a good start in the new U.S. presidential term, and stand ready to push China-U.S. relations to make greater progress from a new starting point. Xi stressed that both China and the United States, two great countries, are pursuing their own dreams and are committed to making the lives of their people better. China and the United States share extensive common interests and broad space for cooperation, and the two countries can become partners and friends, contribute to each other's success, and enjoy common prosperity, which will benefit both countries and the whole world, Xi said. Xi said that it is inevitable that China and the United States, two major countries with different national conditions, have some differences, and the key is to respect each other's core interests and major concerns, and find appropriate ways to solve issues. He said that the Taiwan question concerns China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and it is hoped that the U.S. side handles it with caution. The nature of China-U.S. economic and trade relations is mutually beneficial and win-win, and confrontation and conflict should not be the choice of the two countries, Xi said. He also called on both sides to step up cooperation and do more great, practical and good things that are conducive to the two countries and the world at large based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, so as to keep the two giant ships of China and the United States moving forward on the course of stable, healthy and sustainable development.- The report adds: -Trump thanked Xi for his congratulations, saying that he cherishes his great relationship with Xi, hopes to continue to maintain dialogue and communication, and looks forward to meeting Xi at an early date. The United States and China are the most important countries in the world today, and they should maintain long-lasting friendship and work together to safeguard global peace, Trump said. Xi and Trump exchanged views on major international and regional issues of common concern, such as the Ukraine crisis and the Israel-Palestine conflict. They agreed to establish strategic communication channels and maintain regular contact on major issues of common concern.- Here's CNN's report on how Trump described the call: -I just spoke to Chairman Xi Jinping of China,- Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social. -It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.- Trump said the pair discussed trade, fentanyl, TikTok and other subjects, and that the call was -very good- for both countries. -President Xi and I will do everything possible to make the World more peaceful and safe!- he wrote.- Of course, things have moved at a dizzying pace since the call with regard to TikTok. The app went off and then seemingly back on in the US. At a rally on Sunday ahead of his inauguration, this is what Trump said: -Frankly, we have no choice. We have to save it.- Reuters reports that he added that the US will seek a joint venture to restore the short-video sharing app used by 170 million Americans. Thinking Aloud: The question, of course, is what's the bargain? Trump doesn't need the young voter any more; this is his last term in office. The Indian experience on TikTok also shows that the market often rather quickly creates new options and the consumer too rapidly moves to other alternatives. Moreover, getting the app back creates a legal crisis, given the Supreme Court's 9-0 verdict upholding the law banning the app. So, one wonders if there's a quid pro quo in the works to allow say X or Facebook, perhaps in an alternate/deeply sanitised/heavily censored version into China's information ecosystem. That would be a really interesting proposition, given how the Communist Party under Xi has viewed this domain as a battlefield. Xi has over the years insisted on ensuring strict ideological alignment and expressed deep concerns with regard to the -infiltration- of Western ideas. He has viewed the information domain as being of existential significance to the Party. So giving on this would be rather big. But then, the devil will always lie in the details, and a quid pro quo might not always be like-for-like. Anyway, Xinhua also quotes a WSJ report saying that Trump wants to visit China during his first 100 days in office. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, over the weekend, we got China's 2024 economic data.

Steering the Wild Horses of American Power	As Donald Trump is sworn in for a second term as president, American politics and foreign policy are undergoing profound upheaval. A reassessment of the nation's global interests and international engagement is underway. This growing dissatisfaction with the world order was starkly articulated by Trump's Secretary of State nominee, Marco Rubio, during his Senate confirmation hearing. Rubio remarked, -The postwar global order is not just obsolete; it is now a weapon being used against us.- In this episode of The Great Power Show, Manoj Kewalramani speaks to Edward Luttwak, renowned military strategist, historian, and geopolitical analyst, about this turn in American foreign and security policies. In his inimitable style, Luttwak argues the American political system to in which one is driving a cart with the horses at the back and all one is doing is trying to avoid being overrun by your own horses. He contends that American foreign policy today is in a correction phase after the excesses that began with the 2003 war in Iraq.

Subscribe now Page 3: On the eve of Donald Trump taking over as US President, with the threat of tariffs and deeper global fissures, there's a long article in the bylined Huán Yǔ Píng, making a pitch for economic globalisation. My Brief View: I found this to be a very interesting read. It makes a strong data-driven — and ideological — argument about the resilience of global trade. Beijing, of course, must also walk the talk on issues related to trade, subsidies and surpluses. That said, going back to a world in which fences for capital and labour are higher is self-defeating for everyone. Likewise, while one understands that there is securitisation around certain select emerging technologies, new clubs that result in broad-based denial regimes will indeed set a bulk of the world back by a couple of generations. Politicians and bureaucracies need to guard against mission creep in this era of securitisation. This is not simply about China; this is about the broader developing world. Obviously, the consequences of development failures in the developing world will also be felt by the developed world. Anyway, the first section of the article says: Economic globalisation has not stagnated, let alone reversed; it continues to develop against headwinds. Trade is an important indicator of the state of economic globalisation. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development's Global Trade Update, global trade volume is projected to reach a historic high of $33 trillion in 2024, a year-on-year increase of 3.3%. Global trade has demonstrated strong resilience, particularly with the increasing dynamism of digital trade and service trade. Despite the spread of unilateralism and protectionism, and the enthusiasm of certain countries for pursuing ‘decoupling and breaking chains' or building ‘small yards with high fences,' the global picture shows that enterprises in various countries continue to coexist and thrive within global supply chains, industrial chains, and value chains. According to the World Openness Report 2024, global value chains have maintained an overall expansion trend in recent years, with digitalization, the green economy, and the service sector driving the process of global openness. Humanity still lives in a world shaped by economic globalisation. Global logistics giant DHL and New York University calculated a composite index reflecting the globalisation process based on data on trade, capital, information, and personnel flows. Examining changes since 2001, the index has remained at its highest level of around 25% in recent years. John Pearson, CEO of DHL Express, stated: ‘This latest finding clearly refutes the notion that globalisation is reversing. Globalisation has profoundly reshaped our world and still holds enormous potential for further development'. ，，。。《》，202433，3.3%。，、。、，----，，、、。《2024》，，、、。。、、，。2001，25%。·：-。，。- From the perspective of policy orientation, the so-called ‘shock theory' and ‘stagnation theory' of economic globalisation are also untenable. The high-quality implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement is bringing huge development dividends to regional countries. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership has not declined due to the withdrawal of some countries, but rather has attracted more countries to join. African countries have accelerated the pace of free trade zone construction. The African Continental Free Trade Agreement was implemented between South Africa, Ghana, Kenya and other countries last year. In 2024, the negotiations on the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area 3.0 will be substantially completed; China and Peru will sign a protocol to upgrade the free trade agreement; and the China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement will be upgraded again. The 31st APEC Leaders' Informal Meeting reached important consensus on supporting the multilateral trading system and promoting regional economic integration in the Asia-Pacific region. Looking at the world, the political consensus and policy measures to promote open development are increasing. ，----。《》，《》，。，《》、。2024，—3.0，，—。、。，. The role of the ‘Global South' in promoting the construction of an open world economic system is also expanding. According to the World Openness Report 2024, from 2008 to 2023, the openness index of developed economies fell by 7.7%, while that of emerging markets and developing economies rose by 5.0%. In 2023, the openness index of BRICS countries increased by 0.5% year-on-year, and increased by 8.0% compared with 2008. The latest World Investment Report released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development shows that in 2023, developing economies accounted for 65% of global foreign direct investment flows. The Global South is increasingly becoming an important force in promoting economic globalization. --。《2024》，20082023，7.7%，5.0%。2023，0.5%，20088.0%。《》，2023，65%。. The second section discusses the headwinds to economic globalisation. Historically, the two World Wars plunged the global economy into chaos, cut off cross-border trade routes, and led to the collapse of international cooperation mechanisms. The nearly half-century-long Cold War confrontation divided the world into two distinct blocs, obstructing economic exchanges and impeding resource flows. However, from the perspective of the long arc of history, none of these disruptions prevented the world from returning to the path of economic globalisation. Fundamentally speaking, economic globalisation is an objective requirement of the development of social productive forces, and is an inevitable result of scientific and technological progress; it is not subject to any person's will. ，。，，，。，，，。，，。，，，. The current headwinds facing economic globalisation are the product of domestic political shifts in a few countries, and do not mean that the fundamental logic of economic globalization promoting global welfare has changed. Data from the World Trade Organization show that from 1996 to 2021, the higher the proportion of trade in GDP, the faster the economic growth of low- and middle-income economies. This fully demonstrates that openness is the only way for a country to prosper and develop. ，。，19962021，，。，. Although there exists a tug-of-war between the forces driving economic globalization and those resisting it, the driving forces still outweigh the resistance. The current acceleration of global economic digitalization, green development, and intelligent transformation is building strong momentum for the re-acceleration of economic globalization. The rapid development of global e-commerce and the rise of overseas warehouses are just glimpses of the digital trade wave. According to WTO statistics, global digitally delivered services exports reached $4.25 trillion in 2023, a 9% year-on-year increase, accounting for 54.2% of global service exports, setting a new historical high. Green and sustainable development has become a global consensus, with the ‘green content' of the world economy continuously increasing and new opportunities for open cooperation emerging. Data shows that in 2023, global newly-installed renewable energy capacity increased by 50% year-on-year, and green bond sales grew by over 10%. China's advancements in the new energy vehicle industry and autonomous driving technology are fostering a new wave of deep collaboration in the global automotive industry. As Mark Leonard, Director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, points out, due to accelerating changes in energy and technology, the world is experiencing ‘re-globalization' rather than ‘de-globalisation'. ，。、、，。，，。，20234.25，9%，54.2%，。，--，。，2023，50%，10%。，。·，，----. The third section says that: Economic globalisation is at a new crossroads, and only by guiding it well, taking advantage of the benefits, and avoiding harm can it develop healthily and progress steadily over the long term. ‘In terms of achieving inclusiveness, protectionism is neither efficient nor cost-effective. Only more and better trade can enable more people and regions to integrate into the mainstream of the global economy', said the WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. The 2024 World Trade Report warns that intensified protectionism may set back the process of narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor by 30 years. Both the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund have recently warned that raising tariffs may affect global economic growth. Countries, especially major economies, must adhere to the general direction of open development, resist protectionism, and promote the construction of an open world economic system. ，、，、。-，，，。-。《2024》，30。，。，，. The key to solving the problems brought about by economic globalisation is to promote inclusive economic globalisation. Only by solving the imbalanced development between countries and within countries caused by the global allocation of resources, allowing different countries, different classes and different groups to participate in and enjoy the fruits of economic and social development, so that development is both full and balanced, is the way to drive economic globalisation into a more dynamic, inclusive, and sustainable new phase. This requires governments to show wisdom and take action. As World Economic Forum Chairman Klaus Schwab once pointed out: ‘The challenge and responsibility of today's leaders is to counter trade protectionism while making trade the driving force for inclusive growth.' The process of promoting inclusive development of economic globalization may not be smooth and may not yield immediate results, but all parties must maintain confidence with the belief that ‘progress will come with action and success will follow with perseverance'. ，。，、、，，、、。。：-，，。-，，-、-. China is pursuing a path of seeking common development through opening up. Its participation in economic globalisation has promoted China's development and brought vast opportunities to other countries. China's development proves that promoting an inclusive and equitable economic globalisation can promote common development for all countries. This is why China firmly pursues a mutually beneficial and win-win opening-up strategy, orderly expands independent and unilateral opening-up, steadily expands institutional opening-up, and promotes the construction of an open world economic system. Economic globalization is an inevitable path for human society and an irreversible trend of the times. Countries must have the wisdom to recognize the overall situation, the determination and confidence to follow the trend, and work together to promote inclusive and equitable economic globalization. ，，。，。、、、。、。，，.

Xi Meets Dissanayake - To Lam Willing to Learn from Xi's Thought - Deep Dive into Xi's Qiushi Article on 3rd Plenum Decision - Zunyi Conference Commem...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, January 16, 2025. Page 1: The lead story on the page is about Xi Jinping's meeting (English report) with Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. Xi talked about the -traditional friendship- between the two countries. He added that -with joint efforts, China and Sri Lanka have continuously promoted strategic cooperative partnership featuring mutual assistance and ever-lasting friendship. High-quality Belt and Road cooperation and cooperation in various fields have achieved fruitful results, bringing tangible benefits to the two peoples-. Xi told Dissanayake that China-Sri Lanka ties today face -a historical opportunity-. -The two countries should have a keen grasp of bilateral relations from a strategic perspective and jointly build a China-Sri Lanka community with a shared future- He added: -China takes Sri Lanka as a priority in its neighbourhood diplomacy. China will continue to support Sri Lanka in safeguarding its national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, support Sri Lanka in independently exploring a development path that suits its national conditions, and is willing to deepen political mutual trust with Sri Lanka, exchange experiences in state governance, and enhance dialogue and communication between various departments of the two countries. China's further comprehensive deepening of reform and promotion of Chinese-style modernization will bring new opportunities for Sri Lanka's development. China will actively support Sri Lanka in focusing on economic construction, promoting high-quality joint construction of the ‘Belt and Road', modern agriculture, digital economy, marine economy and other fields of cooperation, and create new highlights. It is necessary to strengthen cultural exchanges between the two sides and enhance linkages between the two peoples. China is willing to strengthen coordination and cooperation with Sri Lanka in multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, jointly address major issues concerning human development such as climate change, adhere to the solidarity and development of the Global South, and contribute to regional peace, stability, development and prosperity.- ，，、，，，，。、，。，--、、、，。，--。，，，. Dissanayake reportedly said that -Sri Lanka admires China's major development achievements in the fields of economy, science and technology, and infrastructure. China has always been a reliable friend and partner of Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka attaches great importance to relations with China, firmly adheres to the one-China principle, and thanks China for its valuable support in safeguarding Sri Lanka's independence, sovereignty and legitimate rights and interests. Sri Lanka is committed to jointly building BRI and helping to improve the level of regional connectivity. It welcomes more Chinese companies to invest in Sri Lanka and is willing to strengthen cooperation with China in infrastructure, energy, agriculture, finance, poverty reduction, digital transformation, tourism, marine industry and personnel training. China plays a significant leading role in the Global South, as well as a constructive role in international affairs, he added. The Sri Lankan side is willing to continue strengthening coordination and mutual support with China on multilateral forums to safeguard common interests. ，。、、。。，，、。--，，，、、、、、、、、。，。、，. During this visit, deals were signed in such areas as Belt and Road cooperation, agricultural products, social welfare, and news and broadcasting. Share Tracking People's Daily Another report on the page discusses Xi's call with CPV General Secretary To Lam. Xinhua reports: Xi -called on China and Vietnam to step up connectivity, jointly build frontier platform for new quality productive forces cooperation, and build stable and smooth cross-border industrial and supply chains.- -Xi said he is glad to hold phone talks with To Lam at the turn of the year and on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties, recalling that during To Lam's state visit to China last August, the two leaders had in-depth exchanges and reached broad consensus on deepening relations between the two parties and the two countries, as well as jointly promoting the development of socialist cause. Over the past six months, the two sides have been active in implementation of the consensus, and the cooperation issues the two leaders agreed on have achieved positive progress, Xi said. The year 2025 marks the conclusion of China's 14th Five-Year Plan period, and a key year for the preparation of 14th National Congress of the CPV, Xi said, noting it is a year of great significance for both countries that serves as both a point of continuity and a new starting point. The two sides should continue to rejuvenate and strengthen the two parties, deepen exchanges of socialist theory and practical experience, and promote the development of the socialist cause amid great changes unseen in a century, said Xi. It is necessary to fully leverage the political guidance of high-level exchanges and continue to maintain close exchanges, Xi said, adding the two countries should push for more results in mutually beneficial cooperation. The two sides should carry out warm and down to earth people-to-people and cultural exchanges that connect people's hearts, and strengthen exchanges and cooperation in areas such as media, culture and tourism, as well as between the youths of the two nations and at the sub-national level, creating more projects that win the hearts of the people, Xi said. The two countries should also strengthen international and regional coordination, safeguard international fairness and justice, and jointly build a community with a shared future for mankind, he added.- Among other things, To Lam reportedly said -that with the goal of preparing for the 14th National Congress of the CPV, Vietnam is set to embark on a new era of development, which envisions a prosperous, powerful, democratic, equitable, and civilized nation. In this process, Vietnam will learn from China's development experience as much as possible, especially the new theoretical and practical innovation of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, he added.- Subscribe now Next, there's a report on Xi's latest article in Qiushi. I'll look at the original article. The article is an extract from Xi's speech at the special seminar for leading provincial and ministerial-level cadres on studying and implementing the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee on October 29, 2024. In the first part of the article, Xi talks about the achievements of reform since the 18th Party Congress. He says that -comprehensively deepening reform in the new era has achieved major practical, institutional and theoretical results, which have attracted worldwide attention and have far-reaching influence.- 、、，，. In terms of practical results, Xi says that: -The new development concept was formed through reforms, the ideological concepts and institutional mechanisms that influence and constrain high-quality development were eliminated through reforms, and the effective qualitative improvement and reasonable quantitative growth of economic development were gradually achieved through reforms. It is through the comprehensive deepening of reform that China's economic strength, scientific and technological strength, and comprehensive national strength have leaped to a new level…- ，，。，、、... In terms of institutional results, Xi says that: -China's fundamental systems, basic systems, and important systems have become more complete. In particular, the Party's leadership system has been established as the country's fundamental leadership system. A systematic, well-structured, scientifically regulated, and effectively functioning institutional framework is gradually maturing and taking shape. We have strengthened the implementation of systems, focusing on transforming institutional advantages into the efficiency of national governance. These efforts are not only aimed at addressing immediate needs but also at ensuring the long-term stability and security of the nation.- 、、，、、，，、、。，。，. Finally, in terms of theoretical results, Xi says that the current phase of reform, i.e., comprehensive deepening of reform in the new era, has been conceived and advanced against the backdrop of China's reform entering a critical stage and deep waters, characterized by its broad scope, deep impact on interests, high difficulty in implementation, and strong interconnectivity and synergy. We have continuously promoted theoretical innovation in reform, scientifically grasped the timing and situation, risks and opportunities that reform faces, summarised fresh experiences in a timely manner, continuously deepened our understanding of reform patterns, and formed a series of new ideas, new perspectives, and new assertions about comprehensively deepening reform. For example, it is emphasized that reform must adhere to the leadership of the Party; it is emphasized that reform must adhere to the people-centered approach; it is emphasized that reform must adhere to the principle of maintaining integrity while making innovations, neither returning to a closed and rigid old path nor deviating to the evil path of changing flags and banners; it is emphasized that reform must adhere to the overall goal of improving and developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities; it is emphasized that reform must adhere to problem orientation; it is emphasized that it must adhere to the reform of the economic system as the driving force; it is emphasized that reform must be promoted on the track of the rule of law; it is emphasized that top-level design must be combined with crossing the river by feeling the stones; it is emphasized that the relationship between reform, development and stability must be properly handled, among other things. The ‘Six Adherences' outlined in the Decision of the Third Plenum are distilled from these new ideas, perspectives, and assertions. These theoretical achievements provide important guidelines for further advancing comprehensive deepening of reform. 。，、、、。，、，，，、、。，；；，，；、；；；；；，。《》--，、、。，. The second section of the article discusses the importance of maintaining integrity while pursuing innovation. This is important: Reform is not about changing flags and banners. I have said many times that our reform has direction and principles. Upholding the Party's comprehensive leadership, upholding Marxism, upholding socialism with Chinese characteristics, upholding the people's democratic dictatorship, taking the promotion of social fairness and justice and enhancement of people's wellbeing as the starting point and ultimate goal—these are all fundamental, directional, and long-term matters that reflect the Party's nature and purpose, conform to China's national conditions, and align with the fundamental interests of the people. These principles must remain unwavering, regardless of circumstances. Therefore, we must uphold the overall reform goal of continuing to improve and develop the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and advance the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity, always moving forward in the direction guided by the overall goal, resolutely reforming what should be reformed and not reforming what should not be reformed. 。，、。、、、，、，、、，，，，。，、，，，。 The central task of the Party and the country in the new era and on the new journey is to comprehensively promote the construction of a strong country and the great cause of national rejuvenation with Chinese-style modernization. Further comprehensive deepening reform must be carried out closely around this central task. We must move forward with unwavering boldness and courage, align with the new trends of the times, meet the new requirements of practice, and respond to the new expectations of the people. We must vigorously promote theoretical innovation, practical innovation, institutional innovation, cultural innovation, and innovation in all other areas, providing strong momentum and institutional guarantees for Chinese-style modernization. 、，。，、、，、、、，. Share Tracking People's Daily We must focus on economic system reform as the key point. Adhering to the reform direction of the socialist market economy, efforts should be made to fully leverage the decisive role of the market in resource allocation while better exerting the role of the government, accelerate the establishment of a unified national market and improve the macroeconomic governance system; adhere to and implement the ‘two unwaverings', and provide a fair and just legal environment for the development of various types of ownership economies; resolutely eliminate the institutional and mechanism obstacles that hinder and restrict high-quality development, improve production relations that are more compatible with new quality productive forces, and shape new development momentum and advantages; resolutely break through bottlenecks and blockages affecting and restricting comprehensive innovation, coordinate and promote the integrated reform of education, science, technology and talent systems and mechanisms, firmly grasp the strategic initiative in the new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation. 。，、，，；--，；，，；，，. The section ends with an emphasis on the requirement of coordinated reforms in other domains too, such as -democracy, rule of law, culture, society, ecological civilisation, national security, national defense and military construction, as well as the reform of the party building system.- Subscribe now In the third section, Xi argues that reform is a -systematic project- that requires scientific methods and proper handling of various relationships. First, uphold the unity of reform and the rule of law. Reform and rule of law are like two wings of a bird or two wheels of a car; they are interdependent and indispensable. It is necessary to use the power of reform to improve the rule of law, further deepen reforms in the field of the rule of law, and continuously refine the system of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics. The scope of the role of the rule of law should be expanded to better leverage its positive role in eliminating resistance to reform and consolidating reform achievements. We must be good at using the rule of law thinking and the rule of law approach to promote reform, safeguard the authority of the rule of law, and ensure that major reforms are based on the law. We must uphold the principle of equal treatment before the law, and equally protect the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, legal persons and other organizations. We must not engage in selective law enforcement, let alone extrajudicial leniency. 。、，、。，，。，、。，，。，、，，. Second, adhere to the dialectical unity of breaking and establishing. Reform is a process of breaking down the old and establishing the new - breaking down is the means, establishing is the purpose. Further comprehensively deepening reform must uphold system building as the main thread, and should emphasize the simultaneous process of breaking down and establishing, by establishing first before breaking. All reform measures must be fully demonstrated and carefully designed, deeply conduct risk assessments, and grasp the timing, degree, and effectiveness well. What should be established should be actively and proactively established, and must be established stably and firmly. It should be feasible and truly effective. What should be broken should be broken in a timely manner, resolutely, and thoroughly on the foundation of establishment, achieving steady and swift reform progress in the unity of breaking down and establishing. We must not break before establishing, resulting in institutional vacuums that leave people at a loss, causing disorder and chaos. 。，，。，，、。、，，。，、，、；、、，。，，，. Third, uphold the unity of reform and opening up. Further deepening reform and high-level opening up complement and promote each other. The deeper the reform, the higher the level of opening up required; the higher the level of opening up, the greater the role of promoting reform. We must steadily expand institutional opening up, actively connect with international high-standard economic and trade rules, deepen the reform of foreign trade, foreign investment and outbound investment management systems, and create a world-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based, and internationalized. We must implement the free trade pilot zone promotion strategy, encourage innovative and integrated exploration, and create a new highland of reform and opening up with a higher level of opening up and a stronger radiation effect. 。、。，；，。，，、，、、。，、，、. Fourth, we must properly handle the relationship between planning and implementation. ‘One part deployment, nine parts implementation'. The deployments made in the Plenum's ‘Decision' are mainly considered from broad perspectives, many measures are strategic, forward-looking, and directional, and implementation requires formulating practical and feasible specific measures. In designing reform plans, we must grasp objective laws, fully promote democracy, conform to social expectations, pay attention to the coordination and matching of various reform measures, enhance the consistency of reform orientation, and prevent and overcome departmentalism. We must establish and improve a work mechanism with clear responsibilities, complete chains, and interlocking links, strengthen tracking and performance evaluation, promote the implementation of reform measures in detail, prevent the phenomenon of focusing on document formulation and neglecting supervision and implementation, and prevent ‘the water on the beach never reaches the end'. . 。-，-。《》，、、，。，，，，，，。、、，，，、，--。 This section ends with Xi issuing a stern warning: Leaders, especially senior cadres, bear important responsibilities for promoting reform. We must enhance our sense of political responsibility and historical mission, and with the political courage to overcome difficulties and rise to the challenge, face up to contradictions and problems without evasion, eradicate stubborn diseases without ambiguity, and respond to risks and challenges without retreating, and strive to open up a new world of reform and development. We must be good at using scientific methods to promote reform, make systematic arrangements, and act after careful planning to avoid blind actions and confusion. 。、，、，，，，。，、，、. In the final section, Xi calls to: correctly understand and interpret the spirit of the ‘Decision' of the Plenary Session. reasonably guide reform expectations, i.e., -reform is a process of adjusting the interests structure, and it is impossible to simultaneously satisfy the interests of everyone. We must guide both officials and the public to strengthen their awareness of the overall situation and correctly handle the adjustment of interest relationships and individual gains and losses during the reform. Reform is also a gradual process; it cannot be accomplished overnight, nor can all problems be solved at once. We must avoid being hasty, setting unrealistically high goals, or raising expectations excessively. Instead, we must be practical, base everything on reality, move forward steadily, and accumulate small successes to achieve greater victories. We must also recognize that reform is the people's own cause, requiring the participation of all people, united in tackling difficulties and overcoming challenges. During the reform process, we must adhere to a people-centered approach, using actual results and the satisfaction of the people to assess the effectiveness of reforms. This will ensure that the people's sense of gain, happiness, and security continuously increases through the reform.- 。，，。、，。，、，、，、，，，，。，，，。，，，、、. promote positive propaganda around reform, and -continue to pay attention to and respond to social concerns, and promptly resolve doubts and confusion.- Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on the front page about Li Qiang meeting with the visiting Japanese political delegation led by Secretary-General Hiroshi Moriyama of the Liberal Democratic Party and Secretary-General Makoto Nishida of the Komeito Party. Xinhua says: Li said that -the resumption of the ruling party exchange mechanism after nearly seven years is an important move in implementing the consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries. It is hoped that China and Japan will continue working together to enhance mutual trust, deepen cooperation, manage differences, and promote the sound and steady development of bilateral relations that will bring more benefits to the two peoples, Li said. He noted that ruling parties of the two countries should focus on safeguarding the long-term fundamental interests of the two countries and adopt a responsible attitude towards the people and history. More efforts should be made to promote cooperation and common development, explore more new growth points of economic cooperation in such areas as sci-tech innovation, digital economy and green development, step up people-to-people and sub-national exchanges, and cement a social foundation for bilateral relations.- Subscribe now Next, there's a report on the meeting of United Front leaders, where Wang Huning delivered a speech. Wang said that: -We should take Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the guide, deeply understand the decisive significance of Two Establishments, resolutely implement ‘Two Safeguards', comprehensively implement the spirit of the 20th Party Congress and the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the 20th Central Committee, improve the overall pattern of United Front work, consolidate and develop the broadest patriotic United Front, give play to the political role of the United Front in rallying people's hearts and minds and gathering strength, and contribute to further deepening reform and promoting Chinese-style modernization.- ，，--、--，、，，，、，、. Wang Huning stated that General Secretary Xi Jinping's important thought on doing well in the Party's United Front work in the new era is the latest achievement in adhering to the ‘two integrations' and advancing the sinicisation and modernisation of Marxist United Front theory, demonstrating strong theoretical creativity and truth power, strong historical penetration and insight into the times, as well as strong political leadership and practical driving force. We must study it deeply, comprehend it thoroughly, and grasp it accurately, in order to promote the high-quality development of United Front work in the new era. ，--、，、、。、、，。 Wang called on United Front officials to -do a solid job in uniting hearts, building consensus, pooling wisdom, and gathering strength- to promote Chinese-style modernisation. We must adhere to, develop, and improve China's new-type political party system, and enhance the political positioning and work efficiency in serving the central tasks of the Party and the country. We must focus on strengthening the consciousness of the Chinese national community, and actively promote the construction of the Chinese national community. We must systematically advance the sinicisation of religion in China, strengthen the rule of law in religious affairs governance, and maintain harmony and stability in the religious sector. We need to strengthen the ideological and political guidance of non-Party intellectuals and individuals from new social strata, encouraging them to make contributions to the construction of Chinese-style modernisation. We must promote the healthy development of the non-public economy and the healthy growth of non-public economy individuals, guiding private enterprises and private businesspeople to build confidence, overcome challenges, and drive development. We must strengthen the unity of Chinese people at home and abroad, and leverage the United Front work in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and overseas to win the hearts of the people. We must enhance the Party's overall leadership over United Front work, ensuring that the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee are fully implemented and effectively executed. 。，2025--，，、、、。，。，。、，。，。，、、。，。，.

Effective from Feb. 15, these regulations stipulate that intermediary agencies must not aid companies in committing financial fraud, issuing deceptive offerings or breaching information disclosure rules.

Zhejiang eyes ‘around 5.5%' expansion and Fujian aims for 5% to 5.5%. The wealthy provinces' goals suggest China will seek to maintain its growth pace after the economy grew about 5% last year. In 2024, the targets of six out of the eight richest provinces were the same or lower than the national level.- The two charts below are rather telling: This Global Times report also has some details about the plans from Shanghai, Guangdong and Beijing.

The third tier includes nations such as China, Iran, Russia and North Korea to which US groups can, in effect, not export. The middle tier of more than 100 countries will face caps and licences for export volumes over those limits.- A more detailed assessment of the Regulatory Framework for the Responsible Diffusion of Advanced Artificial Intelligence Technology is available on CFR's website. Yesterday, the US Department of Commerce announced it would implement new export controls on certain biotechnology equipment, citing national security concerns relating to artificial intelligence and data science. The Commerce Department warned that China could use the biotech equipment's technology to bolster its military capabilities and help design new weapons using artificial intelligence. VOA reports: -The sanctions effectively restrict shipments of the technology to countries without a U.S. license, such as China. The controls apply to parameter flow cytometers and certain mass spectrometry equipment, which according to the Commerce Department, can ‘generate high-quality, high-content biological data, including that which is suitable for use to facilitate the development of AI and biological design tools'.- Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Xi Reaches Out to EU's Costa - China & Japan Resume Ruling Parties Dialogue after 6 Years - Tibet Quake Response vs California Wildfires Bickering - 2...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, January 15, 2025. Page 1: There's a report on Xi Jinping's phone call with European Council President Antonio Costa. Xinhua reports: Xi extended his congratulations once again to Costa on assuming the presidency of the European Council, noting that this year marks the 50th anniversary of China-EU diplomatic relations, an important milestone that serves as both a point of continuity and a new starting point. The history of China-EU relations demonstrates that as long as both sides uphold mutual respect, treat each other as equals, and engage in candid dialogue, they can advance cooperation and make significant achievements, Xi said. Xi said that like-mindedness makes for partnership, and seeking common ground while respecting differences also defines partnership. The key lies in respecting each other's choice of social systems and development paths, as well as each other's core interests and major concerns, Xi said, adding that China has always regarded Europe as an important pole in a multipolar world, firmly supported European integration, and backed the EU's pursuit of strategic autonomy. Both sides should summarize the experiences of China-EU relations, draw important lessons, jointly safeguard the political foundation of their relations, and advance their relationship, so as to bring greater benefits to the peoples of China and Europe and contribute more stability and certainty to an increasingly turbulent international landscape.- The report adds: Xi Jinping stressed that China and Europe have no fundamental conflicts of interest or geopolitical contradictions, and are partners of mutual achievement. Over the past 50 years, China-EU relations have not only contributed to their respective development but also made significant contributions to global peace and prosperity, Xi said, adding that the more severe and complex the international situation becomes, the more China and Europe should adhere to the original aspirations of their diplomatic ties. Calling on both sides to strengthen strategic communication, enhance strategic mutual trust, and uphold their partnership, Xi said that China remains confident in the EU and hopes the EU will also prove to be a trustworthy cooperation partner for China.- (Note: This is quite a remarkable and rather condescending comment.) -The economic and trade cooperation between China and the EU is mutually complementary and beneficial, with both sides serving as defenders of the multilateral trading system, Xi said, adding that the two sides have already formed a strong economic symbiotic relationship. Noting that China remains committed to high-quality development and high-level opening up, Xi said that it will bring new opportunities for China-EU cooperation. The two sides should expand mutual openness, consolidate existing cooperation mechanisms, and foster new growth points in their cooperation, Xi said. Both sides should also ensure the success of activities celebrating the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties, enhance cultural exchanges and people-to-people interactions, encourage mutual visits between their people, and support local exchanges and educational cooperation, so as to strengthen the foundation of public goodwill in China-EU relations, Xi added.- As per Xinhua, Costa said: -The EU is ready to properly address economic and trade differences with China through dialogue and consultation, Costa said. Both the EU and China respect the principles of the UN Charter, uphold multilateralism, safeguard free trade, and oppose bloc confrontation, and they should cooperate rather than compete.- The two also discussed the war in Ukraine. Share Tracking People's Daily Costa summarised the call in a post on X. Meanwhile, Politico reports that -the European Union is considering holding a Brussels summit with China in May in a bid to soothe ties with Beijing early in Donald Trump's second term as U.S. president. The news comes as António Costa, who took office in December as president of the European Council, held an introductory phone call Tuesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two agreed that ‘the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties could be a good opportunity for a successful EU-China Summit later in the year,' said an EU official, who was granted anonymity as they were not authorized to speak on the record.- On trade issues, the report adds: -Trade relations between Brussels and Beijing remain tense, however, with the European Commission ruling on Tuesday that China's market access rules for medical devices are unfair to EU exporters. The decision followed a nine-month probe.- Subscribe now Next, there's a report on Xi's congratulatory message to Joseph Aoun on assuming the presidency of Lebanon. Xinhua reports: -Xi said that he attaches great importance to the development of China-Lebanon ties and is ready to work with President Aoun to promote the friendly relations between the two countries and mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields, so as to better benefit the two peoples. China will, as always, firmly support Lebanon in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and continue to provide assistance within its capacity for Lebanon's economic development and improvement of people's livelihood, Xi said.- Third, there's a report on Wang Huning's meeting with a delegation of Japan's ruling coalition, led by Secretary General Hiroshi Moriyama of the Liberal Democratic Party and Secretary General Makoto Nishida of the Komeito Party. Xinhua says: Wang said the -ruling parties of the two countries should carry out in-depth exchanges, deliver on the common understandings between the two countries' leaders, make joint efforts to develop bilateral relations, and promote the prosperity and development of the region and the world. ‘The CPPCC National Committee is ready to make positive contributions to this end,' said Wang. Representatives of the Japanese delegation said that Japan and China are important neighbors of each other. They said Japan is willing to promote people-to-people exchanges at all levels, including among young parliamentarians and local leaders, in accordance with the important consensus between the two countries' leaders and in the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences, in order to reduce differences and promote cooperation.- Another report in the paper, on Page 3, discusses the delegation's meeting with Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Wang told the delegation that -last November, President Xi Jinping met with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and reached an important consensus on comprehensively promoting the China-Japan strategic and mutually beneficial relationship and striving to build a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship that meets the requirements of the new era. At present, China-Japan relations are facing an important opportunity for improvement and development. It is hoped that both sides will make good use of the ruling party exchange mechanism platform to play a positive role in the development of China-Japan relations. The Japanese side expressed its willingness to work with the Chinese side to implement the consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, strengthen dialogue between the ruling parties, and promote concrete results in practical cooperation in various fields.- ，，11，，、、。，。，。，，，. Another report offers the official Chinese readout of the ninth meeting of the exchange mechanism between the Chinese and Japanese ruling parties. More than 60 representatives from Chinese central ministries, local governments, and Japan's ruling coalition participated. ILD chief Liu Jianchao led this meeting from the Chinese side. Liu said that -China was willing to work with Japan to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, adhere to peaceful coexistence, harmonious symbiosis, and harmony amid diversity, and promote the building of a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship that meets the requirements of the new era. The ruling parties of the two countries should strengthen dialogue and communication and take concrete actions to promote the sound and stable development of China-Japan relations.- ，，、、，、。，。 Finally, there's a report on the agreements reached during the delegation's visit. The report says: Both sides believe that the China-Japan ruling party exchange mechanism has played an important political guiding role in promoting the development of China-Japan relations since its first meeting in 2006, and welcomed the resumption of the inter-party talks after a period of 6 years and 3 months. Focusing on the mission and responsibilities of ruling parties, both sides engaged in candid discussions on the important responsibilities and roles that the two countries should assume to maintain international order based on international law amid global upheavals. The two sides had in-depth discussions and candidly exchanged views on enhancing mutual trust, expanding cultural exchanges and deepening mutually beneficial cooperation. The two sides agreed to follow the direction indicated by the leaders of the two countries, principles established in the four China-Japan political documents, work together to comprehensively promote the China-Japan strategic, mutually beneficial relations, and build a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship that meets the requirements of the new era. To this end, the ruling parties of the two countries will continue to strengthen dialogue. The two sides agreed that no matter what situation China-Japan relations face, they must maintain close dialogue and communication, strengthen exchanges between the two countries' political parties, political leaders and young politicians, enhance mutual understanding and trust, and lay a solid political foundation for improving and developing China-Japan relations and building a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship. The two sides exchanged views on issues such as the discharge of Fukushima nuclear contaminated water into the sea and the import of Japanese aquatic products, and agreed to promote the implementation of the consensus reached by the two governments, accelerate communication and consultations, and properly handle each other's concerns. The two sides confirmed that they will continue to promote practical cooperation between the two countries through exchanges between the ruling parties, and agreed in principle to hold the 10th meeting of the China-Japan ruling party exchange mechanism in Japan this autumn. ，2006，63。-——-，。、、，。，，，、。，。，，、，，，、。，，，。，。 Share Tracking People's Daily Back to the front page, there's a report informing that China implemented 46,967 water conservancy projects in 2024, with a total investment of 1.35 trillion yuan. The effort created 3.147 million jobs. Finally, there's a long feature talking about the earthquake rescue and relief work that has been carried out in Tibet. It says that -at present, the earthquake relief work is at a critical stage. All parties are working tirelessly to win the tough battle…- The piece offers an official relay of events in terms of the state's response. So -after the earthquake, General Secretary Xi Jinping attached great importance to it and issued important instructions … In accordance with General Secretary Xi Jinping's instructions and the request of Premier Li Qiang, Politburo member and Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing led relevant department officials on January 7 to the earthquake-stricken area in Shigatse, Tibet, to guide emergency rescue and response efforts on site. The safety and well-being of the affected people has always been close to the General Secretary's heart. On January 9, Xi Jinping presided over a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee to discuss and plan the earthquake relief efforts in Dingri, Tibet. The meeting emphasised the need to handle the work with even greater precision and to resolutely win the tough battle of earthquake relief.- ，，-，--，--，-。，、7。，。9，，。，，. The next bit in this section of the article essentially and rather emphatically talks about the Party's flag flying high at the forefront of the earthquake relief effort. There's no useful information, just charged rhetoric. For instance, -‘Be together with the masses', this is the solemn promise of Communist Party members when faced with a disaster-. --，. The next section is even more dramatic, with rescuers, with blistered hands, pulling people out of the rubble; doctors and volunteers working long hours with bloodshot eyes, etc. It also informs that -less than two days after the earthquake, a total of more than 12,000 rescue forces from various parties rushed to the scene and rescued 407 trapped people.- Another relevant data point is that as of 18:00 on January 12, a total of 2,198 prefabricated houses had been built to relocate people…166,200 blankets, 40,737 stoves for heating, and 118,000 sets of clothing had been provided. So whom should we thank for all this? -‘The smooth progress of earthquake relief work fully demonstrates the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, fully displays the magnificent scene of Chinese nation's unity as one family, watching out for and helping each other, and fully reflects the remarkable superiority of the socialist system and the incomparable warmth of the motherland's big family', said Wang Junzheng, Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee.- -，，、，。-. The next section has some details on response times and processes. Note: This is really important not just in itself — i.e., to understand the approach and mobilisation during a disaster — but also from a propaganda point of view. One cannot help juxtaposing this narrative from China with the political bickering that has taken place in the US in the past few months around natural disasters, be it with the storms before the election or the fires in California. Now, that said, this article does not mention the US or draw that comparison directly. But Chinese media has prominently covered the political back and forth in the US over the LA fires. For instance, this Xinhua report says that while wildfires rage, American politicians are busy spitting at each other/exchanging verbal attacks ( ). Ta Kung Pao's coverage talks about officials shirking responsibility. Also checkout this VOA report discussing Chinese media and social media comments on the California wildfires. It discusses the different approaches of Chinese media when covering the two natural disasters in California and Tibet. Anyway, the PD article says that: -On the morning of the 7th, just after 9 a.m., an earthquake alarm sounded at the National Emergency Command Center, and within 30 seconds, the internal response mechanism was activated… The heads of the Ministry of Emergency Management and other departments remotely connected with the local emergency command and rescue teams in the Tibet Autonomous Region. The emergency mechanism was launched immediately. The State Council's Earthquake Relief Headquarters set up a working group to strengthen overall coordination, bringing together various departments to fully carry out disaster relief efforts. The coordinated ‘game of chess' approach was clear, highlighting the advantages of the emergency management system with Chinese characteristics… Within 10 minutes of the earthquake, rescue aircraft had already flown over the disaster area; in less than 30 minutes, rescue teams began breaking through debris at the epicenter, the olive green, fire rescue orange, and emergency blue—various units entered the disaster-stricken area in an orderly manner and began their work. The effectiveness of China's emergency rescue system was immediately evident. Within a single day, local communication, networks, roads, and power supplies were gradually restored, and the affected residents were housed in emergency tents, enjoying hot meals three times a day… Emergency disaster relief supplies from the central government were immediately dispatched!On the evening of the 7th, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Emergency Management allocated 100 million yuan of central natural disaster relief funds, and the first batch of central disaster relief materials arrived in the disaster area… Whatever Tibet lacked, the central government allocated. On the evening of the 11th, the Tibet Autonomous Region requested the State Council's Earthquake Relief Headquarters for an additional 2,000 prefabricated shelters. By the morning of the 12th, the emergency management departments of Sichuan and Gansu provinces had begun organizing shipments… As of now, the Ministry of Natural Resources has completed 3,841 emergency inspections of geological hazard risks; the National Energy Administration has completed emergency power connections for 278 resettlement sites; and the National Health Commission and the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine continue to develop treatment plans for the injured on a ‘one person, one policy' basis. ‘Earthquake relief measures the leadership capacity of the ruling party, tests the government's execution ability, evaluates national mobilization capacity, and demonstrates national cohesion. The superiority of our socialist system is most evident in handling urgent, difficult, and critical challenges,' said Ma Liang, a professor at Peking University's School of Government.- 7，9，，，。-？--，，，。-。。，，，。--，。——。10，；，，、、……，。。，、、、，，。——。！7，、1，……，。11，2000；12，、。——。-，200，。-10，，，。，3841；278；、--……-，、、、。，。-.

Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, January 13, 2025. Page 1: On Sunday, there was a report on Xi Jinping issuing instructions for the high-quality development of audit-based oversight to provide safeguards for the country's high-quality economic and social development. The report had said: -Xi Jinping emphasised that on the new journey, it is necessary to be guided by the Thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, adhere to the centralised and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee over audit work, focus on main responsibilities and main tasks, deepen reform and innovation, strengthen self-construction, and strive to build a centralized, unified, comprehensive, authoritative, and efficient audit supervision system, continuously improve the quality and effectiveness of audit supervision, use high-quality audit supervision to support high-quality economic and social development, and make new contributions to comprehensively advancing the building of a strong country through Chinese-style modernization and the great cause of national rejuvenation.- ，，，，，，，、、，，，、. Today, there's an article discussing some of the deliberations at the National Audit Work Conference and the National Audit Institutions Advanced Collectives and Advanced Workers Commendation Conference that was held in Beijing. Here's an interesting excerpt from the report: -Deputy Director of the Policy Research Office of the National Audit Office, Lin Hai, stated that these achievements are a vivid practice of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era in the field of auditing. They represent significant results in the governance of the country by the Party Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, within the auditing domain. These accomplishments fully demonstrate and validate the truth and practical power of the Party's innovative theories. In the first 11 months of 2024, over 50,000 entities and more than 19,000 leading cadres were audited nationwide, resulting in the promotion of revenue growth, expenditure savings, and the recovery of losses totaling over 310 billion yuan. More than 20,000 rules and regulations were refined and perfected, and over 10,000 major issue clues identified through audits were transferred for further handling… Auditing is playing an increasingly important role in advancing the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity. Lin added: ‘We must bear in mind the instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping, take the implementation and effectiveness of the Party Central Committee's macro-control decisions and arrangements as the main line of work, and continue to carry out audits around promoting more active and effective macro policies and improving the efficiency of government investment, promoting the development of new quality productive forces and enhancing regional development vitality, and effectively preventing and resolving risks in key areas, so as to better serve the overall situation of economic and social development'.- ，，，。202411，5、1.9，3100；2，1……。-，，、、，。-. Share Tracking People's Daily There's also an article on the page offering a rather positive view of China's economic trajectory in 2025. Some data from the article: In the past year, new quality productive forces have developed steadily, and new economic momentum has continued to grow. From January to November 2024, the added value of high-tech manufacturing industries above designated size increased by 9% year-on-year, significantly faster than that of industrial enterprises above designated size; investment in high-tech industries increased by 8.8% year-on-year, significantly faster than the growth rate of total investment. Currently, China's inflation rate, fiscal deficit ratio, and government debt ratio are relatively low, and the policy toolbox remains well-stocked. Furthermore, as major global economies enter an interest rate reduction cycle, it will create greater room for China's policies to take effect, said Zhang Bin, Deputy Director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. -，、、，，，。-. The issuance of a 2 trillion yuan quota for replacing existing implicit debts has been completed; the management mechanism for special bonds has been improved, with an expansion of the areas where local special bonds can be directed; the reserve requirement ratio has been further reduced ... fiscal and monetary policies are being deployed intensively. Minister of Finance Lan Fo'an stated that this year, a more proactive fiscal policy will be implemented with sustained and stronger efforts to provide more support for stabilising growth and restructuring, forming a strong boost to economic growth. Pan Gongsheng, Governor of the People's Bank of China, said that the intensity of monetary policy adjustments will be increased, existing policies will be effectively implemented, and additional policies will be promoted to achieve tangible results. -，、、，，，。-。2；，；……。，，、，、，。，，，.

Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: Two pieces to note on the page. First, there's a Zhong Sheng commentary on China-US ties. It argues that this year's Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show showed how China-US cooperation is in mutual interest. It informs that at this year's show more than 1,300 Chinese companies participated, accounting for about 27% of all exhibitors. -Under the current circumstances, the common interests between China and the United States have not decreased but have instead increased. This is a shared perception among the vast majority of businesses and people in both countries and serves as an important foundation for both sides to move towards each other and engage in mutually beneficial cooperation. Looking back at 2024, China hosted over 3,800 economic and trade exhibitions. Whether it was U.S. companies having the largest exhibition area at the Import Expo, or U.S. companies ranking first among overseas exhibitors at the Supply Chain Expo, or the frequent visits to China by many US business executives, the business communities of China and the US have been creating opportunities and achieving mutual success through their exchanges. The cooperation between enterprises from both sides shows that as long as we adhere to mutual respect, mutual benefit, equal consultation, follow economic laws and market rules, and expand and deepen mutually beneficial economic and trade cooperation, China and the US can absolutely achieve win-win results. ，，，，、。2024，3800，，，，、。，、、，，，. It adds: -no matter from which angle we look at Sino-US relations, we can find that China and the United States have extensive common interests, and mutual benefit and win-win are the essential characteristics of Sino-US relations. This is sufficient to enlighten both sides that they should be partners, not opponents; should achieve success together, not harm each other; should seek common ground while reserving differences, rather than engage in malicious competition. China has proposed that both sides should uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation to find a correct way for China-U.S. relations in the new era. This is both a profound summary of past experience and an important guide toward the future.- 46，，，，，。，；，；，。、、，，，. The next paragraph says: -Ancient Chinese said, ‘trade is a path of mutual benevolence and a path of mutual benefit.' There is an inscription at the entrance of the US Department of Commerce Library: ‘Promoting peace and commerce with all people.' Mutual benefit is a principle that holds true both in ancient times and today, and is the consensus of the business communities of China and the US. In 2024, Tesla's sales in China exceeded 657,000 vehicles, an 8.8% year-on-year increase, setting a record high. In the fourth quarter, Starbucks added a net of 290 new stores in mainland China, entering 78 new county-level markets. By the end of 2024, the number of US companies established in China reached 73,000, with a total investment exceeding $1.2 trillion, covering fields such as electronics and communications, automobile manufacturing, consumer goods, and financial services. Countless cases show that US companies investing and doing business in China not only make profits but also benefit the people of both countries. China is committed to advancing Chinese-style modernisation, while the US is working to revitalise its economy, creating boundless space for cooperation between both sides. By focusing on common interests, the list of China-US cooperation can be made longer, and the cake of cooperation can be made bigger.- ，-，，-。--。，，。2024，65.7，8.8%，；290，78……2024，7.3，1.2，、、、。，，，。，，。，，. The interests of China and the US are deeply intertwined, and it is normal for contradictions and differences to arise, but this should not become an obstacle to the two countries' cooperation. Facing the new situation and changes in Sino-US economic and trade relations in recent years, both sides should respect each other, seek common ground while reserving differences, and adopt constructive ways to enhance understanding and expand consensus. Starting tariff wars, trade wars, and technology wars for various reasons goes against historical trends and economic laws, and there will be no winners. Artificially setting limits or engaging in protectionism will only interfere with normal trade exchanges and the stability of global industrial and supply chains, which does not serve the interests of any party. Gary Shapiro, CEO of the US Consumer Technology Association, organizer of the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show, said that raising tariffs will threaten the growth of the US technology industry. The report published by the association predicts that if the new US government implements its proposed high tariff policy, the purchasing power of US consumers for consumer technology industry products and services will decrease by $90 billion to $143 billion in 2025. Maurice Obstfeld, former Chief Economist of the International Monetary Fund, also recently stated that attempting to use tariffs to enhance US influence in the global economy could backfire and harm the US economy. ，，。，、，、。、、，，。，，。、·，。，，20259001430。·，，.

Page 9: There's an article by Dong Zhiyong who is a Vice President at Peking University and a member of the Standing Committee of the PKU Party Committee. Dong writes about China's approach of AI+ development. I don't usually cover such pieces, but I thought this was a good read for an overview of the policy direction with regard to AI. Dong writes: In recent times, driven by policy guidance, technological breakthroughs and industrial applications, China has made remarkable achievements in the development of AI. AI technology development in China has achieved continuous breakthroughs, especially in the fields of speech recognition, image processing, intelligent manufacturing, and autonomous driving. In these domains, China is at the international leading level. At the same time, with the continuous maturity of technology and the continuous expansion of application scenarios, AI development in China is steadily advancing toward deep integration and innovation-driven development, contributing Chinese wisdom to the development of the global intelligent economy. ，、，。，、、、。，，，. He added that -in recent years, China has accelerated the construction of new information infrastructure and laid a solid foundation for the development of AI. As of November 2024, China has built a total of 4.191 million 5G base stations; there are around 1.002 billion 5G mobile phone users. It has also built the world's largest 5G network, accumulating rich technology, data, industry, scenarios and market foundations for the development of AI. For example, some e-commerce platforms and social platforms have relied on new information infrastructure and massive user data to deeply integrate big data analysis, AI algorithms, cloud computing and other technologies to promote the intelligent upgrading of industries and form a virtuous circle. From ‘Internet+' and digitalisation to ‘AI+', this is not only a leap in the ‘technology-economy' paradigm but also a profound transformation in development models, capable of fostering new economic growth points and injecting new momentum into high-quality economic development.- 。，。，，。202411，5G419.1，5G10.02，5G，、、、。，、，、、，，。-+-、-+-，-—-，，，. The continuously optimised policy environment provides support for AI development. China places great emphasis on AI development, evidenced by initiatives like the New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan, the Three-Year Action Plan to Promote the Development of the New Generation AI Industry (2018–2020), and the ‘AI+' Action. These efforts have strengthened the top-level design for AI development. At the same time, local governments are encouraged to integrate their unique characteristics into exploratory practices, creating AI development hubs. For example, Beijing released its ‘AI+' Action Plan, focusing on creating benchmark applications in robotics, education, healthcare, culture, transportation, and other fields. Shenzhen introduced measures to build itself into a pioneer AI city, emphasizing advanced manufacturing, modern services, and scientific research to enable AI to empower a wide range of industries. Shanghai advanced its ‘AI+' initiative in government services, creating a convenient and efficient ‘Smart Easy Service' brand for public administration. Other regions have successively launched special action plans to promote the deep integration of AI with local economies, accelerate the creation of AI ecosystems with regional characteristics, and establish development patterns with demonstrative effects. 。，《》《（2018—2020）》-+-，。，，。，-+-，、、、、；，、，；-+-，--；。，，，. Rich application scenarios have expanded the space for the development of AI. In terms of technology research and development, innovative applications of AI technology have not only driven the optimisation of algorithms but also facilitated breakthroughs in intelligent chips and hardware. According to statistics from the World Intellectual Property Organization, from 2014 to 2023, China filed more than 38,000 patents for generative AI, ranking first globally. At present, China has initially established a relatively comprehensive AI industrial system, with an industry chain covering key upstream and downstream segments such as chips, algorithms, data, platforms, and applications. Several large AI models independently developed by China have been widely applied in areas such as transportation, online shopping, learning, and office work. From an industry perspective, AI technology has been widely used in fields such as intelligent manufacturing, smart cities, and autonomous driving, promoting the growth and strengthening of emerging industries. It has also facilitated the intelligent upgrading and digital transformation of traditional industries. According to the 2023–2024 China Intelligent Manufacturing Development Annual Report, in 2023, the scale of industries related to smart manufacturing in China grew by 14.9% year-on-year, reaching 2.88416 trillion yuan, with high growth expected to continue over the next three years. From a regional perspective, China has formed several internationally competitive AI industry clusters centered in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. These clusters have provided strong momentum for the development of the AI industry while promoting coordinated regional economic development. The abundance of application scenarios has explored new models and paths for AI development. 。，，。，2014—2023，3.8，。，，、、、、。，、、。，、、，，、。《2023—2024》，202314.9%，28841.6，3。，、、，，。，.

Only by coordinating development and security and giving equal importance to both can we ensure that the ship of China rides winds and waves and moves steadily toward the future. AI opens up new development space for new quality productive forces. Empowering the development of new quality productive forces with ‘AI+' is of great significance for achieving high-quality development and high-level security.- ，，。，，、。。-+-，. Inject momentum into economic transformation and upgrading. At present, China's economy is at a critical juncture of high-quality development, and the task of achieving the transformation of development drivers, mode change, and structural adjustment is arduous. AI promotes comprehensive changes in production methods, business models, and consumption patterns through in-depth analysis and processing of various types of data, providing strong impetus for economic transformation and upgrading. In traditional industries, using AI to promote intelligent transformation and digital transformation can improve production efficiency, reduce production costs, and develop towards high-end, intelligent, and green development. For example, some intelligent garment factories have achieved seamless integration of integrated production processes from cutting, sewing, ironing to warehousing matching by introducing auxiliary design large models, greatly increasing the proportion of customized clothing in total production. In the field of emerging industries, AI has created a large number of business opportunities and development space, giving birth to new industries and new models such as autonomous driving and smart medical care, and creating new economic growth points. 。，，、、。，、、，。，，、，、、。，，、、，。，，、，. Providing support for economic security. As the profound changes unseen in a century accelerate, ensuring economic security is crucial for continuously enhancing China's economic competitiveness, innovation capacity, and resilience to risks. The application of AI can, on the basis of promoting industrial structure optimization and upgrading, increase the overall added value of industries, enhance the diversity of industrial entities, reduce dependence on single markets or resources, improve the ability to cope with uncertainty, and thereby enhance the resilience and security level of industrial and supply chains. As AI integrates more deeply with the real economy, data security has become a global and systemic issue. The application of AI helps build a secure and controllable technological framework, enhances real-time responses to cybersecurity threats through automated monitoring systems, prevents risks such as data leaks and hacker attacks, and ensures information security across various fields. 。，、、。，，，，，，。，、。，，，、，. Lay a solid foundation for improving the inclusiveness of development. As an important force for empowering new quality productive forces, AI improves the inclusiveness of development by improving resource allocation and service efficiency. For example, in the field of rural revitalization, AI provides more accurate demand forecasting and resource allocation plans for poverty-stricken areas through big data analysis and intelligent algorithms, which helps to increase farmers' income and improve local production and living conditions. In the field of education, AI has improved the popularity and fairness of educational resources through personalized teaching and intelligent tutoring. In terms of public services, the application of AI in data governance, intelligent decision-making and other fields can improve the efficiency and accuracy of social governance and help promote the modernization of national governance. 。，，。，，，，，。，、，。，、，，. Share Tracking People's Daily In the final section, he writes: At present, China's AI development has entered a new stage. It is necessary to be cognisant that there is still a gap between the overall development level of AI in China and that of developed countries. To implement the task of ‘launching the -AI+- action and cultivating future industries' proposed by the Central Economic Work Conference, we must…firmly grasp the major historical opportunities for the development of AI, and accelerate the innovative development of AI. ，。，。-‘+'，-，、、，，。 The tasks, therefore, are to: Build a healthy and complete industrial ecology: -It is necessary to establish a market-oriented innovation system that promotes deep cooperation and collaboration among multiple stakeholders, including technology researchers, investors, and market participants, forming a digital innovation ecosystem with integrated development of industry, academia, research, and application. Build an industrial ecology with technology research and development, scenario application, and industrial upgrading as the core, and create an interconnected and resource-sharing ecosystem. Based on the resource endowments and industrial foundations of each region, differentiated industrial cluster development strategies should be formulated to promote the distinctive development of local industrial clusters. Give full play to the leading role of leading enterprises in the cluster, drive innovation and resource integration of upstream and downstream enterprises, enhance the overall competitiveness of the cluster, encourage small and medium-sized enterprises to integrate into the AI industry cluster, and form competitive advantages in their respective segments through collaborative innovation A regional coordination development mechanism should be established to promote cross-regional exchange and dissemination of AI technologies, gradually expanding the application scenarios and coverage of ‘AI+'. 。，。，、、，。、，、。，，。，，，，。，，-+-. Build an effective data factor market: Building an efficient, open and innovative data factor market is an important guarantee for the development of AI. It is necessary to explore the establishment of a data property rights system, promote the structural division and orderly circulation of data property rights, and coordinate the construction of standardized and efficient data trading platforms. As an important part of social resources, public data plays an irreplaceable role in promoting the application and innovation of AI. To this end, we should promote the implementation of the public data rights confirmation and authorization mechanism, further increase the intensity of data openness, and promote the expansion of the supply and use scope of public data that does not carry personal information and does not affect public safety according to its purposes. Respect the labor and other factors of data processors such as data collection and processing, and fully guarantee the rights of data processors to use data and obtain benefits. 。、。、，。，，。，。，，，，。、，. Build a multi-level talent training system. -It is necessary to strengthen the reform of basic education and higher education in AI, strengthen the popularization of basic knowledge of AI in primary and secondary schools, strengthen vocational training, focus on improving the digital literacy of workers, and adjust and optimize the curriculum in colleges and universities according to the needs of the development of the AI industry. Optimize talent introduction policies, improve talent incentive mechanisms, and attract and retain top global talents. Pay attention to the career development and subsequent security of talent, ensuring that more high-end talent can be introduced and retained, strengthening their sense of belonging and creativity. Actively promote cooperation and exchanges between domestic institutions and international organizations or overseas universities, utilizing global intellectual resources to advance China's AI innovation and development. 。，。，，，，。，，。，、，。、，。 Optimize AI regulatory policies: It is necessary to promote the standardized development of AI and optimize regulatory policies. Improve the legal framework in terms of data privacy protection, algorithm transparency, and technical ethics, clarify the red lines for technology development and application and the boundaries of responsibility of each subject, and ensure the safety and fairness of technology.Establish a multi-party communication mechanism, establish a cross-departmental and cross-field regulatory coordination mechanism, and form a joint force in technology research and development, data use, and ethical assessment.Strengthen international cooperation, promote global coordination of rules and unified technical standards, accelerate the construction of an inclusive and prudent governance mechanism, encourage all sectors to actively participate in the ethical and safety supervision of AI, and ensure that the development of AI technology is in line with human welfare.。。，，。、、，，。，、，、、。，，，，。 Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Finally, there's a commentary drawing from the CCDI plenary's outcomes. The commentary says that currently China is in a critical period. -How to turn the grand blueprint of Chinese-style modernisation into a beautiful reality? How to ensure that the Party always remains the strong leadership core of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics? The key to answering these major questions is to persist in governing the Party with the spirit of reform and strict standards, deepen the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party, and carry out the Party's great self-revolution to the end.- ，，，、。？？，，，. History and practice have repeatedly proved that the unity of the Party is the life of the Party, and the strong and powerful leadership of the Party Central Committee is the fundamental guarantee for us to overcome all difficulties and risks. General Secretary Xi Jinping has emphasised that ‘maintaining a high degree of alignment with the Party Central Committee must be carried out in words and deeds'. This is not only an intrinsic requirement for ensuring the Party's unity and cohesion but also an urgent necessity for overcoming challenges and seizing the initiative. In the new era and on the new journey, we must unremittingly use Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era to unite our hearts and forge our souls, promote political supervision to focus on specific issues, pursue precise results, and implement it as regular practice, ensuring that the whole Party maintains a high degree of unity with the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core in terms of thought, politics, and actions and ensuring that all decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee are effectively implemented, and work together to promote reform and promote high-quality development. ，，。：-。-，、。，，、、，、、，，、. The commentary then calls for strict self-discipline. It says that -strengthening the Party's discipline is an ongoing task. Only by establishing a normalised and long-term discipline education mechanism, strictly enforcing the Party's discipline, and accurately applying the ‘four forms' can we guide Party members and cadres to transform external restraint into self-discipline, internalizing it as a subconscious standard for daily words and actions. The Party's discipline and the pursuit of reform and innovation are inherently unified. The Party's discipline not only serves as a tool for education and constraint but also provides protection and encouragement. It is both an ‘incantation for control' and a ‘protective talisman'. Efforts must unify strict management and supervision with encouragement for taking responsibility, enabling cadres to pursue reform and innovation while adhering to rules and discipline.- ，，，，--，、，。，，，--，--。，、。 The next bit calls for a focus on top leaders and for all institutions to fulfill their responsibilities.

He also reiterated Nigeria's unwavering adherence to the one-China principle and pledged continued support for China's stance on the international stage, emphasizing that it is the right thing to do.- Wang and Tuggar later met the press. In that interaction, Wang talked about China being ready to work with African countries to implement the GSI. He added: -China firmly supports Africans in solving African problems in an African way. The African people are the real masters of this continent, and they have the wisdom, ability and right to solve their own problems. China opposes external forces interfering in the internal affairs of African countries in any form, supports the African Union and various sub-regional organizations to play a constructive role, supports African powers to strengthen leading actions, promote the resolution of problems and differences through dialogue and consultation, and resolve hot-spot issues through political means.- 。，、。，，，，. -China will firmly support Africa in strengthening its capacity building for peace and security.

China is also willing to make its best efforts to this end. 。，，，10，60001000。，。。，。，。，。。，3600，，，。，。，，，，。. Share Tracking People's Daily Another report (English report) on the page informs that Prime Minister of Grenada Dickon Mitchell will pay an official visit to China from January 11 to 17. One other report to note, although it's not in the paper today. China's Ministry of Commerce has said that the EU's practices in its foreign subsidy investigations against Chinese enterprises have constituted trade and investment barriers. The announcement followed the conclusion of a six-month probe, which was initiated at the request of the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products. Xinhua reports: -Under its foreign subsidies regulation, the EU has conducted preliminary, in-depth and raid investigations into Chinese companies in sectors such as locomotives, photovoltaics, wind power and security check equipment, said the ministry when initiating the probe into trade and investment barriers last July. The EU's investigations involved unreasonable practices that violated the World Trade Organization's core principles, including non-discrimination, the ministry said, citing stakeholders who participated in the probe. The stakeholders believe that the EU's investigations consisted of inappropriate penalties and unreasonable time constraints, and lacked procedural transparency and legitimacy, according to the ministry. The probe found that during the investigations, regulations were ‘selectively enforced' and the criteria used to determine foreign subsidies were vague. It also noted that the scope of the EU's investigations was overly broad, placing an ‘immense burden' on the companies, and that key concepts, such as market distortion, were defined in a ‘subjective and arbitrary' manner. Such investigations have harmed trade and investment between China and the EU by restricting Chinese companies' products, services and investments from entering the EU market, thereby damaging the competitiveness of relevant Chinese companies and products, the ministry said. The probe results revealed that Chinese enterprises have incurred significant economic losses, both directly and indirectly, due to the EU's investigations, including approximately 7.6 billion yuan (about 1.06 billion U.S. dollars) in abandoned bidding projects, with other affected projects valued at over 8 billion yuan.- It adds: -The ministry will take measures, including bilateral consultations, to urge the European side to adjust or change relevant practices in order to ensure an open, fair, just, non-discriminatory and predictable environment for Chinese enterprises to invest and operate in Europe.- Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

CCDI Plenary Communiqué Outlines Tougher Action Plans in Anti-Corruption Struggle - Boosting Support for 'Two New' Policies in 2025	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, January 9, 2025. Page 1: Let's begin with the full communique after the CCDI plenary session. 131 CCDI members and 247 observers attended the plenary session. The first substantive paragraph outlines what was done during the plenary. It begins by saying that the -session thoroughly studied and implemented Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.- The next bit says: The plenary session earnestly studied and deeply understood the important speech by General Secretary Xi Jinping. It unanimously held that the speech fully affirmed the new progress and achievements in comprehensive and strict Party governance over the past year, grasped the basic laws of the anti-corruption struggle from the strategic height of realizing the Party's mission and tasks in the new era and new journey, and deeply analyzed the current situation of the anti-corruption struggle, unequivocally clarified erroneous understandings and cleared ideological fog with a clear-cut stance, put forward clear requirements for resolutely fighting the tough, protracted, and comprehensive battles against corruption, made strategic plans to provide strong guarantees for advancing Chinese-style modernization with new achievements in comprehensive and strict Party governance, and placed high expectations on discipline inspection and supervision cadres. 、。，，，，，、，、、，，.

A sense of reverence must always be maintained, efforts must be intensified to strengthen the standardization, legalisation, and professionalization of discipline inspection and supervision work, and truly achieve loyalty, cleanliness and responsibility, and dare to struggle and be good at struggle. 、、、，、、，、、。，，、，、，--，，，、、，。，，、. The long paragraph below gives a recap of the work from 2024. The plenary session pointed out that in 2024, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the Party adhered to leading the great social revolution through self-revolution, united and guided the entire Party and people of all ethnic groups to focus their efforts and overcome challenges and took new and solid strides in advancing Chinese-style modernisation. The CCDI, NSC and discipline inspection and supervision agencies at all levels adhered to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, firmly supported the Two Establishments and resolutely implemented the Two Safeguards'; focusing on the central tasks of the Party and the country, they continued to deepen political supervision, rectify work styles, discipline and the fight against corruption; promoted the improvement of the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party system, improved the supervision system of the Party and the country, consolidated and expanded the results of thematic education and education rectification, and ensured that the high-quality development of discipline inspection and supervision work in the new era and new journey achieved new results. The CCDI Standing Committee made the study and implementation of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, especially Xi Jinping's important thought on the Party's self-revolution, the central theme and focus throughout the year, leading the whole system to deeply study and understand the Party's innovative theories, and firmly follow the correct direction of discipline inspection and supervision work. The mechanism for making political oversight more specific, precise, and normalised were improved, with political supervision being focussed around the major decisions of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee to ensure the effective implementation of the Party Central Committee's policies and plans. In the study and education of Party discipline, efforts are made to excel as the ‘first phalanx', thoroughly studying and comprehending General Secretary Xi Jinping's important discourses on comprehensively strengthening the Party's disciplinary construction. Focusing closely on the ‘Six Disciplines', each was studied item by item and discussed in depth, guiding the entire system to learn more profoundly, become familiar with and effectively apply the knowledge, and promote the entire Party to study, understand, respect, and abide by discipline. We continued to severely curb hedonism and extravagance, severely rectified formalism and bureaucratism, and ensured the implementation of the eight-point central regulation in an in-depth and practical manner through effective and long-term governance. The anti-corruption struggle was pushed forward in depth, with intensified efforts in key sectors such as finance, state-owned enterprises, energy, tobacco, pharmaceuticals, sports, infrastructure projects, and bidding processes; corruption involving collusion between officials and businesses were severely investigated and dealt with; new and hidden forms of corruption were thoroughly investigated and deal with; efforts to investigate both bribe-taking and bribe giving were strengthened, and reforms based on cases were deepened to eliminate the soil and conditions that breed corruption. Focused rectification was carried out on misconduct and corruption directly affecting the people, with extraordinary measures being taken to punish ‘fly and ant' corruption, resolutely safeguarding the interests of the people and consolidating the Party's governance foundation. Political inspections were deepened, with routine inspections conducted for 68 departments and units, the first-ever coordinated inspections in the financial sector, and higher-level inspections conducted in prefecture-level cities. Immediate investigations and corrections were carried out during inspections, further highlighting the comprehensive supervisory role of inspections. The discipline inspection and supervision system and legal framework were further improved. The CCDI cooperated with the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to amend the Supervision Law, comprehensively advanced the construction of a digital discipline inspection and supervision system, and promoted the better transformation of institutional advantages into the effectiveness of rectifying misconduct and combating corruption. While affirming the achievements, the plenary session conducted a realistic analysis of existing problems in discipline inspection and supervision work and in the building of the cadre team, calling for great attention and practical solutions to address these issues. ，2024，，、，。，--、--，，、，、，，。，，。、、，，。--，，--、，、，。、，、，。，、、、、、、，，，，，。，--，，。，68，、，、，。，，，。，，、. The plenary session emphasized that comprehensively promoting the development of a strong country and the great cause of national rejuvenation through Chinese-style modernization has placed new and higher requirements for the fight against corruption. The discipline inspection and supervision organs should: truly unify their thoughts and actions with the accurate judgment of the situation and the scientific deployment of tasks by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core deeply grasp the historic achievements made in the fight against corruption in the new era, and firmly believe in winning the tough battle against corruption; deeply grasp the current situation of the anti-corruption struggle, which is still severe and complex, and firmly maintain the determination to win the protracted battle against corruption; deeply grasp the policy and strategy of promoting the principle of not daring to be corrupt, not being able to be corrupt, and not wanting to be corrupt, and firmly maintain the strong determination to win the overall battle against corruption. ，、，。、，，；，；、、，. The plenary session proposed that 2025 is the final year of implementing the 14th Five-Year Plan. To do a good job this year, it is necessary to adhere to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, fully implement the spirit of the 20th Party Congress and the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the 20th Central Committee, thoroughly study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping's important thoughts on Party building and the Party's self-revolution, deeply understand the decisive significance of the Two Establishments, strengthen the four consciousnesses, enhance the four self-confidences, and achieve the Two Safeguards, persist in governing the Party with the spirit of reform and strict standards, promote the implementation of the political responsibility of comprehensive and strict Party governance, promote the improvement of the system of comprehensive and strict Party governance, deepen the rectification of work style, discipline and anti-corruption struggle, and continuously promote the high-quality development of discipline inspection and supervision work in the new era and new journey, thereby providing strong guarantees for promoting Chinese-style modernization with new achievements in comprehensive and strict Party governance. ，2025--。，，、，、，--，--、--、--，，，，，，. After this, the communique makes 8 points for work going forward: First, strengthen political supervision around the major arrangements of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, and strive to promote further comprehensive deepening of reform and steady progress in China-style modernization. Resolutely safeguard the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee over the further comprehensive deepening of reform, closely focus on the progress of achieving the overall reform goal and progress in the ‘seven focuses' and 13 goals, refine and substantiate the content of supervision, driving Party organizations at all levels to concentrate efforts on reform and focus on implementation. ，，、。，--、13，，、.

Through ‘joint rectification', eliminate the common roots of misconduct and corruption, and strengthen timely warning and supervision of situations where leading cadres' spouses, children, and their spouses illegally engage in business activities. Promote the establishment of a political ecology analysis and assessment mechanism with unified leadership of the Party Committee, organizational coordination of the CCDI, and coordinated linkage of relevant departments. Improve the joint punishment mechanism for key bribe-givers, formulate a three-year action plan for the construction of a clean culture in the new era (2025-2027), and tell the story of China's anti-corruption struggle well. Use ‘investigation' and ‘rectification' in a coordinated manner to block the evolution of misconduct and corruption, formulate opinions on advancing the simultaneous investigation and rectification of misconduct and corruption issues, and leverage big data and informatization to empower efforts to rectify misconduct and combat corruption. ，，。--，，--，、、、，、；，，、、、、、、、、、，、、，、、，、，。--，、，、、，，（2025—2027），。--、--，，. Fourth, continue to deepen the rectification of unhealthy practices and corruption around the masses, and strive to promote the reform and development results to benefit the general public better and more equitably.

Assist the Party's Central Committee in formulating the working methods for Party Committees (Party Groups) to conduct supervisory talks with lower-level ‘top leaders' and in drafting the Anti-cross-border Corruption Law. Promote the improvement of the Party and state supervision system with intra-Party supervision as the leading factor, specialized supervision as the main body, grassroots supervision as the support, and coordination of various types of supervision as the guarantee. ，，。，、，，、--。（）--，。、、、，. Seventh, strengthen the political responsibility for comprehensive and strict Party governance, striving to maintain a consistent tone of strictness from start to finish. With the ‘two responsibilities' as the guide, promote the main responsibility of the Party committee (Party group), the regulatory responsibility of functional departments, and the supervision responsibility of discipline inspection commissions (or discipline inspection teams), ensuring that all work in the same direction, thereby improving the responsibility pattern of managing and governing the Party with each entity assuming their responsibility and maintaining coordination. Urge Party organizations at all levels to use systematic thinking and scientific methods to advance Party governance, further improving the comprehensive and strict Party governance system. ，，。--，（）、、（），、。、，.

The communique ends by calling for -closer unity around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core-. Share Tracking People's Daily Subscribe now Page 2: There's a report on the NDRC and Ministry of Finance's notice on increasing efforts to implement the ‘two new' policies in 2025, i.e., equipment renewal and consumer goods trade-in. Zhao Chenxin, NDRC Deputy Director, provided some data: In 2024, more than 6.5 million vehicles were scrapped and replaced nationwide. In 2024, among the more than 4,600 equipment renewal projects supported by ultra-long-term special treasury bonds alone, the equipment renewal volume in industry, energy consumption, energy and electricity, transportation and other fields exceeded 2 million units (sets). Preliminary estimates show that under the ‘two new' policies, the total equipment renewal volume in key areas exceeded 20 million units (sets). 。2024，4600，、、、200（）。，--，2000（），. The ‘two new' policies have promoted the rapid growth of equipment manufacturing and consumer goods industry. In November 2024, the added value of equipment manufacturing increased by 7.6% year-on-year, contributing nearly 50% to the growth of added value of industrial enterprises above designated size; the added value of equipment industries such as shipbuilding and related equipment manufacturing, smart consumer equipment manufacturing, and lithium-ion battery manufacturing increased by 20.1%, 10.7% and 8.8% year-on-year respectively. 。--。202411，7.6%，50%；、、20.1%、10.7%8.8%.

First, there's a report on Wang meeting with President of the Republic of the Congo Denis Sassou Nguesso and Foreign Minister Jean-Claude Gakosso. Xinhua's report on th Wang-Denis Sassou Nguesso meeting says: -Noting that Sassou is a renowned African politician and one of the African leaders who have visited China the most and met with Xi the most, Wang said the deep friendship between the two leaders serves as a vital political guarantee for China-Congo and China-Africa relations. The Chinese foreign minister's tradition of starting the year with a visit to Africa is a testament to China's unwavering solidarity with African nations, Wang said. Calling the Republic of the Congo a staunch friend and important partner of China, Wang praised the country's vibrant development under Sassou's leadership. China will remain the country's most reliable friend and partner during its development and revitalization journey, he said. The Republic of the Congo's role as the FOCAC's co-chair reflects Africa's confidence in the country, Wang said. As the best platform for deepening China-Africa cooperation and achieving common development, the FOCAC has been leading global cooperation with Africa, Wang said, noting that China is willing to work closely with the Republic of the Congo to comprehensively implement the outcomes of the FOCAC Beijing Summit, support Africa's development and jointly pursue modernization. These efforts will also enhance the Republic of the Congo's development and elevate its global standing, he added.- The report on Wang's meeting with Jean-Claude Gakosso says that the two sides pledged to implement the outcomes of FOCAC. Wang -said that it has long been a tradition for China's foreign minister to make Africa the destination of the first overseas trip each year. The longstanding tradition, which underscores China's enduring solidarity and cooperation with Africa, is the cornerstone of China's foreign policy and a firm strategic choice. He added that regardless of changes in the international landscape, China will remain committed to deepening its relations and cooperation with Africa. Describing the Republic of the Congo as a steadfast friend of China, Wang said that the two countries have shared an unbreakable bond for more than 60 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties, which is characterized by consistent mutual understanding and support through challenges… As co-chair of the FOCAC, the Republic of the Congo reflects the high-level partnership between the two nations and embodies the aspirations of the African continent, Wang said, expressing his confidence in the Republic of the Congo's active fulfillment of its responsibilities as chair, contributing to the implementation of the FOCAC Beijing Summit's outcomes and advancing China-Africa cooperation. These efforts, Wang added, will not only strengthen the Republic of the Congo's development but also enhance its international influence. Wang also reaffirmed China's commitment to working with African nations toward building an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era.- As per Xinhua, -Gakosso emphasized that the two nations have forged a unique and enduring bond, making their relationship a model for international relations. He attributed this success to their shared dedication to safeguarding global peace, upholding international justice, and pursuing common development…Gakosso reaffirmed the Republic of the Congo's unwavering support for the one-China principle and China's efforts to achieve national reunification, stressing that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. He also voiced support for the Belt and Road Initiative and China's three global initiatives, namely the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative, and expects to learn from China's governance experience.- Second, Wang met with Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno on Wednesday. Mahamat reportedly said that -Xi is a visionary leader, steering China toward remarkable economic achievements and a pivotal role on the global stage…China's cooperation with Africa has always been based on mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit, yielding fruitful results, he said. He also expressed gratitude to China for its enduring support for Africa's development, particularly Chad's progress. China is Chad's important strategic partner and a reliable friend, with their bilateral relations serving as a model of mutual respect and win-win cooperation, Mahamat said. Chad firmly supports China's efforts to safeguard its territorial integrity and achieve national unity while opposing interference in its internal affairs, he stressed. China is committed to upholding global fairness and justice, playing a constructive role in addressing key international issues, the Chadian president said, noting that Chad is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with China to uphold shared positions and protect common interests.- Xinhua adds: -China has always advocated that all countries, big or small, strong or weak, are equal, Wang said, noting that China opposes all forms of hegemony, bullying, and unilateralism. He expressed China's willingness to strengthen strategic coordination with Chad and continue to provide steadfast mutual support. China appreciates Chad's efforts in staying independent and self-reliant, and pursuing development and revitalization that suits its national conditions and is ready to work with Chad to actively implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state and the outcomes of the FOCAC Beijing Summit, Wang said. China seeks to deepen exchanges on governance experience, solidify political trust through shared values, and comprehensively expand mutually beneficial cooperation to support Chad's development and revitalization and jointly build an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era.- Page 7: There's a report informing that Guangzhou is now focussing on developing 15 strategic industrial clusters.

Tibet Quake - Elderly Care Services Guideline - Tasks to Build a Unified National Market - Guideline for Government Investment Funds - Japanese Politi...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, January 8, 2025. Page 1: The lead report on the page is about Xi Jinping's instructions following the 6.8-magnitude earthquake that hit Shigatse in Tibet yesterday. Xi -ordered all-out rescue efforts to save lives and minimize casualties.- Xinhua adds that he called for -utmost efforts to carry out search and rescue and provide medical treatment for the injured. He also urged efforts to prevent secondary disasters, properly resettle affected residents, and handle the aftermath effectively. It is essential to strengthen earthquake monitoring and early warning, promptly allocate disaster relief supplies, expedite the repair of damaged infrastructure, ensure the basic needs of residents are met, and guarantee a safe and warm winter for all-. In addition, Li Qiang issued instructions. Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing is leading officials in Tibet, it seems. The Office of the State Council's Earthquake Relief Headquarters and the Ministry of Emergency Management have launched the national earthquake level 3 emergency response. Of course, the story says nothing about the impact of the earthquake or casualties. As per reports, the death toll is at around 126. If you are interested in the official details of the emergency response, there's a report that provides those. Next, there's a commentary drawing from Xi's speech at the CCDI plenary. Some key excerpts: -Over the past year, ‘tigers' have been targeted without exception, while ‘flies' and ‘ants' (minor corrupt officials) have also been punished, with more than 700,000 cases of unhealthy practices and corruption among the masses being investigated and dealt with. Since the new era, the Party, military, and public have experienced unprecedented cohesion and unity; one important reason is that our Party has always punished corruption with a zero-tolerance attitude. ，--，--，70。，，. And then we have a new slogan: -In his important speech, General Secretary Xi Jinping made encapsulated the Party's achievements as the ‘two historical initiatives' (): we secured the historical initiative to ensure the Party does not deteriorate, change colour, or change flavour, and won the historical initiative for the Party to unite and lead the entire people in the joint endeavor of building a strong nation and achieving national rejuvenation-. --：-、、，、.- The article reiterates that the current situation of the fight against corruption remains severe and complex, and the task of eradicating the soil and conditions that breed corruption is still arduous. The key point is to -dispel the ideological fog- so that one can -further build consensus and enhance the awareness of action.- ，，。，，。，。，，、。 The next bit says that -corruption and power often go hand in hand, which makes the fight against corruption a long-term historical process. As long as the soil and conditions that breed corruption exist, the fight against corruption will remain ongoing … deeply analyzing the corrupt elements investigated and dealt with since the 20th Party Congress shows that the vast majority of their disciplinary violations and illegal behaviors continued from before the 18th Party Congress and till after the 20th Party Congress, indicating both new and residual corruption. With new anti-corruption technologies, tools, and methods, corrupt officials are finding it increasingly difficult to hide. Corruption undermines fairness and justice, disrupts the business environment, and disturbs economic order. Only by resolutely removing this malignant tumor can we enable cadres to work cleanly and boldly and allow various economic actors to innovate and develop with confidence. ，，。，。，，，。、、，。、、。，、，. The next paragraph discusses what Xi means when he says that combating corruption requires adopting a historical perspective. -It means learning lessons from history, grasping the core values from the Party's century-long struggle, and understanding that to remain true to its original mission, the Party must eliminate corruption—the greatest threat. From a strategic perspective, we are in the critical period of China's modernisation construction, with the domestic and international environments undergoing profound and extensive changes, only by unswervingly combating corruption and ensuring the Party health, advanced nature, and purity can we steadily and successfully follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and remain invincible amid the profound changes unseen in a century. For Party members and cadres, when faced with temptations and enticements, they must reflect on the Party's revolutionary ideals, think about the countless revolutionary ancestors who have sacrificed their lives and shed their blood, the weight of the Party and people in their hearts, think about the weight of the party and the people in their hearts, think about the consequences and harm of corruption, and think about the different fates of Marxist parties around the world. Only by rectifying their ideological roots and clearing the muddied waters, they can truly stay steady, maintain their integrity, and always uphold the political character of a Communist Party member.- ：-，、，。-？，，，。，，，，、，，。，、，，、，，，。、，、，. The piece ends by calling on the Party to never slacken or ease up in what is a tough, protracted, and comprehensive battle against corruption. Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, the full guidelines on Deepening the Reform and Development of Elderly Care Services is published in the paper. As per the document, the main goals are: by 2029, the elderly care service network will be basically established, service capabilities and levels will be significantly enhanced, significant progress will be made in expanding capacity, improving quality and increasing efficiency, and the supply of basic elderly care services will be continuously optimized; by 2035, the elderly care service network will be more complete, service supply and demand will be more coordinated and adapted, all elderly people will enjoy basic elderly care services, and an elderly care service system suitable for my country's national conditions will be mature and established. ：2029，，，，；2035，，，，. I am not detailing the full document, but Xinhua reports: -According to the guidelines, basic elderly care services consist of material assistance, nursing, and caregiving services, among others. They are provided directly by the government or by parties supported by the government. The guidelines noted that the system should follow the principles of meeting essential needs and be universally accessible. In the meantime, the system should also allow families with financial difficulties to be supported in elderly care and ensure all institutional resources regarding elderly care are optimized and integrated. The guidelines listed five key aspects where more work should be done. They include forming and implementing a list of elderly care services, establishing an active response mechanism for providing accurate services, enhancing the mechanism that ensures sound elderly care services, improving service capacity, and making such services more accessible.- China Daily's report says: -The government will pay more attention to the nursing and care work of elderly people living in countryside or rural areas, especially those at older elderly, those who lost their self-care ability or with disabilities. Supervision over elderly care service companies or nursing houses will be further tightened, to make sure these companies and nursing house operators have proper fee-charging and caring behaviors. According to the guidelines, the government will encourage foreign companies to invest in the domestic pension industries by giving them some preferential treatment. The government also encourages companies to develop and promote products for the elderly and enrich their services to the elderly, aiming for a prosperous silver economy. The government will cultivate more talent for the elderly care industry by optimizing the nursing workers' evaluation system and setting up pioneer training programs for nursing workers at designated vocational schools, according to the guidelines. Also, the nation will channel resources and investment into technological programs on elderly care services such as humanoid robots and artificial intelligence. The State-level elderly care service information platform will be optimized to better balance the market's supplies and the elderly's needs.- This bit might be useful for businesses: -Actively cultivate specialized service organizations, and encourage communities, domestic service providers, Internet platform enterprises, and others to offer diverse door-to-door services such as meal assistance, bathing assistance, cleaning assistance, mobility assistance, medical assistance, and emergency assistance for the elderly, to better meet the needs of home-based care services. Accelerate the construction of elderly-friendly housing, promote home modifications for aging, support the installation of elevators in old residential communities, and strengthen the construction of barrier-free environments.- ，、、、、、、，。，，，. -Encourage social forces to newly build or renovate and expand elderly care service facilities, support expanding high-quality institutional elderly care service supply through methods such as public construction and private operation. Fully utilize elderly care institutions' roles in technical innovation demonstration, service skills training, equipment promotion and application, promote professional services extending to homes and communities.- ，。、、，. Take the development of rural elderly care services as an important part of implementing the rural revitalization strategy, and include rural elderly care service facilities in the land space planning or village planning at the township level. ，. Guide urban elderly care service institutions to operate rural elderly care service facilities and promote the balanced development of urban and rural elderly care services. ，. Encourage state-owned enterprises and public institutions to revitalize idle assets to carry out elderly care services. For those implementing entrusted operations, the lease term shall be determined based on the principle of stable operational expectations; if the operator makes significant investments, the lease term may be appropriately extended. 、，，；，. Encourage foreign investment in the domestic elderly care service industry and grant it national treatment. Vigorously develop the silver economy, strengthen the research, development, and promotion of products for the elderly, enrich elderly care service scenarios, and unlock the consumption potential of elderly care. Develop the residential tourism elderly care market, adapt to local conditions to develop new formats such as wellness-oriented residential tourism, and promote the construction of residential tourism elderly care destinations. 。，，，。，，. Another point later worth noting, since it can be part of the common prosperity agenda: -Encourage supporting the provision of elderly care services through the establishment of charitable trusts and social donations.- 、. Subscribe now Page 2: There's a report on the State Council's new Guidelines on Promoting the High-quality Development of Government Investment Funds. The report says that the guidelines put forward 25 measures across 7 areas. It calls for the -operation of government investment funds in accordance with the principles of marketisation, rule of law, and specialisation, developing patient capital, and focusing on achieving practical results. Reasonably coordinate the layout of funds to prevent homogeneous competition and the crowding-out effect on social capital. Improve the responsibility mechanism with aligned rights and obligations and compatible incentives and constraints, to promote the formation of a high-quality development pattern for government investment funds with moderate scale, reasonable layout, standardised operation, scientific efficiency, and controllable risks.- 《》，，、，，、、，，。，。、，、、、、. The article then makes seven points: First, identify the correct positioning to better serve the overall development of the country. Focus on major strategies, key areas, and weak links where the market cannot fully play its role, attract and drive more social capital, support the construction of a modern industrial system, and accelerate the cultivation of new productive forces. Leverage the role of funds as long-term and patient capital for cross-cycle and counter-cyclical adjustments. Second, improve the tiered and categorized management mechanism. Specify tiered management requirements for fund establishment, refine differentiated management mechanisms for different types of funds, and standardize budget management for various government investments. Third, strengthen coordination and optimize fund allocation. Achieve synergy between national-level and local-level funds, with provincial governments enhancing the overall management of funds within their regions. Fourth, improve the level of professional and market-oriented fund operations. Standardize fund operation management, optimize fund investment methods, and fully utilize the role of fund managers. Enhance fund performance management, establish and improve an error-tolerance mechanism, and optimize a full-chain and life-cycle assessment system that avoids relying on a single project or a single year's profit and loss as the basis for assessment, and create a good atmosphere that encourages innovation and tolerates failure. Optimize the fund development environment, emphasize positive incentive policies, and boost market investment confidence. Fifth, optimize the exit mechanism to promote a virtuous investment cycle. Broaden fund exit channels, encourage the development of private equity secondary market funds, mergers and acquisitions funds, etc., improve the multi-level capital market system, and explore ways to simplify the project exit process. Sixth, strengthen internal control construction to prevent and resolve risks. Improve the risk prevention and control system and enforce financial discipline. Seventh, strengthen organizational guarantees. Adhere to and strengthen the leadership of the Party, strengthen departmental coordination, and standardize regulatory behavior. ，。、，，，。、。。，，。，。，。。，，。，，、，，、。，，。，。，、，，。，。，。。，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the page is an article about the NDRC issuing a guideline building a unified national market. The report covers the NDRC's press conference on the guideline. Some data from Xinhua English: -Key measures outlined in the guideline include unifying the underlying institutions and rules of the market, improving the high-standard market infrastructure connectivity, building a unified market for factors and resources, advancing the high-standard integration of goods and services markets, enhancing fair and unified regulation, and curbing unfair market competition and improper intervention.- It adds: -Liu Rihong, an official from the Research Office of the State Council, noted that the relatively weak domestic demand, especially in consumption, is a vital bottleneck for economic circulation. Liu emphasized that building a unified national market is essential to unleashing domestic demand potential, facilitating the efficient flow of goods and factors, improving resource allocation, and fully harnessing the market's industrial and demand advantages. The guideline aims to tackle these challenges by drawing firm -red lines- to eliminate local protectionism, regional barriers, and unfair practices in market access, bidding and government procurement, NDRC official Wang Shancheng told a press conference on Tuesday. Local authorities are prohibited from using administrative or penal measures to intervene in economic disputes or infringe on business rights illegally, the guideline said, adding that unlawful cross-jurisdictional law enforcement or administration are also banned. It stated that the cross-regional flow of goods and factors must not be restricted, and bidding and government procurement should avoid limiting or designating specific patents, trademarks, brands, parts, origins or suppliers. The document also calls for establishing a unified national social security public service platform, allowing people to access social security in the locality where they work even if they do not hold local residency. Wang said work is underway to revise and publish a new negative list for market access to further optimize market access management.- The PD report says that Wang also told reporters that the Guidelines put forward specific requirements and goals from three perspectives: required to do, prohibited from doing and encouraged to do. Under required to do, Wang placed the following: Breaking bottlenecks in regional transportation infrastructure, including highways and waterways Unification of data collection standards, formats and fields between different regulatory departments so as to address the problem of inconsistent regulatory standards in various regions Addressing inconsistencies in government service standards Under prohibited from doing, Wang talked about the -red lines- that I have mentioned above. In the context of encouraged actions, Wang said: -Different regions have different resource endowments. Regions with good basic conditions and high marketization can benchmark higher standards to accelerate the construction of unified markets in their regions and across regions… Wang said that the guidelines ‘encourage qualified regions to carry out regional market integration, promoting the strengthening of communication and coordination of systems, rules and major policies in key areas, and increasing the exploration of cost sharing and benefit sharing in regional cooperation'.- -，、。-，《》-，，-. For future work, Wang said: We will revise and issue the Negative List for Market Access (2025 Edition), further reduce the items on the list, and optimise market access management. We will improve the management system for business entity registration and improve the efficiency of enterprise relocation services. We will build a unified urban and rural construction land market, improve the basic system to promote the standardised development of the capital market, accelerate the formation of a unified and interconnected national technology trading network, cultivate a national integrated data market, and accelerate the construction of a unified national power market system. We will further promote the mutual recognition of medical examination and inspection results, returns and exchanges in different places and stores, withdrawals from housing provident funds in different places, and settlements of medical insurance accounts in different places. We will continuously improve the high-standard connectivity of market facilities. This entails improving the comprehensive three-dimensional transportation network. Going forward. new Implementation Measures for the Fair Competition Review Regulations shall be issued to further refine the review standards, consolidate the review responsibilities, and maintain a unified fair competition system. Clean up and abolish various regulations and practices that hinder the national unified market and fair competition. Break down market access barriers that business entities strongly reflect on and that the masses closely follow. Advance special rectification in areas such as bidding and tendering, enterprise relocation. Improve the long-term mechanism for transferring, investigating and rectifying clues to problems that violate the unified large market, and report typical cases in due time. The Ministry of Commerce will focus on improving foreign investment market access, optimising the business environment, connecting with international high-standard economic and trade rules, and accelerating the integration of domestic and foreign trade. ，。。《（2025）》，，。，。，。，，、，，。、、、。，。-、、、、。，，。-。----，。，，。-2024，《》，，7299。-，《》，，，。。、。、。，。、。，--、--、、，-，。- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: A couple of reports to note. First, He Lifeng talked to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Xinhua reports: Both sides agreed -to maintain communication, manage differences and continue stabilization of China-U.S. economic relations during the political transition period in the U.S. The two lead persons for China-U.S. economic and trade affairs reviewed the experience of China-U.S. economic exchanges and cooperation in recent years and spoke highly of the important role of China-U.S. economic and financial working groups and other dialogue mechanisms in implementing the important consensus reached by the two heads of state. The Chinese side expressed concern over U.S. economic and trade restrictions on China -- in particular clarifying China's position concerning the recent trade investigation initiated by the U.S. side. The video call was candid, in-depth and constructive, and both sides agreed on the importance of maintaining communication.- Second, there's a report on Councilor and Director of the China National Narcotic Control Committee Wang Xiaohong speaking to Rahul Gupta, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. Xinhua reports: -Wang said under the strategic guidance of the two heads of state, China-U.S. cooperation on drug control has made positive progress over the past year. Wang added that the two sides should adhere to the correct strategic perception, treat each other as equals, engage in dialogue and cooperation, and promote steady and long-term cooperation in drug control and law enforcement, to better respond to the expectations of the people and demonstrate the responsibility as major countries. Wang also expressed hope that the U.S. side will show more sincerity for cooperation, and respect and address China's concerns. The two sides agreed to continue to maintain cooperation and exchanges in the field of drug control.- Another report, which is not in the paper, carries the Ministry of Commerce's statement on the US adding 11 Chinese companies to its Entity List. Xinhua says: -China's Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday that it firmly objects to the U.S. move to add 11 Chinese firms to its export control -entity list- on so-called military-related grounds. ‘For a long time, the United States has generalized the concept of national security, abused export control measures and suppressed and contained other entities, which has seriously harmed the legitimate rights and interests of relevant entities, undermined the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains, and hindered the recovery and development of the world economy,' the ministry said in a statement. China urges the U.S. side to immediately stop its wrong practices, and the country will take necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese entities-. The 11 companies are: Chengdu RML Technology Co., Ltd., Chengdu Yaguang Electronics Co., Ltd., Chinese Academy of Sciences Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics, and Physics, Hefei Starwave Communication Technology Co., Ltd., Ji Hua Laboratory, Nanjing Simite Optical Instruments Co., Ltd., Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Suzhou Ultranano Precision Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd., Wuhu Kewei Zhaofu Electronics Co., Ltd.,and Yaguang Technology Group Co., Ltd.
