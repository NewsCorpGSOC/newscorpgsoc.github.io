Xi on Ethnic Affairs Policy - PRC's 75th Anniversary - Li Calls to Accelerate Economic Measures - Friends for Peace Group on Ukraine - China's Afghan ...	Hi folks, I hope this finds everyone well. I wanted to begin with a brief announcement. I will be in Washington DC all of next week, starting October 7th. It would be really good to catch up with subscribers. So if you are in town during the week, please do drop me a line as an email response to this edition and we can schedule something. I will also be taking a break from the regular newsletter, given the holidays in China. Of course, as always, I'll try and cover any major developments or pieces that might be published. Cheers, Manoj Before we get to today's edition, let me cover Xi Jinping's remarks at the National Conference on Commending Models for Ethnic Unity and Progress. The entire speech was published in Saturday's edition of the paper. Xi had a lot of praise for the Party's policies: He said that the Party had combined -Marxist ethnic theory with the specific realities of China's ethnic issues and with the best of traditional Chinese culture, creatively blazing a right path with Chinese characteristics to solve ethnic issues. On this path, the CPC has united and led the people of all ethnic groups in the country to achieve national independence and people's liberation, creating a new situation of developing equal, united, mutually supportive, and harmonious relations among all ethnic groups. It has promoted unprecedented progress in the economic and social development in ethnic regions and improved their lives. China's ethnic minorities, regions of ethnic groups, relations between different ethnic groups, and the Chinese nation have undergone profound and historic changes.- 。，、，。，，，，、、、. He added that since the 18th Party Congress, the Party has -continuously promoted the sinicization and modernization of Marxist ethnic theory, and clearly proposed to make the forging of a strong sense of community of the Chinese nation the main line of the Party's ethnic work in the new era and the main line of all work in ethnic regions, formed the Party's important thought on strengthening and improving ethnic work, promoted ethnic regions to join the other parts of the country in securing a victory in the fight against poverty, finished the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and embarked on a new journey to build China into a modern socialist country in all respects…- ，，，、，，、，，。 Practice has proven that the path of solving ethnic issues with Chinese characteristics is completely correct. This path: focuses on the fundamental interests and overall interests of the Chinese nation, unites all ethnic groups to the greatest extent, and realises the common struggle and common prosperity of all ethnic groups; insists on the equality of all ethnic groups, opposes ethnic oppression and discrimination, and ensures that people of all ethnic groups truly obtain equal political rights and jointly become masters of their own country; correctly grasps the relationship between maintaining national unity and implementing ethnic regional autonomy, insists on combining unity with autonomy, and ethnic factors with regional factors, and promotes the Chinese nation to become a more cohesive and unified community with a shared future. ，。，，、；，，、；，、，、。 In the next bit, Xi talks about 5000 years of history and the creation of China as -a unified multi-ethnic country-. He says that the -formation and development of the Chinese nation community is the will of the people, the general trend, and the historical inevitability.- He makes five points to elaborate on this. First, -the intermingling of bloodlines of all ethnic groups has laid the historical foundation for the formation and development of a community for the Chinese nation.- He added: -History has fully proven that the Chinese nation is the result of long-term interaction, exchange, and integration among all ethnic groups. Only by continuously uniting and integrating, and consciously joining the big family of the Chinese nation, can all ethnic groups enjoy a brighter future.- ，。，，、，、，、。，，、，. Second, the shared convictions of all ethnic groups have served as the endogenous driving force for the founding of a unified multi-ethnic country. Since ancient times, the Chinese nation has adhered to the concepts of ‘the six directions share the same customs, the nine regions are interconnected' and ‘there is great harmony under heaven', and regarded great unification as ‘the eternal principle of heaven and earth and the common truth of ancient and modern times'. Since the Qin Dynasty unified China, regardless of which ethnic group ruled the central plains, all have taken the unification of the country as their mission, firmly believing in the common principle that the nation's territory must not be divided, the country must not fall into chaos, ethnic groups must not be scattered, and civilization must not be interrupted. History has fully proven that our unified, multi-ethnic country was jointly created by all ethnic groups and must be jointly safeguarded, consolidated, and developed by them. ，。-，-，-。，，，、、、。，，、. (Note: This is an important paragraph, which allows for building the narrative of continuity with the rule of the Yuan and Qing dynasties or Mongol and Manchu rule.) Third, the cultural connections among all ethnic groups are the cultural genes that have shaped the pluralistic and integrated civilization of the Chinese nation. The cultures of all ethnic groups have learned from and integrated with one another, gradually transcending regional, ancestral, and religious boundaries. This process has converged to form a Chinese culture with strong cohesion and appeal, shaping the unified yet diverse framework of Chinese civilization. History has fully proven that the brilliant Chinese culture was jointly created by all ethnic groups. To forge the new glory of socialist culture, we must continuously enhance identification with Chinese culture and further promote mutual learning and integration among the cultures of all ethnic groups. ，。、，、、，，。，，，. Fourth, the economic interdependence of all ethnic groups is the powerful force for building a unified economy. Our country has a vast territory, and the resource endowments of different regions each have their own characteristics, with strong economic complementarity and a high degree of interdependence. All ethnic groups have consistently maintained economic ties characterised by mutual exchange and mutual benefit, which has significantly strengthened the overall national power and promoted the formation and development of the Chinese national community. History has fully proved that only by continuously integrating into the overall development of the country and strengthening economic exchanges and cooperation can all regions and ethnic groups better promote national economic prosperity and better realise their own economic development. ，。，，、。、，，。，、，、. Fifth, the emotional bonds among all ethnic groups are the strong ties that bind the Chinese nation as one family. Harmonious coexistence, brotherhood, and mutual assistance have always been the mainstream of ethnic relations in our country. The close brotherly ties among various ethnic groups has left many heartwarming historical stories. Especially in the process of resisting foreign aggression, preventing division, and safeguarding unity, the people of all ethnic groups were unprecedentedly united, sharing a common hatred for the enemy, writing a magnificent epic of the Chinese nation's arduous struggles and earth-shaking greatness. History has fully proved that emotional closeness is a strong bond in the formation and development of the Chinese national community. All ethnic groups must cherish, continuously consolidate, and develop the socialist ethnic relations of equality, unity, mutual assistance, and harmony, and constantly strengthen the emotional foundation for building the Chinese national community. ，。、、，。、、，、，、。，，、，. Xi ended this section by stating that the common goal of all ethnic groups is the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Finally, Xi made five points about the tasks ahead in the -new era.- He said that -the central task of the Party and the country is to comprehensively promote the construction of a strong country and national rejuvenation through Chinese-style modernization. This requires the joint efforts of people of all ethnic groups across the country. We must comprehensively implement the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, especially the important thinking on strengthening and improving work on ethnic affairs, adhere to the main line of forging a strong sense of community of the Chinese nation, continuously promote the cause of national unity and progress, and promote the high-quality development of the Party's ethnic work.- ，、，。，，，. First, always adhere to the leadership of the Party and constantly consolidate the common ideological and political foundation for the unity and struggle of all ethnic groups. The CPC is the leading core of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the most reliable backbone of all ethnic groups. We must guide the people of all ethnic groups to continuously enhance their identification with the great motherland, the Chinese nation, Chinese culture, the Communist Party of China, and socialism with Chinese characteristics, firmly establish the concept of a community of sharing weal and woe, honour and disgrace, life and death, and destiny, and work together to realise the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. ，，。，。、、、、，、、、，. Second, we should focus on building a shared spiritual home for the Chinese nation, providing strong spiritual and cultural support for advancing the construction of the Chinese national community. To build a spiritual home shared by the Chinese nation, we must enhance the recognition of Chinese culture. We should take the core socialist values ​​as the guide, deepen the education of patriotism, collectivism, and socialism, and guide the people of all ethnic groups to firmly establish a correct view of the state, history, ethnicity, culture and religions. We should strengthen the historical and cultural education of young people, comprehensively promote the popularisation of the national common language and characters, and comprehensively promote the use of state-approved textbooks, so as to instil the sense of community of the Chinese nation into the hearts of children from an early age. ，，。。，、、，、、、、。，，，. Third, accelerate the high-quality development of ethnic regions and solidly promote the common prosperity of all ethnic groups. To promote Chinese-style modernization and achieve common prosperity, no ethnic group can be left behind. We must support ethnic regions to accelerate their integration into the overall national development and promote closer economic integration and integration among all regions. Ethnic regions must fully and accurately implement the new development concept, continue to deepen reform and opening up, vigorously develop characteristic and advantageous industries, and develop new quality productive forces according to local conditions. We must adhere to the safeguarding and improving people's livelihoods in the process of development, enhance the balance and accessibility of basic public services, do more practical things that conform to the will of the people, benefit the people's livelihood, and warm the hearts of the people, and continuously meet the yearning of people of all ethnic groups for a better life. ，，。、，。，、。，，，。，，、、，. Fourth, promote the all-round integration of all ethnic groups and actively promote exchanges and integration among all ethnic groups. Extensive interactions, exchanges, and integration are important ways to advance the construction of the Chinese national community. We must coordinate economic and social development planning and public resource allocation, strengthen the construction of infrastructure such as transportation in border areas and ethnic minority areas, actively promote people-oriented new urbanization, and promote the mobility and integration of all ethnic groups in an orderly manner. Build an interwoven social structure and community environment, continuously broaden the practical paths for the all-round integration of various ethnic groups, and promote their close unity like the seeds of a pomegranate. ，，。。，，，。，，. Fifth, govern ethnic affairs in accordance with the law, continually improve the capacity and level of governance in ethnic affairs. We must uphold and improve the system of regional ethnic autonomy, gradually refine relevant laws and regulations as well as differentiated regional support policies, and ensure the legal rights and interests of people from all ethnic groups. We should strengthen legal education and public awareness, guiding people of all ethnic groups to enhance their national consciousness, civic consciousness, and legal consciousness. ，，。，，。，、、. Towards the end, Xi stresses this: -Addressing China's ethnic issues is our internal affairs, and no external forces have the right to interfere. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people have found the correct path to solving ethnic issues with Chinese characteristics, and we do not need anyone else to point fingers at us or act as an ‘instructor'. We must resolutely oppose all attempts to infiltrate, sabotage, slander, contain and suppress our country by using ethnicity, religion and other issues. We must strengthen the research and propaganda of the history of the Chinese nation and the theory of the Chinese national community, actively carry out foreign cultural exchanges, and tell the story of the Chinese nation community well.- ，。，、--。、、、。，，。 Share Tracking People's Daily Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, September 30, 2024. Page 1: The entire front page today is dedicated to events marking the 75th anniversary of the founding of the PRC. Xi awarded the highest state honours during the event. Four people, including veteran war hero Huang Zongde and medical scientist Wang Zhenyi, were awarded the Medal of the Republic. Ten individuals, including border patrolman Bayika Kalidibek, technician Xu Zhenchao, and acclaimed actress Tian Hua, were awarded national honorary titles. Dilma Rousseff, former Brazilian president and president of the New Development Bank, received the Friendship Medal. Xi also delivered a speech. Xi said that the -great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered an irreversible historical process-. Xinhua English has a decent summation of the key points: -Xi emphasized the need to bear in mind the ambition of making the country greater. ‘We should be loyal to the country, love the country, integrate personal development goals into the overall national development, and realize personal value in fulfilling duties for the country and serving the people,' he said. He encouraged the Chinese people to hone their skills and contribute to building a strong China. He urged them to strive for extraordinary achievements in ordinary job posts, and contribute to overcoming challenges related to development and reform while safeguarding social harmony and stability. ‘A great era calls for heroes and fosters heroes. A galaxy of heroes emerging generation after generation will ensure the lasting success of the Party and the people's cause,' Xi remarked.- Subscribe now Another report on the page informs of a concert to mark the 75th anniversary of the PRC's founding. Finally, there's a report telling us that a new official compilation of the chronicle of events during the New Democratic Revolution period (1921 to 1949) has been published. Page 3: There's a report on the State Council's executive meeting. The report said that the meeting sought to -study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech on the current economic situation and economic work at the meeting of the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee, and to study and deploy the implementation of a package of incremental policies.- 929，，. -The meeting emphasised that it is necessary to unify thoughts and actions with the scientific judgement of the Party Central Committee on the economic situation, implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee, implement the policies and measures that have been clarified, effectively implement macroeconomic control, promote the coordinated efforts of various policies, focus on addressing prominent issues in economic operation, and strive to achieve the goals and tasks of economic and social development for the entire year.- ，，，，，，，，. For each policy, there must be a clear division of responsibilities, and the pace of implementation should be accelerated. Policies that are relatively mature should be implemented immediately, while those that need further refinement should be worked on urgently, introducing them in batches as they become ready. All departments should not avoid difficulties or shirk responsibilities, but form a strong synergy in their work. At the same time, new incremental policies should be studied promptly in response to changing situations. In-depth investigations and research should be conducted, paying attention to opinions from all sides, to continuously optimise and improve policy measures. It is necessary to strengthen policy interpretation to better build consensus and enhance confidence. ，，，、。、，。，，。，，。，、. The meeting deployed relevant measures to accelerate the implementation of 102 major projects in the 14th FYP. The meeting pointed out that the implementation of 102 major projects during the 14th FYP period is an important deployment made by the Party Central Committee coordinating immediate and long-term needs. It is necessary to focus on the overall implementation of major projects, further consolidate the responsibilities of all parties, strengthen departmental coordination and central-local linkage, strengthen financial support and factor resource guarantees, address difficulties and bottlenecks, and ensure that the construction of major projects achieves the expected results. --102。，--102，。，，，，，. The meeting also discussed the construction of a universal childcare service system, and heard a report on progress in building up China's strength in intellectual property rights. On IPR, the meeting called to -strengthen the support of intellectual property rights for key core technology research, carry out special actions for patent transformation and application, implement the construction project of the intellectual property protection system, and provide strong support for achieving scientific and technological self-reliance and promoting high-quality development.- The draft revisions to the law on science and technology popularization and the law against unfair competition were discussed and approved in principle. Also on the page is a report on the State Council approving a set of revised regulations for commending fallen heroes. As per Xinhua, -the revised regulations stipulate improved criteria and assessment procedures for identifying martyrs, better financial support and preferential treatment for their families, and strengthened protection and management of their memorial facilities. The revised regulations also highlight the need to strengthen the dissemination of martyrs' heroic deeds and improve the protocols when paying homage to them. The revised regulations will take effect on Jan. 1, 2025.- Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on Wang Yi's remarks at the UNGA general debate. The full English text is available on the MFA website. Key points: What China proposes is to uphold peaceful coexistence and put in place a security architecture that ensures enduring stability; uphold openness and inclusiveness and foster a development paradigm that promotes shared prosperity; uphold harmony without uniformity and adopt an approach to civilizations that promotes exchange and mutual learning; and uphold fairness and justice and develop a governance structure that pools strengths for shared benefit. In today's world, the security of all countries is tied together. In face of various kinds of global challenges and risks, no one can stay immune or enjoy security alone. Countries need to be guided by a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. We should respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, take the legitimate security concerns of others seriously, and resolve disputes and differences through dialogue and consultation. We should actively explore a path for major countries to coexist in peace, and work for a new type of international relations characterized by mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation. Achieving modernization is a legitimate right of the people of all countries, not a prerogative of a few. We should be committed to advancing global modernization, and ensure that no one and no country is left behind on the journey toward modernization. We should advocate a universally beneficial and inclusive globalization, unequivocally oppose unilateralism and protectionism, and help developing countries leap over the development divide, to maintain the vitality of global economic growth. President Xi Jinping pointed out that there is no such thing as a superior or inferior civilization, and civilizations are different only in identity and location. We should respect the diversity of civilizations, and strive to replace estrangement and clash of civilizations with exchanges and mutual learning. We should advocate humanity's common values, namely, peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, refrain from conducting values-oriented diplomacy, and oppose ideology-based confrontation. We should respect each other as equals, and help each other succeed with an inclusive mind. As a large number of Global South nations are growing with a strong momentum, gone are the days when one or two major powers call the shots on everything. We should advocate an equal and orderly multipolar world, and see that all countries, regardless of their size, have their own place and role in the multipolar system. We should practice true multilateralism, oppose hegemonism and power politics, and make international relations more democratic. We should follow the principle of extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefit, and make global governance more just and equitable. Share Tracking People's Daily On Ukraine, Wang said: -An end to the Ukraine crisis remains elusive. The top priority is to commit to ‘no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no provocation by any party,' and push for deescalation of the situation as soon as possible. China is committed to playing a constructive role, engaging in shuttle mediation and promoting talks for peace, not throwing oil on the fire or exploiting the situation for selfish gains. At this session of the General Assembly, China, Brazil and other Global South countries have jointly launched the group of Friends for Peace. Its very purpose is to uphold the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, build consensus for a political settlement of the crisis and contribute to a prospect of peace. The meeting of this group was chaired by the Chinese and Brazilians. 17 other ‘Global South' countries attended the meeting. At this meeting, Wang Yi said that: -The ‘Friends of Peace' platform is not about taking sides in the conflict, engaging in bloc confrontation, or replacing existing platforms. They hope to rely on the United Nations to bring together more Global South countries and send more objective, balanced and rational voices, so as to accumulate conditions and create an atmosphere for a ceasefire, an end to hostilities and the resumption of peace talks. The ‘Friends of Peace' platform is open and welcomes the joining of more like-minded countries, in particular, Global South countries.- He added: -China hopes that the parties involved will consider resuming peace talks at an appropriate time, meet each other halfway in their dialogue, and seek common ground while shelving differences in their negotiations, fairly discuss all peace plans, and promote the establishment of a new security architecture.- He also called for -peaceful coexistence- and said that -it is necessary to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries, observe the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, value the legitimate security concerns of all countries, and ensure the legitimate living space of all ethnic groups.- A joint communique was issued by Algeria, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Mexico, South Africa, Türkiye, and Zambia. Subscribe now Back to Wang's comments at the UNGA debate. On Palestine, he said that -might must not take the place of justice.- He called for a -comprehensive ceasefire- and Palestinian statehood and full UN membership. On Afghanistan, he said that -it is important to help Afghanistan exercise prudent governance, fight terrorism effectively, improve people's life and reinvigorate the economy, to open up a better future for the Afghan people.- Interestingly, at the sidelines of the UNGA, there was a meeting between China, Russia, Pakistan and Iran on Afghanistan. Wang Yi made four points at this meeting: First, build security together. Closely track the movements of terrorist organizations entrenched in Afghanistan, strengthen intelligence exchange and sharing, and expand law enforcement and security cooperation. Fully utilize the anti-terrorism security collaboration functions of platforms such as the Foreign Ministers' Meeting of Afghanistan's Neighboring Countries and the SCO to jointly address risks and challenges, and ultimately achieve the goal of eradicating violent extremist groups within Afghanistan. 。，，。、，，. Second, implement comprehensive measures. Jointly implement the ‘Tunxi Initiative' to support Afghanistan's reconstruction, help Afghanistan cultivate self-development capabilities through deepening regional economic and trade investment, interconnectivity, and major project cooperation. Support the SCO in playing a greater role in Afghan issues, support the UN in coordinating the international community to stabilize and assist Afghanistan, help Afghanistan improve its humanitarian predicament, and promote reconstruction and development. 。--，、，。，，，. Third, uphold justice. Make Afghanistan a platform for cooperation among all parties, not a venue for geopolitical games. US actions of cutting off aid, freezing assets, and imposing sanctions on Afghanistan are key factors preventing substantial improvement in Afghanistan's economic and livelihood difficulties. The US should use the seized Afghan overseas assets to support Afghanistan in alleviating livelihood difficulties, developing alternative crops to drugs, and resettling returning refugees. 。，。、、，。，，. Fourth, provide positive guidance. Encourage the international community to focus on the most pressing and urgent difficulties facing Afghanistan, promote Afghanistan's reconstruction and development in a constructive manner, and guide the Afghan governing authorities to improve and strengthen the protection of the rights of women and children in an equal and respectful way. Strengthen the exchange of governance experiences with Afghanistan in a flexible manner, encourage the Islamic world, especially Gulf countries, to exert special influence, and support Afghanistan in exploring a modernization path that aligns with the requirements of the times and the wishes of the people. 。，，。，，. Subscribe now Back to Wang's UNGA speech. He added -the Korean Peninsula should not experience war again. The important thing is to make persistent effort for deescalation, commit to seeking solutions through dialogue and consultation, realize a transition from the armistice to a peace mechanism, and safeguard peace and stability on the Peninsula.- Wang also said this about Asia: -China is deeply aware that Asia needs stability and development and opposes division and conflict. As an important origin of human civilization and a key engine of global growth, Asia has the wisdom and capability to stabilize the situation through regional cooperation and handle differences properly through dialogue and consultation. We are firmly against the meddling by countries outside the region, and will resolutely resist attempts by any force to stoke trouble and confrontation in the region.- After this, Wang pitched GDI, GSI and GCI. He then said: In the face of unilateral, bullying acts such as sanctions and blockade, China firmly supports countries in defending their legitimate rights, upholding the equity and openness of the international system, making global development more coordinated and beneficial for all, and jointly opposing technology blockade and rejecting decoupling or severing supply chains. Sanctions and pressure will not bring monopolistic advantages. Suppressing and containing others will not solve problems at home. The right of people of all countries to pursue a better life should not be taken away. Here, we once again urge the United States to completely lift its blockade, sanctions and terrorism-related designation against Cuba. On environmental issues, he said: -At the global level, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities must be upheld, and the Paris Agreement must be implemented in earnest. Developed countries should assist developing countries in building their capacity to cope with climate change. Touting the need of climate response while suppressing the green industries of others will only hold back global progress in green transition.- On AI governance, he said: -We are working to explore and establish widely-recognized international rules and standards. China supports the U.N.'s role as the main channel for global AI governance and is committed to strengthening international cooperation on AI capacity-building-. On human rights, he said: -China maintains that all countries' right to independently choose their path of human rights development should be respected. No country should impose its own will on others, or arbitrarily interfere in others' internal affairs citing human rights as an excuse.- After this, there's a big chunk on Taiwan: -Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. This is the history and the reality. Both the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation stated in explicit terms that all the territories Japan had stolen from the Chinese, such as Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, shall be restored to China, and this constitutes an important part of the post-war international order. Right here in this august hall 53 years ago, the 26th session of the U.N. General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758 with an overwhelming majority, deciding to restore all the rights of the People's Republic of China at the U.N., to recognize the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate representatives of China to the U.N., and to expel forthwith the representatives of the Taiwan region from the U.N. and all the organizations related to it. Once and for all, the resolution resolved the issue of the representation of the whole of China, including Taiwan, in the U.N. It made clear that there is no such thing as ‘two Chinas,' or ‘one China, one Taiwan.' On this matter of principle, there is no gray zone or room for ambiguity. The complete reunification of China will be achieved. Taiwan will eventually return to the embrace of the motherland. This is the overwhelming trend of history that no one and no force can stop.- Share Tracking People's Daily The final bit in the speech is about how China's modernization benefits the world. Moving on, Wang Yi also met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The Chinese readout says that the -two sides agreed that the meeting was candid and substantive, and that China and the United States need to find a way to live alongside one another in peace in the indefinite future…and agreed to maintain communication on international and regional hotspot issues, and hold a new round of consultations on Asia-Pacific affairs in due course.- Wang said that: -The stabilization of China-U.S. relations serves the interests of the two peoples and meets the expectation of the international community. Whether or not this momentum can be sustained depends on the efforts of both sides. The United States should not always approach China with two faces: On the one hand encircling and suppressing China brazenly, and on the other hand, having dialogue and cooperation with China as if nothing is wrong. Since the United States has expressed multiple times that it has no intention to have conflict with China, then fundamentally, it needs to establish a rational perception of China, and find the right way to get along with it. The United States needs to carry out dialogue with respect, advance cooperation in the spirit of reciprocity, and address differences with great prudence, rather than act willfully as it sees fit from a position of strength or use previous mistakes as excuses to make more mistakes.- -Wang Yi underscored that the intensifying ‘Taiwan independence' activities by Lai Ching-te and others pose the greatest danger to the situation across the Taiwan Strait. ‘Taiwan independence' and cross-Strait peace are irreconcilable. If the United States truly hopes to see peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, it should abide by the one-China principle, implement the three China-U.S. Joint Communiqués, stop arming Taiwan, publicly oppose ‘Taiwan independence', and support the peaceful reunification of China. Wang Yi said that China is firmly opposed to U.S. suppression in trade and technology. National security should not be politicized, and ‘small yard, high fence' should not become ‘big yard, iron curtain'. China will never accept finger-pointing by human rights preachers, still less interference in China's internal affairs under the pretext of human rights. People-to-people exchanges between the two countries are very important, and the United States should remove obstacles with real actions. Wang Yi articulated China's firm position on the South China Sea issue. He stressed that China remains committed to resolving differences through dialogue and consultation with countries directly concerned. The United States should not stir up trouble in the South China Sea, or undermine regional countries' efforts to safeguard peace and stability there. Wang Yi noted that China's position on the Ukraine issue is aboveboard. It has been committed to promoting talks for peace and has been making its efforts toward peaceful settlement. The United States should stop smearing, scapegoating and arbitrarily imposing sanctions on China, and stop using this issue to create antagonism and incite camp-based confrontation.- Share Tracking People's Daily The State Department said that the two had -candid, substantive, and productive discussions-. It adds: -Secretary Blinken underscored the United States' continued concern with PRC support for Russia's defense industrial base and war of aggression against Ukraine and made clear the need for the PRC to address Russia's threat to transatlantic security. He emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and raised concerns about the PRC's dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea. Secretary Blinken reiterated that it remains a top priority to resolve the cases of American citizens who are detained or subject to exit bans in China. He also raised human rights concerns, including with respect to Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong. The Secretary discussed concerns related to technology; U.S. policy remains designed to prevent advanced U.S. technologies from being used to undermine our national security. Both sides agreed to maintain contact, including on regional and global issues. Another important report is the one on Wang Yi's meeting with his South Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yul. Wang told him that: -As long as both sides adhere to the original intent of establishing diplomatic ties, remain committed to a friendly direction and pursue mutual benefit and win-win cooperation, it is believed that the China-South Korea relationship can continue to develop in a healthy and forward-looking manner. As close neighbors and important cooperation partners, China and South Korea should create favorable conditions for their respective development and the development of bilateral relations, Wang said. The deployment of U.S. intermediate-range missiles in the region undermines regional peace and stability and does not serve the interests of regional countries, Wang said, adding that war and chaos must not occur on the Korean Peninsula and maintaining peace and stability on the Peninsula is in the common interest of all parties. China will continue to mediate and promote talks, playing a constructive role in achieving long-term peace and stability on the Peninsula, he said.- For some context, Reuters' report informs: -The U.S. deployed the Typhon system, which can be equipped with cruise missiles capable of striking Chinese targets, this year. China has demanded its removal, and Russia has joined in condemning the first deployment of the system to the Indo-Pacific, accusing Washington of fuelling an arms race.- Subscribe now Page 10: There's a report on the PBOC and the National Financial Regulatory Administration announcing new measures (English report) to stabilize the real estate market. The mortgage rates for first homes, second homes and more are required to be reduced no lower than 30 basis points below the loan prime rate (LPR) by Oct. 31, 2024. In principle, 18 national commercial banks need to release their plans for adjustments before Oct. 12. The minimum down payment ratio for individuals' commercial housing mortgages will be lowered to no less than 15 percent for both first-home and second-home purchases. The central bank will increase funding for financial institutions if they issue loans to support local state-owned enterprises to acquire completed yet unsold commercial housing at reasonable prices for use as affordable housing. A Bloomberg report informs: On Sunday, the trading hub of Guangzhou became the first tier-1 city to remove all restrictions, saying it will stop reviewing homebuyer eligibility and no longer limit the number of homes owned. Both Shanghai and Shenzhen said they will allow more people to purchase residences in suburban areas, as well as allow others to buy more homes. Shanghai, China's financial hub, and Shenzhen, the southern city known for its tech industry, also announced they were lowering minimum downpayment ratios for first and second homes to 15% and 20%, respectively, in a bid to boost demand. The loosening in Shanghai and Shenzhen is slightly less than expected, while Guangzhou went further than anticipated, according to Jefferies Financial Group Inc. analysts including Shujin Chen. ‘We think the policies are unlikely to turn property prices around, but they could ease potential price declines,' Chen wrote in a note on Monday.- Finally, although it is not in the paper, do note this article about the Chinese, Russian coast guards jointly conducing drills and patrols in the high seas of the North Pacific Ocean. The report says: -The operation aimed to maintain order in high-seas fisheries. During the mission, the vessels also conducted joint exercises in search and rescue, damage control and locating illegal vessels, demonstrating the strong collaborative capabilities of the two coast guards.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Stimulating the Economy - Wang Yi's AI, GDI & BRICS Pitches - Wang Meets 'Old Friend of the Chinese People' Muhammad Yunus - China on Hopes for Ties w...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, September 27, 2024. Page 1: The lead story on the page is the readout from the Politburo's meeting on the economy. I covered this in yesterday's edition. Before I get to other reports, let me highlight the following: First, this really helpful graphic from Hutong Research. It lists the efforts at cash infusion. Second, this Reuters report summarises the steps being taken. On the heels of the Politburo huddle, China plans to issue special sovereign bonds worth about 2 trillion yuan ($284.43 billion) this year as part of fresh fiscal stimulus, two sources with knowledge of the matter have told Reuters. On Tuesday by Governor Pan Gongsheng, the People's Bank of China on Friday trimmed the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, known as the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), by 50 basis points, the second reduction this year. The move is expected to release 1 trillion yuan ($142.5 billion) in liquidity into the banking system and was accompanied by a cut in the benchmark interest rate on seven-day reverse repurchase agreements by 20 bps to 1.50%. Reuters reported on Thursday that 1 trillion yuan due to be raised via special bonds will be used to increase subsidies for a consumer goods replacement programme and for the upgrade of large-scale business equipment. They will also be used to provide a monthly allowance of about 800 yuan, or $114, per child to all households with two or more children, excluding the first child. China also aims to raise another 1 trillion yuan via a separate special sovereign debt issuance to help local governments tackle their debt problems. Third, today the PBOC has cut the interest rate of seven-day reverse repos from 1.7 percent to 1.5 percent. Xinhua reports that the interest rate of 14-day reverse repos and those of temporary repos and reverse repos will continue to be determined by the interest rate of seven-day reverse repos in the open market, and the range of adjustment will remain unchanged. The interest rate of 14-day reverse repos and those of temporary repos and reverse repos will continue to be determined by the interest rate of seven-day reverse repos in the open market, and the range of adjustment will remain unchanged. The central bank conducted 278 billion yuan (about 39.66 billion U.S. dollars) of 14-day reverse repos on Friday at an interest rate of 1.65 percent, 20 basis points lower than the previous day. A reverse repo is a process in which the central bank purchases securities from commercial banks through bidding, with an agreement to sell them back in the future. The central bank also announced a cut in the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points for financial institutions on Friday. Share Tracking People's Daily Okay, now back to the paper. The other main story is Xi Jinping's letter to the faculty and students of the Communication University of China on the occasion of its 70th anniversary. Xinhua reports: -Xi urged the university to take solid steps to implement the fundamental task of fostering virtues and educating people on the new journey in the new era. He emphasized the importance of focusing on the needs of the press and public communication, highlighting the university's distinctive features, deepening reform and innovation, and continuously improving its teaching and research capacity, in a bid to cultivate more high-caliber journalism and communication professionals and make new contributions to the development of the Party's cause concerning public communication and culture.- Next, there's a report on Wang Huning's meeting with Tanzila Narbayeva, chairperson of the Senate of Uzbekistan. Xinhua says: Wang said that -under the guidance of the two heads of state, the development of China-Uzbekistan relations has entered a new stage with fruitful cooperation in various fields.

Wang noted that the CPPCC National Committee is willing to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with Uzbekistan to better serve the construction of their respective countries and the development of bilateral relations.- Among other things, Narbayeva said that Uzbekistan adheres to the one-China principle. Next, there's a report on Ding Xuexiang meeting with Nepal's Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel in Beijing. Xinhua reports: Ding -said that China and Nepal -- two nations linked by mountains and rivers -- have enjoyed lasting friendship, setting a fine example of equality and mutual benefits between countries of different sizes.

Let me begin with his speech at the BRICS foreign ministers meeting. Wang called the BRICS the -leading force of the Global South-, which must work towards -promoting an equal and orderly world multipolarization and inclusive economic globalization.- -We must advocate common security and achieve lasting peace. In today's interdependent world, mankind is an indivisible security community. No country has the right to manipulate the global security agenda, let alone build its own security on the insecurity of other countries. We must make good use of mechanisms such as the BRICS Foreign Ministers' Meeting and the Meeting of High Representatives for Security Affairs to strengthen coordination on international and regional hotspot issues and jointly address various challenges. On the Ukraine issue, we must insist on preventing the spillover of conflict, avoiding the escalation of warfare, and preventing any party from fueling the fire. The crisis should be resolved through dialogue and negotiation. Brazil and China jointly issued the ‘Six-Point Consensus', which has received positive responses from more than 100 countries to varying degrees. On the Palestinian issue, China stands firmly with Arab countries. We must promote a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible, support Palestine to become a formal member of the United Nations, implement the ‘two-state solution', and achieve lasting peace in the Middle East.- ，。，。，。、，，。，、、，。--，100。，。、，，--，. We must prioritise development and solve development problems. Development is the eternal theme of human society and an important yardstick of progress in the era. President Xi Jinping proposed the GDI, which has been actively supported by the United Nations and the vast majority of developing countries. The BRICS should give full play to its own advantages, promote the development issue to be placed at the centre of the United Nations' work, pay attention to the practical difficulties of developing countries, urge developed countries to earnestly fulfil their commitments, and inject stronger impetus into the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We should focus on the urgent needs of developing countries in poverty reduction, development financing, energy and food security, seize the opportunities of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, and cultivate new momentum for high-quality development. ，。，。，。，，，，2030。、、，，. We must uphold multilateralism and improve global governance. When multilateralism is under attack, the world falls into chaos. When hegemonic behaviour runs rampant, human civilization regresses to the law of the jungle. We must firmly uphold the international system with the United Nations at its core and adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, opposing the practice of using multilateralism only when it is convenient and abandoning it when it is not. Taking the implementation of the outcomes of the Summit of the Future as an opportunity, we should promote reforms in the international financial architecture, support the full participation of southern countries in international economic decision-making, governance, and rule-making, and enhance their voice and representation. The resolution on Enhancing International Cooperation on Capacity-building of Artificial Intelligence jointly proposed by China and many southern countries has been overwhelmingly approved by the UN General Assembly, and we welcome BRICS countries to participate in its implementation so that developing countries can broadly benefit. ，。，。，。，，-，-。，，、，。--，，. He then talked about supporting Russia in hosting the BRICS summit in October. He also called to ‘create new landmark achievements in the fields of finance, artificial intelligence, energy and minerals to ensure that the BRICS+ cooperation can get off to a good start. We must also accelerate the completion of the work of setting up partner countries. This is the consensus reached by BRICS leaders at last year's Johannesburg Summit, and it is also the mission we should accomplish. Continue to open the door for expansion, to add vitality and momentum to BRICS development.- ，，、。，，、。、、，--、。，，，，、. If you are wondering what are the BRICS' specific processes and criteria for expansion, here is the document agreed upon in 2023. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, Wang's speech at an event called -Global Development Initiative Supports the Global South -- China in Action-. Wang said: -over the past three years since the inception of the GDI, it has evolved from a Chinese proposition to an international consensus, and from a cooperation concept to joint actions, contributing China's solutions and injecting Chinese strength into the implementation of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development…We held a High-level Dialogue on Global Development, a ministerial meeting of the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative, and two Global Shared Development Action Forums, effectively building consensus on international development cooperation and promoting all parties to recommit to and start again on the Sustainable Development Goals.- ，，、，2030，...，--，，，、. Then Wang put forward some data around GDI. Over the past three years, more than 100 countries and more than 20 international organizations have actively supported and participated in the Initiative, and 82 countries have joined the Friends of GDI group. More than 70 countries and international organizations have joined the Global Development Promotion Center Network, more than 50 parties have signed cooperation documents on GDI with China, and the United Nations has established a GDI Promotion Working Group.10020，82--。70，50，.

Moreover, we have organized over 2,000 capacity-building projects for developing countries, training more than 60,000 talents in various fields. From technical cooperation to capacity building, from poverty alleviation and education to the digital economy, from high-yield rice to fungus grass processing, the cooperation under the initiative has deepened and materialized, bringing benefits to the Global South. 、。32，1100，600。2000，6。，，，，--. Share Tracking People's Daily Third, Wang Yi's speech at the High-level Conference on International Cooperation on AI Capacity Building. Wang called for: comprehensive and balanced governance of AI openness without building walls, interconnection without decoupling, equality without discrimination, and working together to create an open, inclusive, inclusive, and non-discriminatory environment for the development of AI, so that the dividends of AI can benefit all countries. He added that AI should not and cannot be reduced to a tool for maintaining hegemony and pursuing superiority. establishing an AI governance mechanism with universal participation from all countries under the UN framework, so that all countries can participate and benefit equally. Using one's own values ​​as the only criterion for judgement will only artificially create differences and obstacles, and will not be conducive to mankind working together to meet new challenges. 。、、、，，，。，。。，、、，、、、，。、。。，，。，、。，，. He then made five areas of China's work: China is willing to cooperate with all countries, especially developing countries, in building AI infrastructure and advancing the global layout of interoperable AI and digital infrastructure. China is willing to carry out AI models development and empowerment cooperation, build an international cooperation platform for AI capacity building, build an open source AI community in a responsible manner, and build a rich, diverse, healthy and benevolent AI development ecosystem in accordance with local conditions. China will organize short-term education and training on AI capacity building for developing countries, AI knowledge and expertise through a combination of online and offline methods. We will organize 10 AI training and seminar programs for developing countries by the end of 2025. China is willing to work with all countries, especially developing countries, to jointly develop AI corpora, promote and improve data infrastructure, promote and protect the diversity of civilizations, and promote fair and inclusive use of global data.

Share Tracking People's Daily Fourth, Wang Yi's meeting with Sergei Lavrov. Wang said that the experience of China-Russia ties shows that -as long as we adhere to permanent good-neighborly friendship, comprehensive strategic cooperation, and mutually beneficial cooperation and win-win results, China-Russia relations will move forward…Both sides should continue to hold high the banner of multilateralism, defend the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and promote the building of a more just and reasonable global governance system with the United Nations at its core. China will fully support Russia in playing its role as the BRICS chair, ensure the complete success of the Kazan Summit, and open up a new situation for BRICS+ cooperation.- They also talked about the upcoming 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. Wang also met with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha. Wang told him that: -China has always advocated the peaceful settlement of disputes and advocated that all hotspot issues should be resolved politically through dialogue, and the same is true for the Ukrainian issue. China does not engage in geopolitical games or pursue its own self-interests, but has always actively promoted peace and negotiations, working to build consensus for peace. China has always paid attention to the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, has provided four batches of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, and is willing to provide new assistance according to Ukraine's needs. We hope that Ukraine will continue to take effective measures to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel and institutions in Ukraine. We are willing to maintain communication with all parties, including Ukraine, and continue to do what China believes is right to strive for peace at an early date.- ，，。，，，。，，。，。，，. While on this, do check out Politico's reporting on a Ukrainian assessment of Wang's agenda at the UNGA. The report says: -China wants to work behind the scenes at the United Nations to enlist international support for an agreement to end the war in Ukraine on terms favorable to Russia, according to a Ukrainian government document. The Chinese government came into this week's U.N. General Assembly with a plan to seek support from countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa that would freeze battle lines in the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II, according to the document obtained by POLITICO. The U.S. is opposed to the deal and Ukrainian officials are alarmed by it — so much so that they have circulated the document among diplomats gathered in New York for the UNGA. In its proposal, China is trying to persuade diplomats to support peace talks focused on -taking into account the security interests of each country- with the objective of -preventing Russia from losing- the war, according to the document. The paper, which was drafted by the Ukrainian government ahead of this week's high-level U.N. meetings, does not say how Kyiv is aware of China's strategy. Ukraine is also pushing on multiple fronts this week to dissuade allies from embracing the China-backed plan. Ukraine's U.N. mission in New York did not respond to a request for comment on the document. Beijing's game plan in New York involves enlisting the support of some two dozen countries -to form some kind of ‘core' group which in the future can quickly expand [to include] other countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia,- the document said. China seeks their endorsement for its plan to initiate peace talks between Russia and Ukraine based around a China-Brazil joint six-point proposal released in May. That document urges -no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no provocation by any party.- That would allow Russia to continue hostilities at their current intensity as well as its occupation of Ukrainian territory. The six-point proposal hinges on -an international peace conference … recognized by both Russia and Ukraine.- Also noteworthy part in the report is this bit: -China's pursuit of India's support could create particular trouble for Ukraine. Kyiv has been hoping that New Delhi may help broker a peace pact it can live with. The Indian embassy in Washington declined to comment.- Meanwhile, another interesting Politico report said this week that: Ukraine has found its favored middleman to help end the war with Russia: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi…A high-ranking Ukrainian official, granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive subject, confirmed that India was Kyiv's big hope to reach a peace pact it can live with. According to the official, Modi was clear in summertime discussions with Kyiv that — while Ukraine would inevitably need to compromise on some things to end Moscow's onslaught — any proposals to end the war should not include giving up territory to Russia. Modi, in Kyiv's eyes, has come a long way in a short time. When he visited Moscow in July and warmly embraced Russian President Vladimir Putin, the response from Kyiv was scathing. Zelenskyy called the hug — on the same day a Russian missile strike killed dozens of Ukrainians — -a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts.- But since then, Ukraine has come to increasingly view India — the world's most populous nation, which has long promoted non-alignment in its foreign relations — as its ideal intermediary in dealings with the Kremlin. While New Delhi has consistently refrained from condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it has spoken in support of respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity, and ending the war. Six weeks after his Moscow trip raised Ukrainian hackles, Modi traveled to Kyiv to meet with Zelenskyy. He vowed to be -a friend- to Kyiv and help bring about a peace deal. India may be the only global power player that can play the role — or at least the only one able to credibly portray itself as a neutral party to both Moscow and Kyiv. Subscribe now Another noteworthy report is about Wang's comments on Security Council reform. This was part of a dialogue between the P5 and C10 countries from Africa. Wang made three points: Effectively increase the representation of Global South countries, allow more developing countries, especially small and medium-sized countries including African countries, to participate in Security Council decision-making, enhance the authority and efficiency of the Security Council, and promote the development of international order towards a more just and reasonable direction. The Security Council cannot become a club for big countries or rich countries, let alone an arena for political confrontation. We must effectively change the imbalance between North and South in the composition of the Security Council and the over-representation of developed countries. We must anchor the reform path of giving priority to special arrangements for Africa. The Security Council structure with insufficient representation of Africa is hardly reasonable, and correcting this injustice requires creativity. Last year, President Xi Jinping took the lead in announcing that China supports making special arrangements for the priority resolution of Africa's demands, which has led to just calls in support for Africa's demands. China is willing to work with Africa and all parties to jointly explore the implementation path of the special arrangements for Africa's priority. We must support the main channel status of the General Assembly's Security Council reform intergovernmental negotiations. The Security Council reform intergovernmental negotiations are the only platform authorized by the General Assembly and widely recognized by member states. We should jointly maintain the intergovernmental negotiation platform where everyone can sit down and talk, and continuously accumulate and expand the consensus of the international community. 。--，，，。，。、。。，。，。，。。、。，.

The readout says: -China has always placed Nepal in an important position in its peripheral diplomacy and is committed to building a closer China-Nepal community with a shared future. Next year will be the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Nepal. The two sides should take this opportunity to promote the joint construction of the BRI and other cooperation to bear more fruit and benefit the people of the two countries… China will, as always, support Nepal in safeguarding its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and hopes that Nepal will find a successful development path that suits its national conditions. He appreciated Nepal's repeated reiteration that it will not allow any forces to use Nepal's territory to engage in anti-China activities. China has granted zero tariff treatment to 100% of items imported from all least-developed countries that have diplomatic relations with China, which will facilitate more Nepali specialty products entering the Chinese market. China welcomes Nepal's announcement in China of 2025 as the ‘Nepal Tourism Year' and is willing to work with Nepal to plan a series of events to promote cultural exchanges.-，、，，。100%，。2025--，，.

China and Bangladesh share a traditional friendship, and the people of both countries have deep amicable feelings for each other. China is willing to work with Bangladesh to promote this traditional friendship, strengthen political mutual trust, deepen cooperation in jointly building BRI, and push forward the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries. China is also willing to expand cooperation in areas such as agriculture, poverty alleviation, and new energy based on Bangladesh's needs, and strengthen exchanges on governance, reform, and opening-up experiences to support Bangladesh's economic and social development. The two sides can strengthen cooperation in international and regional affairs to safeguard the common interests of developing countries. ，，。，，，--，。，、、，，。，.

China has created miracle after miracle in human history, especially achieving unprecedented accomplishments in poverty alleviation, which is deeply admirable.

Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, Wang met with American representatives from the National Committee on United States-China Relations, the US-China Business Council, the US Chamber of Commerce, the Aspen Institute, the Asia Society, and the Council on Foreign Relations. Wang told them that: -This year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States. After nearly half a century of ups and downs, the most important revelation is that the two countries should be partners, not adversaries; they should help each other succeed rather than engage in vicious competition; and they should keep their word and follow through, rather than saying one thing and doing another. President Xi Jinping cares deeply about and attaches great importance to China-US relations. Based on profound reflection on the lessons learned, he has proposed the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation, which are the fundamental guidelines for China's approach to US relations. In contrast to China's stable and consistent policy towards the US, the US often sends mixed signals and presents two different faces in its China policy. The root cause lies in the inability of some in the US to view and accept China's development objectively. The US needs to recognize that China also has the right to develop, and that China's development is an opportunity for both the US and the world, rather than a challenge. 。，45。，，，；，；、，、。，，、、，。，、。。，。、. Wang Yi said that during his visit to New York for the UN General Assembly, he sensed the widespread concern over the international situation, with many hoping for greater unity and coordination among major powers to shoulder their responsibilities. As permanent members of the UN Security Council and the world's two largest economies, China and the US should first strive for stable, healthy, and sustainable development of their bilateral relationship. They should also work with the international community to address the numerous global challenges emerging today. China-US relations are an evolving process that requires continuous dialogue and communication to eliminate unnecessary misunderstandings and misjudgments. Wang Yi expressed hope that people of insight from various sectors in the US would contribute to these efforts, foster an objective and rational understanding of China, enhance mutual understanding and trust, and help improve and develop China-US relations. ，，，，。，，，。，，。，，，.

China is willing to maintain communication with the U.S. at all levels, and push for steady and long-term law enforcement cooperation between the two countries. The U.S. side should attach importance to addressing China's concerns, demonstrate sincerity with concrete actions, and remove obstacles for deepening cooperation, Wang noted. The two sides agreed to stay in communication on important issues in the field of law enforcement.- Page 6: There's a report informing that the NDRC and the Xi Jinping Economic Thought Research Center hosted the 2024 Annual Conference on Deeply Studying and Practising Xi Jinping's Economic Thought.

Politburo Meeting Signals Economic Easing - Wang Yi's Diplomacy in New York - Guidelines to Implement Employment-first Policy - Song Tao Meets KMT's S...	Just as I was about to publish, Xinhua has published a report stating that Xi Jinping has today chaired a meeting of the Politburo to study and assess the current economic situation and deploy the next phase of economic work. Since the beginning of this year, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has united and led the people of all ethnic groups in the country to overcome difficulties and respond calmly, enhance macroeconomic regulation, focus on deepening reform and opening up, expand domestic demand, and optimize the economic structure. Consequently, the overall economic operation has been stable and steady, new quality productive forces have developed steadily, people's livelihood security has been solid, positive progress has been made in preventing and resolving risks in key areas, high-quality development has been solidly promoted, and the overall social situation remains stable. ，，、，，、、，、，，，，，. The meeting pointed out that the fundamentals of China's economy and favorable conditions, such as a vast market, strong economic resilience and great potential have not changed. At the same time, some new situations and problems have emerged in the current economic operation. It is necessary to look at the current economic situation comprehensively, objectively and calmly, face up to difficulties, strengthen confidence, and effectively enhance the sense of responsibility and urgency to do a good job in economic work. We must focus on key points, take the initiative, effectively implement existing policies, intensify efforts to introduce incremental policies, further improve the pertinence and effectiveness of policy measures, and strive to complete the annual economic and social development goals and tasks. ，、、。，。，、，。、，，，、，. The next paragraph has specific policy points. It says: The meeting emphasised the need to increase counter-cyclical adjustment of fiscal and monetary policies, ensure necessary fiscal expenditures, and effectively carry out the ‘three guarantees' work at the grassroots level. It is necessary to issue and use ultra-long-term special treasury bonds and local government special bonds to better leverage the driving role of government investment. It is necessary to lower the reserve requirement ratio and implement substantial interest rate cuts. It is necessary to promote the real estate market to stop falling and stabilize, strictly control the increase in commercial housing construction, optimize the stock, and improve the quality, increase the loan issuance for ‘white list' projects, and support the revitalization of idle land. It is necessary to respond to the concerns of the people, adjust the housing purchase restriction policy, reduce the interest rate of existing mortgage loans, speed up the improvement of land, fiscal and taxation, and financial policies, and promote the construction of a new model of real estate development. It is necessary to strive to boost the capital market, vigorously guide medium- and long-term funds to enter the market, and clear the bottlenecks hindering social security, insurance, and wealth management funds from entering the market. It is necessary to support the merger and reorganization of listed companies, steadily advance the reform of public funds, and study and introduce policies and measures to protect small and medium-sized investors. ，，，--。，。，。，、、，--，。，，，、、，。，，、、。，，。 Note: This tells us clearly that we should expect more stimulus measures. The PBOC recently cut the rate of the medium-term lending facility to 2% from 2.3%. Bloomberg had earlier reported that the cut to the MLF rate is a prelude to more significant measures. Pan had also said that the central bank would cut the amount of cash banks have to hold in reserve - known as reserve requirement ratios (RRR). The RRR will initially be cut by half a percentage point, in a move expected to free up about 1 trillion yuan ($142bn; £106bn). BBC reported that further measures aimed to boost China's crisis-hit property market include cutting interest rates for existing mortgages and lowering minimum down payments on all types of homes to 15%. Anyway, the next paragraph of the Xinhua report says: The meeting pointed out that it is necessary to help enterprises overcome difficulties and further standardise the law enforcement and supervision behaviours related to enterprises. It is necessary to introduce a law to promote the private economy and create a good environment for the development of the non-public economy. It is necessary to combine promoting consumption with benefiting people's livelihood, promote income increases for middle and low-income groups, and upgrade consumption structure. It is necessary to cultivate new consumption formats. It is necessary to support and standardise the development of the elderly care and childcare industries by social forces, and speed up the improvement of the policy system for fertility support. It is necessary to increase efforts to attract and stabilise investment, promptly advance and implement reform measures such as foreign investment access in the manufacturing sector, further optimise building a first-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based, and internationalised. ，，、。，。，，。。、，。，，、、. The meeting also called to implement the employment-first policy, -strengthen assistance to low-income individuals-, ensure the supply and price stability of important materials such as food, water, electricity, gas, and heating, and support grain production and farmers. The final paragraph calls for complete policy implementation by all regions, departments and cadres, and says that economically developed provinces should take the lead and better play a leading and supporting role.

First, he addressed the UNGA. He mentioned GDI, GSI and GCI and then said: In this changing and turbulent world, new risks and challenges keep cropping up. No country can stay unaffected. Greater solidarity and cooperation of the international community is not a choice, but a must. Countries should uphold the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and settle disputes through dialogue, resolve differences through consultation and enhance security through cooperation. Major countries, in particular, should lead by example. They should break geopolitical circles by pursuing the greater good, rise above bloc confrontation with a broad vision for mutual prosperity, and serve as propellers for world solidarity and anchors for international peace. Countries need to share development opportunities and pursue win-win cooperation. We need to follow a people-centered development philosophy and advocate a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, so as to deliver the fruits of development to our people and ensure common prosperity for all countries. A winner-takes-all approach is a sure way to lose the whole game, and the ‘small yard with high fences' would only imprison the builder and tear the world apart. We need to build an equal and orderly multipolar world, and defend the U.N.-centered international system, the international order based on international law, and the basic norms of international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter. We need to strengthen the authority of international rule of law, reject the law of the jungle where the strong bully the weak, oppose acts of hegemonism such as unilateral sanctions, protect the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries, promote greater democracy in international relations, and uphold international fairness and justice. We need to keep abreast with the times, push back the frontier and explore new practices, and make global governance more just and equitable. China supports the U.N. in serving as the main channel in AI governance, and will propose the AI Capacity-Building Action Plan for Good and for All. In particular, we need to encourage the young people to bring out their creativity and contribute their share to the advancement of humankind. Subscribe now Next, Wang met with several other foreign ministers. I cannot cover all the meetings. So, I am going to pick on the one's I am interested in. First, the readout (English report) on Wang's meeting with the EU's Josep Borrell says: -Strengthening cooperation between China and the EU benefits both sides and aligns with their fundamental and long-term interests, and meets the expectations of the international community, said Wang. In a world marked by turmoil and interwoven challenges, China and the EU should enhance mutual trust and close cooperation, respect and learn from each other, and contribute to the stability of the international and regional situation and the development and progress of mankind, said Wang. It is hoped that the EU will adhere to its strategic autonomy, eliminate external interference and promote the sound and steady development of China-EU relations, said Wang. Borrell, for his part, said that China's rise is an unstoppable historical trend. China is already a strong country and will continue to grow stronger. The world needs China and Europe should strengthen cooperation with China. The world is not peaceful as challenges are growing and conflicts keep cropping up, and countries need to work together to maintain peace and security, said Borrell.- On Ukraine, Wang said that -China has always adhered to an objective and fair stance on the Ukrainian crisis, and is committed to cooling the situation and never giving up its efforts for peace. If anyone continues to accuse China, they are doing so with ulterior motives, trying to shift responsibility onto China with hidden agendas.- Share Tracking People's Daily Second, the readout from Wang's meeting with Australian FM Penny Wong says: -Wang Yi said that China-Australia relations have made positive progress. Premier Li Qiang's successful visit to Australia in June injected new impetus into the development of China-Australia relations. The two sides have resumed a series of dialogue and cooperation mechanisms, China has implemented unilateral visa exemption for Australia, local and cultural exchanges between the two countries have become more active, and Adelaide Zoo will welcome a new pair of giant pandas this year. The improvement of China-Australia relations has been welcomed and supported by all sectors within the two countries. This is the result of the two sides moving towards each other and working together, and it also shows that the healthy and stable development of China-Australia relations is the common expectation of the two peoples. The two sides should continue to build a more mature, stable and fruitful comprehensive strategic partnership. At the same time, the two sides should grasp the problems existing in bilateral exchanges, not define China-Australia relations by differences, not replace the mainstream of mutually beneficial cooperation with negative information, and not let negative thinking interfere with the improvement and development of bilateral relations. It is hoped that Australia will work with China to ensure that China-Australia relations continue to move along the right track and achieve more results.- ，。6，。，，，。，、，。、。，，，，。，.

She also reiterated Australia's one-China policy. ，、，，，，，，。。，、。，，，，. The Australian side shared her opening remarks during the meeting. Do note this framing: -China's size and weight, as a great power and permanent member of the UN Security Council, make your country central to global challenges, from climate to health. And it is in all of our interests for China to play a constructive role in the international system that is inclusive and representative.- Also note this from Penny Wong's press briefing in New York.

And that's what we work with partners to achieve. Share Tracking People's Daily Third, the report on Wang's meeting with German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock says: -Politicizing economic and trade issues and abusing tariff measures would serve no one's interests, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his German counterpart…calling on Berlin and the European Union (EU) to instead resort to dialogue and consultations to resolve trade disputes with China. Judging from the nearly half-century history since China and the EU established diplomatic relations, enhancing bilateral cooperation is in both side's interests and conducive to world stability, Wang said, stressing that the foundation for China-EU relations is mutually beneficial cooperation, and that the highly complementary nature of the two economies means economic cooperation between China and the EU can result in outcomes that exceed a simple adding-up of their respective economic output. Whereas, politicizing economic and trade issues between China and the EU while slashing tariffs on Chinese imports would serve no one's interests, nor would such actions work to the benefit of the green transition of the world economy, Wang remarked, expressing the hope that Germany and the EU will stick to open cooperation, continue to hold dialogue and consultations with China, properly handle related issues, and jointly uphold international trade rules and a fair environment for competition. On China-Germany relations, Wang noted the strategic plan drawn up by leaders of the two countries, coupled with frequent high-level interactions since the start of the year. He said China-Germany economic and trade cooperation has maintained at a high level, which is an indication of the mutually beneficial and strategic nature of bilateral ties. Many German companies have seized the opportunities presented by China pursuing modernization, deepening all-round reforms and promoting high-quality opening up, Wang said. German companies actively cultivating the Chinese market has led to Germany's investment in China reaching a new record high in the first half of the year, he added.

The current situation is a manifestation of the spillover effect of the conflicts in Gaza, and China calls for realizing a ‘permanent ceasefire and comprehensive withdrawal of troops' and ensuring an effective implementation of ‘the two-state solution,' he said. Wang voiced hope that the Lebanese side will take effective measures to protect the safety of Chinese citizens in Lebanon.- Wang also said that -China firmly supports Lebanon in safeguarding its sovereignty, security and national dignity.

It is hoped that Japan will work with China to grasp the correct direction of bilateral relations, implement the consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, and promote the healthy and stable development of Sino-Japanese relations. Kamikawa said that Japan values its relationship with China. In the face of rising risks and challenges in the international situation, Japan and China should maintain communication and dialogue at all levels and in all fields, including negotiating solutions to the nuclear wastewater issue, and jointly safeguarding regional peace and development.

Xinhua reports that Wang put forward three points: Firstly, it is necessary to enhance the sense of crisis in cooling down the situation. Weapons of mass destruction should not be used, nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes such as nuclear power plants should not be attacked, and civilians and civilian facilities should not be targeted, the envoy said. Secondly, it is necessary to enhance the sense of responsibility in promoting peace talks. Dialogue and negotiation is the only viable way out of the Ukrainian crisis, he noted, urging the international community to seize the current opportunity to form joint efforts to promote peace talks. Thirdly, it is necessary to enhance the sense of urgency in managing spillovers. China calls on the international community to strengthen cooperation on energy, finance, trade, food security and the protection of key infrastructure such as oil and gas pipelines, so as to jointly maintain the stability and smooth flow of global industrial and supply chains, Wang said. China is not a creator of the Ukraine crisis, nor is it a party concerned, the top Chinese diplomat noted. China has always sided with peace, and maintained contact with all parties, including Russia and Ukraine, he added. Warning that any attempt to blame, attack or smear China on the Ukraine issue is irresponsible and will not succeed, Wang called on the international community to join hands to uphold a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security.- Subscribe now Tenth, during a meeting with United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk and multiple countries' foreign ministers on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, Wang lashed out at the US and defended China's human rights record. -The United States and a few other countries used the Xinjiang issue to attack and smear China's human rights situation. Nearly 80 countries, including the majority of Muslim countries, read out a joint statement on the spot in support of China, and more than 20 countries expressed their support for China's just position in different ways, clearly opposing the politicization of human rights issues and interfering in other countries' internal affairs under the pretext of human rights. The clear voices of more than 100 countries fully demonstrate that the political manipulation of a few countries such as the United States has become increasingly unpopular.- -Wang pointed out that such action of the United States and its followers once again exposed their double standards on human rights issues to the world. People cannot help but ask: if the United States is so concerned about the human rights of Muslims, why does it continuously provoke or support wars in regions like the Middle East, causing numerous innocent Muslim casualties? Why does it turn a blind eye to the historical injustices faced by the Arab people and not support Palestine in becoming a full member of the United Nations? Why does it fail to play its due role in achieving a permanent ceasefire and full military withdrawal from Gaza? Wang Yi said that the majority of Muslim countries have long seen through the tricks of the United States and know that the United States is just using human rights as a cover to interfere in the internal affairs of China and developing countries. More than 100 developing countries, including Muslim countries, clearly supported China at the Human Rights Council, not only to safeguard China's legitimate rights, but also to safeguard international fairness and justice, safeguard the common interests of developing countries, and safeguard the basic principle of non-interference in internal affairs of international relations.- 、，924，，。80，20，，，。100，。，。，，，？，？、？，，，。100，，，，。 Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, meeting Slovenian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and European Affairs Tanja Fajon, Wang said that China supports Slovenia assuming the rotating chair of the United Nations Security Council this month, is willing to work with the Slovenian side to implement true multilateralism, uphold the authority of the United Nations and the Security Council, and promote international peace and security.

Zhang said that the Third Plenum resolution made -systematic arrangements- and clarified the -position, pace, and key focus areas- for state capital and assets for reform on the new journey. 《》，，、. He the made five points: First, we will continue to promote the strengthening, optimization and expansion of state-owned capital and state-owned enterprises. This is the guiding goal of further deepening the reform of state-owned assets and enterprises. We will adhere to the ‘two unwaverings', rely on reform to break the institutional and mechanism obstacles that restrict the high-quality development of enterprises, and unswervingly expand and strengthen and optimize them with determination, thereby continuously consolidating the important material and political foundation of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Second, we will enhance core functions and improve core competitiveness. This is the fundamental requirement for deepening the reform of state-owned assets and state-owned enterprises. We will keep in mind the ‘matters of national interest' and improve strategic support capabilities, people's livelihood security capabilities, and value creation capabilities through reform. While shouldering economic responsibilities, we will better shoulder political and social responsibilities. Third, we will accelerate the formation of production relations that are compatible with new quality productive forces. This is the clear direction of deepening SOE reform on the new journey. We will firmly grasp the general trend of the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, adapt to the new expectations of the people and new changes in market demand, accelerate the transformation of organizational forms, operating mechanisms, and management systems of enterprises, promote the aggregation of various advanced production factors for the development of new quality productive forces, continuously improve total factor productivity, and create new momentum and new advantages. Fourth, we will fully and accurately implement the reform measures of state-owned assets and enterprises laid out by the plenary session. This includes improving the management and supervision system and mechanism, promoting the optimization of the layout and structural adjustment of the state-owned economy, improving the institutional arrangements for promoting original innovation in state-owned enterprises, and improving the modern enterprise system with Chinese characteristics. We will not only ensure comprehensive implementation but also focus on key breakthroughs to continuously enhance the comprehensive effectiveness of the reforms. Fifth, we will adhere to and strengthen the Party's overall leadership over the reform of state-owned assets and state-owned enterprises. We will continue to deepen the implementation of the spirit of the National Conference on Party Building in State-owned Enterprises, integrate the Party's leadership throughout all aspects of the reform process, promote the deep integration of Party building and enterprise production and operation, give full play to the role of Party committees (Party groups) in guiding the direction, managing the overall situation, and ensuring implementation, give play to the role of grassroots Party organizations as vanguards and the role of Party members as pioneers and models, and ensure that the reform of state-owned assets and state-owned enterprises always moves forward in the right direction and achieves the expected results. 。。--，，、，。。。--，、、，，、。。。，，、、，，，。。，，，，，，。。，，，（）、、，，、。 In the next response, Zhang explains what will be done when one talks about the -optimization of the layout and structural adjustment of the state-owned economy-. He said that the SASAC -will, in general, focus on developing and strengthening the real economy, promoting the strategic restructuring, professional integration, and forward-looking deployment of the state-owned economy through market-oriented approaches. This will strongly promote the ‘three concentrations', i.e., concentration on important industries and key areas related to national security and the lifelines of the national economy; concentration on public services, emergency response capabilities, and public welfare areas related to national economy and people's livelihood; and concentration on forward-looking strategic emerging industries.- ，，、，--，、，、、，. He added: -Specifically, SASAC will adhere to a two-pronged approach with dual drivers. On one hand, we will focus on strengthening the foundation and transformation of traditional industries, coordinating equipment updates, process upgrades, digital empowerment, and management innovation. Traditional industries will be transformed and upgraded using digital intelligent and green technologies, promoting high-end, intelligent, and green development. On the other hand, we will focus on the strategic layout of emerging industries, implementing in-depth industrial renewal actions for central enterprises and future industry launch actions. It will improve the cultivation mechanism for emerging industries and increase investment in fields such as new-generation information technology, artificial intelligence, aerospace, new energy, new materials, high-end equipment, biomedicine, and quantum technology, thereby continuously fostering new industries, new models, and new growth drivers.- ，、：，、、、，、，、、。，，，、、、、、、、，、、. He then explained the tasks for -improving the institutional arrangements for original innovation of state-owned enterprises-. Zhang made five points: First, strengthen the supply of high-quality science and technology. The SASAC will guide central enterprises to actively integrate into the national innovation system, take the initiative to lead or participate in national scientific and technological research tasks, establish an enterprise R&amp;D reserve system, strengthen goal-oriented basic research and applied basic research, and make every effort to tackle key problems in areas with high strategic value, broad application prospects, and own advantages, and strive to master more key core technologies and source underlying technologies. Second, build high-level R&amp;D platforms. Deeply participate in the construction of national laboratories, build a number of national key laboratories, national technology innovation centers and other national R&amp;D platforms, jointly build regional innovation centers, create high-level innovation consortia, deepen scientific and technological cooperation with various upstream, midstream and downstream enterprises, actively carry out international scientific and technological exchanges, and ensure more scientific and technological achievements. Third, promote high-efficiency industrial integration. Strengthen the deep integration of industry, academia and research led by enterprises, actively open up markets and application scenarios, accelerate the construction of platforms for concept validation and pilot testing, promote the application of the first piece or set of equipment, the first batch of outputs, and the first edition/version of products, so that more scientific and technological achievements can be transformed from samples into products and extended from products to industries. Fourth, continue to create an innovation ecosystem. Improve the investor policy to support original innovation, improve the mechanism for adding back R&amp;D investment, promote the reform of empowering official scientific and technological achievements, take innovation and creation as the orientation, flexibly carry out various forms of medium- and long-term incentives, and further improve the compliance exemption mechanism based on the high uncertainty of scientific research work, so that scientific and technological personnel can let go and do their work and focus on scientific research. 。，，，，、、，。。，、，，，，，。。，，、，（）、、，、。。，，，，，，，、. The final bit is about the requirement of improving the management and supervision. Zhang talks about balancing control with allowing for vitality. He talks about improving assessment indicators too.

China's development will enhance the force for peace in the world and augment the strength of developing countries, and will hence bring new opportunities for developing countries like the Maldives, Wang said. China-Maldives relations have become an example of countries large and small treating each other equally, helping and supporting each other, and striving for mutual benefits and win-win results, Wang said, adding that it is the wish of China to carry forward its traditional friendship with the Maldives and march alongside the Maldives at the forefront of the endeavor to build a community with a shared future for mankind. China will always support the Maldives' effort to protect its sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and national dignity, and support the Maldives' search for a development path that suits the country's reality, Wang said.

Subscribe now First, the Quad meeting in Delaware came up in the daily MoFA press briefing yesterday. Here are the responses to the relevant questions. -Bloomberg: At the Quad summit in the US over the weekend, US President Biden made some remarks on China. He said that China continues to act aggressively and is testing the US and its allies in the Indo-Pacific region. What's the Foreign Ministry's comment? Lin Jian: Quad is identified as the premier regional grouping that plays a leading role in the US's Indo-Pacific strategy. It is a tool the US uses to contain China and perpetuate US hegemony. The Indo-Pacific strategy attempts to patch up forces to exclude and contain China by peddling the ‘China threat' narrative, and Quad tries to muster military and security cooperation under the pretext of maritime issues—same intention, same tactics. Though the US claims that it does not target China, the first topic of the summit is about China and China was made an issue throughout the event. The US is lying through its teeth and even the US media does not believe it. China believes that cooperation between countries should not target any third party or even harm their interests. Any regional initiative should follow the overwhelming trend of the region and promote regional peace, stability, and prosperity. Ganging up to form exclusive groupings undermines the mutual trust and cooperation between regional countries, runs counter to the overwhelming trend of pursuing peace, development, cooperation, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific and is bound to fail. The US needs to get rid of its obsession with perpetuating its supremacy and containing China, stop using regional countries as its tool, stop glossing over the strategic intention behind all kinds of exclusive groupings, and act on its word that the revitalization of its alliances is not targeted at China, instead of seeking selfish gains at the expense of other countries' strategic security interests and the wellbeing of the people in the Asia-Pacific. AFP: Quad leaders said in the joint statement that they are seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas, which apparently refers to China. Has China protested to relevant countries? Lin Jian: The situation in the East and South China Seas is generally stable. Some country outside the region keeps cobbling together small groupings and tries every means to meddle in maritime issues at China's doorstep in order to incite bloc confrontation, escalate the situation, and undermine regional peace and stability. Let me stress that no interference from any force will weaken China's determination in defending its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in accordance with law and keeping the region peaceful and stable. We will lodge serious protests over any act that undermines China's sovereignty and security interests. PTI: Further to what you spoke about the Quad summit in the US. The summit also for the first time approved a joint coast guard cooperation at sea. And also they have rather agreed to strengthen cooperation in the Indian Ocean region and recognized India's leadership in finalizing the IORA Outlook on the Indo-Pacific and expressed support for that. Do you have any comment on this? Lin Jian: Cooperation between countries should be conducive to peace, stability, and prosperity in the region, rather than focusing on forming exclusive groupings that undermine trust and cooperation among regional countries. China is open to normal cooperation between relevant countries at sea, but the cooperation should not target other countries or undermine regional peace and stability under any pretext. PTI: You said that China will protest to anyone in violation to security interests. So can we presume that you have lodged a protest to all the Quad countries regarding the comments on the South China Sea and the East China Sea? Lin Jian: As I said just now, China will protest over any move that harms China's sovereignty and security interests. Second, the Chinese and Nepali armies are carrying out joint training in Chongqing. Xinhua reports: -Under the theme of ‘joint counter-terrorism operations in urban blocks', the joint training will include small arms shooting in special operations, counter-terrorism squad tactics, drone operations, emergency rescue, and comprehensive counter-terrorism exercises. The training will last until Oct. 1. In addition to joint exercise sessions, the two militaries will engage in research and exchange on disaster reduction and relief in earthquakes, avalanches and landslides.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

It is an objective requirement to actively respond to population ageing and promote high-quality population development. It is a practical need to fully unleash the talent dividend and support Chinese-style modernization. It is also a significant measure to improve the social security system and better protect and improve people's livelihoods. All regions and departments must raise their political awareness, align their thoughts and actions with the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee, and work solidly to implement the reform, ensuring the achievement of the expected outcomes.- ，，，、，、，、。，，，. Li added: It is necessary to adhere to the principle of ‘voluntary participation and flexibility' to implement the delayed retirement policy and ensure that the wishes of employees are truly reflected. It is necessary to accelerate the formulation and improvement of supporting policy measures. Policies that need to be directly linked to the reform plan should be introduced and implemented as early as possible. Policies that need to be adjusted due to changes in the statutory retirement age should be formulated and implemented as soon as possible after thorough evaluation. It is necessary to further increase policy support and work efforts to effectively address the real concerns of the people.

The draft also relaxes the vehicle weight limit for lead-acid battery models from 55 kilograms to 63 kilograms Subscribe now Page 14: There's a Zhong Sheng commentary on the recent announcement by USTR following a statutory four-year review process on tariffs on Chinese imports. The USTR report said that: -The Trade Representative is proposing modifying the actions by adding or increasing section 301 tariffs for certain products in strategic sectors. Many of the sectors are targeted by China for dominance or are sectors where the U.S. has recently made significant investments. These include: Battery parts (non-lithium-ion batteries) Electric vehicles Facemasks Lithium-ion electrical vehicle batteries Lithium-ion non-electrical vehicle batteries Medical gloves Natural graphite Other critical minerals Permanent magnets Semiconductors Ship to shore cranes Solar cells (whether or not assembled into modules) Steel and aluminum products Syringes and needles- The Zhong Sheng commentary argues that -the United States has politicized, instrumentalized, and weaponized economic and trade issues, and has insisted on imposing tariffs, which is protectionism that goes against the trend of the times. The United States should immediately correct its wrong practices and cancel all tariffs imposed on China.- It argues that section 301 tariffs are unpopular within the US. -The Office of the United States Trade Representative previously solicited public opinions on the results of the tariff review, and the majority of opinions opposed the imposition of tariffs or requested the expansion of tariff exemptions…Faced with many opinions opposing the imposition of tariffs, the Office of the United States Trade Representative postponed the announcement of new tariff measures on China twice, saying that it would continue to ‘review public opinions'. But facts have proved that the US government did not respect the opinions of the people, and insisted on raising the 301 tariffs on China out of domestic political compulsions. The US approach cannot achieve its declared goals; rather it will only backfire and weaken the competitiveness of American industries.- ，。，...，，--。，，，301。，，. The author adds: American tariff increases distort market rules and seriously damage the interests of the American people. The long list of tariff increases meets the needs of some US politicians to show strength to China, but it pushes up the prices of imported goods, with consumers bearing the cost of tariff increases. As per Moody's estimates, US consumers bear 92% of the cost of tariff increases on China, and American families spend an additional $1,300 each year. Outdated protectionist policies are also not conducive to protecting the interests of American workers. According to statistics from the US-based Tax Foundation, the tariff increase on China has not only failed to solve the employment problem of American workers, but has led to the loss of 142,000 jobs in the United States. US medical equipment importers and others believe that the imposition of tariffs on medical products, such as syringes, will affect doctors' access to high-quality tools and have a serious impact on American newborns and other vulnerable groups. ，。，，。，92%，1300。。，，14.2。，，.

State Council Discusses Venture Capital Sector & Regulations on Export Control of Dual-Use Items - What Guides China's New Era of Reform? - China-EU T...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, September 19, 2024. Page 1: Let's begin with the report on the State Council executive meeting. The meeting studied measures to boost the development of the venture capital industry. In addition, it heard a report on this year's grain production situation and agricultural work; reviewed and approved the ‘Regulations on Commendation of Martyrs (Draft Amendment)'; and reviewed and approved the ‘Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Export Control of Dual-Use Items (Draft)'. The meeting said venture capital is related to technological innovation, industrial upgrading and high-quality development. It is necessary to: accelerate the clearing of blockages and bottlenecks in the various stages of ‘fundraising, investment, management, and exit.' Support eligible tech companies to go public domestically and internationally, vigorously develop the equity transfer and mergers &amp; acquisitions markets, promote the pilot program of distributing physical stocks, and encourage private capital to set up market-oriented mergers &amp; acquisitions funds or venture capital secondary market funds to foster a virtuous cycle in the venture capital industry. encourage state-owned capital investment to become more responsible long-term capital and patient capital, and improve policies related to state-owned capital contributions, performance assessments, fault tolerance, and exits. consolidate the institutional foundation for the healthy development of venture capital, implement key measures for capital market reform, improve the functions of the capital market, and further stimulate the vitality of the venture capital market. ，、。--，，、，，，。、，、、、。，，，. On agriculture, the meeting called to study and formulate the policy plan for grain purchasing and storage as soon as possible, announce the minimum purchase price of wheat in the new year as soon as possible, improve the reward and compensation policy for soybean processing, and protect farmers' enthusiasm for growing grain. It is necessary to increase support for cattle and sheep breeding and implement a number of relief policies to help farmers tide over the difficulties. ，，，。，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Next on the page is a long, long Ren Lixuan article. The crux of the article is a call to action for everyone to implement the reform agenda outlined at the Third Plenary Session, and implementing action requires ideological alignment with Xi. The author contends that: -Only by learning well can we implement and execute effectively. Firm action stems from strong political consciousness and ideological consciousness. Only by being clear-headed and resolute in thought can we be strong and effective in action. To ensure the implementation of reforms and be steadfast practitioners and doers in building Chinese-style modernization, we must adhere to Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, especially General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of new ideas, new viewpoints, and new propositions on comprehensively deepening reform, and learn and understand the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee.- 、。、。，。，、，、、，. Later the author adds: -Thought is the banner of action and hard work. To further comprehensively deepen reform and promote Chinese-style modernization, we are treading a path never before taken by our predecessors. This journey must be guided by the correct guiding ideology. Only by adhering to the correct guiding ideology can we avoid taking the old path of being closed and rigid or the evil path of changing flags and banners, but unswervingly follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and continuously promote the self-improvement and development of the socialist system. The ‘Decision' has put forward the ‘guiding ideology for further comprehensively deepening reform', which plays a vital role in further comprehensively deepening reform. Especially at this moment, as reform progresses, the complexity of the situation and environment we face is unprecedented, and the arduousness of the tasks of reform, development, and stability that we bear is unprecedented. The direction of the reform ship must be precise, and its navigation must be steady. The guiding ideology for further deepening reform provides a ‘compass' for the steady and far-reaching progress of reform. We must move forward in the direction guided by the guiding ideology of further comprehensively deepening reform, and we must not deviate or waver at any time. Within the guiding ideology, General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of new ideas, new viewpoints, and new propositions about comprehensively deepening reform are the most important content. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee, General Secretary Xi Jinping has personally led, deployed and promoted the work of comprehensively deepening reform, scientifically summarised historical experience, deeply grasped the laws of reform, and creatively put forward a series of new ideas, new viewpoints and new propositions using Marxist standpoints, viewpoints and methods, clearly answering major questions such as why we should comprehensively deepen reform in the new era and how to promote comprehensively deepening reform, providing a fundamental guideline for further comprehensively deepening reform. General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of new ideas, new viewpoints and new propositions on comprehensively deepening reform not only have in common traits of Marxist theory, such as being political, people-oriented and practical, but also possess a strong sense of historical initiative, firm commitment to upholding principles while innovating, clear problem orientation, systematic strategic layout, profound humanistic concern, and a deep global vision. Party members and cadres should deeply study and understand General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of new ideas, new viewpoints and new propositions on comprehensively deepening reform, grasp their rich connotations, theoretical characteristics and practical requirements, and further unify their thoughts and actions. 。、，，。，，，，。《》--，。，，，、，--。，、。，、、。，、、，，，，、、，、，。、、，、、，、、、、、。、、，、，. And much later, the author also adds: Party members and cadres must deeply understand the decisive significance of the Two Establishments, resolutely implement the Two Safeguards', persist in using Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era to unite hearts and forge souls, and thoroughly implement General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of new ideas, new viewpoints, and new propositions on comprehensively deepening reform. On the basis of learning and understanding the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, we must implement reforms with a spirit of perseverance and demonstrate our responsibility and action. On the basis of thoroughly studying and understanding the spirit of the Third Plenary Session, we must apply the spirit of driving nails to ensure the implementation of reforms, demonstrating responsibility and action. --，--，，、、，，，. Towards the end, this bit is useful to note: -The more than 300 major reform measures determined in the ‘Decision' are all innovative measures, and many strategic deployments are mainly strategic, forward-looking, and directional, still requiring the formulation of thorough and feasible reform plans through exploration and innovation. This requires all regions, departments and Party members and cadres to implement the spirit of the CPC Central Committee to the letter, closely integrate the actual situation, adapt to local conditions, explore and innovate to implement reforms well, and create fresh experiences that can be replicated and scaled.- 《》300，、、，。，，，，、. -Exploration and innovation, along with daring to act and be effective, are proactive actions based on a deep understanding of the guiding ideology, overall goals, and key principles of further comprehensively deepening reform. They are creative actions following a deep understanding of the Party Central Committee's strategic deployment intentions. They are scientific actions that follow the laws of comprehensively deepening reform and building Chinese-style modernization. This is an inherent part of being resolute practitioners and doers. Only by exploring and innovating, and daring to act effectively, can we prevent mere copying in implementation, superficiality from top to bottom, and avoid mechanical execution, oversimplification, and ‘one-size-fits-all' approaches. To explore and innovate for effective reform implementation, it is necessary to promote positive interaction and organic integration between top-level design and grassroots exploration…- 、，、、，， ，、。 、，、，、、--。 ，、.

Subscribe now Page 10: There's an article by the Theory Study Center of the Party Group of the Development Research Center of the State Council. The article talks about building a high-level socialist market economic system. They key tasks that it outlines are: The core issue in building a high-level socialist market economic system is to properly handle the relationship between the government and the market. Letting the market play a decisive role in resource allocation and better leveraging the role of the government are important practical experiences formed in the process of China's reform. To unlock the potential of the socialist market economy system at a higher level, the market mechanism must be utilised more effectively, ensuring that property rights serve as effective incentives, factors flow freely, prices respond flexibly, competition is fair and orderly, and successful enterprises thrive while weaker ones are eliminated. At the same time, the government's ability to govern the macroeconomy must be enhanced to better maintain market order, address market failures, and ensure smooth circulation of the national economy, smooth the circulation of the national economy, so as to do both ‘let it live' and ‘maintain control'. 。，，。，，、、、、。，，、，，----. The key points that then follow are: Adhere to and implement the two unwaverings. -Public ownership is the main body, and the common development of multiple ownership economies is an important part of the socialist basic economic system. The leading role of the state-owned economy in the national economy is an essential requirement of a socialist state. It is necessary to actively implement the Decision by concentrating state capital in key industries and sectors related to national security and the lifeblood of the national economy, in public services, emergency capabilities, and public welfare areas, and in forward-looking, strategic emerging industries. This requires deepening the reform of state-owned assets and enterprises, establishing a system for optimising the layout and structural adjustment of the state-owned economy, and improving the system and mechanism that promote state-owned enterprises focusing on their main responsibilities and core businesses. The private economy is an inherent element of China's economic system and an important force in promoting the development of the socialist market economy. However, there are still problems such as unequal market access and the failure to effectively protect legitimate rights and interests. It is necessary to accelerate the implementation of the ‘principles and policies that help foster a favorable environment and create more opportunities for the development of the non-public sector' put forward in the ‘Decision' to ensure equal access to factors and business activities after access. Guide private enterprises to improve corporate governance, strengthen the compliance and legal operation of private enterprises, and promote the private economy to better play an important role in stabilizing growth, maintaining employment, and promoting innovation within the framework of the socialist market economic system.- --，、。、。，《》、，、、，，，，。，，、。《》--，。，，、、。 Build a unified national market. Under this, the article points to the fact that -the construction of a national unified factor market faces problems such as local investment promotion involution, imperfect factor price formation mechanisms, insufficient social security connections, and imperfect free flow mechanisms for factors like land and data. The construction of a national unified product market faces issues such as local protectionism, market access barriers, different treatments for different ownership systems, monopolies, and unfair competition.- ，，，，、。、、、。It proposes that: we must strengthen the rigid constraints of fair competition review and intensify anti-monopoly and anti-unfair competition efforts…standardise local laws and regulations on attracting investment, and prohibit giving preferential policies in violation of laws and regulations. Establish and improve a unified, standardized and information-sharing public resource trading platform system such as bidding and procurement by the government, institutions and state-owned enterprises, achieving full-process open management of projects. Improve the regulatory mechanism for new economic organizations such as platforms. Improve the land, capital, technology, and data markets, improve the price mechanism of factors mainly determined by market supply and demand, and prevent the government from improperly intervening in price formation. Promote pricing reforms in water, energy, transportation and other fields to achieve more efficient allocation of factor resources. 《》，，。，。、、、，。。、、，，。、、，。 Ensure fair competition in the market. Improve the macroeconomic governance system. Under this, the article calls to -improve the national strategic planning system and policy coordination mechanism, promote the coordinated efforts of planning, finance, currency, industry, price, employment and other policies, and bring both economic policies and non-economic policies into the consistency assessment of macroeconomic policy orientation to improve the comprehensive efficiency of macroeconomic regulation and control…deepen the reform of the fiscal and taxation system, improve the budget system, optimise the tax structure, increase local independent financial resources, improve the financial transfer payment system and improve the government debt management system. Accelerate the improvement of the central banking system, smoothen the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, improve the capital market function of coordinating investment and financing, improve the financial supervision system, and improve the financial system's ability to serve the real economy and prevent and resolve risks.

Share Tracking People's Daily First, Euractiv reports that Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis are set for tough talks on Thursday ahead of a pivotal vote by EU member states next week. -Wang's visit, which follows whistle-stop trips to Germany and Italy earlier this week, is a last-ditch effort ahead of a vote next Wednesday (25 September) on whether to definitively implement the EU executive's proposed duties of up to 35.3% on electric vehicles (EVs). According to reports by the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU (CCCEU), Wang told Chinese and European automakers at a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday (18 September) that China-EU trade ties are now at a ‘crossroads', with ‘one path leading to openness and collaboration [and] the other to protectionism and isolation'. Commission spokesperson Olof Gill told Euractiv on Wednesday that the European Commission remains ‘open to a negotiated solution ... provided that such a solution is adequate and effective in addressing the risk of injury to EU industry that we established in our investigation.' The European Commission argues the tariffs are necessary to protect European automakers against unfairly subsidised Chinese competitors.- The report adds: -Fifteen of the EU's 27 member states, representing at least 65% of the union's population, must vote against the tariffs to prevent their introduction for five years starting from the end of October. Germany abstained in an initial non-binding vote on the proposed duties held in early July, while Spain voted in favour. Only four member states voted against it. Beijing's push to persuade European capitals to vote against the tariffs reportedly yielded some success over the past week. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz both supported Beijing's call for a negotiated solution to the dispute. However, one person familiar with the matter told Euractiv that Germany will likely abstain again next week unless a block is likely to be achieved. But on Monday, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said after a meeting with Wang that Rome will continue to ‘support the position of the EU'.- Share Tracking People's Daily Second, on Wednesday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced a decision to impose countermeasures against nine US military companies for arms sales to Taiwan. Xinhua reports: -Pursuant to Articles 3, 4, 6, 9 and 15 of China's Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, China decided to take the following countermeasures against Sierra Nevada Corporation, Stick Rudder Enterprises LLC, Cubic Corporation, S3 AeroDefense, TCOM, Limited Partnership, TextOre, Planate Management Group, ACT1 Federal and Exovera: Their movable, immovable and all other types of property in China will be frozen. Organizations and individuals in China will be prohibited from engaging in transactions, cooperation or other activities with the above-mentioned enterprises. The decision will become effective from Sept. 18, 2024.- -In response to a query concerning recent U.S. plans to sell arms to China's Taiwan region, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a press briefing that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan seriously violates the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiques, particularly the August 17 Communique of 1982; seriously violates China's sovereignty and security interests; damages China-U.S. relations as well as peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait; and sends an erroneous signal to ‘Taiwan independence' separatist forces. ‘China strongly condemns and firmly opposes this, and has lodged stern representations with the U.S. side. China has taken firm countermeasures and announced that it will impose sanctions on nine U.S. military companies,' he said. The United States continues to arm Taiwan, supporting Lai Ching-te and Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities in their stubborn pursuit of ‘Taiwan independence' and their provocations regarding the one-China principle, Lin noted. This once again proves that the biggest threat to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the greatest saboteur of the status quo across the Taiwan Strait are the separatist activities of ‘Taiwan independence' forces and the conniving support of external forces led by the United States, he added. It should be noted that the DPP authorities are attempting to seek ‘Taiwan independence' through military build-up, and the United States is determined to help advance that agenda by arming Taiwan, Lin said, adding that any such actions will only backfire and lead to disastrous consequences, ultimately ending in failure, Lin said. He stressed that the Taiwan question is at the heart of China's core interests, and it is the most important red line that cannot be crossed in China-U.S. relations. No one should underestimate China's firm will and strong ability to oppose ‘Taiwan independence' and defend its national sovereignty and territorial integrity.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Xi Extols the Superiority of the People's Congress System	It's the holiday edition today with the mid-Autumn festival upon us. But there were two important stories over the weekend. So let me cover those today. First, there was a meeting at the Great Hall of the People marking the 70th anniversary of the National People's Congress. The entire PBSC was present. Xi Jinping delivered a major speech. The full text of the speech was published in the paper on Sunday. I am going to rely on that and Xinhua's English report. Xi said: -70 years ago, the first session of the First NPC adopted the Constitution of the PRC, marking the formal establishment of the people's congress system, which is the basic political system of the country. The establishment of the people's congress system meant that China's politics had fundamentally achieved a great leap from a system where a few held power and the vast majority were oppressed and exploited, to one where the Chinese Communist Party leads and the people are the masters of their own country. This was an unprecedented achievement in thousands of years of history, realising a great transformation in China's political system. The system of people's congresses is the result of the arduous exploration and long-term struggles of the Chinese people under the CPC leadership. It is an entirely new political system that has grown from the Chinese soil and a great invention in the evolution of political institutions. From the initial exploration and proposal of the basic concept of the people's congress system during the New Democratic Revolution, to its establishment and implementation during the period of socialist revolution and construction, to its continuous consolidation and improvement during the new period of reform, opening-up and socialist modernization, and to its further development towards greater maturity and institutionalisation in the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the system of the people's congress has gone through an extraordinary journey. It is now deeply rooted in China and has become an integral part of the great practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics.- 70，《》，。，、、，，。，，。，，，、，，，. Subscribe now In the next part of the speech, Xi made five points, highlighting the significant advantages of the system of people's congresses. First, the people's congress system has demonstrated significant political advantage of upholding the leadership of the Communist Party of China and ensuring that the Party leads the people to effectively govern the country according to law. The people's congress system upholds the organic unity of the Party's leadership, the people's mastery of the country, and the rule of law, firmly safeguards the authority and centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, and upholds the Party's core leadership role in taking overall charge and coordinating all entities. This system is conducive to ensuring and consolidating the Party's leadership position and its governance status from both an institutional and legal perspective, ensuring that the Party's propositions become the will of the state through legal procedures, ensuring that the candidates recommended by the Party organization become the leaders of the state power organs through legal procedures, ensuring that the Party exercises leadership over the state and society through the state power organs, and ensuring that the Party's theories, lines, policies, and decision-making arrangements are fully implemented in national work. This effectively overcomes the chaos and disunity of old China, where there was no central leadership (a group of dragons without a leader - ), the country was fragmented (akin to a dish of loose sand - ), and constant political infighting and mutual attacks exposing each other's faults were commonplace. ——、。、、，，、，，，，，、、。、、. Second, the people's congress system has the significant advantage of practising whole process people's democracy and guaranteeing that the people are the masters of the country. The people's congress system upholds the people's dominant position, upholds the principle that all state power belongs to the people, supports and guarantees the people's exercise of state power through the people's congresses, and embodies the nature of the people's democratic dictatorship. The implementation of the people's congress system, together with the implementation of basic political systems, such as the multi-party cooperation and political consultation system under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the system of regional ethnic autonomy, and the system of grassroots mass autonomy, consolidates and develops the broadest patriotic united front, and together forms a comprehensive, extensive, and organically connected system of people being the true masters of the country. This is conducive to ensuring that all people, in accordance with the law, engage in democratic elections, democratic consultations, democratic decision-making, democratic management, and democratic supervision, and manage state affairs, economic and cultural undertakings, and social affairs through various channels and forms in accordance with the law. This effectively overcomes the phenomenon in some countries where the people appear to have rights in form but lack real power in practice, and where grand promises are made during elections, only to be ignored once the election is over. ——、。，，，。，、、，，、、，、、、、，、、。、、. — (Note: For any rational observer, the first point fundamentally undermines the second point. But if you read them in conjunction, the message is quite clear, that as long as the power and legitimacy of the Party to rule is not challenged, policy dialogue is possible.) Third, the people's congress system has the significant advantage of implementing democratic centralism and ensuring that the country's political life is both vibrant and stable and orderly. The people elect their own representatives through democratic elections to form people's congresses at all levels. The state administrative organs, supervisory organs, judicial organs, and procuratorial organs are created by the people's congresses, are responsible to the people's congresses, and are supervised by the people's congresses. People's congress representatives come from all regions, ethnic groups, and all walks of life; they listen to and convey the opinions and suggestions of the public through various forms and channels. People's congresses at all levels and their standing committees implement democratic centralism, fully leveraging democracy, and exercise their powers collectively. This demonstrates a high degree of unity between democracy and efficiency, ensuring that state organs operate in a highly coordinated and efficient manner, and that the country's various undertakings are organised and advanced in a unified and effective way. This effectively overcomes the problems seen in some countries, where there is mutual obstruction, severe internal friction, and situations where matters are discussed but not decided, or decided but not implemented. ——、。，。、、、，，。、、，。，，。，，。、、. Fourth, the people's congress system has the significant advantage of ensuring the comprehensive rule of law in the country and promoting the legalisation of all aspects of national governance. According to the Chinese Constitution, the NPC has the power to amend the Constitution and supervise its implementation, while the NPC Standing Committee interprets the Constitution and oversees its implementation. The NPC, its Standing Committee, and local people's congresses with legislative power have the authority to draft and amend laws and regulations, and the people's congresses at all levels and their standing committees have the right to supervise the implementation of laws and regulations and supervise the state organs to perform their duties in accordance with the law. Such an institutional arrangement is conducive to giving full play to the functional role of the people's congresses and their standing committees at all levels in the construction of the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics; it is conducive to promoting scientific legislation, strict law enforcement, fair justice, and public adherence to the law; it is conducive to continuously improving the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics with the Constitution as the core; it is conducive to ensuring the comprehensive and effective implementation of the Constitution and laws; and it is conducive to maintaining social fairness and justice. This effectively overcomes the phenomena seen in some countries where there are no laws to follow, laws are not enforced, or where power overrides the law or suppresses it. ——、。，、，、，、，、.，，、、、，，，。、、. Fifth, the people's congress system has the significant advantage of maintaining national unity and ensuring long-term stability. China is a unified multi-ethnic country and also a unitary state. The people's congress system serves as an institutional guarantee for maintaining national unity, ethnic solidarity, and social stability. Under the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, we have rationally divided the powers of the central and local governments, with the central government having comprehensive governance authority over all local administrative regions, including ethnic autonomous areas and special administrative regions. We uphold the principle of equality among all ethnic groups. In areas where ethnic minorities are concentrated, regional autonomy is practised, and autonomous organs are established to exercise the powers and autonomy of local state organs in accordance with the law. We adhere to the principle of ‘One Country, Two Systems', establishing special administrative regions in Hong Kong and Macau, maintaining the constitutional order of the special administrative regions as defined by the Constitution and the Basic Law, and supporting the Chief Executives and governments of the special administrative regions in governing in accordance with the law. These institutional arrangements are conducive to maintaining the unity of the legal system, safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, fully leveraging the initiatives of both the central and local governments, and concentrating efforts to achieve major undertakings. They also help to consolidate and develop socialist ethnic relations based on equality, solidarity, mutual assistance, and harmony, and promote the building of a Chinese national community. This effectively overcomes the problems seen in some countries, where local governments act independently, central authority is weak (the tail is too large to wag – ), and ethnic extrangement/divisions and conflicts persist. ——、。，，、、。，，。，，，。--，、，，。，、，、，、。、、. Share Tracking People's Daily In the next bit, Xi begins by talking about the -strong vitality and significant superiority- of the people's congress system. Xinhua English summarises the next two paragraphs well: -Xi pointed out that since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, our Party has stood at a new historical juncture, gained a deep understanding of the new changes to the principal contradictions in Chinese society, actively responded to the people's new demands and aspirations for democracy and rule of law, and improved the organizational and working systems of people's congresses, making historic achievements in its work. We adhere to adapting the basic tenets of Marxism to China's specific realities and fine traditional Chinese culture, deeply grasp the laws governing the development of socialist democracy, and continuously promote theoretical and practical innovations in the system of people's congresses. Noting that the system of people's congresses is an important institutional vehicle for realizing whole-process people's democracy in China, Xi said it is imperative to uphold the CPC's leadership, adhere to the use of a system of institutions to ensure that the people run the country, exercise law-based governance on all fronts, uphold democratic centralism, and stick to the path of socialist political advancement with Chinese characteristics. Efforts must be made to modernize China's system and capacity for governance, give full play to the role of deputies to people's congresses, strengthen the self-improvement efforts of people's congresses at various levels to uphold their four-fold role as political, working, representative institutions, and institutions of state power. This series of new concepts, ideas and requirements form the Party's important thoughts on upholding and improving the system of people's congresses, providing fundamental guidance for the high-quality development of people's congresses in the new era. After this, he put forth five points of action going forward. First, give full play to the role of people's congresses in ensuring full and effective implementation of the Constitution and laws. People's congresses at all levels and their standing committees must fully perform their functions, firmly safeguard the unity, dignity, and authority of the country's legal system, ensure effective implementation of the Constitution and laws, and make sure that all state organs fulfill their duties and carry out their work within the scope permitted by the Constitution and laws. Second, it is important that people's congresses play a leading role in legislative work. Xi urged efforts to improve the legislative framework featuring guidance from Party committees, the leading role played by people's congresses, support from the government, and participation by all parties. Efforts should be made to step up legislation in key, emerging, and foreign-related fields, improve the quality of legislation, and continuously improve the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics. He also urged efforts to accelerate the improvement of a legal system featuring equal rights, equal opportunities and fair rules for all to ensure that citizens fully enjoy their rights. In addition, he called to adhere to deepening reforms within the framework of the rule of law, achieving unity between reform and the rule of law; major reforms should be based on the law and should be elevated to the status of legal systems in a timely manner. Third, he called to give full play to the key role of the oversight by people's congresses in the Party and state supervision systems. It is imperative to improve the system through which people's congresses oversee the government, the supervisory commissions, the people's courts and the people's procuratorates. Xi urged people's congresses to strengthen oversight of the implementation of the Constitution and laws, and intensify the review and oversight of government budgets and final accounts and the oversight over the management of state-owned assets and government debts. People's congresses should work to promote the implementation of the CPC Central Committee's decisions and plans, and ensure that all state organs exercise their powers by law and that the legitimate rights and interests of the people are safeguarded and realized. Administrative, supervisory, adjudicatory and procuratorial organs at various levels should readily accept oversight from people's congresses and effectively fulfill their respective supervisory duties. Fourth, Xi pointed out that people's congresses should play an exemplary role in maintaining close ties with the people. All state organs and their employees must foster a strong sense of service to the people, put the people above all else, and maintain close ties with them. Deputies to people's congresses shoulder the honorable duties entrusted to them by the people, Xi noted, urging them to faithfully represent the interests and will of the people, and serve as the bridge that links the Party and the state with the people. He stressed the need for all state organs to provide support for the deputies to the people's congresses to perform their duties in accordance with the law, improve the systems and mechanisms for contact with deputies, and ensure that deputies reach out to the public on a greater variety of issues and in more diversified ways. Fifth, Xi emphasized that party committees at all levels should strengthen their overall leadership over the work of the people's congresses, and support the people's congresses and their standing committees in exercising their powers and carrying out their work in accordance with the law. The leading Party members groups of the standing committees of the people's congresses at all levels should always adhere to the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, fulfill their main responsibilities for comprehensively and strictly governing the Party, and strengthen the political, ideological, organizational, work style, and disciplinary construction of the people's congresses in line with the requirement to uphold the four-fold role. They should train personnel that maintain political resolve, serve the people, respect the rule of law, promote democracy, and are diligent and responsible, and continuously improve the quality and level of the people's congress work in the new era and on the new journey. Towards the end, Xi said: -Democracy is a common value of all mankind. The great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China in developing people's democracy have enriched global democratic theory and practice, and contributed Chinese wisdom and solutions. We should draw on the beneficial achievements of human political civilization, but we must not simply copy Western political systems. We are willing to continue exploring with all countries and peoples around the world who pursue peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy, and freedom, to jointly explore paths for achieving broad, genuine, and effective democracy, and to make new contributions to the progress of human political civilization.- 。，，。，。、、、、、，、、，。 70 years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong issued a call to ‘struggle to build a great socialist country' in his opening speech at the first session of the First NPC. Now, the new journey of building a comprehensive modern socialist country has begun, and the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered an irreversible historical process. The entire Party and people of all ethnic groups in the country must unite more closely around the Party Central Committee, keep in mind the original intention and mission, actively develop whole-process people's democracy, strive to build socialist political civilization, give full play to the significant advantages of the people's congress system, and unite and strive for the great cause of comprehensively promoting the construction of a strong country and national rejuvenation with Chinese-style modernization!- 70，，--。，，。，、，，，，、! Share Tracking People's Daily Second, on Saturday, there was a detailed report (English report) on Xi's visit to Gansu and Shaanxi. Xinhua has a detailed English report too. In Gansu, Xi was accompanied by Gansu governor and Party secretary. He visited Tianshui, Lanzhou and other localities. Xi visited the Fuxi temple in Tianshui. Xi said that -it is imperative to protect and pass on the precious cultural heritage, so that the wisdom and creativity of ancestors will constantly inspire future generations and enhance national pride and confidence.- He then visited the Huaniu apple production base in the Maiji district of Tianshui. There, he listened to a report of a project to divert water from the Taohe River. The big message from Xi was that -the key to rural revitalization is industrial revitalization.- He called for -strengthened efforts to protect and optimize cultivation of this variety (of apples) and apply new marketing models so that this specialty industry will be expanded, and more people will increase their incomes. He wished villagers a prosperous life.- Xi then visited the Maijishan Grottoes. He said that -China's four major grottoes are the treasures of Chinese civilization, all of which have important historical and cultural value. He called on cultural relic workers to continue the -Mogao Spirit,- devote themselves to protecting national treasures, and make greater contributions to promoting the inheritance and innovative development of China's traditional culture and enhancing the influence of Chinese culture.- Next stop was Lanzhou, where he first went to a service center for Party members and residents. He also visited a police station. -He emphasized the necessity of focusing on the practical needs of residents, especially the elderly and children, and continuously improving community services. It is imperative to adhere to and develop the ‘Fengqiao model- in the new era, and make more solid progress on community-level governance and social security. Work must be done to continue to take actions against the practice of formalism to reduce the burden on the grassroots units, so that grassroots cadres can devote more time and energy to serving the people.- Then, Xi visited a section of the Yellow River near the Zhongshan Bridge in Lanzhou, where he stressed the importance of ecological protection. The next day, he listened to a -work report from the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee and the provincial government, and affirmed the province's achievements in various work.- Xi added: Gansu should promote new-type industrialization, accelerate the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries, strengthen and improve industries with distinctive advantages, actively develop strategic emerging industries, develop new quality productive forces in light of local conditions, and build a significant national manufacturing base for new energy and new-energy-related equipment. He also urged the province to actively cultivate modern specialty agriculture in cold and arid climate, and nurture a number of competitive agricultural brands. Efforts should also be made to promote the integrated protection and systematic management of mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes, grass and sand there, and fortify the ecological security shelter in the western part of the country. He stressed the need for the province to deepen reform and expand opening up with greater courage and determination, actively integrate into the building of a unified national market, deepen reform related to state assets and state-owned enterprises, and encourage and support the development of the non-public sector. Efforts should also be made to implement the people-centered new urbanization strategy effectively, enhance the comprehensive carrying capacity of the counties, expand the county economy, and promote the integrated urban and rural development. Xi urged the province to take the initiative to serve and align local development with coordinated regional development strategy, expand cross-provincial cooperation, and deeply integrate itself into high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and the construction of the new western land-sea corridor. Xi pointed out that Gansu Province has a profound historical and cultural heritage and is rich in resources of revolutionary culture. It is necessary to carry forward the revolutionary traditions and strengthen cultural heritage protection, he said. Efforts should be made to support the Dunhuang Academy in its efforts to become an example of world cultural heritage protection and a center of Dunhuang studies, and advance the building of the national cultural parks dedicated to the Great Wall, the Long March and the Yellow River, so as to provide a powerful source of inspiration for modernization. Efforts should also be made to further integrate culture and tourism, developing the cultural tourism sector into a pillar industry. Xi emphasized the need to promote social advancement and governance and establish a solid foundation for common prosperity among all ethnic groups. It is important to pool resources to address the demands of the people and accomplish practical livelihood projects that are tangible and accessible to the people. Work must be done to consolidate and expand the achievements in poverty alleviation, and prevent any risk of lapsing or relapsing into poverty en masse in rural areas. Efforts should be made to promote the transformation of rural customs to cultivate a civilized rural atmosphere, continuously forge a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation and strengthen the governance of religious affairs in accordance with the law. He emphasized efforts to ensure the basic needs of the people affected by the earthquake that struck Jishishan County are met, and advance post-disaster recovery and reconstruction, making sure the people are safe and warm during the winter. Work must be done to effectively ensure workplace safety.

CMC on Studying Political Army Building in New Era - Wang's Global South Message at BRICS Meet - Li Qiang's Saudi Visit	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, September 12, 2024. Page 1: Xi Jinping is on an inspection tour to Shaanxi and Gansu. But that is not what's been covered in the paper today. We'll get a consolidated report once the visit ends. Instead, there is a report on Xi Jinping's congratulatory letter to the SCO forum on women, and his message to Abdelmadjid Tebboune, congratulating him on his reelection as president of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria. Another report informs that a book compiling Xi's discourses on the political building of the armed forces has been published. The book contains a total of 89 manuscripts. The CMC has called to -carefully organise the study and use of- the book. The CMC has called for the incorporation of the collection -into the theoretical study sessions of party committees, the ideological and political education of the troops, and the teaching of political theory in military academies. It should be prominently featured as important content in the organization of specialized political cadre training at various levels. 《》、，、. Theory workers should thoroughly study and comprehend Chairman Xi's important expositions on political army building in the new era, and strengthen research and interpretation of the strategy for political army building in the new era.

Deputies to the People's Congresses are elected through democratic processes, come from among the people, are rooted in the people, and maintain close ties with the people. They faithfully represent the interests and will of the people in exercising state power, which is a distinctive feature and unique advantage of the People's Congress system. Over the past 70 years, as the people's congress system has been continuously improved, the system of deputies has also been strengthened, providing support and guarantees for deputies to perform their duties according to law and to maintain contact with the public. Since the 18th Party Congress, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has placed great emphasis on the role of deputies, comprehensively strengthening leadership over the work of deputies. The mechanisms and systems for deputies to connect with the people have been further improved, channels have become smoother, and the effectiveness of their work has been continuously enhanced.- ，。，、，，，。70，，，、。，，，、、.

China is committed to promoting efficient global IP governance, adhering to true multilateralism, and encouraging the global IP governance system to progress in a fairer and more reasonable way, he noted.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 2: There's a report on Wang Yi's comments at the BRICS meeting on security affairs or the BRICS NSAs meeting. I am going to cover the different meetings and statements from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' website. First, Wang said (English report) -in the face of current security challenges, BRICS should adopt a long-term perspective, demonstrate a more open attitude, and cooperate more closely to jointly address security threats and resolve security dilemmas, so as to inject positive energy into the turbulent international situation and make new contributions to building a world of lasting peace and universal security-. He then put forward four points: -Firstly, be implementers of peaceful coexistence. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. BRICS should lead by example in practicing peaceful coexistence, strengthening solidarity and coordination and upholding independence, and take the lead in building a community with a shared future for mankind. It is essential to adhere to a holistic approach to national security, systematically advance political, economic, cultural and social security, and firmly grasp the initiative of safeguarding national security, in a bid to ensure real security for the people. Secondly, be builders of multilateralism. Guided by true multilateralism, BRICS should advocate abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, practice the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, uphold dialogue rather than confrontation, partnership rather than alliance, and win-win rather than zero-sum outcomes. Using the UN's 2024 Summit Of The Future as an opportunity, BRICS should jointly uphold the international system with the UN at its core and support the UN in playing a greater role in international security affairs. Exceptionalism and double standards should be rejected, and any words or deeds that undermine the UN's authority or negate the binding force of Security Council resolutions should be firmly resisted. Thirdly, be promoters of political settlement. BRICS should resolutely promote the political settlement of hotspot issues, uphold the principle of indivisible security, respect each other's legitimate concerns, seek common ground while shelving differences in dialogues, work with each other in the same direction in negotiations, and turn hostility into friendship. Regarding the prolonged spillover of the Ukraine crisis, China and Brazil jointly issued a six-point consensus, which received widespread positive responses. BRICS partners are encouraged to support and participate in this initiative to amplify the rational, balanced and constructive voices within the international community and build more consensus for a political settlement to the crisis. Regarding the Gaza conflict, it is necessary to implement a comprehensive ceasefire as soon as possible, unblock humanitarian aid corridors, and return to the right track of the two-state solution as soon as possible. Fourthly, be defenders of fairness and justice. BRICS should speak for justice and jointly advocate an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization. Upholding the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits, BRICS should make the global governance system more just and equitable, effectively enhancing the representation and voice of the Global South to ensure equal rights, equal opportunities, and equal rules for every country. BRICS should strengthen the governance of artificial intelligence (AI) and balance development and security to ensure that AI always serves the progress of human civilization.- He added that -China stands ready to work with BRICS partners to fully implement the Global Security Initiative-. Subscribe now Next, there's a report (English report) on Wang's comments during the meeting's work reviewing the BRICS Counter-Terrorism Working Group and the Cybersecurity Working Group. Wang again made four points: First, adhere to the correct principles. Advocate a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable security, and forge a new path for security. Support the United Nations in playing a central coordinating role in global counter-terrorism cooperation, and resist ‘double standards' and politicization and instrumentalization of counter-terrorism issues. Promote the establishment of a more just and reasonable internet governance system reflecting the will and interests of most countries, achieving resource sharing, joint responsibility, and cooperative governance, and ensuring the sharing of digital dividends. Second, strengthen practical cooperation. China fully affirms the results of the Counter-Terrorism and Cybersecurity Working Group and is willing to work with all parties to earnestly implement the ‘BRICS Counter-Terrorism Strategy' and ‘Action Plan' to create a model for international counter-terrorism cooperation. China invites BRICS counter-terrorism officials to visit Xinjiang again and supports the signing of an MoU on BRICS cybersecurity cooperation. Third, demonstrate the spirit of solidarity. BRICS countries should fully leverage the positive effects of the ‘BRICS+' model, unite a broader range of countries with the BRICS spirit, share experiences and practices, expand dialogue and cooperation, provide capacity-building support, and continuously consolidate the common positions and actions of the Global South on counter-terrorism and cybersecurity. Fourth, improve global governance. Promote the implementation of GSI, adhere to the principle of consultation, joint construction and sharing, and establish a fair, reasonable and effective global security governance system centered on the United Nations.
