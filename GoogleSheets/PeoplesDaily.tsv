Page 4: There's a report with comments from Mo Rong, president of the Chinese Academy of Labour and Social Security, discussing the proposal to push back the statutory retirement age. Mo said that: This -is a major reform based on the needs of the development of China's economic, social, and demographic situation. It takes a long-term perspective and is the result of extensive deliberation, thorough research, and careful decision-making. It is an objective requirement for economic and social development and an inevitable choice for China to adapt to the new normal of population development. It is related to supporting Chinese-style modernization with high-quality population development, and it has objective necessity and practical urgency.- -、、，，、、，，，，。-. This reform responds to the objective reality of increased life expectancy and years of education in China, addressing the need to enhance the effectiveness of human resource development and utilisation. With the improvement in living standards, advancements in medical technology, and better health and sanitation conditions, China's average life expectancy has risen to 78.6 years. At the same time, the average years of education for new labour force entrants has increased from 8 years in 1982 to 14 years in 2023, marking a significant rise. ‘This also means that the age at which the labour force starts working has been delayed. If the statutory retirement age remains unchanged, the reduction in average working years will lead to issues such as a lower utilisation rate of human capital,' Mo Rong explained. Drawing from international experience and China's own circumstances, implementing delayed retirement reform helps increase the labour participation rate of younger elderly people, enhances the potential and quality of labour supply, promotes human resource development, and transforms the demographic dividend into a human resource dividend. This reform also addresses changes in the working-age population and the need to increase the effective labour supply across society.- 、，。、，78.6，，19828202314，。-，。，。-，，，，，。，. Mo added that -by the end of 2023, China's population aged 60 and above reached 297 million, accounting for 21.1% of the total population-. Mo added that -in recent years, China's working-age population has declined, and the proportion of working-age population in the total population will continue to decline going ahead. ‘The implementation of delayed retirement age reform is conducive to stabilising the labour participation rate, maintaining the momentum and vitality of economic and social development, and is an important measure to implement the national strategy of actively responding to population ageing. It can better support the high-quality development of the economy and society'.- -、、，。-，2023，602.97，21.1%。，，，-，，，.- He finally clarified that the reform will follow the principles of being voluntary and flexible. In other words it will be implemented -fully considering the needs of different groups, allowing workers to choose a retirement plan that suits their own work and life circumstances. Employees who wish to retire earlier, and meet conditions such as the minimum contribution period for pension insurance, can opt for flexible early retirement. Younger elderly people who are willing, able, and qualified to continue working are not forced out of the labour market prematurely and can choose to keep working-. -、，，。，，。、、，，。-，，、. Share Tracking People's Daily US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell has said that Beijing is giving Moscow -very substantial- help to beef up its war machine, and in return Russia is handing over its closely guarded military tech on submarines and missiles, as per Politico. The report says: -Speaking with a group of journalists, including POLITICO, after meetings with European Union and NATO counterparts in Brussels, Campbell upped the ante on Beijing. The U.S. previously focused on Beijing's supply of what's known as dual-use technologies — which can be applied for military or civilian purposes. Now Washington is unambiguously saying that China is aiding the Russian military. With Moscow facing international sanctions, it desperately needs technology to boost its military production to be able to continue its war against Ukraine. ‘These are not dual-use capabilities,- Campbell said, referring to the latest materials China is giving Russia. ‘These are basically being applied directly to the Russian war machine.- -These are component pieces of a very substantial effort on the part of China to help sustain, build and diversify various elements of the Russian war machine', he added. ‘We're seeing efforts at the highest levels of both governments to try to both hide and protect certain elements of this worrisome collaboration ... Most of these activities have been driven underground.' China has frequently issued statements denying it is supplying Russia with arms to use in Ukraine, insisting it does not provide either side with weapons and has an ‘impartial position' on the war. In exchange for Beijing's help, Russia has started giving China submarine, missile and other sensitive technologies. Historically, Moscow has been wary of giving Beijing its very latest military technology. ‘The capabilities that Russia is providing is support in areas where previously they had been frankly reluctant to engage directly with China,' Campbell said. ‘We are concerned about a particular number of military arenas where there appears to be some determination to provide China with greater support. ‘That has to do with submarine operations, activities of aeronautical design, including stealth; that also involves capacities on missile capabilities,' he said.- Xinhua reports that China's Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday expressed willingness to engage in further consultations with the European Union (EU) concerning the anti-subsidy case involving Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). The report says: -The EV case is complex and has a wide impact, and there are certain challenges facing the quest for China and the EU to reach an agreement through consultation, the spokesperson noted, adding that China believes that as long as the EU shows sincerity and works towards the same goal, the two sides can succeed in addressing each other's concerns through consultation. ‘China is willing to continue to work closely with the EU to reach an early solution that meets the common interests of both sides and conforms to World Trade Organization rules, so as to promote the sound and steady development of China-EU economic and trade relations'.- Wang Yi Meets Secretary of the Russian Federation Security Council Sergei Shoigu: As per the report, Wang said that -in face of unprecedented changes in a century, the stable and healthy development of China-Russia relations are fundamentally due to the guidance of the two countries' heads of state…He stressed that China is willing to strengthen strategic communication with Russia, give full play to the role of the China-Russia strategic security consultation mechanism and the BRICS Meeting of High Representatives on National Security mechanism, and continuously enrich the strategic connotations of China-Russia relations. Meanwhile, Wang said that China supports Russia's work as the rotating chair of BRICS and is willing to join hands to deepen mutual trust and cooperation among BRICS countries, to shape the BRICS mechanism into a major channel for emerging powers to make their voices heard and an important platform for solidarity and cooperation of the ‘Global South' and to continuously create new paradigms for ‘BRICS+' cooperation.- The report adds: -The two sides also exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis. Shoigu explained Russia's position on the issue. He welcomed the ‘six-point consensus' jointly proposed by China and Brazil, saying Russia is pleased to see this consensus widely recognized by the international community. Wang stated that China has always maintained an objective and fair attitude on the Ukraine issue and will continue to commit to increasing the voice of balance, objectivity, and rationality in the international community, to gather more international consensus and accumulate necessary conditions for an early ceasefire and a political resolution to the crisis.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

But this Reuters report puts it in context. -China's consumer inflation accelerated in August to the fastest pace in half a year but the uptick was due more to higher food costs from weather disruptions than a recovery in domestic demand as producer price deflation worsened. A sputtering start in the second half is mounting pressure on the world's second-largest economy to roll out more policies amid a prolonged housing downturn, persistent joblessness, debt woes and rising trade tensions. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.6% from a year earlier last month, versus a 0.5% rise in July, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Monday, but less than a 0.7% increase forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. Extreme weather this summer from deadly floods to scorching heat has pushed up farm produce prices, contributing to faster inflation.

The spokesperson noted that the Dutch side should keep in mind international economic and trade rules and the overall situation of Sino-Dutch economic and trade cooperation. They should respect market principles and the spirit of contract, and avoid relevant measures that hinder the normal cooperation and development of the semiconductor industry of the two countries, the MOC spokesperson added.

Breakdown of Wang Yi's Post-Plenum Article on China's Foreign Policy	Hi folks, In today's edition, I am only doing a full breakdown of Wang Yi's post-plenum article, which is published in the paper on Page 6. If you have been following official discourse on foreign affairs, directionally, there is nothing particularly new in the piece. But there are some useful takeaways: The primary concerns remain arond -hegemonic bullying- and efforts by the US at -containing and suppressing emerging forces,- along with unilateralism and protectionism and outbreak of -local conflicts.- Ties with Russia and the Global South remain a priority; the aim is to expand China's circle of friends. With the US and EU, the focus is on achieving some sort of stability. The language on RMB internationalisation remains that this must be done -steadily and prudently.- The approach towards foreign technological, trade and personnel exchanges remains one of openness, as is the language related to foreign capital. The three global initiatives remain key to the foreign policy agenda. But it is interesting that the Global Artificial Intelligence Governance Initiative was covered in the paragraph on GSI. This was interesting: Promote the establishment of more bilateral and regional communities with a shared future, and promote the construction of communities with a shared future in various fields such as health, climate change, and cyber security. In addition, the points related to establishing and improving the coordination mechanism for peripheral security work; mechanisms for early warning, prevention, control, and protection of overseas interests and investment risks; anti-sanction, anti-interference, and anti-‘long-arm jurisdiction' mechanisms; and the mechanism for safeguarding maritime rights and interests are worth noting. Share Tracking People's Daily In the first section, Wang clarifies that foreign policy must serve the goal of Chinese-style modernisation.

We have written a new chapter in the two miracles of rapid economic development and long-term social stability, and have lifted nearly 100 million rural poor people out of poverty, accounting for over 70% of global poverty reduction; China's contribution to world economic growth has exceeded 30% for many consecutive years, which has effectively promoted the cause of global development. We have written the adherence to the path of peaceful development into the Party Constitution and the state Constitution, have proposed to promote the construction of a new type of international relations based on mutual respect, fairness, justice, and win-win cooperation, and have taken a new path that is completely different from the rise of traditional powers.

We have promoted the five nuclear powers to issue a joint statement on preventing nuclear war, explored and implemented solutions to hot-spot issues with Chinese characteristics, and achieved important results such as promoting reconciliation and resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

Wang says that the forum will -draw up a new blueprint for the common development of China-Africa relations and write a new chapter of unity and cooperation in the ‘Global South'.- He calls it the most important diplomatic event being held domestically. In the first section, Wang recalls a bit of history. He then talks about FOCAC being established in 2000, adding that: Share Tracking People's Daily In the second section, Wang makes five points. First, he talks about how Xi has been personally engaged in promoting China-Africa relations. -Guiding the building of a China-Africa community with a shared future through head-of-state diplomacy. Since becoming President, Xi Jinping has visited Africa five times, presided over two Forum on China-Africa Cooperation summits, as well as the Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity Against COVID-19 and the China-Africa Leaders' Dialogue, among others. He has also welcomed numerous African leaders to China. Through high-level exchanges with ‘visiting relatives' and ‘family portraits', China-Africa relations have entered a new era. During his visit to Africa, at the Johannesburg Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in 2015, President Xi Jinping repeatedly emphasised that China and Africa have always been a community with a shared future. In 2018, at the FOCAC summit in Beijing, President Xi Jinping proposed to build a China-Africa community with a shared future that features ‘joint responsibility, win-win cooperation, delivers happiness for all, enjoys cultural prosperity, enjoys common security, and promotes harmony between man and nature'.

Wang adds: -Africa is the first continent to collectively welcome and support the Global Development Initiative, with 33 countries joining the Friends of GDI group, accounting for over 40% globally. Africa is a demonstration region for the high-quality joint construction of BRI and the implementation of GDI, and has become the most proactive and enthusiastic region in the world in responding to China's major initiatives and proposals.- ，33，40%。--、，、.

Wang writes that the -global political and security situation is becoming increasingly complex.- -Only by adhering to the concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security can we embark on a path of universal security. In April 2022, President Xi Jinping put forward the Global Security Initiative. Adhering to the core principles of respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, paying attention to the legitimate security concerns of all countries, and resolving differences and disputes between countries in a peaceful manner, these core principles are consistent with Africa's principles of solving African problems in an African way, playing a leading role in regional peace and security affairs, and promoting the ‘silencing of guns in Africa', which has received support and praise from many African countries. ，。、、、，。20224，。、，，，、、--，. China is not only the proposer of GSI, but also an active implementer. China has constructively participated in African peace and security affairs, and actively promoted regional countries to engage in dialogue and cooperation on hot-spot issues such as in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and the Great Lakes region. In response to hot-spot issues in the Horn of Africa, China proposed the ‘Outlook on Peace and Development in the Horn of Africa', appointed a special envoy to mediate for the cause of regional peace and development, and successfully held two Horn of Africa Peace Conferences. In response to non-traditional security challenges such as food security, China has provided Chinese solutions for world food security governance and strengthened international exchanges and cooperation through multilateral mechanisms such as the United Nations, the G20, and the BRICS. We are concerned about the urgent needs of our African friends and have provided emergency food aid to Africa many times, meeting challenges together with practical actions.- ，。，、、。，--，，。，、、，，。，，.

No Party Spirit, No Membership - Breakdown of US NSA's China Visit & Beijing's Questions About VP Harris - India-China Talks - Xi Presses Reform Agend...	Instead of going page-by-page today, I'll go issue-by-issue, since that works better for today. Let's begin with a report on Xi Jinping presiding over the sixth meeting of the Central Committee for Comprehensively Deepening Reform on Thursday morning. Xi said that -further deepening reform is an advancement based on the comprehensive deepening of reform since the new era, and it has a solid foundation and favourable conditions.- ，，. -We should make good use of the existing reform achievements and important experiences, emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, keep pace with the times, be realistic and pragmatic, fully mobilise the enthusiasm of all parties, and do our best to organise and implement the reform tasks.- ，、、、，，. The meeting approved: A guideline on upgrading pilot free trade zones Work Plan for the Implementation of Important Reform Measures from the Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee by Relevant Departments of the Central and State Organs The report then praises the -landmark and leading institutional innovation achievements- of the 22 free trade pilot zones set up by the CPC Central Committee since the 18th Party Congress. It adds: Share Tracking People's Daily Next, let's look at the report on Xi Jinping meeting with US NSA Jake Sullivan. Xinhua says: As per Xinhua, Sullivan said that his talks with Wang Yi were -candid, substantive and constructive.- He added that: The US readout is very brief. It says: -The two sides discussed further implementation of the commitments President Biden and President Xi made at the November 2023 Woodside Summit, including on counternarcotics, military-to-military communications, and AI safety and risk. They also discussed cross-Strait issues, Russia's war against Ukraine, and the South China Sea. Both sides welcomed ongoing efforts to maintain open lines of communication, including planning for a call between President Biden and President Xi in the coming weeks.- Share Tracking People's Daily While in Beijing, Sullivan also met with CMC vice chairman Zhang Youxia. Here is the Chinese reporting on the meeting: The US readout on this meeting says: Subscribe now There's also a press briefing that Sullivan did before leaving Beijing. Key points: -We believe that competition with China does not have to lead to conflict or confrontation. The key is responsible management through diplomacy.- -This was a true working visit. Over the course of 14 hours of meetings, we discussed progress and next steps on implementation of the Woodside commitments, including our work on counternarcotics and efforts to reduce the flow of illicit synthetic drugs into the United States; military-to-military communications including an upcoming engagement between our theater commanders; as well as work towards another round of AI safety and risk talks. Among other issues of global concern, we discussed the recent efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza.- -The United States will continue to take necessary action to prevent advanced U.S. technologies from being used to undermine our national security without unduly limiting trade or investment. We have continued concerns about China's unfair trade policies and non-market economic practices. We remain deeply concerned about China's support for Russia's defense industrial base and its impact on both European and transatlantic security, not to mention on Russia's brutal aggression against Ukraine…I also underscored the longstanding U.S. commitment to universal human rights and fundamental freedoms. In all of my meetings, I stressed the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait; emphasized the United States' commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula; and I reaffirmed the United States' commitment to our Indo-Pacific allies including our concerns about destabilizing actions against lawful Philippine maritime operations in the South China Sea.- Then we get to the questions. -I think the meeting with Vice Chairman Zhang was very important. There is no substitute for actually being able to sit across the table, not just with the Vice Chairman but with his whole team, and be able to hear from them their perspective on critical issues, and them be able to hear from us our perspective on those same issues, whether it's cross-Strait relations or the South China Sea or cyber issues. And being able to have that exchange, which is rare, I think allows us to clarify our intentions and our concerns and hear theirs, and try to use that in service of responsible management of the relationship going forward.- This bit is interesting, since it tells us that Beijing was clearly interested in understanding what a Harris presidency would mean for US-China ties. And that there were direct questions, it seems, to that effect. Q Thank you. From the Wall Street Journal. Just to follow up on the question about the U.S. election, I'm curious about what questions, if any, did the Chinese ask you about what a potential Harris administration would represent for U.S.-China relations. And connected to this, did you raise the issue specifically of potential election interference by China during your trip here today? Let me take a moment here and highlight this from a report today in SCMP on Harris' latest interview with CNN: Finally, I do recommend pondering over this paragraph. Share Tracking People's Daily The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also put out a detailed review of the visit. Director General Yang Tao of the Department of North American and Oceanian Affairs said that Sullivan-Wang conversations spanned six sessions, totaling more than 11 hours. They discussed the China-U.S. relations, sensitive issues and major international and regional hotspots. I am only going to highlight anything not covered above. First, the key to keeping the China-U.S. relations to the right direction lies in the guidance and stewardship of the two presidents; Second, the key to avoiding conflict and confrontation between China and the United States lies in abiding by the three joint communiques; Third, the key to smooth interactions between China and the United States lies in treating each other as equals; Fourth, the key to a steady and sustained China-U.S. relationship lies in cementing the popular foundation; Fifth, the key to peaceful coexistence between China and the United States lies in developing a right perception. These ‘five keys' will help the two sides chart a better future and find a right way for the two major countries to get along with each other.- -The two sides also agreed on a number of specific matters, including: to maintain high-level exchanges and communication at various levels; to continue cooperation in such areas as anti-narcotics, law enforcement, repatriation of illegal immigrants, and tackling climate change; to hold in due course a theater commander-level video call between the two militaries and the second round of intergovernmental dialogue on AI, among other institutionalized arrangements; and to maintain communication on international and regional hotspots including the Middle East, Ukraine and the Korean Peninsula. These new outcomes will help the two sides remove interference, overcome obstacles, and move toward the San Francisco vision, and jointly promote a healthy, stable and sustainable China-U.S. relationship.- On the South China Sea, he said: -Developing alliances and partnerships is something up to the United States itself, but it should not use it to hurt China's interests. The Philippines should keep its word, and the United States should also do things that are conducive to regional peace and stability.- The final bit on China-US ties today is a report confirming that on September 7, the China-US commercial and trade working group will hold its second vice-ministerial meeting in Tianjin. Share Tracking People's Daily The General Office of the Party Central Committee has issued new regulations outlining how underperforming and unqualified Party members should be dealt with. The document is called -Measures for the Organizational Handling of Unqualified Party Members of the Communist Party of China- . The report on this says that the -formulation and implementation of these ‘Measures' are of great significance for implementing the strategy of comprehensively and strictly governing the Party, building a Party member team with firm beliefs, political reliability, reasonable structure, high quality, strict discipline, and outstanding performance, and continuously enhancing the Party's vitality and vigor.- 《》，，、、、、、，，. The Measures have 27 articles, mainly covering four aspects: The overall requirements, concepts, methods, and principles of organisational handling of such cadres The applicable situations for rectification within a specified time frame, persuasion to voluntarily withdraw from the Party, and expulsion are detailed, with detailed procedures and subsequent matters for handling The provisions for situations that can be exempted from handling, or where this can be done in a combined manner, and other policy requirements that should be grasped The work responsibilities, work disciplines, etc. for handling of such cases 《》27，4：、、；、，；、；、. If you are further interested, on Page 4, there's an interview with an official from the Central Organisation Department on these new regulations. The official informs that the draft measures were approved by the Politburo Standing Committee on May 21, 2024. I am only covering the question about the applicable circumstances under which someone gets taken to task for organizational handing under this document. The official says that the ‘Measures' discuss 15 scenarios for rectification within a specified time frame, persuasion to voluntarily withdraw from the Party, and expulsion. Persuasion to withdraw from the Party: This covers cases where individuals who threaten to quit the Party in order to achieve their personal goals and do not change after education; and those who have not changed after the rectification within the specified time frame. Expulsion: This mainly includes cases where one is lacking ideals and beliefs, wavering in political stance, being disloyal and dishonest to the Party, abandoning the Party's original aspiration and mission, and having lost the qualifications of a Party member; failure to participate in the Party's organisational activities for 6 consecutive months without justifiable reasons, or failure to pay Party dues, or failure to do the work assigned by the Party; suspension of Party membership due to loss of contact with the Party organisation, and no contact can be made after two years; and where a member, despite being persuaded to withdraw from the Party, insists on not leaving. At the same time, adhering to a practical approach and distinguishing between subjective and objective factors, the ‘Measures' specify situations where no handling is necessary: if the Party organisation to which the Party member belongs is not sound or weak and lax, and the organisational life is not normal, such that the Party member cannot normally participate in the organisational life and fulfil the obligations of the Party member; if the Party member is restricted by objective conditions and cannot temporarily complete the work assigned by the Party organisation, and cannot play a role in the short term or in a certain work, no punishment may be given. ：、《》，、，，《》、15。（1），、、；；，；、，、；6、2。（2），，；。（3），、，，，；，6，，；，2；、。，，，：、，、，，，，.

As of July 31, 2024, the number of enterprises related to energy-saving and environmental protection industries in China was close to 5 million, a year-on-year increase of 19.3%. Share Tracking People's Daily The Chinese government today issued a new White Paper, titled China's Energy Transition. My colleague Rakshith Shetty, who has been researching China's new energy policies, has provided me with a short summary of the key highlights from the document. The paper documents China's actions and achievements in transitioning to green and low-carbon energy over the past decade. It highlights that since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012, China's energy sector has entered a stage of high-quality development guided by President Xi Jinping's new energy security strategy. Below are key data and takeaways from the white paper: China's investment in energy transition reached USD 676 billion in 2023 Clean energy consumption increased from 15.5% in 2013 to 26.4% in 2023, while coal consumption dropped by 12.1 percentage points In 2023, clean energy accounted for 58.2% (1,700 GW) of the total installed power generation capacity (2,920 GW) and generated 39.7% (3,800 TWh) of the country's total electricity, up ~15 percentage points from 2013 Over the past decade, clean energy accounted for more than 50% of the increase in total electricity consumption China invested over RMB100 billion from the central budget to upgrade rural power grids, enabling nationwide electricity access by 2015 By 2023, clean energy heating in northern China approached 80%, and charging facilities for new energy vehicles increased from less than 100,000 in 2013 to almost 8.6 million Energy consumption per unit of GDP (energy intensity) decreased by more than 26% from 2013 to 2023 The number of coal-fired boilers and power plants decreased by more than 80% nationwide China collaborated with over 100 countries and regions on green energy projects In 2023, China's wind power and PV exports helped other countries reduce CO2 emissions by about 810 million tonnes The second chapter focuses on China's efforts to promote green energy consumption through energy conservation, efficiency improvements, and strengthening institutional constraints for carbon reduction. As part of its commitment to reducing energy intensity, China has introduced various energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies and industries. These initiatives have led to significant energy savings, equivalent to approximately 1.4 billion tonnes of standard coal, and a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of about 3 billion tonnes. To further support these efforts, China has established a comprehensive framework of standards and regulations. By the end of 2023, the country had released 335 national standards on energy consumption limits and product energy efficiency. Moreover, the energy conservation service industry has experienced rapid growth, with its total output value exceeding RMB 500 billion in 2023, a twofold increase compared to 2013. These developments demonstrate China's dedication to promoting sustainable energy consumption and reducing its carbon footprint. The third chapter emphasises the importance of accelerating the development of non-fossil energy sources to pursue eco-environmental progress, promote green and low-carbon economic and social development, and achieve peak carbon and carbon neutrality goals. The fourth chapter highlights China's efforts to implement an innovation-driven development strategy in the energy sector. China is improving top-level design and overall plans to establish innovation as a primary driver in energy technology. It adopts an open competition mechanism for selecting the best candidates to undertake key energy technology projects and a multi-team research mechanism for finding the best pathways and achieving optimal results. China is applying supercritical and ultra-supercritical power generation and deep peak-shaving technologies in the coal-fired power industry to raise its environmental and energy efficiency indicators to world-leading standards. The fifth chapter explains the modernisation of energy governance in China. The country has focused on building a unified national market, removing barriers within the energy market, and facilitating smooth and efficient market operations. The monopoly held by power grid enterprises in the purchase and sale of electricity has been largely eliminated, and energy prices are now determined primarily through market forces. China has strengthened the coordination of fiscal, taxation, investment, financing, and other macroeconomic policies, reinforced market regulation, and improved its public services to ensure both efficiency and fairness in its energy transition. The chapter also highlights how China has established a comprehensive legal framework to support its energy transition, comprising the Energy Conservation Law, the Renewable Energy Law, and other relevant laws and regulations Finally, the last chapter highlights China's contributions to the global energy transition through its own advancements.

Li Qiang eventually spoke. He said that population ageing will be a basic part of the Chinese national conditions for quite some time to come. It is necessary to understand this situation objectively and dialectically. It is necessary to attach great importance to the challenges brought by ageing, but also see that ageing contains new development opportunities, and the elderly population is also a valuable resource. It is necessary to act in accordance with the trends and take the initiative, enhance strategic foresight, and make forward-looking plans; combine coping with population aging with promoting economic and social development, strengthen service, financial and institutional guarantees, and cultivate new development momentum in actively coping with population ageing.- ，。。，，。、，、，，、，.

Launched on Aug. 21, the demo flight will exceed one month and encompass several high-plateau airports in Xizang, Sichuan, Qinghai, and Gansu. This move aims to fully demonstrate the adaptability of ARJ21 aircraft to high-plateau airports and high-plateau routes, of airport ground service equipment and of special flight procedures, so as to better and more comprehensively meet the requirements of high-altitude operation. Daocheng Yading Airport in Sichuan Province, located at 4,411 meters above sea level, is known as the world's highest-altitude civilian airport. In July 2020, the ARJ21 aircraft completed maximum take-off and landing altitude tests locally. These tests verified that the ARJ21 is capable of serving all high-plateau airports, and paved the way for airlines to use the aircraft along more high-altitude routes, according to the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, Ltd. (COMAC), its developer. Plateau airports refer to those airports with an altitude of more than 1,500 meters above sea level. They include high-plateau airports that exceed 2,438 meters above sea level.- Page 2: There are two reports on Shanghai and Guangdong holding events to mark the 120th birth anniversary of Deng Xiaoping.

Han writes that -A scientific fiscal and taxation system is the institutional guarantee for optimising resource allocation, maintaining market unity, promoting social equity, and realising long-term peace and stability of the country. Deepening the reform of the fiscal and taxation systems is of great significance to comprehensively promoting Chinese-style modernization with high-quality development- 、、、，. In the first section, Han largely talks about why fiscal and taxation system reform is needed. He argues: The fiscal and taxation system is an important basic system that affects the allocation of resources, and fiscal policy is an important tool for macro-control. We must adapt to the changes in the principal contradiction of our society, accelerate the improvement of fiscal and taxation systems and mechanisms that are conducive to high-quality development, address the prominent issues that hinder the establishment of a new development pattern and the promotion of high-quality development, stimulate the vitality of various business entities, shape new development momentum and advantages, and create social wealth and material foundation that match the modernization level of more than 1.4 billion people. ，。，，、，，，14. Finance is the foundation and important pillar of national governance, and the fiscal and taxation system is an important part of the high-level socialist market economic system. We must adapt to the requirements of advancing the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities, strengthen our foundations, leverage our advantages, address weaknesses, and bolster areas of deficiency. Focus on building a unified national market, improve the macroeconomic governance system, accelerate the enhancement of the tax system and fiscal mechanisms, and strengthen coordination with other reforms, fully implement the requirements of modern budget management, and better transform China's institutional advantages into national governance effectiveness. ，。，、，、，、，，，，. Deepening the reform of the fiscal and taxation system is an objective requirement for promoting Chinese-style modernization… At present, the urban-rural, regional development and income distribution gaps in China are still prominent. The per capita resource availability is low, and the ecological environment is under significant pressure, while the external environment for development is becoming increasingly severe. It is necessary to accelerate the improvement of the fiscal and taxation system and mechanism to promote shared development, expanding the ‘cake' while also dividing it better, promoting coordinated development between urban and rural areas, enhancing public welfare, and advancing common prosperity. Improve the fiscal and taxation policy system that supports green and low-carbon development, and promote the construction of a Beautiful China and harmonious coexistence between humans and nature. 。、，。，，、，。，----，，，。，、.

Politburo Meeting - China-Philippine Vessel Collision - Wang-Sullivan Meeting Preview - India Okays Chinese Investments	Hi folks, Instead of covering reports from the paper today — a lot of which I did not find interesting — I am highlighting some key stories over the past few days. First, there was a Politburo meeting on Friday. This was covered in the paper on Saturday. Xinhua has a detailed report on this. It says: The meeting reviewed -policies and measures to open up a new vista in the large-scale development of China's western region.- The report adds that -some other issues- were also discussed at the meeting. Share Tracking People's Daily Second, there's a preview of the upcoming visit by Jake Sullivan from August 27 to 29. The briefing provided by MoFA outlines the following points: -Since the Xi-Biden meeting in San Francisco in November 2022, -Director Wang Yi and NSA Sullivan have held three rounds of strategic communication in Vienna, Malta and Bangkok respectively, all of which were substantive and constructive, and produced good results. Both sides agreed to continue making good use of this channel of strategic communication. The upcoming visit will also be the first visit to China by a National Security Advisor to the U.S. President after eight years, and the first visit to China by NSA Sullivan.- The official adds: On the Ukraine war, the official said: -The United States should stop abusing unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction, and stop smearing, framing, pressuring and blackmailing China. China will continue to take strong and resolute measures to safeguard its major interests and legitimate rights.- On the South China Sea, the official said: -China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the region have sufficient historical and legal basis, and that countries in the region have full confidence, wisdom and capability to properly handle the issue. Countries outside the region should not do things that provoke confrontation or increase tensions.- On the Middle East issue, he called for the US to adopt a -responsible position-. The official ended by saying that -China does not follow the old path of Western colonization and plundering, nor the wrong path of seeking hegemony with growing strength. Nor does it seek to export its ideology. China is committed to peaceful development and win-win cooperation, and is a firm defender of the U.N.-Centered international system and international order-. Let's also look at the press briefing by the White House before the visit. Some key points: Each time the two (Sullivan and Wang) have met, they have typically spent about 10 to 12 hours over two days covering bilateral issues, global regional issues, and cross-Strait issues. We expect to follow the same format in Beijing next week…As I mentioned earlier, I expect these meetings will cover roughly the same format as we have in previous rounds, discussing key issues in the U.S.-China bilateral relationship and advancing counternarcotics cooperation, military-to-military communication, and AI safety and risk discussions — all outcomes of the Woodside summit. I expect we will also spend some time on areas of difference, as we always do. Mr. Sullivan will raise U.S. concerns about China's support for Russia's defense industrial base, the South China Sea, and various other issues. I expect the two will also exchange views on other global issues, like DPRK, Middle East, and Burma. And I expect they will also discuss cross-Strait issues.- The official talked about pressing Beijing on theater command-level communications and -ensuring the resilience- of military-to-military communications. On counternarcotics, the official said that -we've seen some good action in that space over the last couple of months, including the scheduling for the first time in quite some time of three fentanyl precursors.

Xi Defines Deng's Legacy - Li Qiang's Belarus Visit - China-Bhutan Boundary Talks - Guideline on Improving Market Access System - The Curious Case of ...	Page 1: Today's front page is largely dedicated to a report on Xi Jinping's remarks at the event marking Deng Xiaoping's 120th birth anniversary. Xi said that Deng was -an outstanding leader with high prestige, who was recognized by the entire Party, the military, and the people of all ethnic groups across the nation. Deng was a great Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary, statesman, military strategist, and diplomat. He was a time-tested communist fighter, the core of the Party's second generation central leadership, the chief architect of China's socialist reform and opening up and modernization construction, the pioneer of the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the primary founder of Deng Xiaoping Theory, and a great internationalist who made significant contributions to world peace and development. His outstanding contributions to the Party, the people, the country, the nation, and the world have left an indelible mark in history, inspiring future generations.- ，，，、、、，，，，，，。、、、、，、. The report adds that in his speech, Xi lauded the -outstanding contributions to the cause of national independence and people's liberation led by the Party and the establishment of New China, and carried out fruitful work for the establishment of the socialist system and socialist development. After the end of the ‘Cultural Revolution', as the core of the Party's second-generation central leadership, he led the Party and the people in achieving a great historical turning point, promoted a new leap in the sinicization of Marxism, opened up a new phase of socialist modernization, established the correct path for achieving the complete reunification of the motherland, firmly defended the glorious banner of socialism, and successfully pioneered socialism with Chinese characteristics.- ，，、、。、，。--，，，，，，，. ‘Xi Jinping emphasised that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's historical achievements are comprehensive and pioneering, and their impact on China and the world is profound and long-term. His lifelong struggle fully demonstrated a lofty character of unshakable faith in the ideals of communism and socialism with Chinese characteristics, his great love for the people, his theoretical quality of always adhering to seeking truth from facts, his political courage to constantly pioneering and innovating, his far-sighted strategic thinking, and his broad-minded and selfless character. We will always remember his great historical achievements, and we will forever admire his noble revolutionary spirit.- ，、，、。，、、、、、。，；，. -Xi Jinping emphasised that China is a strong force for maintaining world peace. We must always uphold the banner of peace, development, cooperation, and mutual benefit, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. We should champion the common values of all humanity, implement the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative, actively participate in the reform and construction of the global governance system, and continuously offer new opportunities to the world through the new progress of Chinese-style modernization.- ，。、、、，，，、、，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Cai Qi then spoke, praising Xi's speech about Deng. He termed it -insightful and profound, with strong political, ideological and guiding significance-, while calling on everyone to study it. Among the others who spoke at the event were: Qu Qingshan, head of the Institute of Party History and Literature of the CPC Central Committee. Miao Hua, member of the CMC and Director of the Political Work Department of the CMC Wang Xiaohui, Party Secretary of Sichuan Province The full text of Xi's speech is available on Page 2. There is a lot of history that Xi covers in the speech. I am sharing below some key excerpts along with my takeaway:- -In the spring and summer of 1989, amid the backdrop of the Soviet Union's dissolution and dramatic changes in Eastern Europe, China experienced a severe political turmoil. At this critical moment, Comrade Deng Xiaoping led the Party and the people in firmly opposing the chaos, resolutely defending the socialist state power, and ensuring that the Party and the country withstood a severe test of turbulent storms. Subsequently, he deeply reflected on the lessons learned during the process of reform and opening up, emphasising the need to focus on strengthening Party building, enhancing ideological and political work and education on fine traditions, improve the Party's leadership level and governing ability, and ensure the stability of the red country.- 。，。、，1989。，，，。，，，，，. Subscribe now Also check out this paragraph from Xi's speech: In the new era and on the new journey, we must continue to deeply study and apply Deng Xiaoping Theory, fully and accurately understanding its scientific essence and core essence. For example, Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphasized that the Party's basic line should guide us for a hundred years, and that it is necessary to unify around adhering to the economic construction as the center, adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, and adhere to reform and opening up throughout the entire process of socialist modernization. Emancipating the mind means seeking truth from facts, aligning thoughts with reality, and ensuring that the subjective conforms to the objective. Both planning and markets are economic tools. As long as they contribute to the development of productive forces, they can be utilized. We must uphold independence and self-reliance; at the same time cannot close the door and be isolated or be blindly xenophobic/anti-foreign influence. Instead, we must implement opening up to the outside world. It is necessary to encourage some regions and individuals to become rich and prosperous first; let those who become rich first help others to become rich later, ultimately realizing common prosperity for all, without permitting polarization. We must adhere to the dual focus on material and spiritual civilization, ensuring both are strengthened. We should take bold and steady steps in pursuing reform, carefully managing the relationship between reform, development, and stability, with stability being the top priority. The key to successfully managing China's affairs lies in the Party, which must simultaneously promote reform and opening up while fighting corruption. These important thoughts and assessments are filled with materialist dialectics, reflecting a broad perspective and strategic vision. They grasp the main contradictions and key aspects of issues, highlighting the distinctive style and unique appeal of Deng Xiaoping Theory. Only by understanding these important ideas and conclusions within the historical background, focusing on an overall and dialectical understanding, knowing both the meaning and the reasoning behind it, understanding not only what is true but also why it is true, can one correctly apply them to guide practice. If we focus on one aspect at the expense of another or place too much emphasis on one while neglecting others, it can lead to deviations in practice, or even to principled and directional errors (、). Our Party has experienced such lessons in history, and we must learn from them deeply.- ，，、、。，，，、、；，，；，、，、；、，，，、；，，；、，、，；、，，，；、；、，、、，；，，。，，，。，，、，，，。、，，、。，。 Finally, I'd like to highlight the paragraph on common prosperity.

The accident left Hu severely injured, with an open comminuted fracture of the right patella. Following a disagreement on compensation, Hu sued Mo and the delivery company. Hu Ziyuan, a judge of the Huangpu District People's Court of Guangzhou, assessed that the focus of the dispute is whether Mo was performing his duties when he was driving the electric vehicle at the time of the accident. If it is determined that the damage was caused in the course of Mo performing his duties, his employer shall bear the liability for compensation. The delivery company argued that Mo's last order was delivered at 12:06 pm. After this order was completed, he had no new order or delivery records on that day. Therefore, technically, this accident occurred during Mo's personal time, outside the scope of his duties, and therefore, it is unrelated to the company.	https://trackingpeoplesdaily.substack.com/p/xi-defines-dengs-legacy-li-qiangs	2024-08-22T23:16:15-07:00

This is the core of the modern central bank system. We will gradually reduce the focus on quantitative targets, pay more attention to the role of price-based regulatory tools, such as interest rates, enrich the monetary policy toolbox, improve the policy communication mechanism, and increase the transparency of monetary policy. Second, to strengthen the macro-prudential policy framework and the systemic financial risk prevention and disposal mechanism, and maintain the bottom line of preventing systemic financial risks. This is the pillar of the central bank's role in maintaining financial security and stability. Third, improve the financial market and financial market infrastructure system and deepen the structural reform on the supply side of finance. We will strengthen the construction of financial market systems, focus on building a standardised, transparent, open, dynamic and resilient financial market, and build an independent, controllable, safe and efficient financial market infrastructure system, which is the basis for the central bank to perform its macroeconomic regulation duties. Fourth, to build a new open financial system at a higher level, steadily and prudently promote the internationalization of the RMB, and actively participate in global economic and financial governance and cooperation.

The second question is: -How will monetary policy better support economic recovery and high-quality economic and social development?- Going ahead, the PBOC will thoroughly implement the decisions and arrangements of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. The prudent monetary policy will be more flexible, moderate, precise, and effective. The intensity of regulation and control will be increased The implementation of the financial policy measures that have been issued shall be accelerated We shall maintain reasonably ample liquidity, guide reasonable growth in monetary credit, and promote a steady decline in corporate financing and household credit costs We shall maintain the RMB exchange rate basically stable at a reasonable and balanced level We will enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy in promoting economic structural adjustments, transformation and upgrading, and the conversion of new and old growth drivers.

China-Fiji Ties - Xi's Messages on Reform Implementation - Former Greek FM on China's Democracy	Page 1: Before I get to the contents of the page, for those watching, Xi Jinping is back in public today, meeting with visiting Vietnam leader To Lam. Now, the top report today is about the publication of a new collection of documents, spanning a period from the 20th Party Congress in October 2022 till the second session of the 14th NPC in March 2024. Out of the total 75 pieces published, 33 are by Xi Jinping and 18 by other leaders. 19 of the pieces are being published for the first time The report says that this compilation serves as an -important textbook for the entire Party to deeply study and implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and the major policies and guidelines of the Party Central Committee-. Key contents of the book are highlighted on Page 2. Next, there's a report on Li Qiang meeting with visiting Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka. Xinhua says: He added that -the vision of ‘Sea of Peace' aligns with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by China, sharing the same ideals and goals.- --、... Subscribe now Next, there's an article talking about the third plenum resolution. This is interesting in the context of the praise that it heaps on Xi Jinping, insisting that the document has his imprimatur, and discusses implementation. The article tells us about how Xi has always proceeded with the spirit of nailing nails, and taken decisive action amid policy arguments around reforms related to deep-rooted challenges. Then we get this nugget about time. Also this bit about the spirit of nailing nails: To hammer in nails, the first thing is to fully understand the spirit of reform. ‘We must guard against empty reform slogans, prevent simple forwarding and copying of central documents, and avoid mechanical inspections and evaluations.' Rectifying formalism and reducing burdens on grassroots levels means tackling these stubborn issues. General Secretary Xi Jinping once noted the phenomenon of ‘overnight transmission,' but thorough study and understanding inevitably takes time. How can it be accomplished in one go, mistaking rapid transmission for effective implementation? A careful reading of the Decision shows that every reform measure is rooted in the profound Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. This is the source of understanding the spirit of reform.- ？《》《》。，--，--、、；----，-，-；-，-，-，-。，。-，，。-、，。--，，，？《》，，。. Later the piece talks about precision in methods, i.e., that steps taken should adapt to local conditions, and it talks about innovation. Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, on the front page, is a report on the passing of Zhou Guangzhao, a renowned physicist and former president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He was 95. As per China Daily, Zhou was a -pivotal figure in China's nuclear weapons program- He was -honored with the prestigious ‘Two Bombs, One Satellite' Meritorious Service Medal in 1999. Zhou made significant contributions to theoretical physics, including his discovery in 1960 of the partial conservation of axial current — one of the most important contributions to particle physics and the key to understanding the interactions of fundamental particles known as pions. His work was also instrumental in the research and development of China's first atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb and other nuclear weapons.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: There's an article by Georgios Katrougalos, former foreign minister of Greece, talking about China's -whole-process people's democracy-. He writes that: -Democracy is a common value of all mankind and a common pursuit of people of all countries. There is no single model for achieving democracy that is applicable to all countries.- ，。. China's whole-process people's democracy integrates democracy into all domains, aspects and links of the country's political life. Survey results in recent years show that the Chinese people have maintained a high level of satisfaction with their political system and government performance, which shows the success of China's relevant policies. 、、。，，。 It is very important to fully apply the results of technological advancement to promote the development of democracy. The development of technologies such as the Internet, big data, and AI has enriched democratic practices, providing the government with more convenient ways to listen to the voice of the people. Reality also shows that without effective regulation, digital technologies can pose a threat to democratic development. China has a clear understanding of this and has introduced a series of laws and regulations, including the Cybersecurity Law, the Data Security Law, and the Personal Information Protection Law. 。、、，。，，。，、、. -The spirit of democracy also requires respect for the sovereignty, independence and equality of all countries, and ensuring that all countries participate equally in global decision-making. At present, the climate crisis, regional conflicts, and growing inequality between countries are hindering global development and affecting the global democratic cause.- In this context, he praises GDI, GSI and GCI as -important for promoting democracy.- 、，。，、、，。、、，，，、，.
