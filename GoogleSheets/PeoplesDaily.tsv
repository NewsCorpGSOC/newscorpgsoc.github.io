Xi's Global South Pitch at BRICS+ Meeting - Wang Huning Visits Xinjiang - Aligning People’s Congresses with Party Agenda - China's Diplomatic Push at ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, October 25, 2024. Page 1: The main story today is drawn from Xi Jinping's remarks at the BRICS+ dialogue that took place in Kazan, Russia, on Thursday. The full text of Xi's remarks is on Page 2 and available in English. Xi stressed the significance of the rise of the Global South. But he added that -peace and development still faces severe challenges, and the road to prosperity for the Global South will not be straight.- He then added: We should uphold peace and strive for common security. We should come forward together to form a stabilizing force for peace. We should strengthen global security governance, and explore solutions to address both symptoms and roots of hotspot issues. Many parties have warmly responded to my Global Security Initiative. Under the Initiative, we have made prominent progress in maintaining regional stability and in many other areas. China and Brazil jointly issued the six-point consensus, and launched the group of Friends for Peace on the Ukraine crisis together with other Global South countries. We should promote early deescalation to pave the way for political settlement. Last July, Palestinian factions reconciled with each other in Beijing, marking a key step toward peace in the Middle East. We should continue to promote comprehensive ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and revive the two-State solution. We must stop the flames of war from spreading in Lebanon and end the miserable sufferings in Palestine and Lebanon. We should reinvigorate development and strive for common prosperity. The Global South emerges for development and prospers through development. We should make ourselves the main driving force for common development. We should play an active and leading role in the global economic governance reform, and make development the core of international economic and trade agenda. Since its introduction three years ago, the Global Development Initiative has helped make available nearly US$20 billion of development fund and launch more than 1,100 projects. And recently the Global Alliance on Artificial Intelligence for Industry and Manufacturing Center of Excellence has been established in Shanghai. China will also build a World Smart Customs Community Portal and a BRICS Customs Center of Excellence. We welcome active participation by all countries. We should promote together development of all civilizations and strive for harmony among them. Diversity of civilization is the innate quality of the world. We should be advocates for exchanges among civilizations. We should enhance communication and dialogue, and support each other in taking the path to modernization suited to our respective national conditions. The Global Civilization Initiative I proposed is exactly for the purpose of building a garden of world civilizations in which we can share and admire the beauty of each civilization. China will coordinate with others to form a Global South Think Tanks Alliance to promote people-to-people exchanges and experience-sharing in governance. Xi ended by saying that -we support more Global South countries in joining the cause of BRICS as full members, partner countries or in the ‘BRICS Plus' format…- Share Tracking People's Daily Moving on, there's a report on Wang Huning visiting Hotan and Kashgar in Xinjiang from October 21 to 24. It says: Wang said that -we must adhere to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, thoroughly implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, fully and accurately implement the Party's strategy for the governance of Xinjiang in the new era, adhere to the main line of building a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation, and better build a beautiful Xinjiang in the process of Chinese-style modernization.- ，，，，，. Wang visited schools, hospitals, villages and the homes of people belonging to ethnic minority groups. He said that: -Efforts to promote ethnic unity should be implemented in grassroots governance, school education, and aspects of people's daily lives. The awareness of the Chinese nation as a community should be instilled in the hearts of children from an early age, so as to promote all ethnic groups to hold together like pomegranate seeds.- When visiting an economic and technological development zone and related enterprises in Hotan, Wang said that -it is necessary to build a modern industrial system with the characteristics and advantages of southern Xinjiang, cultivate a group of enterprises with long industrial chains and strong driving capabilities, support the improvement of people's livelihood, and enhance the vitality of development.- ，、、，，。，，，、，，. Support for higher education, opening up, protection and utilisation of historical relics and sites were among other key aspects that he talked about. The report adds: -During the investigation, Wang Huning said that the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Party Committee has thoroughly implemented the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches on Xinjiang work, further consolidating the good situation of Xinjiang's overall social stability and the good situation of people living and working in peace. To do a good job in Xinjiang, it is necessary to always put the maintenance of social stability in the first place/as the priority, ensuring long-term stability in the overall situation in the region. It is necessary to do a solid job in ethnic and religious work, carry out cultural enrichment in Xinjiang, and guide people of all ethnic groups to forge a strong sense of community of the Chinese nation, strengthening the ‘five identifications'. We must promote Xinjiang to embark on the track of high-quality development and consolidate the material foundation for Xinjiang's social stability and long-term peace and stability. The spirit of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps should be promoted, with deeper integration of civilian and military development, forming new advantages in stabilising and defending the border in the new era.- ，，，、。，，。，，、--。，。，，.

Zhao stressed the importance of -upholding, improving and running the system of people's congresses at a new historical starting point.- Zhao visited Dandong, Dalian and Shenyang, carrying out extensive research at the offices of the local people's congress standing committees, while also presiding over symposiums. -He stressed that studying and implementing the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech (on the work of people's congresses at the 70th anniversary of the NPC's founding) is a compulsory course and basic skill for people's congresses at all levels to do their jobs well. It should be combined with studying the General Secretary's series of important expositions and important instructions on the people's congress system and the work of people's congresses, so as to fully grasp the development context, core essence and rich connotation of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important thoughts on upholding and improving the people's congress system, and always adhere to the correct political direction in the work of the people's congresses.- ，，、、，、、、，. -Zhao Leji pointed out that the people's congresses should leverage the significant political advantages of the people's congress system in practice, adhere to the organic unity of the Party's leadership, the people's mastery of the country, and the rule of law, ensure that the Party's propositions become the will of the state and the people's common actions through legal procedures, and ensure that the Party's theories, lines, policies, and decision-making arrangements are fully implemented in national work.

Xinhua English summarises the last paragraph well: -Zhao also took the time to visit legislation outreach and community deputy liaison offices, enterprises, villages and rural households. During these visits, he engaged in profound exchanges with both deputies to the people's congresses and local residents. In the course of such interactions, he pointed out that people's congresses should consciously practice whole-process people's democracy, establish sound mechanisms for gathering public opinion and wisdom, and ensure the effective performance of deputies' responsibilities in accordance with the law.- Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on Li Qiang's investigation and research tour in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region from Tuesday to Thursday. Xinhua reports that Li -called for concrete efforts to facilitate the progress of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program (TSFP) and ensure the supply of energy-. The report covers Li's remarks on dealing with desertification, soil and water conservation management, forest belt construction and dairy technology innovation, as well as ecological, grass and seed research, and research on the promotion of improved varieties. They key point from my perspective are these: In Ningxia, Li -called for continuous energy technology research, and the promotion of the on-site deep processing of coal resources. He said that policy guidance and support should be enhanced and efforts be made to make good use of building facades, particularly rooftop spaces, to release the development potential of new energy, such as photovoltaic power.- In Inner Mongolia, he called to -put the development of new energy and clean energy in a more prominent position, and promote the complementary and deep integration of traditional energy and new energy. It is necessary to vigorously promote the clean and efficient use of coal, further improve the efficiency of power generation and heating, and ensure that the people can spend the winter in warmth.- He also stressed the need to -forge a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation.- Subscribe now Page 2: There's a report on State Councilor and Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong meeting with Italian Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi in Beijing. Xinhua says: -Wang noted that China stands ready to deepen practical cooperation with Italy in areas such as drug control and cracking down on telecom fraud and transnational organized crime, to effectively protect each other's national security interests and promote bilateral relations to a higher level. Piantedosi said Italy is willing to enhance law-enforcement and security cooperation with China to jointly address security issues.- Also on the page are reports of three CPC delegations visiting Laos, Thailand and Ethiopia. The delegation to Thailand was led by Chen Gang, a member of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the CPC Qinghai Provincial Committee. Xinhua reports that it met with Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy Pirapan Salirathavibhaga, Deputy Pheu Thai Party leader Chusak Sirinil and other leaders of political parties. The delegation to Laos was led by Qu Qingshan, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and director of the Institute of Party History and Literature of the CPC Central Committee. Xinhua reports that Qu met with Bounthong Chitmany, a politburo member of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP) Central Committee, a permanent member of the Secretariat of the LPRP Central Committee, and vice president of Laos. Qu also met with Kikeo Khaykhamphithoune, a member of the Political Bureau of the LPRP Central Committee and deputy prime minister of Laos, and Khamphanh Pheuyavong, a member of the Secretariat of the LPRP Central Committee and head of the Propaganda and Training Board of the LPRP Central Committee. The delegation to Ethiopia was led by Vice Minister of Education Wu Yan. He met with Adem Farah, Vice President and General Secretary of the Prosperity Party (PP) of Ethiopia, and Minister of Labor and Skills Muferihat Kamil, among others. If you are interested, here's a related Xinhua report with details of an event that took place. Subscribe now Page 15: There's a long article detailing China's diplomacy at the 57th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council. The report says that the Chinese viewpoint was that the country -has embarked on a human rights development path that suits its national conditions, is supported by the people, and conforms to the trend of the times.- Chen Xu, head of the Chinese delegation to the 57th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council and China's permanent representative to the United Nations Office in Geneva, highlighted the significance of the Decision following the Third Plenum. He said that -China will further deepen reforms in an all-round way, promote Chinese-style modernization, enhance the well-being of all people, and strengthen human rights law enforcement and judicial protection.- The report adds: -On September 18, the Chinese representative spoke to publicise China's achievements in human rights development, pointing out that China has built a comprehensively moderately prosperous society as scheduled, and has historically solved the problem of absolute poverty; it has continuously developed whole-process people's democracy, promoted the legal protection of human rights, and promoted the people to enjoy more extensive, substantial and comprehensive democratic rights; it has continuously improved the levels of employment, education, social security, and the quality of living environment. At present, China is promoting Chinese-style modernization and will continue to improve the level of human rights protection with the achievements of modernization construction.- 918，，，；，，、、；、、，。，. The next segment is useful to recap in entirety: -China advocates respecting each country's right to independently choose its path to human rights development and opposes using human rights as a pretext to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries or hinder their development. In the face of baseless attacks and false accusations, the Chinese delegation resolutely defended its position during the meeting, clearing up the confusion and reaffirming its stance. On September 24, in response to the United States and some other countries attacking and smearing China's human rights situation at the meeting, more than 100 countries supported China's just position and opposed the politicisation of human rights issues in different ways, such as joint and individual statements. Cuba, speaking on behalf of nearly 80 countries, including China, emphasized that respecting national sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, and non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states, are fundamental principles of international relations. Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Tibet are internal affairs of China, and the politicization of human rights issues and the application of double standards should be opposed, as well as using human rights as a pretext to interfere in other countries' internal affairs. All parties should adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, follow the principles of universality, fairness, objectivity, and non-selectivity, and respect the right of all peoples to choose their own development paths based on their national conditions. Uganda, on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, Venezuela, on behalf of the Group of Friends in Defence of the UN Charter, and Gambia, on behalf of the African Group, spoke in support of China's position, pointing out that all parties should objectively view the human rights situation in other countries, conduct dialogue and cooperation on human rights issues on the basis of equality and mutual respect, avoid selective and double standards, and jointly resist the wrong practice of politicising, instrumentalizing and weaponizing human rights issues. Chen Xu, representing the ‘Group of Friends in Promoting Human Rights through Dialogue and Cooperation', made a joint statement, noting that the politicisation and polarisation of the Human Rights Council is intensifying. The Human Rights Council should not be a venue for confrontation and pressure but should play its proper role in building trust and promoting cooperation through dialogue and exchanges between countries.- ，、。，、。924，，100、，，。80，、，。、、，，。，、、，。、--、，，，，、、。--，。，、. Share Tracking People's Daily Some other key points: On October 2, the Chinese representative called for the effective protection of the legitimate rights and interests of the Palestinian people… Li Xiaomei, deputy head of the Chinese delegation to the 57th session of the UNHRC, urged the United States and other Western countries to immediately lift illegal unilateral sanctions against China during an interactive dialogue with the Council's Special Rapporteur on Unilateral Coercive Measures. Li said that unilateral sanctions seriously violate the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, seriously violate the basic norms of international relations, and seriously infringe on human rights. China has always firmly opposed them. The United States has a poor human rights record, but it often abuses ‘long-arm jurisdiction' based on domestic law, completely violating human rights in the name of democracy and human rights. ，。，，，，。，--，、.

BRICS Summit Special: Examining Leaders' Remarks & the Kazan Declaration	I'll limit this edition to the BRICS summit-related engagements. This anyway dominates the paper today too. At least, I found little else interesting in the paper today. So here goes. The top story on the front page today is based on Xi Jinping's speech at the BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia. The speech has been published on Page 2; full English version is available here. Key points: -At this summit, we have decided to invite many countries to become partner countries, which is another major progress in the development of BRICS…We must make full use of this summit, maintain the momentum of BRICS, and consider and devise our strategy to address issues that have a global impact, determine our future direction, and possess strategic significance. We must build on this milestone summit to set off anew and forge ahead with one heart and one mind.- -We must work together to build BRICS into a primary channel for strengthening solidarity and cooperation among Global South nations and a vanguard for advancing global governance reform.- Then Xi made a five-point proposal of building a: : Peaceful BRICS; : Innovative BRICS; : Green BRICS; : Fair BRICS; and : Humanistic BRICS -We should build a BRICS committed to peace, and we must all act as defenders of common security. We humans are an indivisible community of security. Only by embracing the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security can we pave the way for universal security. The Ukraine crisis still persists. China and Brazil, in collaboration with other countries from the Global South, initiated a group of Friends for Peace to address the crisis. The aim is to gather more voices advocating peace. We must uphold the three key principles: no expansion of the battlefields, no escalation of hostilities, and no fanning flames, and strive for swift de-escalation of the situation. While the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate, the flames of war have once again been rekindled in Lebanon, and conflicts are escalating among the parties. We must promote an immediate ceasefire and an end to the killing. We must make unremitting efforts toward a comprehensive, just and lasting resolution of the Palestinian question.- -We should build a BRICS committed to innovation…China has recently launched a China-BRICS Artificial Intelligence Development and Cooperation Center. We are ready to deepen cooperation on innovation with all BRICS countries to unleash the dividends of AI development. China will establish a BRICS Deep-Sea Resources International Research Center, a China Center for Cooperation on Development of Special Economic Zones in BRICS Countries, a China Center for BRICS Industrial Competencies, and a BRICS Digital Ecosystem Cooperation Network.- We should build a BRICS committed to green development…China's high-quality production capacity, as exemplified by its manufacturing of electric vehicles, lithium batteries and photovoltaic products, provides a significant boost to global green development. China is willing to leverage its strengths to expand cooperation with BRICS countries in green industries, clean energy and green mining, and promote green development through the entire industrial chain, so as to increase the ‘green quotient' of our cooperation and upgrade the quality of our development. -We should build a BRICS committed to justice, and we must all act as forerunners in reforming global governance. The international power dynamics is undergoing profound changes, but global governance reform has lagged behind for a long time. We should champion true multilateralism and adhere to the vision of global governance characterized by extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits. We must ensure that global governance reform is guided by the principles of fairness, justice, openness and inclusiveness. In light of the rise of the Global South, we should respond favorably to the calls from various countries to join BRICS. We should advance the process of expanding BRICS membership and establishing a partner country mechanism, and enhance the representation and voice of developing nations in global governance.- -The current developments make the reform of the international financial architecture all the more pressing. BRICS countries should play a leading role in the reform. We should deepen fiscal and financial cooperation, promote the connectivity of our financial infrastructure, and apply high standards of financial security. The New Development Bank should be expanded and strengthened. We must ensure that the international financial system more effectively reflects the changes in the global economic landscape.- We should build a BRICS committed to closer people-to-people exchanges…We should enhance the exchange of governance experiences among BRICS countries, and fully harness the untapped potential for cooperation in areas such as education, sports, and the arts so that our diverse cultures can inspire one another and illuminate the path forward for BRICS…China will implement a capacity-building program for BRICS digital education. We will open 10 learning centers in BRICS countries in the next five years, and provide training opportunities for 1,000 local education administrators, teachers and students… Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the front page are reports on Xi's meeting with the presidents of Iran and Egypt. The meeting with India's Narendra Modi is covered on Page 2. I covered this in detail in the edition yesterday. First, the report (English report) on Xi's meeting with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian says: -Iran, Xi said, is a country with important regional and international influence and a good friend and partner of China. The strategic significance of China-Iran relations has become more prominent as transformations of the world unseen in a century are unfolding at faster pace, he said. The Chinese side supports Iran in safeguarding national sovereignty, security and national dignity, steadily advancing its own economic and social development, and improving and deepening good-neighborly and friendly relations with neighboring countries, he added. The Chinese side, he said, stands ready to work with Iran to firmly support each other, uphold the basic norms governing international relations such as non-interference in internal affairs, and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the two countries, adding that his country is also willing to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with Iran in various fields, promote the sound and steady development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries, and better benefit the two peoples. Xi congratulated on and welcomed Iran's participation in the BRICS Summit for the first time as a full member, pointing out that China is willing to strengthen cooperation with Iran within BRICS and other multilateral frameworks, further volume up the influence and voice of the Global South, and push forward the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction.- -Xi pointed out that China is deeply concerned about the current situation in the Middle East, saying that an early ceasefire and end of war in Gaza are the key to easing regional tensions. The international community should work together to urge relevant parties to earnestly implement the UN Security Council resolutions and avoid further instability in the region, he added.- Among other things, Pezeshkian said -China is Iran's most important partner for cooperation.- He added that -Iran is also ready to work with China to continue firmly supporting each other on issues concerning their respective core interests and opposing hegemony and bullying.- Subscribe now The report (English report) on Xi's meeting with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi says that: -Xi pointed out that this year marks the China-Egypt year of partnership and the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries. China firmly supports Egypt in safeguarding its national sovereignty, security and development interests, he said. The two sides should continue to firmly support each other, consolidate political mutual trust, deepen practical cooperation, jointly build the Belt and Road with high quality, strengthen people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and push bilateral relations toward the goal of building a China-Egypt community with a shared future in the new era, Xi said. China is also willing to strengthen coordination with Egypt to promote the steady and long-term development of greater BRICS cooperation, further volume up the influence and voice of the Global South, and safeguard the common interests of developing countries, he added.- -The two sides exchanged views on the current situation in the Middle East. Xi pointed out that China is deeply worried about the current situation in the Middle East. Noting that wars and chaos in the region serve no one's interests and the Palestinian issue is the core of the Middle East issue, Xi said the pressing task now is to fully and effectively implement the UN Security Council's relevant resolutions and end the fighting in Gaza as soon as possible. Only by implementing the two-state solution can a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian issue be promoted at an early date, he said. China appreciates Egypt's efforts to promote a ceasefire and end of war, and stands ready to strengthen coordination and cooperation with Egypt to jointly push for an early end to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the easing of the regional situation, Xi added.- Share Tracking People's Daily At this point, let me go back to the BRICS Summit. There has been an agreement on partner countries, but I still don't have a list of these countries. In the meantime, let's look at what different leaders said and what the final declaration says. First, let me highlight the Indian Prime Minister's remarks at the Closed Plenary of the BRICS Summit: -We support dialogue and diplomacy, not war. And just as we were able to overcome a challenge like COVID together, we are certainly able to create new opportunities to ensure a secure , strong and prosperous future for future generations. In order to counter terrorism and terror financing, we need the single minded, firm support of all. There is no place for double standards on this serious matter. We need to take active steps to stop radicalization of youth in our countries. We must work together on the long pending matter in the UN of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism. The same way, we need to work on global regulations for cyber security and for safe and secure AI.- -India is ready to welcome new countries into BRICS as Partner Countries. In this regard all decisions should be taken by consensus, and the views of BRICS founding members should be respected. The Guiding principles, standards, criteria and procedures adopted during the Johannesburg summit, should be complied with by all members and partner countries.- -We must move forward in a time bound manner on reforms in global institutions such as the UN Security Council, Multilateral development banks, and the WTO. As we take our efforts forward in BRICS, we must be careful to ensure that this organisation does not acquire the image of one that is trying to replace global institutions, instead of being perceived as one that wishes to reform them.- One of the key points that he made at the open meeting was: -We welcome efforts to increase financial integration among BRICS countries. Trade in local currencies and smooth cross-border payments will strengthen our economic cooperation. The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) developed by India is a huge success story and has been adopted in many countries. Last year, together with His Highness Sheikh Mohamed, it was launched in the UAE as well. We can also cooperate with other BRICS countries in this area.- Share Tracking People's Daily The key points from Putin's remarks at the open meeting are as follows: He proposed -creating a new BRICS investment platform, which would become a powerful tool for supporting our national economies and would also provide financial resources to the countries of the Global South and East.creating a new BRICS investment platform, which would become a powerful tool for supporting our national economies and would also provide financial resources to the countries of the Global South and East.- -I would like to note that this year our association has managed to agree on a number of initiatives aimed at solving critically important common tasks. In particular, this concerns increasing the sustainability of supply chains and added value, countering protectionism, developing e-commerce, and establishing contacts through special economic zones. We believe that the launch of a special mechanism for consultations of BRICS countries on issues of the World Trade Organization will facilitate the development of a common position on the formation of fairer rules of the game in the global economy and the reform of the international financial system.- -We consider the initiatives on the BRICS partnership on carbon markets and the climate research platform to be promising.- It was proposed to open a BRICS grain exchange, which would facilitate the formation of fair and predictable price indicators for products and raw materials, taking into account their special role in ensuring food security. The implementation of this initiative will help protect national markets from negative external interference, speculation and attempts to cause artificial shortages of food products. Over time, one could also think about transforming the grain exchange into a full-fledged commodity exchange.- He talked about the importance of a joint energy research platform and a BRICS platform for precious metals, as well as for diamonds. -Russia has also put forward an initiative to establish a BRICS public health research network, which is designed to strengthen national health systems through the exchange of best practices. It is important to further strengthen the capacity of the BRICS vaccine center and tuberculosis research network.- -I would like to draw attention to the Russian proposal to create a BRICS alliance in the field of artificial intelligence. Its goal is to regulate artificial intelligence technologies, including to prevent their illegal use. In Russia, the business community has adopted a code of ethics in this area, which our BRICS partners and other countries can join.- Subscribe now Looking at the remarks of other leaders is also really useful. It helps understand the very diverse approaches and priorities of all the countries. As I had said in my comments to CNN recently, most of them are approaching the group pragmatically rather than ideologically. I am relying on machine translation of the comments available on the Russian presidential website. Egypt's Sisi talked about supporting multipolarity and basically added: -The world order suffers from many problems and crises, political crises that are aggravated by economic problems, leading to security problems, lack of financing for development goals, and rising costs of resources. Therefore, we in Egypt attach priority importance to taking significant steps to ensure financing for development goals in developing countries by creating reliable mechanisms and instruments to ensure sustainable development in developing countries.- He added: -Egypt confirms its readiness to strengthen interaction, coordination with the countries of the association on various international platforms, including in such areas as the climate agenda, strengthening, ensuring food security, digitalization, education and science. We are also committed to further work to ensure financial cooperation and the transition to national currencies, ensuring financial payments in national currencies, as well as interaction in the areas of digitalization, interaction with the BRICS Business Council and strengthening public-private partnership interaction based on the BRICS Interbank Cooperation Mechanism.- Brazil's Lula da Silva mentioned the Israel-Palestine and Russia-Ukraine conflicts. He also talked about climate change. A key point added was: -It is now necessary to create alternative monetary relations between our countries. We are not talking about replacing our internal money, but when we talk about a multipolar world, we must create a financial system, we must seriously discuss this topic. Technically, we cannot wait any longer – we must decide.- Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed stressed the importance of -intra-BRICS trade, investment and tourism-. Supported the proposal on AI. He added that -prompt consideration of applications for membership in BRICS and the New Development Bank will make it possible to create a system of alternative financing for infrastructure projects that are important for development.- He stressed the significance of -African representation in the UN Security Council-. Iran's Pezeshkian said that -the period of unilateralism, when prosperity and development can only be realized on the path determined by Western directions, is coming to an end. I can say that the result of such an approach of Western countries can only worsen the situation in all corners of the world. And with great regret, I must say that the Americans have contributed to the growth of conflicts, as well as wars throughout the world. This is the unleashing of various wars, various conflicts, and we understand very well what is happening right now in Lebanon and Palestine.- He added: -The efforts that have been made so far to reduce the dollar's dominance in the world economy must be strengthened and implemented through operational solutions, such as the creation of a BRICS currency basket or a new settlement mechanism independent of the dollar. Independent parties can no longer pay for the United States' misguided financial policies or ineffectiveness in combating organized corruption in its financial sector.- He talked about Palestine, and the importance of financing support for development projects. He added: -I think it is necessary to create an electronic platform for all BRICS members in order to facilitate mutual trade processes between these parties, as well as to reduce dependence on ‘world domination' in the sphere of trade. We need to think about how we can improve the system of mutual settlements based on national currencies. We are well aware that we should not depend on Western settlement systems any longer, this is a big threat to all countries. Maybe not today, but tomorrow.- South Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa said that -We look forward to hearing reports from our Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on the use of national currencies in international trade and financial transactions among the BRICS countries and their trading partners.- He added: -Emerging economies are heavily affected by the impacts of climate change. However, they bear the least blame for the current climate crisis. It is therefore imperative that industrialized countries meet their climate commitments to ensure a just and equitable transition. It is important that climate action does not exacerbate inequality or hold back the development of countries in the Global South.- And he said: -It is necessary to increase cooperation among BRICS countries by launching common development programs in the field of exports, industrial cooperation and technology exchange. We call for recalibration and modification of trade routes to ensure more sustainable industrialization. Reform of the World Trade Organization is also necessary. Cooperation among BRICS countries in the field of mineral resources and mineral sourcing needs to be considered. This is of great importance for development and achieving the goal of reducing the carbon footprint of our economies.- UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan was very brief. He avoided any overt political remarks. Insted, he highlighted the country's success in sectors such as technology, logistics, and the green economy. He added: -The UAE has invested in major renewable energy projects such as solar energy, wind energy, to use natural energy sources, natural resources more efficiently. This is part of our vision to achieve a more sustainable future, taking into account climate change.- Next, the NDB's Dilma Rousseff spoke. She said that the international situation was complex and was further -complicated by the fact that the dollar is used as a weapon to change the living conditions of the population, which also affects the international system, that is, trust [in it] and its integrity.- She further stated: -For 2024-2025, we planned to finance 39-40 projects in the field of infrastructure, transport, clean electricity, clean water, digital projects worth more than 10 billion dollars. To date, we have financed a total of 101 investment projects worth 35 billion dollars. The new development bank envisages and wants to focus on financing in national currencies. This is very important for us to increase our capacity for financing. This is our strategy. The target for 2022–2026 was to implement 30 percent of financing in national currencies. Today, we have reached 28.3 percent, so we are almost reaching our target of 30 percent.- Putin responded to her remarks by adding: -You said that the dollar is used as a weapon. Yes, indeed, we see that this is so. In fact, I think that this is a big mistake for those who do this, because using the dollar, which is still the most important instrument of world finance, as a means of achieving political goals undermines confidence in this currency and reduces its capabilities. But it is not us who do this, it is other people who do this. But we do not refuse, we do not fight the dollar. But if we are not allowed to work with it - what to do, then we are forced to look for other alternatives, which is what is happening. We, striving for cooperation, nevertheless, it seems to me, must understand that the longer we live and work by someone else's rules and on someone else's platforms, the longer this transition to a new and more just economic and financial system will last, and this may be accompanied by major upheavals, including those that we are seeing, in particular, in the Middle East. We will talk about this with our colleagues.- Subscribe now Let's now look at the Kazan Declaration. This is a very, very long document. So I am just going to highlight some key points: We welcome the considerable interest by countries of the Global South in BRICS and we endorse the Modalities of BRICS Partner Country Category. We strongly believe that extending the BRICS partnership with EMDCs will further contribute to strengthening the spirit of solidarity and true international cooperation for the benefit of all. We commit to further promoting BRICS institutional development. We reaffirm our support for the rules-based, open, transparent, fair, predictable, inclusive, equitable, non-discriminatory, consensus-based multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at its core, with special and differential treatment (S&amp;DT) for developing countries, including Least Developed Countries and reject the unilateral trade restrictive measures that are inconsistent with WTO rules. We welcome the outcomes of the 13th Ministerial Conference in Abu Dhabi (UAE) and reiterate our commitment to work towards the implementation of the decisions and declarations of WTO Ministerial Conferences. We note however there is still a need for further efforts in many outstanding issues. We emphasize the importance of reforming the WTO and strengthening the developmental dimension in its work. We commit to engage constructively within the WTO to attain the goal to deliver a fully and well-functioning two-tier binding WTO dispute settlement system by 2024 accessible to all, and the selection of new Appellate Body Members without further delay. We agree to enhance our dialogue on multilateral trading system and WTO-related issues and welcome the establishment of the BRICS Informal Consultative Framework on WTO issues. We reiterate the decision under the Strategy for BRICS Economic Partnership 2025 to take actions to support the necessary WTO reform to enhance the WTO's resilience, authority and efficacy, and promote development and inclusivity. We are deeply concerned about the disruptive effect of unlawful unilateral coercive measures, including illegal sanctions, on the world economy, international trade, and the achievement of the sustainable development goals. Such measures undermine the UN Charter, the multilateral trading system, the sustainable development and environmental agreements. They also negatively impact economic growth, energy, health and food security exacerbating poverty and environmental challenges. We reaffirm our commitment to maintaining a strong and effective Global Financial Safety Net with a quota-based and adequately resourced IMF at its center. We call for the reform of the Bretton Woods institutions, which includes increased representation of EMDCs in leadership positions to reflect the contribution of EMDCs to the global economy. We support a merit-based, inclusive and equitable selection process for the top positions at the Bretton Woods institutions, increased geographical representation and the role and share of women. We note the quota increase at the 16th General Review of Quotas (GRQ) and urge members to secure domestic approvals to make quota increase effective. We welcome the decision to create a 25th chair at the IMF Executive Board to enhance the voice and representation of Sub-Saharan Africa. We acknowledge the urgency and importance of realignment in quota shares to better reflect members' relative positions in the world economy, while protecting the quota shares of the EMDCs, in particular, the poorest members. We welcome the IMF Executive Board's ongoing work to develop by June 2025 possible approaches as a guide for further quota realignment, including through a new quota formula, under the 17th GRQ. The discussions should result in quota realignment that is fair and transparent, enhances the representation of underrepresented IMF members, and transfers quota share from advanced economies to EMDCs. We look forward to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) 2025 Shareholding Review. We reiterate that the objectives, principles and provisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), its Kyoto Protocol and its Paris Agreement, including its principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC) in the light of different national circumstances, must be honoured. We condemn unilateral measures introduced under the pretext of climate and environmental concerns and reiterate our commitment to enhancing coordination on these issues. We will strengthen cooperation on a whole range of solutions and technologies that contribute to the reduction and removal of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs). We also note the role of carbon sinks in absorbing GHGs and mitigating climate change, whilst also highlighting the importance of adaptation and stressing the need for the adequate provision of the means of implementation, namely financial resources, technology transfer and capacity building. We reiterate that the unilateral coercive measures, inter-alia in the form of unilateral economic sanctions and secondary sanctions that are contrary to international law, have far-reaching implications for the human rights, including the right to development, of the general population of targeted states, disproportionally affecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations. Therefore, we call for their elimination. Share Tracking People's Daily On the Middle East conflict, the statement says: -We reiterate our grave concern at the deterioration of the situation and humanitarian crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in particular the unprecedented escalation of violence in the Gaza Strip and in West Bank as a result of the Israeli military offensive, which led to mass killing and injury of civilians, forced displacement and widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure. We stress the urgent need for an immediate, comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and detainees from both sides who are being illegally held captive and the unhindered sustainable and at scale supply of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, and cessation of all aggressive actions. We denounce the Israeli attacks against humanitarian operations, facilities, personnel and distribution points. For this purpose, we call for the full implementation of resolutions 2712 (2023), 2720 (2024), 2728 (2024) and 2735 (2024) of the United Nations Security Council and in this regard welcome the continuous efforts by the Arab Republic of Egypt, the State of Qatar, other regional and international efforts in order to reach immediate ceasefire, accelerate the delivery of humanitarian aid and Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. We call for adherence to international law. We are also alarmed that the further escalation of the conflict in the Gaza Strip fuel tension, extremism and severe negative consequences both regionally and globally. We call on all relevant parties to act with utmost restraint and to avoid escalatory actions and provocative declarations. We acknowledge the provisional measures of the International Court of Justice in the legal proceedings instituted by South Africa against Israel. We reaffirm our support for the State of Palestine's full membership in the United Nations in the context of the unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-state solution based on international law including relevant UNSC and UNGA resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative that includes the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine in line with internationally recognised borders of June 1967 with East Jerusalem as its capital living side by side in peace and security with Israel.- We express alarm over the situation in Southern Lebanon. We condemn the loss of civilian lives and the immense damage to civilian infrastructure resulting from attacks by Israel in residential areas in Lebanon and call for immediate cessation of military acts. We stress the need to preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the State of Lebanon and to create conditions for political and diplomatic solution in order to safeguard peace and stability in the Middle East while underlining the importance of strict observance of UNSC resolutions 1701 (2006) and 2749 (2024). We strongly condemn attacks on UN personnel, threats to their safety and call upon Israel to immediately cease such activity. We express our concern over the increasing incidents of terrorist attacks linked with ICT capabilities. In this regard, we condemn the premeditated terrorist act of detonating handheld communication devices in Beirut on 17 September 2024, resulted in the loss of life and injury of dozens of civilians. We reiterate that these attacks constitute a grave violation of International Law. We stress the importance of ensuring the exercise of navigational rights and freedoms of vessels of all states in the Red Sea and Bab Al-Mandab Strait, in accordance with international law. We encourage enhanced diplomatic efforts by all parties to that end, including by addressing the causes of the conflict, and continued support for dialogue and Yemen's peace process under UN auspices. We stress that Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity must be strictly observed. We condemn illegal foreign military presence that lead to increasing risks of a large-scale conflict in the region. We emphasize that illegal unilateral sanctions seriously exacerbate the suffering of the Syrian people. We condemn the attack against the diplomatic premises of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the Syrian capital Damascus by Israel on 1 April 2024 that constitutes a violation of the fundamental principle of the inviolability of diplomatic and consular premises under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Share Tracking People's Daily On the war in Ukraine, all we have is this: -We recall national positions concerning the situation in and around Ukraine as expressed in the appropriate fora, including the UNSC and the UNGA. We emphasize that all states should act consistently with the Purposes and Principles of the UN Charter in their entirety and interrelation. We note with appreciation relevant proposals of mediation and good offices, aimed at a peaceful resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy.- Subscribe now Other security issues referenced are those in Sudan, Haiti, non-proliferation and disarmament, terrorism, prevention of an arms race in outer space, informatio and misinformation, corruption, drug production, trafficking and abuse, the situation in Afghanistan, etc. On Afghanistan, two points worth noting are: We urge for more visible and verifiable measures in Afghanistan to ensure that the territory of Afghanistan is not used by terrorists. We call on Afghanistan authorities to reverse the effective ban on girl's secondary and higher education. On development issues, the document says: We believe it is necessary to address the international debt properly and in a holistic manner to support economic recovery and sustainable development, taking into account each nation's laws and internal procedures, accompanied by sustainable external debt and fiscal prudence. We recognise the need to address in an effective, comprehensive and systematic manner the debt vulnerabilities of both low and middle income countries. One of the instruments, amongst others, to collectively address debt vulnerabilities is through predictable, orderly, timely and coordinated implementation of the G20 Common Framework for Debt Treatment with the participation of official bilateral creditors, private creditors and Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) in line with the principle of joint action and fair burden-sharing. We support the NDB in continuously expanding local currency financing and strengthening innovation in investment and financing tools. We encourage the Bank to follow member-led and demand-driven principles, the employment of innovative financing mechanisms to mobilize financing from diversified sources, and in this regard, we acknowledge the initiative to create new investment platform to leverage the existing institutional infrastructure of the NDB to boost the investment flow into the countries of BRICS and the Global South mechanisms. We support the enhancement of capacity building and knowledge exchange, including by building synergies with knowledge sources from developing countries, the assistance of member countries in achieving the SDGs and the further improvement of efficiency and effectiveness to fulfill its mandate, aiming to be a premier multilateral development institution for EMDCs. We agree to jointly develop the New Development Bank into a new type of MDB in the 21st century. We urge the Bank to execute its purpose and functions in accordance with the Articles of Agreement of the New Development Bank in a fair and non-discriminatory manner. We support the further expansion of NDB membership and expedited consideration of applications of BRICS countries in line with the NDB General Strategy and related policies. We reiterate our commitment to enhancing financial cooperation within BRICS. We recognise the widespread benefits of faster, low cost, more efficient, transparent, safe and inclusive cross-border payment instruments built upon the principle of minimizing trade barriers and non-discriminatory access. We welcome the use of local currencies in financial transactions between BRICS countries and their trading partners. We encourage strengthening of correspondent banking networks within BRICS and enabling settlements in local currencies in line with BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI), which is voluntary and non-binding, and look forward to further discussions in this area, including in the BRICS Payment Task Force. We agree to discuss and study the feasibility of establishment of an independent cross-border settlement and depositary infrastructure, BRICS Clear, an initiative to complement the existing financial market infrastructure, as well as BRICS independent reinsurance capacity, including BRICS (Re) Insurance Company, with participation on a voluntary basis. We reaffirm the need to develop a fair agricultural trading system and implement resilient and sustainable agriculture. We commit to minimize disruptions and promote rules-based trade in agriculture and fertilizers with the view to ensure a continuous flow of food and essential inputs for agricultural production which should be exempted from undue restrictive economic measures, inconsistent with WTO rules, including those affecting producers and exporters of agricultural products as well as business services with regard to international shipments. In this regard, we welcome the initiative of the Russian side to establish a grain (commodities) trading platform within BRICS (the BRICS Grain Exchange) and to subsequently develop it including expanding it to other agricultural sectors. We reject unilateral, punitive and discriminatory protectionist measures, that are not in line with international law, under the pretext of environmental concerns, such as unilateral and discriminatory carbon border adjustment mechanisms (CBAMs), due diligence requirements, taxes and other measures and reconfirm our full support for the call in COP28 related to avoidance of unilateral trade measures based on climate or environment. We also oppose unilateral protectionist measures, which deliberately disrupt the global supply and production chains and distort competition. We welcome the establishment of the Contact Group on Climate Change and Sustainable Development by BRICS Environment Ministers on 28 June 2024 in Nizhny Novgorod and the adoption of the Framework on Climate Change and Sustainable Development at the High-level Dialogue on Climate Change (30 August 2024, Moscow). We look forward to establishing the BRICS Climate Research Platform (BCRP) to enhance the scientific and expert exchange of views, knowledge and best practices of the grouping. There's a lot after this on health, tourism, disaster prevention, competition law and policy, customs and tax, IP cooperation, people-to-people exchanges, science, education, culture, etc. Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Breakdown of the Meeting between Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping	Hi folks, The main BRICS summit concluded earlier today in Kazan, Russia. I'll be coveringXi Jinping's engagement and the Kazan declaration in tomorrow's newsletter breaking down the People's Daily. Today, I am doing a special brief detailing Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with Xi Jinping in Kazan. My quick takeaway is that this meeting seems to have yielded positive outcomes. This is the first step on a long road to re-engaging, building trust and potential normalisation. A lot has to happen still; and a lot can impede this process still. In terms of the key developments, there is an agreement between the two sides to begin all-round dialogue, which is welcome. Xi Jinping's formulation of referring to India as a major country is noteworthy, particularly given the hierarchy of countries in Chinese official discourse. India generally tends to fall within the peripheral diplomacy category. More important, however, is his comment that -development is currently the ‘greatest common denominator' between China and India-. It is, of course, terribly early but this is a good sign. It provides a frame for arriving at some sort of a new balance in ties. Also positive is that there will be a meeting of the Special Representatives on the India-China boundary question sometime soon. The Indian side in its briefing has suggested that it expects further talks to deal with the issue of further easing in Eastern Ladakh, including de-escalation. But this doesn't seem to have been a part of the conversation, thus far. That said, there is a curious line in the Chinese readout that: Modi put forward ideas and suggestions on improving and developing bilateral relations, and Xi Jinping agreed in principle. One wonders what these were. Anyway, let's look at the readouts below: The Chinese readout after the meeting said: Xi Jinping pointed out that China and India are both ancient civilizations, major developing countries, and important members of the Global South. They are also both in a critical period of modernization in their respective countries. It is in the fundamental interests of the two countries and their peoples for China and India to correctly grasp the historical trend and the direction of development of bilateral relations. The two sides should strengthen communication and cooperation, enhance strategic mutual trust, and facilitate each other's pursuit of their development aspirations. Both sides should also shoulder international responsibilities, set an example of unity and self-reliance for the vast number of developing countries, and contribute to promoting world multipolarization and the democratization of international relations. ，、、，。，。，，。，，、. Xi Jinping emphasised that the essence of China-India relations is how two neighbouring developing major countries, each with over 1.4 billion people, should get along with each other. Development is currently the ‘greatest common denominator' between China and India. Both sides should continue to uphold important consensuses that India and China are ‘development opportunities for each other, and do not constitute threats to each other' (、) and are ‘cooperative partners rather than competitors/rivals (), and adhere to the correct strategic understanding, and and jointly seek the bright path of peaceful coexistence and common development between neighbouring major countries. ，14。--。-、-、--，，、. As per the Chinese readout, Modi said that under the current international situation, -India-China cooperation is conducive to promoting economic recovery and world multipolarization.- He added that -India is willing to strengthen strategic communication with China, enhance strategic mutual trust, and expand mutually beneficial cooperation. India is willing to fully support China's work as the rotating presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and strengthen communication and cooperation within multilateral frameworks such as BRICS.- ，，28，。，，。，，。，. The two leaders positively evaluated the significant progress made recently through intensive communication between both sides in resolving issues related to the border areas. Modi put forward ideas and suggestions on improving and developing bilateral relations, and Xi Jinping agreed in principle.- 。，. -The two sides agreed to give full play to the role of the meeting mechanism of the special representatives of the two countries on border issues, jointly maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas, and seek fair and reasonable solutions. The two sides agreed that the foreign ministers and officials at all levels of the two countries should conduct dialogues to push the bilateral relations back on the track of stable development as soon as possible. The two sides agreed to strengthen communication and cooperation at multilateral forums to safeguard the common interests of developing countries. The two sides believed that this meeting was constructive and of great significance, and agreed to view and handle China-India relations from a strategic height and long-term perspective, not to let specific differences affect the overall situation of bilateral relations, and make positive contributions to regional and world peace and prosperity and advance world multipolarization.- ，，，。，，。，，。，，，，、. The Indian readout after the meeting says: -Welcoming the recent agreement for complete disengagement and resolution of issues that arose in 2020 in the India-China border areas, Prime Minister Modi underscored the importance of properly handling differences and disputes and not allowing them to disturb peace and tranquility. The two leaders agreed that the Special Representatives on the India-China boundary question will meet at an early date to oversee the management of peace &amp; tranquility in border areas and to explore a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution to the boundary question. The relevant dialogue mechanisms at the level of Foreign Ministers and other officials will also be utilized to stabilize and rebuild bilateral relations. The two leaders affirmed that stable, predictable, and amicable bilateral relations between India and China, as two neighbors and the two largest nations on earth, will have a positive impact on regional and global peace and prosperity. It will also contribute to a multi-polar Asia and a multi-polar world. The leaders underlined the need to progress bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective, enhance strategic communication and explore cooperation to address developmental challenges.- India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri made the following points at the MEA's press briefing after the meeting. The two leaders welcomed the agreement reached by the two sides on the border issue. -Prime Minister Modi underscored the importance of not allowing differences on boundary related matters to disturb peace and tranquility on our borders,- said Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri. The two leaders -instructed the Special Representatives to meet at an early date.- -Both of them stressed that with maturity and wisdom and by showing mutual respect for each other's sensitivities, interests, concerns and aspirations, the two countries can have a peaceful, stable and beneficial bilateral relationship-. -As we have maintained over the last four years, the restoration of peace and tranquility in the border areas will create space in returning us towards the path of normalisation of bilateral relations. Officials will now take the next steps to discuss enhancing strategic communication and stabilising bilateral relations by utilising the relevant official bilateral dialogue mechanisms, including at the level of our respective foreign ministers.- They had a -very productive exchange- on BRICS. Misri added that Modi expressed -full support- for China's SCO presidency. In responding to questions about the impact of the meeting on the LAC and on confidence-building measures (CBMs): Misri said that: -it is certainly our expectation that as a result of not only the agreement that was arrived at just a couple of days ago between Indian and Chinese diplomatic and military negotiators but also as a result of the endorsement of that agreement at the highest leader level possible between the two countries as happened in the meeting today where both PM Modi and President Xi Jinping welcomed the efforts made by Indian and Chinese negotiators and the results that were achieved by that, I think these should certainly lead to an easing of the situation along the LAC.- On CBMs, he said that -these evolve continuously-. As the two sides engage once again in multiple formats, this is certainly a subject that I think will be under discussion between the two sides.- On the question of whether soldiers will continue to be deployed along the LAC, he deferred the question to military leaders. On the question of normalisation, he said that we have embarked on the path of normalisation (in Hindi, he said: ek yatra ek tarah se chal padi hai). He added that the agreement between the two sides has opened a pathway, but both need to walk on that path now (in Hindi: yeh rasta khul gaya hai; raste par chalne ki ab hum dono ko aawashakta hai). He added that on trust, what ever process we follow going forward, we hope that it will boost trust between the two sides. On the question of whether the border agreement covers Depsang and Demchok, Misri said that the answer is within is statements issued over the past few days. In essence, he confirmed that Depsang and Demchok were the only issues that the current agreement covers. The agreement that was arrived at, he said, -essentially pertains to these areas.- If you are interested, this is what he had said yesterday when asked a similar question: -Well, what it will entail is that in the pending areas under discussion, patrolling and indeed grazing activities, wherever applicable, will revert to the situation as it obtained in 2020. Incidentally, I should say that this is also what the External Affairs Minister was talking about yesterday when he was speaking at the NDTV World Summit, I think. And as to the other part of your question, what the, as far as the disengagement agreements reached previously are concerned, those agreements were not reopened in these discussions. The agreement that was reached yesterday, very early yesterday morning, was focused on issues that had remained outstanding in the last couple of years. So that is what I would say at this point in time.- On the question of whether Russia played a role as peacemaker between India and China, he said: -We are in Kazan; we are in Russia. I think we can certainly thank Russia for providing the venue.- You can watch the full briefing below. It's an 18-minute video, which is in loop.

India-China Talks - Xi Meets Putin - Zhang Youxia Seeks New Models of Integrated Training - Central SoEs Pump $196 bln in Strategic Emerging Industrie...	Hi folks, Before we get to today's edition, I wanted to point to something that I am looking forward to during the day. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping will be meeting for their first formal bilateral talks since October 2019. This comes after a deal was announced separately by both sides on the issues related to the standoff between the two forces in Eastern Ladakh.

The two sides have upheld the spirit of lasting good-neighbourliness and friendship, comprehensive strategic coordination, and mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation, and continued to deepen and expand comprehensive strategic cooperation and practical cooperation across various fields, injected strong impetus into the development, revitalization and modernization of the two countries, and made important contributions to enhancing the well-being of the Chinese and Russian people and safeguarding international fairness and justice. At present, the world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, resulting in a fast-changing and turbulent international landscape, but the profound and lasting friendship between China and Russia will not change, nor will their sense of responsibility as major countries for the world and for the people. Despite complex and severe external challenges, bilateral cooperation in areas such as trade continues to advance, and large-scale joint projects remain stable in operation. The two sides should continue to promote the in-depth docking of BRI and the Eurasian Economic Union to provide dynamic support for promoting the high-quality development of their respective economies.- ，75。75，，-、、-。、、，，，、。，，，，。，，。--，.

Li Hongyan also noted that foreign investment in domestic bonds continues to see a stable inflow, with a cumulative net increase of over $80 billion in the first three quarters of the year. She noted that foreign investment in domestic stocks has also significantly improved, adding that the proportion of foreign investment in the domestic stock and bond markets is around 3% to 4%.

It is necessary to adhere to the Party's absolute leadership over the army, deepen the Party's theoretical arming, and carry out ideological and political work down to the launch pads in order to ensure that the troops resolutely obey the command of the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission at any time and under any circumstances.

Xi's instructions were conveyed by Vice Premier He Lifeng during an event held in Tianjin on Sunday. -It is necessary to be pioneers in reform and opening up, further improve the systems and mechanisms for high-level opening to the outside world; actively participate in the high-quality co-construction of the Belt and Road Initiative, expand international cooperation, innovate methods for attracting investment, and help build the ‘Invest in China' brand; consolidate and enhance the industrial foundation of advanced manufacturing, promote the upgrading, greening, and digitalization of industries, create digital industries and future industries, and develop new productive forces in line with local conditions.- ，；--，，，--；，、、，、，.

For instance, this article discusses economic and practical cooperation under the BRICS umbrella. Some key points: The import and export trade volume between China and countries such as Russia, India, Brazil, and South Africa grew from 960.21 billion RMB in 2009 to 4.32 trillion RMB in 2023, with an average annual growth rate of 11.3%. So far, the BRICS New Development Bank has approved more than 100 projects with a total amount of more than $34 billion. In 2021, the New Development Bank expanded its membership for the first time, accepting Bangladesh, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay as new members. At the end of August this year, at the 9th Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the New Development Bank, Algeria was officially approved to become a member of the New Development Bank. The report also mentions China setting up the China-BRICS Science and Innovation Incubation Park for the New Era in Xiamen. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's an article by Zhang Hanhui, China's ambassador to Russia, on the BRICS+ Cooperation. He argues that the -BRICS cooperation mechanism is active and effective, and its shaping power has continued to increase. The BRICS countries have built multi-level, wide-ranging and all-round cooperation mechanisms led by the heads of state meeting, have actively expanded the breadth of cooperation through the ‘BRICS+' cooperation model, and have helped the Global South countries achieve the development goals of mutual achievement and common revitalization. The BRICS countries maintain close coordination on international affairs, defend fairness and justice, and promote world multipolarization. All parties support the development of the New Development Bank, promote the reform of the international financial system, and safeguard the development interests of the Global South countries; they have held a special video summit of BRICS leaders on the Palestinian-Israeli issue, insisted on resolving the Ukrainian crisis through dialogue and negotiation, and promoted political solutions to hotspot issues; and they have proposed ‘BRICS proposals' regarding counter-terrorism, climate change, energy, food, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and other domains of international governance, delivering a ‘strong voice from the South'.- ，。、、，-+-，、。，，。，，；，，；、、、、、--，--. He later adds: -China and Russia maintain close strategic cooperation within the BRICS cooperation mechanism. China actively supports Russia in doing a good job during its rotating presidency, building consensus and pooling strength through the Kazan meeting, promoting the great development and great achievements of BRICS+ cooperation, and working together to promote an equal and orderly world multi-polarization and inclusive economic globalization, and promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.- 。，、，--、，，.

It adds that the -China-ASEAN Free Trade Area 3.0 covers 9 areas, including both existing areas of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement and emerging areas with huge cooperation potential between the two sides. For the first time, China and ASEAN have reached the highest level of agreements in their respective economic and trade agreements, covering chapters on the digital economy, green economy, and supply chain connectivity. They have also achieved agreements on the highest level of standards, technical regulations, and conformity assessment procedures in their respective treaty practices. These upgrades will fully expand mutually beneficial cooperation between China and ASEAN in emerging fields, strengthen the integration of standards and rules between the two sides, jointly build a safe, stable, and efficient regional supply chain cooperation network, and elevate China-ASEAN win-win cooperation to a new level.- —3.0，，。9，—，。、、，。，，、，. The article adds: -Currently, the global problem of insufficient overall demand is more prominent, making the market a scarce resource for economic development. China and ASEAN's combined populations account for a quarter of the world's total, and their large-scale markets are the main foundation for promoting economic prosperity. The upgraded FTA will further integrate and connect the two large markets, certainly generating more significant economies of scale, industrial clustering effects, and development spillover effects-. 1/4，。、，、、. The article also makes the point that the completion of negotiations on the deal also -reflects the clear attitude of both sides to firmly support multilateralism and free trade.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 16: There is an article by Zheng Zongwen discussing the BRICS summit. The author writes that more than 30 countries have applied to join the BRICS cooperation mechanism, demonstrating the increasing appeal and attraction of the BRICS cooperation mechanism.- Zheng argues that the popularity of the BRICS is the -choice of history and the call of the times.- A key point that the author makes is: -One arrow is easily broken, but ten arrows are hard to bend.- ，. BRICS cooperation has always taken independence and self-reliance as its cornerstone, demonstrating responsibility for promoting human social progress. Faced with the choice between peaceful coexistence or confrontation and antagonism, BRICS countries adhere to the role positioning of -not starting from scratch/a new system/starting over, not engaging in camp confrontation, not wanting to replace anyone' (、、), uphold the spirit of mutual respect and understanding, equal treatment, unity and mutual assistance, openness and inclusiveness, and consensus through consultation, striving to seek the greatest common divisor and draw the largest concentric circle. From respecting each other's development paths to resolutely opposing interference in other countries' internal affairs, from jointly defending development rights to jointly exploring the path of modernization, every step forward in BRICS cooperation crystallises profound thinking on changing one's own destiny and pursuing reform and progress, and demonstrates the tremendous power of the collective awakening of the vast number of developing countries. At present, certain major countries, driven by geopolitical objectives, are seeking to coerce other countries to take sides and create camp confrontation, disregarding other countries' interests and engaging in self-centeredness, arbitrarily containing and suppressing emerging market countries and developing countries. The enlarged BRICS as the first echelon of the Global South will stride forward along the path of independence, self-reliance, and united self-strengthening, continuing to build a solid ‘golden defense line' to safeguard the common interests of developing countries. ，。，-、、-，、、、、，、。，，、，。，，，，，。----，、，--. The next bit talks about BRICS cooperation essentially being a win-win model, focussing on key areas, such as economic development, technology, production and supply chain cooperation, food security cooperation and sustainable development. -BRICS cooperation has always pursued fairness and justice, contributing wisdom to improving the global governance system. Faced with the contest between multilateralism and hegemony and power politics, BRICS countries represent the Global South countries in voicing more just opinions. From maintaining the authority and status of the United Nations to promoting reforms of international financial institutions, such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, BRICS countries, while maintaining the stability of the global governance system, support its timely reform and rectification of historical injustices. From holding the BRICS Leaders' Special Video Summit on the Palestinian-Israeli Issue, to China and Brazil proposing a ‘six-point consensus' on the political resolution of the Ukraine crisis, to establishing a ‘Friends of Peace' group for the Ukraine crisis, BRICS countries take the lead in speaking and acting justly, playing a constructive role in promoting the resolution of international and regional hotspot issues. From establishing a working group on cybersecurity issues to setting up the ‘China-BRICS Artificial Intelligence Development and Cooperation Center', BRICS countries actively engage with new domains of global governance, playing a positive role in ensuring equal participation of Global South countries in international affairs and safeguarding their rights. The enlarged BRICS is an expansion of the world's justice front, and will continue to contribute ‘golden wisdom' to promote the construction of a global governance pattern featuring joint consultation, joint construction and shared benefits.- ，。，。、，，，。，--，--，、，。-—-，，、。--，--. The author then makes the case that the BRICS is a model of inclusiveness, of seeking common ground while reserving differences, and of coexistence and cooperation among countries with different ethnicities, cultures, and systems.

Ford, chairman and chief executive officer of General Atlantic. Xi pointed out that China-U.S. ties are one of the world's most important bilateral relations, which bear on the well-being of the two peoples and the future of mankind. Xi said China has always handled the China-U.S. relationship based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and always believes that each country's success presents opportunities for the other.

Share Tracking People's Daily Page 2: First, there's a report (full speech text - English text) on Li Qiang's remarks at the SCO meeting in Pakistan. Li called on the SCO members to move towards the following: First, efforts to build an even more solid political foundation. The fundamental reason why the SCO has stayed vibrant since its inception is that we have upheld the Shanghai Spirit, a vital political consensus, and endeavored to be trustworthy and reliable partners for each other. No matter how the international landscape may evolve, SCO cooperation in various fields will move forward steadily as long as the Shanghai Spirit remains entrenched. Second, efforts to provide more reliable security safeguards. As we speak, geopolitical conflicts, power politics and acts of bullying continue to undermine regional peace and stability, while on such fronts as cyber security and biosecurity, new threats and new challenges continue to emerge. No country is immune, and the only true security is security for all. Only by further improving the mechanisms and tools to tackle threats and challenges can we provide better safeguards for common development. Third, efforts to foster closer economic bonds. The SCO's continuous expansion of membership in recent years has created more notable economic complementarity among member states. By deepening our economic ties, resisting external attempts of pulling us apart, and tapping into and pooling our respective strengths in resources, market and industries, we will be able to foster even stronger synergy for development. Fourth, efforts to cultivate stronger emotional bonds. Our region is home to diverse and splendid civilizations, where different nations and cultures have interacted and converged with each other throughout the course of history and coexisted in harmony. This has been the source of popular support for cooperation among SCO member states. We need to further promote mutual learning among civilizations and cultural exchanges so as to enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the people of SCO member states. Fifth, efforts to boost coordination in multilateral fora. Embracing 26 countries from three continents, the SCO family is a constructive force that carries important global influence. With our commitment to the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, and our enhanced communication and coordinated actions, SCO member states will better rally the developing world in promoting a more just and equitable global order. Li then made four proposals: First, enhancing strategic synergy for our shared purpose. Pursuing peaceful development is the abiding purpose of the SCO. We should stay grounded in the fundamental and long-term interests of the region, bear in mind the big picture and keep external disruptions at bay. Our best efforts must be directed toward mapping out the SCO's development strategy for the next decade and drawing up roadmaps for cooperation in various areas. Member states should step up strategic communication, bridge differences and boost mutual trust through dialogue, and pool strengths for unity. Second, expanding practical cooperation in line with development needs. The year 2025 will be the SCO Year of Sustainable Development. China stands ready to deepen cooperation with all sides in poverty reduction, digital economy and green development, to generate sustained momentum for development. We should continue to draw impetus from openness and cooperation, boost the region's trade and investment facilitation and connectivity, and maintain stable and smooth industrial and supply chains. Active efforts should be made to establish an SCO development bank in order to provide financing support for countries in their pursuit of development. Third, proactively addressing major risks. Our region continues to face grave security issues. The fight against terrorism, separatism and extremism remains a long-term, arduous task, and various challenges lie ahead in such areas as safeguarding information security and combating transnational organized crime. China stands ready to work with all sides to strengthen intelligence sharing and joint operations, move faster to build a universal center to address the challenges and threats to the security of SCO member states and the Anti-Drug Center, and strive for major outcomes at next year's summit, so that we can put in place new platforms and a new architecture for regional security cooperation. Fourth, expanding people-to-people exchange to meet popular expectations. We should fully leverage the role of the SCO Committee on Good-Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation, develop an effective SCO digital education alliance, organize excellent events under our flagship programs such as the Forum on People-to-People Friendship and the Forum on Friendship Cities, the Forum on Women, and the Art Exhibition of Young Artists, and increase our peoples' participation and sense of fulfillment, to keep people-to-people friendship strong for generations to come.

In the new era and on a new journey, as the profound changes unseen in a century accelerate, a new military revolution is rapidly advancing, and China's security and development needs are undergoing profound changes, the task of achieving the goal of strengthening the military has become more urgent, and it is necessary to comprehensively strengthen military theory work.- ，，。，，，，，. -It is necessary to implement the thought on strengthening the military in the new era; implement the military strategic guidelines for the new era; persist in combining the basic principles of Marxism with the practice of building the people's army; draw from the essence of China's excellent traditional military culture; focus on the battlefield, the troops, and the future; keep a close eye on changes in technology, warfare, and adversaries; grasp firmly the research on major issues of war preparedness and military building under new historical conditions; optimize top-level design for military theory innovations; improve the model of relevant research and enhance the application of military theory; and build a modern military theory system with Chinese characteristics so as to provide scientific support and leadership for achieving the PLA's centennial goal and accelerating the building of a world-class military.- ，，，，、、，、、，，，，，，、. Zhang Youxia was present at the meeting and also delivered a speech, emphasising Xi's message. Subscribe now The other top story on the page is about Qiushi's publication of a speech by Xi at a symposium on literature and art on October 15, 2014. This is quite a famous speech, but for those who might not have followed back then, I'll do a full breakdown of the report. If you want to read a full translation of the speech by Rogier Creemers back then, here's the link. -The speech emphasised that literary and artistic undertakings are important undertakings of the Party and the people, and the literary and artistic front is an important front of the Party and the people. Literature and art are the clarion call for the advancement of the times, and they best represent the style of an era and are most able to shape the atmosphere of an era. To achieve the ‘two centenary' goals and realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, the role of literature and art is irreplaceable, and there is much for literary and artistic workers to do. The majority of literary and artistic workers should recognize the status and role of literature and art from such a perspective, recognize the historical mission and responsibility they bear, adhere to the people-centred creative approach, strive to create more excellent works worthy of the times, carry forward the Chinese spirit, gather Chinese strength, and inspire people of all ethnic groups across the country to vigorously move forward into the future.- ，，。，，。--、，，。，，，，、，. -The speech pointed out that achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation requires the prosperity and flourishing of Chinese culture. It is essential to place great importance on and fully leverage the significant role of literature, art, and cultural workers. Both history and reality have proven that the Chinese nation possesses immense cultural creativity. At every major historical juncture, culture can sense the changes in national fortunes, stand at the forefront of the times, and sound the clarion call of the era, cheering millions of people and our great motherland. Raising the banner of spirit, establishing spiritual pillars, and building a spiritual home all cannot be separated from literature and art. Writers and artists in our country should become the forerunners, pioneers, and advocates of the times, and write and record the great practice of the people and the progressive requirements of the times through more literary and artistic works with strength, morality, and warmth.- ，。。，。，、、，、。、、，。、、，、、，、. The next paragraph stresses the importance of -creating and producing excellent works that are worthy of our great nation and great era.- It says: -The central task of literary and artistic work must be the creation and production of excellent works. We must strive to create and produce more excellent works that spread contemporary Chinese values, embody the spirit of Chinese culture, reflect the aesthetic pursuits of the Chinese people, and organically unify ideological content, artistic quality, and aesthetic appeal. Innovation is the lifeblood of literature and art.- ，、、，、、。. Xi then stressed the importance of -the originality of literature and art- and called to -strive to cultivate a group of influential literary and artistic leaders in various fields, and build a large team of literary and artistic talents.- The next bit is important to remember: -The speech pointed out that socialist literature and art, in essence, is the literature and art of the people. Literature and art must reflect the voice of the people and must adhere to the fundamental direction of serving the people and serving socialism. This is a basic requirement put forward by the Party for the literary and artistic front, and it is also the key to determining the future and destiny of China's literary and artistic undertakings. First, the people need literature and art. To meet the people's growing spiritual and cultural needs, we must focus on cultural development and increase the spiritual and cultural wealth of society. Second, literature and art need the people. Whether excellent works can be produced fundamentally depends on whether they can write for the people, express emotions for the people, and reflect the thoughts of the people. Third, literature and art must love the people. There are a hundred or even a thousand methods for literary and artistic creation, but the most fundamental, crucial, and reliable method is to be rooted in the people and in real life. A good work should be one that withstands the evaluation of the people, experts, and the test of the market. It should prioritise social benefits but also achieve a balance between social and economic benefits. Literature and art should not be slaves to the market and should not be tainted with the stench of money.- ，，，。，、。，。，。，，。，。，、、。，。、，、、、。，、、，，。，. The speech pointed out that the Chinese spirit is the soul of socialist literature and art. Every era has its own spirit. Literature and art are projects that shape the soul, and literary and artistic workers are the engineers of the soul. Literary and artistic workers should uphold the banner of core socialist values, fully recognize the responsibilities on their shoulders, and vividly and creatively reflect these core values in their artistic creations. Patriotism should be the main theme of literary and artistic creation, guiding the people to establish and uphold the correct views of history, the nation, the state, and culture, while enhancing their sense of pride and confidence in being Chinese. Through literary and artistic works, we should convey truth, goodness, and beauty, and transmit positive and virtuous values, guiding people to aspire to and pursue a life that values morality, respects morality, and upholds morality. We should inherit and promote China's excellent traditional culture and Chinese aesthetic spirit in line with the conditions of the new era. ，。。，。，，、。，、、、，。，，、、。，. The final paragraph calls to strengthen the Party's leadership over literary and artistic work.

Subscribe now Page 7: There's a report based on data released by the State Taxation Administration on individual income taxation. It informs that more than 70 percent of people earning an income did not have to pay tax in China last year. Individuals with an annual income of less than 100,000 yuan ($13,600), did not have to pay personal income tax last year. Li Ping, the deputy director of the STA's tax science research institute explained -in 2018, China revised the Individual Income Tax Law for the seventh time, raising the basic deduction standard from the original 3,500 yuan per person per month to 5,000 yuan. At the same time, six special additional deductions were established for children's education, support for the elderly, housing loan interest, housing rent, continuing education, and major illness medical treatment. In 2022, a special additional deduction for the care of infants under 3 years old was added, and in 2023, the standards for three special additional deductions for the care of infants under 3 years old, children's education, and support for the elderly were increased.- The report also informs that among the individual income tax payers in China, high-income earners with an annual income of more than 1 million yuan account for about 1% of the number of taxpayers, and the individual income tax declared and paid by this group accounts for more than 50% of the total individual income tax. The individual income tax paid by the top 10% accounts for more than 90% of the total individual income tax. While on this subject of taxation, do check out this Bloomberg report. It says: -China has begun enforcing a long-overlooked tax on overseas investment gains by the country's ultra-rich, according to people familiar with the matter. Some wealthy individuals in major Chinese cities were told in recent months to conduct self-assessments or summoned by tax authorities for meetings to evaluate potential payments, including those in arrears from past years, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter. The move underscores growing urgency within the government to expand its sources of revenue as land sales tumble and growth slows. It also aligns with President Xi Jinping's ‘common prosperity' campaign to create a more equal distribution of wealth in the world's second-largest economy. The individuals contacted are facing up to 20% levies on investment gains, and some are also subject to penalties on overdue payments, said the people, adding that the final amount is negotiable.- Another report on the page informs that the inter-provincial electricity spot market has officially begun operation on Tuesday. This is a key step towards building a unified electricity market system. The State Grid said that building on the existing medium- and long-term electricity trading mechanism, the spot market allows for day-ahead and intra-day transactions across provinces. Since the pilot use started in January 2022, the market has been running smoothly and steadily for 31 consecutive months. Up to date, it has achieved full coverage of areas operated by the State Grid and the western Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, with over 6,000 trading entities and a cumulative transaction volume of over 88 billion kilowatt-hours, of which more than 44 percent are clean energy sources. Share Tracking People's Daily First, there's too much in this to offer a summary, but if you are interested, do check out Xinhua Institute's new report: ‘Eight Major Steps' Heralds Promising New Decade of Belt and Road Cooperation. Second, check out this report from Caixin discussing the potential of the central government possibly raising 6 trillion yuan from treasury bonds to support local governments. -​​China may raise an additional 6 trillion yuan from treasury bonds over three years as part of its efforts to buttress the slowing economy through fiscal stimulus, multiple sources with knowledge of the matter told Caixin. The funds will be partly used to help local governments resolve their off-the-books debts, according to the sources. Speculation about the size of China's new fiscal stimulus has been rife since the Ministry of Finance pledged at a press briefing Saturday to help local governments relieve debt pressure without specifying the amount. The central government will expand the quota for local authorities to bring their hidden debt onto the books by a ‘relatively large scale,' Finance Minister Lan Foan said at the briefing. By helping manage the tens of trillions of yuan of off-the-books debt, the measure could free up more energy and fiscal resources for local governments to develop their economies and improve the welfare of residents, he noted. Lan also announced policies for local governments to buy land and housing from property developers in a bid to revive the country's real estate sector, which has now been in a slump for more than three years. Part of the funding will come from local governments issuing special-purpose bonds, which are typically used to finance infrastructure and public welfare projects. Other fiscal measures will include injecting capital into China's major state-owned commercial banks and subsidizing ‘important groups,' such as students, Lan said. The central government is looking into additional fiscal policies, the finance minister said, adding that it has a ‘relatively large' amount of room to increase its deficit and issue more debt.- SCMP also has a very useful explainer on when we are likely to get more details on this stimulus. It says: -When talking on Saturday about introducing a one-time, large-scale, debt-ceiling increase for local governments to swap their hidden debts, Lan said specifics on the amount of money will be disclosed after the proper legal procedures. Historically speaking, the NPC Standing Committee usually holds a chairman's meeting in the second week after the National Day holiday, and the time and agenda of the upcoming legislature gathering are decided. Thus, more details of China's fiscal stimulus might be disclosed in late October or early November after the NPC Standing Committee meeting. Last year, the NPC Standing Committee meeting was held from October 20-24 and a resolution was passed to issue an additional 1 trillion yuan (US$ 141.3 billion) worth of treasury bonds. In December, there will be another Politburo meeting focused on economic issues and the Central Economic Work Conference will likely take place. At that time, more signals about raising the headline fiscal deficit and bond issuance for the next year should come to light. Many economists expect that the size of the overall stimulus package might be counted in the trillions of yuan. But Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Capital, said China's policymakers may not announce an overall figure at all. ‘First, they don't need to come up with such a number for the [NPC] to approve. Second, it's hard to come up with such a number, as the line between fiscal, monetary and industrial policies is often blurred in China,- he said in a note on Saturday. And it would be politically incorrect to be seen flooding the economy with money in China, especially after the ‘4 trillion yuan stimulus' in 2008, he added. Back then, the number was first announced by the former premier at a State Council executive meeting and disclosed to the public a few days later.- Third, Xinhua reports that China unveiled a national mid and long-term development program for space science on Tuesday, which will guide the country's planning of space science missions and space research from 2024 to 2050. -The program, the first of its kind at the national level, was jointly released by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) at a press conference held by the State Council Information Office. The program outlines the development goals of China's space science, including 17 priority areas under five key scientific themes, as well as a three-phase roadmap. The five key scientific themes include the extreme universe, space-time ripples, panoramic view of Sun-Earth, habitable planets, and biological and physical sciences in space, Ding Chibiao, vice president of the CAS, said at the press conference.- The report adds: -In the first phase, leading up to 2027, China will focus on the space station operation, implementing the manned lunar exploration project, and the fourth phase of its lunar exploration program as well as the planetary exploration project. Five to eight space science satellite missions will be approved during the period, according to the program. The international lunar research station initiated by China will be constructed during the second phase from 2028 to 2035, and approximately 15 scientific satellite missions will be carried out during this period. In the third phase from 2036 to 2050, China will launch over 30 space science missions.- -In the next decade, China's space station will focus on cutting-edge technologies, addressing major national needs, and promoting the health and well-being of its people. It will focus on four research areas, namely, space life and human body research, microgravity physics, space astronomy and Earth science, and new space technologies and applications, according to Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the CMSA. China plans to launch a 2-meter caliber space telescope to explore the forefront issues in space astronomy. In order to support its operation and research, scientific centers have been established at Peking University, the Yangtze River Delta region and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, aiming to achieve breakthroughs in cosmology, galaxy science, as well as the study of celestial bodies in the Milky Way and the solar system, Lin said.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Special Report: Contours of a New Modus Vivendi with China	Hi folks, I hope this finds you well. I am thrilled to share the publication of my latest paper: Contours of a New Modus Vivendi with China. Share Tracking People's Daily This paper recommends a pathway for India to arrive at a new modus vivendi in its relationship with China. I begin by providing an overview of the current state of the relationship and structural factors that are shaping its direction. Thereafter, the paper provides a detailed assessment of the Indian debate on China and Chinese discourse on India before recommending a way forward. In essence, I argue that volatility is likely to be the norm in the India-China dyad owing to certain structural factors. However, it is in the interest of both sides to ensure a certain amount of stability and predictability in the relationship. In order to do so, the paper contends that Indian strategy should be focussed on expanding national power and dealing with China from a position of strength, while building new mechanisms of engagement and scrutiny. The paper ends with six broad recommendations for Indian policy going ahead. I hope that these serve as a starting point for a robust debate on Indian policy, what is a desirable relationship with China, and what India should be doing to ensure that we get there.

Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: Two interesting reports which inform of China's evolving position on the conflict in the Middle East. Wang Yi spoke to the foreign ministers of Israel and Iran. The call with the Israeli foreign minister was the first conversation at this level between the two sides since October 2023,. Xinhua reports: Wang -called for an immediate, complete and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and the release of all hostages.- He also -called for unimpeded access of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Wang said that the international community is deeply worried about the prolonged escalation of conflict in the Middle East. Noting that all lives are equally precious, regardless of nationality or ethnicity, Wang said that the humanitarian disaster in Gaza must end and that countering violence with violence cannot truly address the legitimate concerns of all parties. Pointing out that the conflict in Gaza has once again demonstrated that the Palestinian question remains a core issue in the Middle East, Wang said the voices of the international community are clear, which hope all parties return to the political path of a -two-state solution- as soon as possible. Doing so would realize the peaceful coexistence of Israel and Palestine and the harmonious coexistence of the Jewish and Arab peoples. This is the right way to achieve stability and lasting security for all parties, including Israel, Wang said.- -Wang said that China is highly concerned about the tension between Israel and Iran and believes that renewed conflict and turmoil in the region serves the interests of no one. Wang stated that China urges all parties to proceed with caution to prevent falling into a vicious circle. He said China is not self-interested in the Middle East and never engages in geopolitical contests. As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, China has always stood on the side of peace, international law and truth and will continue to play a constructive role in de-escalating the situation and restoring peace in the region, Wang said. Wang stressed that United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is mandated by Security Council resolutions to carry out peacekeeping missions, adding that the Israeli side should take concrete measures to ensure the safety of UNIFIL personnel.- The Times of Israel notes that -Foreign Minister Israel Katz has told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi that Iran is a threat to the Middle East and the entire world.- -‘We expect that China will express a balanced and fair position in relation to the war that was imposed on Israel,' says the Israeli readout, ‘which accurately reflects who are terrorist elements in our region and who is the state that protects itself against attacks by those terrorists.' They discuss the importance of economic cooperation, and Katz notes the 20,000 Chinese workers who remained in Israel during the war. ‘We agreed to continue the relationship and work together to strengthen the ties between the countries based on the long-standing friendship between the Jewish people and the Chinese people,' says Katz's office.- Share Tracking People's Daily Xinhua's report on Wang's call with Iranian Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araghchi has Wang saying that -China will continue to demonstrate a sense of duty as a responsible major country and play a constructive role in promoting the cooling down of the conflict-. It adds: -The two sides spoke highly of China-Iran relations, emphasizing a commitment to maintaining exchanges at all levels and promoting practical cooperation. Araghchi said Iran is deeply concerned about the risk of an overall escalation of the current regional situation and does not want to see a further expansion of conflict. Iran highly values China's influence in international affairs and is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with China to cool down the situation through diplomatic means, Araghchi said, adding that Israel should avoid taking risks and proceed cautiously.- -Wang said that the negative impacts of the current Gaza conflict are clearly spilling over, and regional tensions are escalating continuously. China has always advocated for resolving hotspot issues through dialogue and consultation and opposes exacerbating tensions, expanding conflicts and taking military adventures, Wang said, calling on all parties to make more efforts to safeguard regional peace and stability. Wang said that China will proceed from the merits of the issue, strengthen communication among all parties, build a broader international consensus, and pool the strengths of all parties. Wang said that China is pleased to see the Iranian government carry out mediation diplomacy, enhance understanding with relevant parties and improve relations with regional countries.

The report informs that China currently has 141,000 specialised and innovative SMEs and 14,600 ‘Little Giant' enterprises. ‘Wang Jiangping, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said that in terms of technological innovation, this year, central government funding will support more than 1,000 key ‘Little Giant' enterprises to create new drivers of growth, tackle new technologies, develop new products, and strengthen the supporting capacity of industrial chains. Through special re-loan projects, more than 1,100 ‘Little Giant' enterprises will be supported in technical transformation and equipment upgrades.

This fully demonstrates that promoting the development of the private economy is a fundamental policy that the Party and the country will consistently and persistently uphold. Once these principles are enshrined in law, they will gain stability and binding force, which will certainly promote the sustained, healthy, and high-quality development of the private economy, and create a better environment for the joint development of all types of ownership, including the private economy.- -。，‘'‘'，‘、、，'，。，、、，. -In response to issues such as local protectionism and market fragmentation, more stringent institutional measures with binding force will be introduced and implemented.

China-Vietnam Deals - Taiwan Drills - Finance Minister's Press Conference & Seeking Confidence in Economy - Supporting People-to-People Diplomacy via ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, October 14, 2024. Page 1: Let's begin with a report on Li Qiang's meeting with Vietnam's Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh. -Li Qiang pointed out that China and Vietnam, both developing countries, are at critical stages of their modernization efforts. China firmly supports Vietnam in steadily advancing on the socialist path that suits its national conditions. China is willing to strengthen the alignment of development strategies with Vietnam, fully leverage the role of the China-Vietnam Bilateral Cooperation Steering Committee mechanism, and effectively implement cooperation plans under BRI and the ‘Two Corridors and One Belt' framework. Both sides should deepen cooperation in connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, healthcare, disaster prevention and mitigation, and expand cooperation in local currency settlement. They should also explore new areas of cooperation in emerging industries such as the digital economy and green development, continuously upgrading and enhancing cooperation across various fields. Both sides should take next year's 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations and the ‘China-Vietnam Year of Cultural Exchange' as an opportunity to further deepen cultural exchanges, enhance mutual understanding and ties between the peoples of both countries, especially the younger generations, ensuring that the friendship between China and Vietnam is passed down through the generations. Both sides should adhere to friendly consultations, properly manage differences, and expand maritime cooperation. China is also willing to strengthen coordination with Vietnam on multilateral platforms such as the United Nations and APEC, promoting global governance toward a more just and equitable direction, safeguarding the interests of developing countries, and leading the international community in building a shared future for humanity.- ，，，，，，----，、、、，，、，。75--，，，。，，。、，，，. As per the report, Pham Minh Chinh said that ties with China were -the top priority and strategic choice- of the CPV and the government.

He also requested support for establishing a Vietnamese Trade Promotion Office in Haikou this year, and more offices in Chengdu (Sichuan) and Nanjing (Jiangsu) in the near future.- -He called for improved customs clearance efficiency at border gates, advancing -soft connectivity- through smart customs-... Li Qiang -proposed joint efforts to put in place large-scale, high-tech projects in the sectors where China has strength and Vietnam has demand, which are seen as symbols of the bilateral ties. They cover such areas as renewable energy, supporting industries, electric vehicles, international financial centers, free trade zones, smart cities, digital economy, green economy, and circular economy.- Vietnamese PM -suggested the two sides step up the sharing of data on meteorology, hydrology, and cross-border water resources, while working together to ensure sustainable management and use of the Mekong-Lancang River water resources-. -The two sides exchanged sincere and straightforward views on maritime issues, and agreed to continue strictly implement the high-level common perceptions and the agreement on basic principles guiding the resolution of maritime issues between Vietnam and China, appropriately managing differences, and actively seeking mutually-acceptable, fundamental, and long-term solutions in line with the agreement on basic principles guiding the resolution of maritime issues and international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). They agreed to avoid actions that could complicate the situation and to maintain stability at sea together, while effectively implementing negotiation mechanisms on maritime issues, and actively promoting cooperation in less sensitive areas as well as search and rescue operations at sea.- This is also worth noting: -Chinh called on both sides to respect each other's legitimate rights and interests, resolve disputes and disagreements through peaceful means in accordance with international law, particularly the UNCLOS 1982; properly address issues related to fishermen and fishing vessels in a manner that aligns with the friendly relations between the two countries, ensuring that the East Sea issue does not impact the bilateral political trust and damage the sentiments and confidence of the two countries' people.- Share Tracking People's Daily On Page 2, there are reports on Li's meeting with entrepreneurs and business leaders in Vietnam and Vietnamese National Assembly Chairman Tran Thanh Man. Xinhua reports that Li told business leaders -China and Vietnam are traditional socialist friendly neighbors, and their respective development is an important opportunity for each other, he said, adding that economic and trade cooperation has always been a highlight of China-Vietnam cooperation and an important source of driving force for advancing bilateral ties. Looking ahead, Li said, there is still more space for expansion and greater potential to be tapped in the further alignment of the development strategies of the two countries, stronger connectivity, the release of complementary advantages, as well as economic and trade cooperation. The two countries share the same social system, strong political mutual trust, geographical proximity and affinity among their people, and enjoy a profound friendship of ‘comrades and brothers', which has laid a solid foundation for bilateral cooperation. The Chinese premier called on the entrepreneurs to more actively engage in national development strategies, and make full use of multilateral and bilateral economic and trade cooperation agreements and policy dividends such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and the Version 3.0 China-ASEAN Free Trade Area. Li proposed that the entrepreneurs should jointly promote the integrated development of industries, deepen mutual integration of supply and demand, and build stable and smooth cross-border industrial and supply chains. He also urged the two countries' entrepreneurs to pool innovation and creativity, and strengthen the whole-chain innovation cooperation between industry, academia, research and utilization, with a particular focus on clean energy, biomedicine and artificial intelligence, so as to jointly foster and strengthen new driving forces for the development of the two countries.- Xinhua's report on the meeting with Tran Thanh Man has Li saying: -China is willing to enhance exchanges and cooperation with Vietnam's legislative bodies, strengthen coordination and cooperation in multilateral fields, and provide solid support for promoting each other's socialist construction, Li said. It is hoped that the legislatures of the two countries will strongly support practical cooperation in various fields, focus more on innovation, provide legal guarantees for China and Vietnam to strengthen cooperation in emerging industries such as digital economy, new energy and 5G, and jointly cultivate and strengthen new drivers of development, said Li. At the same time, the two countries' legislatures will actively provide public guidance to enhance mutual understanding and goodwill between the two peoples, especially among the young people, and continue to consolidate the social foundation for bilateral cooperation, he added.- Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report informing that Sam Hou Fai has been elected as the chief executive designate of Macau. He won the election on Sunday with 394 votes in favour out of 398 valid ballots. Xinhua reports that the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office said that -the successfully concluded election is ‘significant' for implementing the principle of ‘patriots administering Macao' and advancing the successful practice of ‘one country, two systems' with Macao characteristics.- The report adds that an article on the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office's website said that -Sam had received broad public support for his deep affection and sense of responsibility toward Macao and the country, willingness to collaborate with various social groups and sectors, and commitment to promoting socio-economic development and improving the well-being of Macao residents. Sam, who previously served as president of Macao's Court of Final Appeal, has handled a number of major cases and effectively safeguarded national security and the constitutional order of the Macao SAR, the article said. The Macao society has confidence in Sam to safeguard both the overall interests of the country and the fundamental interests of Macao, and ensure the steady and sustained practice of -one country, two systems- with Macao characteristics, it added. The article also said Sam demonstrates his capability of adapting to changes and seeking transformation, and the will to seize opportunities and pursue reform.- There is also a front page commentary on Sam's election. It talks about the election process, saying that -all sectors of Macau society and the general public actively participated and exercised their democratic rights in accordance with the law. The entire election process was open, fair, just, legal, stable and orderly…- The article says that Sam was able to garner support because of six planks: Being patriotic and loving Macau, having unwavering dedication Being skilled at uniting people and pooling wisdom Being focused on development, seeking truth and being pragmatic Being people-oriented, with a strong emphasis on livelihood Safeguarding national security, maintaining stability Being pioneering and innovative and courageous in breaking through 、；、；、；、；、；、……，，、。 The article then basically doubles down on the significance of the one country, two systems framework. It says that the election -fully reflects the Macau society's heartfelt support for ‘one country, two systems'...- It adds that -practice has fully proven that ‘one country, two systems' is a great initiative under socialism with Chinese characteristics and the best institutional arrangement for maintaining long-term prosperity and stability after the return of Hong Kong and Macau to the motherland, and it must be adhered to for a long time'.- ，--，、，。 Further, the piece reiterates that -the destinies of Hong Kong, Macau, and the mainland have always been closely linked, and national development has always been the strongest foundation for the development of Hong Kong and Macau.-、，、. Subscribe now Finally, there's a long, long article under the byline Jin Sheping , discussing economic policy shifts and basically calling for greater confidence. The article begins by making the case that China's long-term fundamentals remain strong. It says that through this year, -overall economic performance has been stable with steady progress; however, some new situations and problems have also emerged-. --，、，，。 The piece begins talking about the September 26 Politburo meeting, which discussed the economy. The meeting called to -effectively enhance the sense of responsibility and urgency of doing a good job in economic work- and -strive to complete the goals and tasks of economic and social development throughout the year.- 926，。，，----. Section one then says that in order to strive to achieve the year's goals, -we must strengthen our confidence in overcoming difficulties-. Then we get some data points from the holidays: The trade-in program for home appliances during the National Day holiday led to the sales of eight categories of home appliances under the program reaching 17.835 billion yuan. During the seven-day National Day holiday, domestic tourist numbers and total tourist spending increased by 10.2% and 7.9% respectively compared to the same period in 2019. The article then says: -Currently, all regions and departments are conscientiously implementing the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech and the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee. A series of measures to support stable economic growth and high-quality development have been introduced in quick succession, effectively guiding societal expectations and strengthening confidence in China's economy.- ，，，，. Then we get some sprinkling of positive information about the real estate sector and consumption vouchers and subsidies by local governments. For instance: -On October 1st, the online signing area of newly constructed commercial housing in Shandong reached 93,800 square meters, a year-on-year increase of 46.8%. From October 1st to noon on October 3rd, compared to the same period last year, Beijing saw a 92.5% increase in new home viewings and a doubling of purchase intentions, while second-hand home viewings increased by 104.1%. Some properties in Guangzhou received over 150 visits per day, a 200% increase compared to normal times.- 101，9.38，46.8%。1013，92.5%、2，104.1%。150，200%. This next macro assessment is worth reading: -On one hand, the external environment has become increasingly complex, severe, and uncertain, and the adverse effects of changes in the external environment on China's economy have increased. The ‘global economy is stagnant', said the IMF in its World Economic Outlook report, updated in July. Currently, major world economies are experiencing weak growth momentum and heavy debt burdens. Many have recently implemented interest rate cuts, and international market volatility has increased. Global trade protectionism has intensified, and uncertainty and instability have increased. These factors will have an adverse impact on China through trade, investment, finance and other channels. In particular, it is important to note that some external forces are trying to contain, blockade, and suppress China, deliberately attempting to hinder the historical process of building a socialist modern power in an all-round way and realising the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Rhetoric about ‘decoupling and breaking supply chains' and ‘small yards with high walls' has become louder, reflecting the increasing complexity, severity, and uncertainty of the external environment China faces. On the other hand, while China's economy continues to recover and improve, downward pressure has increased. Since the third quarter, key economic indicators such as industrial production, investment, and consumption have fluctuated. Some industries are experiencing ‘involution-style' competition, and some enterprises are struggling to adapt to optimization, upgrading, or transformation. In some cases, increased production has not led to increased revenue or profits, some companies face significant operational difficulties, and in some sectors hidden risks remain relatively high.- ，，。--，7《》。，、，，，，，、、。，、、，、。----，、、。，，，、，--，，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily The article then says that given all this, where does confidence come from? The answer is that first, -confidence comes from a deep understanding of (China's) development advantages.- -Since the new era, under the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Economy, China's economic development has formed significant advantages. Deeply understanding, utilizing, consolidating, and developing these important advantages is not only a key support for the long-term positive fundamentals of the Chinese economy but also an essential foundation for solving the challenges faced in economic development. China's development benefits from five strategic advantages: the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, the notable advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, the solid foundation accumulated through sustained rapid development, a long-term stable social environment, and the spiritual strength of self-confidence and self-reliance. Additionally, China possesses the institutional advantage of a socialist market economy, the demand advantages of a super-large-scale market, the supply advantages of a complete supporting industrial system, and the talent advantages of a large number of high-quality workers and entrepreneurs, which have laid a solid foundation for responding to risks and challenges…History and reality have repeatedly proven that the creation and continuation of China's economic miracle is inseparable from the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China and the fundamental guarantee of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics. On the path forward, as long as we steadfastly uphold the Party's comprehensive leadership and give full play to the role of the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, the giant ship of China's economy will surely ride the wind and waves and sail towards a brighter future.- ，，。、、，，。--：、、、、。，、、、，。，--，，，；，，，、，、，，……，，。，，，，. Second, confidence comes from -a deep understanding of the development trend.- Under this point, we basically get selective economic data citation, along with the argument that China's -innovation power and development vitality are surging-, with factors supporting the development of new quality productive and high-quality development surging. This paragraph is useful with quotes from Xi. The reason I point this out is because it is indicative of deep anxieties. Think of this as a pep-talk by a coach at the back of a terrible inning to pick up the team. -What determines the prospects of economic development is never how many difficulties there are, but how we view difficulties, how we resolve to solve them, and how we deal with them. Only by looking at the long-term and trends from a development perspective can we overcome difficulties more effectively. ‘China's development prospects are bright, and we have the confidence and assurance to say so'. ‘The world today is undergoing unprecedented changes not seen in a century, but time and momentum are on our side. This is where our determination and confidence lie.' ‘When have there not been difficulties? We tackle them one by one, year after year, and the Chinese nation has been doing this for over 5,000 years. Overcoming challenges is crucial to boosting confidence.' General Secretary Xi Jinping's profound expositions contain a profound ‘grand historical perspective'. Based on the ‘grand historical perspective', we can more deeply understand that the ‘long-term positive fundamentals of the Chinese economy have not changed and will not change'.- ，，、、。、，。-，。--，，，。--？，、，5000。，。-，--。--，--。 The second section calls to accurately grasp the focus of policy measures. First the section talks about investments in water conservancy projects. It says that from January to August this year, national investment in water conservancy construction reached 801.94 billion yuan, an increase of 10.7% compared to the high level of the same period last year, setting a new record. The number of water conservancy projects implemented and the number of jobs created both exceeded those of the same period last year, making significant contributions to promoting sustained economic growth and stable development. Among these, more than 7,800 water conservancy construction projects were arranged with newly issued national bonds, with investments of 303.77 billion yuan completed. 18，8019.4，10.7%，，、，。，7800，3037.7. -As the external environment becomes more complex and severe, the role of domestic demand in ensuring China's stable economic growth has become more prominent. 700 billion yuan in central budget investment has already been allocated, and all of the 700 billion yuan designated for ‘two major' constructions from the 1 trillion yuan of ultra long-term special government bonds has been fully allocated to projects…Since the beginning of this year, the proactive fiscal policy has been moderately strengthened and improved in quality and efficiency. The role of government investment has been leveraged and efforts have been intensified to lay the foundation, benefit the long-term, make up for shortcomings, and adjust the structure. High-quality investment is becoming an important driving force for promoting high-quality development. Additionally, the 300 billion yuan in national bond funds supporting the ‘two new' initiatives has been fully allocated, providing stronger support for expanding domestic demand. ，。7000，1--7000……，、，，、、、，。，--3000，. -To strive to complete the annual economic and social development goals and tasks, we must increase the intensity of countercyclical policy adjustments, strengthen the overall coordination and systematic integration of macroeconomic policies such as fiscal and tax policy, monetary and financial policy, investment and consumption, and income distribution; strengthen the coordinated innovation of policy tools, grasp the timing and effectiveness of policy implementation, amplify the policy combination effect, and enhance the consistency of macroeconomic policy orientation.- ，，、、、，，，，. The article then signals support for the private economy, by talking about the release of the draft Private Economy Promotion Law, which is open for public comments until November 8. The article also mentions the issuance of living allowances to people. It also references the Guidelines of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Implementing the Employment First Strategy. It says that this is the first time since the new era that the central government has issued a guiding document to promote employment. Also, in order to achieve the goals for the year, the article calls to maintain -the bottom line of people's livelihood, strengthen assistance and support for low-income people, ensure the supply and price stability of important materials such as food and water, electricity, gas and heat, and effectively ensure food and agricultural production to ensure national food security.- The final section of the article calls on everyone to take on responsibilities and act. The goal is to break through the -stubborn diseases of formalism and bureaucratism.- -Reform the defects in thinking, eliminate chronic problems in work style, and promote a spirit of practical action. In the current situation, to truly enhance the sense of responsibility and urgency in doing economic work well, we must resolutely overcome simplistic thinking, inertial thinking, and responsibility-avoiding thinking, and use ideological breakthroughs to promote practical action and responsibility-taking. Resolutely break the negative mindset of ‘just getting by without striving for excellence' in doing work, and discard the selfish attitude of ‘not taking risks, taking up fewer tasks'; resolutely eliminate the dependency on ‘first consulting the old almanacs (sort of like resorting to past experiences)' when encountering issues, and discard the lax approach of ‘lying flat and watching, being conservative and procrastinating'; resolutely break the stability-seeking mentality of ‘first thinking about avoiding responsibility, not thinking about taking responsibility' when doing things, and discard the mistaken understanding that ‘doing more leads to more mistakes, doing less leads to fewer mistakes, doing nothing leads to no mistakes'... Great winds and waves are precisely the touchstones for testing responsibility and commitment. Setting good benchmarks for selecting and appointing people, and encouraging cadres to better assume responsibilities, can cultivate firm doers and pragmatists for the construction of Chinese-style modernization, achieve success through overcoming difficulties, open up paths in daring to forge ahead, and develop a bright future for China's economy through unremitting struggle.- 、、。，，、、，。-、-，-、-；--，-、-；-、-，-、、-……，。，，、，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily While on the economy, I am still catching up with the developments of the past 10 days or so. Anyway, Caixin reports: China's finance ministry on Saturday announced policies for local governments to buy land and housing from property developers, and promised intensive support to help localities with their hidden debts… ‘Countercyclical' fiscal measures are ‘by no means' limited to those announced Saturday, Finance Minister Lan Foan said at a press conference on the same day, adding that policymakers are studying other policy tools. For example, the central government has a ‘relatively large' amount of room to increase its deficit and issue more debt, he noted…Tools including local government special-purpose bonds (SPBs), special funds and tax policies will be used in tandem to arrest the slide in the real estate market, Lan said. The central government will allow local authorities to tap their SPB proceeds, mainly used for funding government projects, to buy back undeveloped land from developers, according to Liao Min, a vice finance minister. In some regions, SPB proceeds can also be used to increase the reserve of land for sale, Liao said.- On local government debts, the report adds: -At the press briefing, Lan said that the central government had allowed local governments to use bond quotas of 1.2 trillion yuan ($170 billion) and more than 2.2 trillion yuan in 2024 and 2023, respectively, to resolve hidden debt and pay overdue arrears to businesses. He added that the central government will step up support for local governments to deal with their debts by expanding the quota for swapping off-the-books for on-the-books debt. This will be a one-time expansion of a ‘relatively large scale,' the minister said, noting that it can free up more energy and fiscal resources for local governments to develop their economies and improve the welfare of residents. ‘This forthcoming policy will be the most significant measure introduced in recent years to support (hidden) debt resolution,' Lan said, noting that it will be detailed after going through legal procedures. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) also pledged to issue special treasury bonds to help major state-owned commercial banks supplement their core capital. The program is already in the works, Liao said. A cross-department work group, including the MOF, is waiting for banks to hand in their capital injection plans, he said, noting that the lenders will publish their plans according to rules for listed companies.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 2: There is a confirmation that Li will be heading to Pakistan for the SCO Council of Heads of Government meeting. Also, there is a brief report informing that Li Xiaoxin, who is the deputy chief of the Organisation Department, led a delegation to Russia from October 9 to 12. Page 3: There's a report with data on China's shipbuilding industry. It says: -From January to September, the shipbuilding completion volume was 36.34 million deadweight tons, an increase of 18.2% year-on-year; new orders were 87.11 million deadweight tons, an increase of 51.9% year-on-year; and as of the end of September, the backlog of orders was 193.30 million deadweight tons, an increase of 44.3% year-on-year. From January to September, China's three major shipbuilding indicators accounted for 55.1%, 74.7% and 61.4% of the global total in terms of deadweight tons.- Subscribe now Page 8: There is an article by Yang Wanming, Party Secretary and President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC). He is writing in the context of Xi's speech recently marking the 70th anniversary of the CPAFFC. In that speech, Xi had said: -People are the creators of history, and building a community with a shared future for mankind is the future of the people of all countries in the world. China is willing to strengthen friendly exchanges with friends from all countries, give full play to the unique role of people-to-people diplomacy, and work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind.- He had then made three points: First, we should build a broad consensus on promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind in the spirit of ‘shared responsibility as dwellers of the same planet'…China is willing to work with all countries in the world to promote the common values ​​of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom, advocate an equal and orderly multi-polar world and an inclusive economic globalization that benefits all, and make the planet Earth a peaceful, friendly and harmonious home for all-. --，。，，。--，--。，，，。，、、、、、，、、、，、，、、. Second, we must gather a strong force to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind through the concept of win-win cooperation. The Communist Party of China is a party that seeks happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation. It is also a party that seeks progress for mankind and world harmony. I proposed the building of a community with a shared future for mankind and the GDI, GSI and GCI, all in order to promote the building of a better world and create a better life for people of all countries. The practice of building a community with a shared future for mankind for more than 10 years has brought many inspirations. One of the important ones is that only through win-win cooperation can we accomplish things, do good things, and do great things. China does not pursue self-centered modernization, and welcomes more foreign friends to actively participate in China's modernization process. The country is committed to providing new opportunities for global development with its achievements in modernization, and promoting a global modernization that features peaceful development, mutually beneficial cooperation and common prosperity to better benefit people of all countries.- ，。、，、。、、，，。10，，、、。，。，，，、、，. Third, with an open and inclusive mindset, we should embrace all civilizations to build a community with a shared future for humanity…Harmony while maintaining diversity is the law governing the occurrence and development of all things, as well as the principle behind the transmission and development of human civilization. Mutual exchange and learning are essential requirements for the advancement of civilization and serve as important driving forces for the progress of human civilization, as well as for world peace and development. Chinese civilization is an open system formed in constant exchange and mutual learning with other civilizations, and remains ever new through its inclusiveness. The Chinese nation is an open and inclusive nation, and the Chinese people are kind and friendly people. China is willing to work with all parties to practice the GCI, promote a view of civilization that emphasizes equality, mutual learning, dialogue, and inclusiveness, enhance understanding and deepen friendship through sincere communication, transcend civilizational barriers through civilizational exchanges, transcend civilizational conflicts through civilizational mutual learning, and promote the world to develop in the direction of a community with a shared future. ，。-，。-，。，。，。，。，，、、、，，、，、，. In the article today, Yang writes that more than 300 international friends from nearly 100 countries attended the CPAFFC anniversary event. He writes that over the years the association has established -friendly exchange and cooperation relationships with over 400 organizations and institutions in more than 150 countries, coordinated and promoted the establishment of over 3,000 pairs of friendly city (province/state) relationships between China and more than 140 countries, and built a ‘circle of friends' and ‘network of partners' spanning five continents…- ，。、，150400，1403000（），----，----，、. It has coordinated and mobilised resources from international friendly cities, multinational corporations, friendly organizations, and various other sectors. It has promoted the establishment of diverse mechanisms for local exchanges between China and foreign countries and vigorously advanced pragmatic cooperation in fields such as trade, education, technology, culture, ecology, health, poverty alleviation, and human resources training, etc… ，。，、、，，、、、、、、、，，. Yang concludes with a few points for work going forward: We will work with friends from various countries to build more bridges for people-to-people exchanges, give full play to the role of friendly organisations as communication channels, continue to consolidate old friends and make new friends, enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the people of China and people of other countries, and lay a solid foundation for social public opinion of friendship between China and foreign countries. We will work with friends from all over the world to build more bridges of pragmatic cooperation, give full play to the role of international sister cities as cooperation platforms, mobilize resources and strengths in various fields at home and abroad, constantly innovate cooperation methods, expand cooperation fields, and enhance cooperation effectiveness, so that local and sister cities cooperation can better benefit people of all countries. We will work with friends from all countries to build more bridges for cultural exchanges, give full play to the role of cultural exchanges as a bond to link hearts and enhance friendship, carry out wide-ranging, in-depth and diversified cultural exchanges and mutual learning activities between China and foreign countries, inspiring mutual resonance of hearts, and promoting the ‘heart-to-heart communication, emotional bonding, and strength gathering' of the Chinese and foreign people. We will work with friends from various countries to build more bridges for youth friendship, fully leveraging the fundamental and long-term role of youth exchanges in the development of relations between countries, inviting more foreign youth to come to China, encouraging more Chinese youth to go out into the world, and striving to cultivate successors for the cause of friendship between Chinese and foreign people. ——，，，，、，，。——，，，，，、、，。——，，，、，、、，，-、、-。——，，，，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Former Taiwan president Tsai ing-wen is in Europe. She will be visiting the Czech Republic and Brussels. She was also expected to travel to London, but that seems to have been cancelled -due to the British Foreign Office, which worried that such a visit could compromise Foreign Secretary David Lammy's first official visit to China next week.- Meanwhile, Xinhua reports that the Eastern Theater Command has just launched its ‘Joint Sword-2024B' drills in the Taiwan Strait and the north, south and east of the island of Taiwan. -Li Xi, spokesperson for the theater command, said the drills involve vessels and planes closing in on the island from multiple directions and assaults by joint forces. The drills focus on joint sea-air combat readiness patrol, the blockade and control of key ports and areas, strikes on sea and land targets, and the seizure of comprehensive battlefield control, so as to test the joint real-combat capabilities of the forces of the command, Li said. The drills are a powerful deterrent to the separatist activities of ‘Taiwan independence' elements, and are legitimate and necessary actions to safeguard national sovereignty and national unity, Li said.- This comes after President Lai Ching-te's Double Tenth speech. Some key remarks: The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are not subordinate to each other. On this land, democracy and freedom are growing and thriving. The People's Republic of China has no right to represent Taiwan. Taiwan is resolved in our commitment to upholding peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and achieving global security and prosperity. We are willing to work with China on addressing climate change, combatting infectious diseases, and maintaining regional security to pursue peace and mutual prosperity for the well-being of the people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. For a long time now, countries around the world have supported China, invested in China, and assisted China in joining the World Trade Organization, thereby promoting China's economic development and enhancing its national strength. This was done out of the hope that China would join the rest of the world in making global contributions, that internally it would place importance on the livelihoods of the people, and that externally it would maintain peace. As we stand here today, international tensions are on the rise, and each day countless innocents are suffering injuries or losing their lives in conflict. We hope that China will live up to the expectations of the international community, that it will apply its influence and work with other countries toward ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East. And we hope that it will take up its international responsibilities and, along with Taiwan, contribute to the peace, security, and prosperity of the region and the globe. In an era when the international landscape is becoming increasingly chaotic, Taiwan will become more calm, more confident, and stronger; it will become a force for regional peace, stability, and prosperity. I believe that a stronger democratic Taiwan is not only the ideal of our 23 million people, but also the expectation of the international community. Beijing responded with anger. There's this latest Xinhua commentary, which says: -Recently, Lai continued to brazenly preach his ‘two states' claim, openly clamoring that ‘Taiwan has sovereignty' and that ‘the People's Republic of China (PRC) has no right to represent Taiwan'...The Taiwan regional leader repeatedly referred to the mainland as ‘China.' He has been playing with concepts and confusing right and wrong. By attempting to highlight the political differences between the two sides of the Strait and break up their historical ties, Lai fabricated the false concept that ‘the Republic of China equals Taiwan' out of thin air to further advance his ‘Taiwan independence' plot. Lai has been indulging in outright secessionist and blatantly provocative remarks. Certainly, his increasingly hostile words lead nowhere, only escalating tensions and undermining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. If Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities continue going against the historical trend and pursuing their separatist line, they would plunge people in Taiwan into serious calamity.- Subscribe now	https://trackingpeoplesdaily.substack.com/p/china-vietnam-deals-taiwan-drills	2024-10-13T19:42:29-07:00	
Xi on Ethnic Affairs Policy - PRC's 75th Anniversary - Li Calls to Accelerate Economic Measures - Friends for Peace Group on Ukraine - China's Afghan ...	Hi folks, I hope this finds everyone well. I wanted to begin with a brief announcement. I will be in Washington DC all of next week, starting October 7th. It would be really good to catch up with subscribers. So if you are in town during the week, please do drop me a line as an email response to this edition and we can schedule something. I will also be taking a break from the regular newsletter, given the holidays in China. Of course, as always, I'll try and cover any major developments or pieces that might be published. Cheers, Manoj Before we get to today's edition, let me cover Xi Jinping's remarks at the National Conference on Commending Models for Ethnic Unity and Progress. The entire speech was published in Saturday's edition of the paper. Xi had a lot of praise for the Party's policies: He said that the Party had combined -Marxist ethnic theory with the specific realities of China's ethnic issues and with the best of traditional Chinese culture, creatively blazing a right path with Chinese characteristics to solve ethnic issues. On this path, the CPC has united and led the people of all ethnic groups in the country to achieve national independence and people's liberation, creating a new situation of developing equal, united, mutually supportive, and harmonious relations among all ethnic groups. It has promoted unprecedented progress in the economic and social development in ethnic regions and improved their lives. China's ethnic minorities, regions of ethnic groups, relations between different ethnic groups, and the Chinese nation have undergone profound and historic changes.- 。，、，。，，，，、、、. He added that since the 18th Party Congress, the Party has -continuously promoted the sinicization and modernization of Marxist ethnic theory, and clearly proposed to make the forging of a strong sense of community of the Chinese nation the main line of the Party's ethnic work in the new era and the main line of all work in ethnic regions, formed the Party's important thought on strengthening and improving ethnic work, promoted ethnic regions to join the other parts of the country in securing a victory in the fight against poverty, finished the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and embarked on a new journey to build China into a modern socialist country in all respects…- ，，，、，，、，，。 Practice has proven that the path of solving ethnic issues with Chinese characteristics is completely correct. This path: focuses on the fundamental interests and overall interests of the Chinese nation, unites all ethnic groups to the greatest extent, and realises the common struggle and common prosperity of all ethnic groups; insists on the equality of all ethnic groups, opposes ethnic oppression and discrimination, and ensures that people of all ethnic groups truly obtain equal political rights and jointly become masters of their own country; correctly grasps the relationship between maintaining national unity and implementing ethnic regional autonomy, insists on combining unity with autonomy, and ethnic factors with regional factors, and promotes the Chinese nation to become a more cohesive and unified community with a shared future. ，。，，、；，，、；，、，、。 In the next bit, Xi talks about 5000 years of history and the creation of China as -a unified multi-ethnic country-. He says that the -formation and development of the Chinese nation community is the will of the people, the general trend, and the historical inevitability.- He makes five points to elaborate on this. First, -the intermingling of bloodlines of all ethnic groups has laid the historical foundation for the formation and development of a community for the Chinese nation.- He added: -History has fully proven that the Chinese nation is the result of long-term interaction, exchange, and integration among all ethnic groups. Only by continuously uniting and integrating, and consciously joining the big family of the Chinese nation, can all ethnic groups enjoy a brighter future.- ，。，，、，、，、。，，、，. Second, the shared convictions of all ethnic groups have served as the endogenous driving force for the founding of a unified multi-ethnic country. Since ancient times, the Chinese nation has adhered to the concepts of ‘the six directions share the same customs, the nine regions are interconnected' and ‘there is great harmony under heaven', and regarded great unification as ‘the eternal principle of heaven and earth and the common truth of ancient and modern times'. Since the Qin Dynasty unified China, regardless of which ethnic group ruled the central plains, all have taken the unification of the country as their mission, firmly believing in the common principle that the nation's territory must not be divided, the country must not fall into chaos, ethnic groups must not be scattered, and civilization must not be interrupted. History has fully proven that our unified, multi-ethnic country was jointly created by all ethnic groups and must be jointly safeguarded, consolidated, and developed by them. ，。-，-，-。，，，、、、。，，、. (Note: This is an important paragraph, which allows for building the narrative of continuity with the rule of the Yuan and Qing dynasties or Mongol and Manchu rule.) Third, the cultural connections among all ethnic groups are the cultural genes that have shaped the pluralistic and integrated civilization of the Chinese nation. The cultures of all ethnic groups have learned from and integrated with one another, gradually transcending regional, ancestral, and religious boundaries. This process has converged to form a Chinese culture with strong cohesion and appeal, shaping the unified yet diverse framework of Chinese civilization. History has fully proven that the brilliant Chinese culture was jointly created by all ethnic groups. To forge the new glory of socialist culture, we must continuously enhance identification with Chinese culture and further promote mutual learning and integration among the cultures of all ethnic groups. ，。、，、、，，。，，，. Fourth, the economic interdependence of all ethnic groups is the powerful force for building a unified economy. Our country has a vast territory, and the resource endowments of different regions each have their own characteristics, with strong economic complementarity and a high degree of interdependence. All ethnic groups have consistently maintained economic ties characterised by mutual exchange and mutual benefit, which has significantly strengthened the overall national power and promoted the formation and development of the Chinese national community. History has fully proved that only by continuously integrating into the overall development of the country and strengthening economic exchanges and cooperation can all regions and ethnic groups better promote national economic prosperity and better realise their own economic development. ，。，，、。、，，。，、，、. Fifth, the emotional bonds among all ethnic groups are the strong ties that bind the Chinese nation as one family. Harmonious coexistence, brotherhood, and mutual assistance have always been the mainstream of ethnic relations in our country. The close brotherly ties among various ethnic groups has left many heartwarming historical stories. Especially in the process of resisting foreign aggression, preventing division, and safeguarding unity, the people of all ethnic groups were unprecedentedly united, sharing a common hatred for the enemy, writing a magnificent epic of the Chinese nation's arduous struggles and earth-shaking greatness. History has fully proved that emotional closeness is a strong bond in the formation and development of the Chinese national community. All ethnic groups must cherish, continuously consolidate, and develop the socialist ethnic relations of equality, unity, mutual assistance, and harmony, and constantly strengthen the emotional foundation for building the Chinese national community. ，。、、，。、、，、，、。，，、，. Xi ended this section by stating that the common goal of all ethnic groups is the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Finally, Xi made five points about the tasks ahead in the -new era.- He said that -the central task of the Party and the country is to comprehensively promote the construction of a strong country and national rejuvenation through Chinese-style modernization. This requires the joint efforts of people of all ethnic groups across the country. We must comprehensively implement the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, especially the important thinking on strengthening and improving work on ethnic affairs, adhere to the main line of forging a strong sense of community of the Chinese nation, continuously promote the cause of national unity and progress, and promote the high-quality development of the Party's ethnic work.- ，、，。，，，. First, always adhere to the leadership of the Party and constantly consolidate the common ideological and political foundation for the unity and struggle of all ethnic groups. The CPC is the leading core of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the most reliable backbone of all ethnic groups. We must guide the people of all ethnic groups to continuously enhance their identification with the great motherland, the Chinese nation, Chinese culture, the Communist Party of China, and socialism with Chinese characteristics, firmly establish the concept of a community of sharing weal and woe, honour and disgrace, life and death, and destiny, and work together to realise the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. ，，。，。、、、、，、、、，. Second, we should focus on building a shared spiritual home for the Chinese nation, providing strong spiritual and cultural support for advancing the construction of the Chinese national community. To build a spiritual home shared by the Chinese nation, we must enhance the recognition of Chinese culture. We should take the core socialist values ​​as the guide, deepen the education of patriotism, collectivism, and socialism, and guide the people of all ethnic groups to firmly establish a correct view of the state, history, ethnicity, culture and religions. We should strengthen the historical and cultural education of young people, comprehensively promote the popularisation of the national common language and characters, and comprehensively promote the use of state-approved textbooks, so as to instil the sense of community of the Chinese nation into the hearts of children from an early age. ，，。。，、、，、、、、。，，，. Third, accelerate the high-quality development of ethnic regions and solidly promote the common prosperity of all ethnic groups. To promote Chinese-style modernization and achieve common prosperity, no ethnic group can be left behind. We must support ethnic regions to accelerate their integration into the overall national development and promote closer economic integration and integration among all regions. Ethnic regions must fully and accurately implement the new development concept, continue to deepen reform and opening up, vigorously develop characteristic and advantageous industries, and develop new quality productive forces according to local conditions. We must adhere to the safeguarding and improving people's livelihoods in the process of development, enhance the balance and accessibility of basic public services, do more practical things that conform to the will of the people, benefit the people's livelihood, and warm the hearts of the people, and continuously meet the yearning of people of all ethnic groups for a better life. ，，。、，。，、。，，，。，，、、，. Fourth, promote the all-round integration of all ethnic groups and actively promote exchanges and integration among all ethnic groups. Extensive interactions, exchanges, and integration are important ways to advance the construction of the Chinese national community. We must coordinate economic and social development planning and public resource allocation, strengthen the construction of infrastructure such as transportation in border areas and ethnic minority areas, actively promote people-oriented new urbanization, and promote the mobility and integration of all ethnic groups in an orderly manner. Build an interwoven social structure and community environment, continuously broaden the practical paths for the all-round integration of various ethnic groups, and promote their close unity like the seeds of a pomegranate. ，，。。，，，。，，. Fifth, govern ethnic affairs in accordance with the law, continually improve the capacity and level of governance in ethnic affairs. We must uphold and improve the system of regional ethnic autonomy, gradually refine relevant laws and regulations as well as differentiated regional support policies, and ensure the legal rights and interests of people from all ethnic groups. We should strengthen legal education and public awareness, guiding people of all ethnic groups to enhance their national consciousness, civic consciousness, and legal consciousness. ，，。，，。，、、. Towards the end, Xi stresses this: -Addressing China's ethnic issues is our internal affairs, and no external forces have the right to interfere. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people have found the correct path to solving ethnic issues with Chinese characteristics, and we do not need anyone else to point fingers at us or act as an ‘instructor'. We must resolutely oppose all attempts to infiltrate, sabotage, slander, contain and suppress our country by using ethnicity, religion and other issues. We must strengthen the research and propaganda of the history of the Chinese nation and the theory of the Chinese national community, actively carry out foreign cultural exchanges, and tell the story of the Chinese nation community well.- ，。，、--。、、、。，，。 Share Tracking People's Daily Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, September 30, 2024. Page 1: The entire front page today is dedicated to events marking the 75th anniversary of the founding of the PRC. Xi awarded the highest state honours during the event. Four people, including veteran war hero Huang Zongde and medical scientist Wang Zhenyi, were awarded the Medal of the Republic. Ten individuals, including border patrolman Bayika Kalidibek, technician Xu Zhenchao, and acclaimed actress Tian Hua, were awarded national honorary titles. Dilma Rousseff, former Brazilian president and president of the New Development Bank, received the Friendship Medal. Xi also delivered a speech. Xi said that the -great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered an irreversible historical process-. Xinhua English has a decent summation of the key points: -Xi emphasized the need to bear in mind the ambition of making the country greater. ‘We should be loyal to the country, love the country, integrate personal development goals into the overall national development, and realize personal value in fulfilling duties for the country and serving the people,' he said. He encouraged the Chinese people to hone their skills and contribute to building a strong China. He urged them to strive for extraordinary achievements in ordinary job posts, and contribute to overcoming challenges related to development and reform while safeguarding social harmony and stability. ‘A great era calls for heroes and fosters heroes. A galaxy of heroes emerging generation after generation will ensure the lasting success of the Party and the people's cause,' Xi remarked.- Subscribe now Another report on the page informs of a concert to mark the 75th anniversary of the PRC's founding. Finally, there's a report telling us that a new official compilation of the chronicle of events during the New Democratic Revolution period (1921 to 1949) has been published. Page 3: There's a report on the State Council's executive meeting. The report said that the meeting sought to -study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech on the current economic situation and economic work at the meeting of the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee, and to study and deploy the implementation of a package of incremental policies.- 929，，. -The meeting emphasised that it is necessary to unify thoughts and actions with the scientific judgement of the Party Central Committee on the economic situation, implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee, implement the policies and measures that have been clarified, effectively implement macroeconomic control, promote the coordinated efforts of various policies, focus on addressing prominent issues in economic operation, and strive to achieve the goals and tasks of economic and social development for the entire year.- ，，，，，，，，. For each policy, there must be a clear division of responsibilities, and the pace of implementation should be accelerated. Policies that are relatively mature should be implemented immediately, while those that need further refinement should be worked on urgently, introducing them in batches as they become ready. All departments should not avoid difficulties or shirk responsibilities, but form a strong synergy in their work. At the same time, new incremental policies should be studied promptly in response to changing situations. In-depth investigations and research should be conducted, paying attention to opinions from all sides, to continuously optimise and improve policy measures. It is necessary to strengthen policy interpretation to better build consensus and enhance confidence. ，，，、。、，。，，。，，。，、. The meeting deployed relevant measures to accelerate the implementation of 102 major projects in the 14th FYP. The meeting pointed out that the implementation of 102 major projects during the 14th FYP period is an important deployment made by the Party Central Committee coordinating immediate and long-term needs. It is necessary to focus on the overall implementation of major projects, further consolidate the responsibilities of all parties, strengthen departmental coordination and central-local linkage, strengthen financial support and factor resource guarantees, address difficulties and bottlenecks, and ensure that the construction of major projects achieves the expected results. --102。，--102，。，，，，，. The meeting also discussed the construction of a universal childcare service system, and heard a report on progress in building up China's strength in intellectual property rights. On IPR, the meeting called to -strengthen the support of intellectual property rights for key core technology research, carry out special actions for patent transformation and application, implement the construction project of the intellectual property protection system, and provide strong support for achieving scientific and technological self-reliance and promoting high-quality development.- The draft revisions to the law on science and technology popularization and the law against unfair competition were discussed and approved in principle. Also on the page is a report on the State Council approving a set of revised regulations for commending fallen heroes. As per Xinhua, -the revised regulations stipulate improved criteria and assessment procedures for identifying martyrs, better financial support and preferential treatment for their families, and strengthened protection and management of their memorial facilities. The revised regulations also highlight the need to strengthen the dissemination of martyrs' heroic deeds and improve the protocols when paying homage to them. The revised regulations will take effect on Jan. 1, 2025.- Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on Wang Yi's remarks at the UNGA general debate. The full English text is available on the MFA website. Key points: What China proposes is to uphold peaceful coexistence and put in place a security architecture that ensures enduring stability; uphold openness and inclusiveness and foster a development paradigm that promotes shared prosperity; uphold harmony without uniformity and adopt an approach to civilizations that promotes exchange and mutual learning; and uphold fairness and justice and develop a governance structure that pools strengths for shared benefit. In today's world, the security of all countries is tied together. In face of various kinds of global challenges and risks, no one can stay immune or enjoy security alone. Countries need to be guided by a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. We should respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, take the legitimate security concerns of others seriously, and resolve disputes and differences through dialogue and consultation. We should actively explore a path for major countries to coexist in peace, and work for a new type of international relations characterized by mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation. Achieving modernization is a legitimate right of the people of all countries, not a prerogative of a few. We should be committed to advancing global modernization, and ensure that no one and no country is left behind on the journey toward modernization. We should advocate a universally beneficial and inclusive globalization, unequivocally oppose unilateralism and protectionism, and help developing countries leap over the development divide, to maintain the vitality of global economic growth. President Xi Jinping pointed out that there is no such thing as a superior or inferior civilization, and civilizations are different only in identity and location. We should respect the diversity of civilizations, and strive to replace estrangement and clash of civilizations with exchanges and mutual learning. We should advocate humanity's common values, namely, peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, refrain from conducting values-oriented diplomacy, and oppose ideology-based confrontation. We should respect each other as equals, and help each other succeed with an inclusive mind. As a large number of Global South nations are growing with a strong momentum, gone are the days when one or two major powers call the shots on everything. We should advocate an equal and orderly multipolar world, and see that all countries, regardless of their size, have their own place and role in the multipolar system. We should practice true multilateralism, oppose hegemonism and power politics, and make international relations more democratic. We should follow the principle of extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefit, and make global governance more just and equitable. Share Tracking People's Daily On Ukraine, Wang said: -An end to the Ukraine crisis remains elusive. The top priority is to commit to ‘no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no provocation by any party,' and push for deescalation of the situation as soon as possible. China is committed to playing a constructive role, engaging in shuttle mediation and promoting talks for peace, not throwing oil on the fire or exploiting the situation for selfish gains. At this session of the General Assembly, China, Brazil and other Global South countries have jointly launched the group of Friends for Peace. Its very purpose is to uphold the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, build consensus for a political settlement of the crisis and contribute to a prospect of peace. The meeting of this group was chaired by the Chinese and Brazilians. 17 other ‘Global South' countries attended the meeting. At this meeting, Wang Yi said that: -The ‘Friends of Peace' platform is not about taking sides in the conflict, engaging in bloc confrontation, or replacing existing platforms. They hope to rely on the United Nations to bring together more Global South countries and send more objective, balanced and rational voices, so as to accumulate conditions and create an atmosphere for a ceasefire, an end to hostilities and the resumption of peace talks. The ‘Friends of Peace' platform is open and welcomes the joining of more like-minded countries, in particular, Global South countries.- He added: -China hopes that the parties involved will consider resuming peace talks at an appropriate time, meet each other halfway in their dialogue, and seek common ground while shelving differences in their negotiations, fairly discuss all peace plans, and promote the establishment of a new security architecture.- He also called for -peaceful coexistence- and said that -it is necessary to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries, observe the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, value the legitimate security concerns of all countries, and ensure the legitimate living space of all ethnic groups.- A joint communique was issued by Algeria, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Mexico, South Africa, Türkiye, and Zambia. Subscribe now Back to Wang's comments at the UNGA debate. On Palestine, he said that -might must not take the place of justice.- He called for a -comprehensive ceasefire- and Palestinian statehood and full UN membership. On Afghanistan, he said that -it is important to help Afghanistan exercise prudent governance, fight terrorism effectively, improve people's life and reinvigorate the economy, to open up a better future for the Afghan people.- Interestingly, at the sidelines of the UNGA, there was a meeting between China, Russia, Pakistan and Iran on Afghanistan. Wang Yi made four points at this meeting: First, build security together. Closely track the movements of terrorist organizations entrenched in Afghanistan, strengthen intelligence exchange and sharing, and expand law enforcement and security cooperation. Fully utilize the anti-terrorism security collaboration functions of platforms such as the Foreign Ministers' Meeting of Afghanistan's Neighboring Countries and the SCO to jointly address risks and challenges, and ultimately achieve the goal of eradicating violent extremist groups within Afghanistan. 。，，。、，，. Second, implement comprehensive measures. Jointly implement the ‘Tunxi Initiative' to support Afghanistan's reconstruction, help Afghanistan cultivate self-development capabilities through deepening regional economic and trade investment, interconnectivity, and major project cooperation. Support the SCO in playing a greater role in Afghan issues, support the UN in coordinating the international community to stabilize and assist Afghanistan, help Afghanistan improve its humanitarian predicament, and promote reconstruction and development. 。--，、，。，，，. Third, uphold justice. Make Afghanistan a platform for cooperation among all parties, not a venue for geopolitical games. US actions of cutting off aid, freezing assets, and imposing sanctions on Afghanistan are key factors preventing substantial improvement in Afghanistan's economic and livelihood difficulties. The US should use the seized Afghan overseas assets to support Afghanistan in alleviating livelihood difficulties, developing alternative crops to drugs, and resettling returning refugees. 。，。、、，。，，. Fourth, provide positive guidance. Encourage the international community to focus on the most pressing and urgent difficulties facing Afghanistan, promote Afghanistan's reconstruction and development in a constructive manner, and guide the Afghan governing authorities to improve and strengthen the protection of the rights of women and children in an equal and respectful way. Strengthen the exchange of governance experiences with Afghanistan in a flexible manner, encourage the Islamic world, especially Gulf countries, to exert special influence, and support Afghanistan in exploring a modernization path that aligns with the requirements of the times and the wishes of the people. 。，，。，，. Subscribe now Back to Wang's UNGA speech. He added -the Korean Peninsula should not experience war again. The important thing is to make persistent effort for deescalation, commit to seeking solutions through dialogue and consultation, realize a transition from the armistice to a peace mechanism, and safeguard peace and stability on the Peninsula.- Wang also said this about Asia: -China is deeply aware that Asia needs stability and development and opposes division and conflict. As an important origin of human civilization and a key engine of global growth, Asia has the wisdom and capability to stabilize the situation through regional cooperation and handle differences properly through dialogue and consultation. We are firmly against the meddling by countries outside the region, and will resolutely resist attempts by any force to stoke trouble and confrontation in the region.- After this, Wang pitched GDI, GSI and GCI. He then said: In the face of unilateral, bullying acts such as sanctions and blockade, China firmly supports countries in defending their legitimate rights, upholding the equity and openness of the international system, making global development more coordinated and beneficial for all, and jointly opposing technology blockade and rejecting decoupling or severing supply chains. Sanctions and pressure will not bring monopolistic advantages. Suppressing and containing others will not solve problems at home. The right of people of all countries to pursue a better life should not be taken away. Here, we once again urge the United States to completely lift its blockade, sanctions and terrorism-related designation against Cuba. On environmental issues, he said: -At the global level, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities must be upheld, and the Paris Agreement must be implemented in earnest. Developed countries should assist developing countries in building their capacity to cope with climate change. Touting the need of climate response while suppressing the green industries of others will only hold back global progress in green transition.- On AI governance, he said: -We are working to explore and establish widely-recognized international rules and standards. China supports the U.N.'s role as the main channel for global AI governance and is committed to strengthening international cooperation on AI capacity-building-. On human rights, he said: -China maintains that all countries' right to independently choose their path of human rights development should be respected. No country should impose its own will on others, or arbitrarily interfere in others' internal affairs citing human rights as an excuse.- After this, there's a big chunk on Taiwan: -Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. This is the history and the reality. Both the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation stated in explicit terms that all the territories Japan had stolen from the Chinese, such as Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, shall be restored to China, and this constitutes an important part of the post-war international order. Right here in this august hall 53 years ago, the 26th session of the U.N. General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758 with an overwhelming majority, deciding to restore all the rights of the People's Republic of China at the U.N., to recognize the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate representatives of China to the U.N., and to expel forthwith the representatives of the Taiwan region from the U.N. and all the organizations related to it. Once and for all, the resolution resolved the issue of the representation of the whole of China, including Taiwan, in the U.N. It made clear that there is no such thing as ‘two Chinas,' or ‘one China, one Taiwan.' On this matter of principle, there is no gray zone or room for ambiguity. The complete reunification of China will be achieved. Taiwan will eventually return to the embrace of the motherland. This is the overwhelming trend of history that no one and no force can stop.- Share Tracking People's Daily The final bit in the speech is about how China's modernization benefits the world. Moving on, Wang Yi also met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The Chinese readout says that the -two sides agreed that the meeting was candid and substantive, and that China and the United States need to find a way to live alongside one another in peace in the indefinite future…and agreed to maintain communication on international and regional hotspot issues, and hold a new round of consultations on Asia-Pacific affairs in due course.- Wang said that: -The stabilization of China-U.S. relations serves the interests of the two peoples and meets the expectation of the international community. Whether or not this momentum can be sustained depends on the efforts of both sides. The United States should not always approach China with two faces: On the one hand encircling and suppressing China brazenly, and on the other hand, having dialogue and cooperation with China as if nothing is wrong. Since the United States has expressed multiple times that it has no intention to have conflict with China, then fundamentally, it needs to establish a rational perception of China, and find the right way to get along with it. The United States needs to carry out dialogue with respect, advance cooperation in the spirit of reciprocity, and address differences with great prudence, rather than act willfully as it sees fit from a position of strength or use previous mistakes as excuses to make more mistakes.- -Wang Yi underscored that the intensifying ‘Taiwan independence' activities by Lai Ching-te and others pose the greatest danger to the situation across the Taiwan Strait. ‘Taiwan independence' and cross-Strait peace are irreconcilable. If the United States truly hopes to see peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, it should abide by the one-China principle, implement the three China-U.S. Joint Communiqués, stop arming Taiwan, publicly oppose ‘Taiwan independence', and support the peaceful reunification of China. Wang Yi said that China is firmly opposed to U.S. suppression in trade and technology. National security should not be politicized, and ‘small yard, high fence' should not become ‘big yard, iron curtain'. China will never accept finger-pointing by human rights preachers, still less interference in China's internal affairs under the pretext of human rights. People-to-people exchanges between the two countries are very important, and the United States should remove obstacles with real actions. Wang Yi articulated China's firm position on the South China Sea issue. He stressed that China remains committed to resolving differences through dialogue and consultation with countries directly concerned. The United States should not stir up trouble in the South China Sea, or undermine regional countries' efforts to safeguard peace and stability there. Wang Yi noted that China's position on the Ukraine issue is aboveboard. It has been committed to promoting talks for peace and has been making its efforts toward peaceful settlement. The United States should stop smearing, scapegoating and arbitrarily imposing sanctions on China, and stop using this issue to create antagonism and incite camp-based confrontation.- Share Tracking People's Daily The State Department said that the two had -candid, substantive, and productive discussions-. It adds: -Secretary Blinken underscored the United States' continued concern with PRC support for Russia's defense industrial base and war of aggression against Ukraine and made clear the need for the PRC to address Russia's threat to transatlantic security. He emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and raised concerns about the PRC's dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea. Secretary Blinken reiterated that it remains a top priority to resolve the cases of American citizens who are detained or subject to exit bans in China. He also raised human rights concerns, including with respect to Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong. The Secretary discussed concerns related to technology; U.S. policy remains designed to prevent advanced U.S. technologies from being used to undermine our national security. Both sides agreed to maintain contact, including on regional and global issues. Another important report is the one on Wang Yi's meeting with his South Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yul. Wang told him that: -As long as both sides adhere to the original intent of establishing diplomatic ties, remain committed to a friendly direction and pursue mutual benefit and win-win cooperation, it is believed that the China-South Korea relationship can continue to develop in a healthy and forward-looking manner. As close neighbors and important cooperation partners, China and South Korea should create favorable conditions for their respective development and the development of bilateral relations, Wang said. The deployment of U.S. intermediate-range missiles in the region undermines regional peace and stability and does not serve the interests of regional countries, Wang said, adding that war and chaos must not occur on the Korean Peninsula and maintaining peace and stability on the Peninsula is in the common interest of all parties. China will continue to mediate and promote talks, playing a constructive role in achieving long-term peace and stability on the Peninsula, he said.- For some context, Reuters' report informs: -The U.S. deployed the Typhon system, which can be equipped with cruise missiles capable of striking Chinese targets, this year. China has demanded its removal, and Russia has joined in condemning the first deployment of the system to the Indo-Pacific, accusing Washington of fuelling an arms race.- Subscribe now Page 10: There's a report on the PBOC and the National Financial Regulatory Administration announcing new measures (English report) to stabilize the real estate market. The mortgage rates for first homes, second homes and more are required to be reduced no lower than 30 basis points below the loan prime rate (LPR) by Oct. 31, 2024. In principle, 18 national commercial banks need to release their plans for adjustments before Oct. 12. The minimum down payment ratio for individuals' commercial housing mortgages will be lowered to no less than 15 percent for both first-home and second-home purchases. The central bank will increase funding for financial institutions if they issue loans to support local state-owned enterprises to acquire completed yet unsold commercial housing at reasonable prices for use as affordable housing. A Bloomberg report informs: On Sunday, the trading hub of Guangzhou became the first tier-1 city to remove all restrictions, saying it will stop reviewing homebuyer eligibility and no longer limit the number of homes owned. Both Shanghai and Shenzhen said they will allow more people to purchase residences in suburban areas, as well as allow others to buy more homes. Shanghai, China's financial hub, and Shenzhen, the southern city known for its tech industry, also announced they were lowering minimum downpayment ratios for first and second homes to 15% and 20%, respectively, in a bid to boost demand. The loosening in Shanghai and Shenzhen is slightly less than expected, while Guangzhou went further than anticipated, according to Jefferies Financial Group Inc. analysts including Shujin Chen. ‘We think the policies are unlikely to turn property prices around, but they could ease potential price declines,' Chen wrote in a note on Monday.- Finally, although it is not in the paper, do note this article about the Chinese, Russian coast guards jointly conducing drills and patrols in the high seas of the North Pacific Ocean. The report says: -The operation aimed to maintain order in high-seas fisheries. During the mission, the vessels also conducted joint exercises in search and rescue, damage control and locating illegal vessels, demonstrating the strong collaborative capabilities of the two coast guards.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Stimulating the Economy - Wang Yi's AI, GDI & BRICS Pitches - Wang Meets 'Old Friend of the Chinese People' Muhammad Yunus - China on Hopes for Ties w...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, September 27, 2024. Page 1: The lead story on the page is the readout from the Politburo's meeting on the economy. I covered this in yesterday's edition. Before I get to other reports, let me highlight the following: First, this really helpful graphic from Hutong Research. It lists the efforts at cash infusion. Second, this Reuters report summarises the steps being taken. On the heels of the Politburo huddle, China plans to issue special sovereign bonds worth about 2 trillion yuan ($284.43 billion) this year as part of fresh fiscal stimulus, two sources with knowledge of the matter have told Reuters. On Tuesday by Governor Pan Gongsheng, the People's Bank of China on Friday trimmed the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, known as the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), by 50 basis points, the second reduction this year. The move is expected to release 1 trillion yuan ($142.5 billion) in liquidity into the banking system and was accompanied by a cut in the benchmark interest rate on seven-day reverse repurchase agreements by 20 bps to 1.50%. Reuters reported on Thursday that 1 trillion yuan due to be raised via special bonds will be used to increase subsidies for a consumer goods replacement programme and for the upgrade of large-scale business equipment. They will also be used to provide a monthly allowance of about 800 yuan, or $114, per child to all households with two or more children, excluding the first child. China also aims to raise another 1 trillion yuan via a separate special sovereign debt issuance to help local governments tackle their debt problems. Third, today the PBOC has cut the interest rate of seven-day reverse repos from 1.7 percent to 1.5 percent. Xinhua reports that the interest rate of 14-day reverse repos and those of temporary repos and reverse repos will continue to be determined by the interest rate of seven-day reverse repos in the open market, and the range of adjustment will remain unchanged. The interest rate of 14-day reverse repos and those of temporary repos and reverse repos will continue to be determined by the interest rate of seven-day reverse repos in the open market, and the range of adjustment will remain unchanged. The central bank conducted 278 billion yuan (about 39.66 billion U.S. dollars) of 14-day reverse repos on Friday at an interest rate of 1.65 percent, 20 basis points lower than the previous day. A reverse repo is a process in which the central bank purchases securities from commercial banks through bidding, with an agreement to sell them back in the future. The central bank also announced a cut in the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points for financial institutions on Friday. Share Tracking People's Daily Okay, now back to the paper. The other main story is Xi Jinping's letter to the faculty and students of the Communication University of China on the occasion of its 70th anniversary. Xinhua reports: -Xi urged the university to take solid steps to implement the fundamental task of fostering virtues and educating people on the new journey in the new era. He emphasized the importance of focusing on the needs of the press and public communication, highlighting the university's distinctive features, deepening reform and innovation, and continuously improving its teaching and research capacity, in a bid to cultivate more high-caliber journalism and communication professionals and make new contributions to the development of the Party's cause concerning public communication and culture.- Next, there's a report on Wang Huning's meeting with Tanzila Narbayeva, chairperson of the Senate of Uzbekistan. Xinhua says: Wang said that -under the guidance of the two heads of state, the development of China-Uzbekistan relations has entered a new stage with fruitful cooperation in various fields. Following the important consensus reached by the two heads of state, China is ready to work with Uzbekistan to push for steady and long-term growth of the bilateral ties, Wang said. Wang noted that the CPPCC National Committee is willing to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with Uzbekistan to better serve the construction of their respective countries and the development of bilateral relations.- Among other things, Narbayeva said that Uzbekistan adheres to the one-China principle. Next, there's a report on Ding Xuexiang meeting with Nepal's Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel in Beijing. Xinhua reports: Ding -said that China and Nepal -- two nations linked by mountains and rivers -- have enjoyed lasting friendship, setting a fine example of equality and mutual benefits between countries of different sizes. He said that under the strategic guidance of the leaders of the two countries, China is ready to work with Nepal to deepen exchange and cooperation in various fields, build a high-quality Belt and Road, consolidate popular support for the bilateral friendship, and push China-Nepal relations to a higher level. Paudel said that Nepal abides firmly by the one-China principle, supports China steadfastly in safeguarding its core interests, and hopes to strengthen its exchange of governance experience with China and deepen practical cooperation in various fields.- Paudel also met with He Lifeng earlier. PTI reports that: -He assured Paudel that the Chinese government would accelerate the execution of previously announced projects, according to a press release issued by the Nepal Finance Ministry. The Communist Party leader also requested assistance from the northern neighbour in expanding direct air services from various Chinese cities to Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports…The two leaders discussed about advancing key infrastructure projects being implemented with China's assistance, such as the construction of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway, the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, the Kimathangka-Hile and Hilsa-Surkhet-Bhurigaun roads, Madan Bhandari Science and Technology University, and Damak Industrial Park. Chinese leader He underscored the importance of implementing the agreements to further strengthen the bilateral ties and also expressed his desire to expedite the development projects including infrastructure, transport and connectivity.- Subscribe now Next, there is a long article celebrating Xi's leadership of China's modernization drive. The piece refers to him as the people's leader. Also, there is another long article detailing the -record of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core in promoting the strengthening of the sense of community of the Chinese nation.- Page 3: Okay, back to Wang Yi in the US. Let me begin with his speech at the BRICS foreign ministers meeting. Wang called the BRICS the -leading force of the Global South-, which must work towards -promoting an equal and orderly world multipolarization and inclusive economic globalization.- -We must advocate common security and achieve lasting peace. In today's interdependent world, mankind is an indivisible security community. No country has the right to manipulate the global security agenda, let alone build its own security on the insecurity of other countries. We must make good use of mechanisms such as the BRICS Foreign Ministers' Meeting and the Meeting of High Representatives for Security Affairs to strengthen coordination on international and regional hotspot issues and jointly address various challenges. On the Ukraine issue, we must insist on preventing the spillover of conflict, avoiding the escalation of warfare, and preventing any party from fueling the fire. The crisis should be resolved through dialogue and negotiation. Brazil and China jointly issued the ‘Six-Point Consensus', which has received positive responses from more than 100 countries to varying degrees. On the Palestinian issue, China stands firmly with Arab countries. We must promote a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible, support Palestine to become a formal member of the United Nations, implement the ‘two-state solution', and achieve lasting peace in the Middle East.- ，。，。，。、，，。，、、，。--，100。，。、，，--，. We must prioritise development and solve development problems. Development is the eternal theme of human society and an important yardstick of progress in the era. President Xi Jinping proposed the GDI, which has been actively supported by the United Nations and the vast majority of developing countries. The BRICS should give full play to its own advantages, promote the development issue to be placed at the centre of the United Nations' work, pay attention to the practical difficulties of developing countries, urge developed countries to earnestly fulfil their commitments, and inject stronger impetus into the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We should focus on the urgent needs of developing countries in poverty reduction, development financing, energy and food security, seize the opportunities of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, and cultivate new momentum for high-quality development. ，。，。，。，，，，2030。、、，，. We must uphold multilateralism and improve global governance. When multilateralism is under attack, the world falls into chaos. When hegemonic behaviour runs rampant, human civilization regresses to the law of the jungle. We must firmly uphold the international system with the United Nations at its core and adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, opposing the practice of using multilateralism only when it is convenient and abandoning it when it is not. Taking the implementation of the outcomes of the Summit of the Future as an opportunity, we should promote reforms in the international financial architecture, support the full participation of southern countries in international economic decision-making, governance, and rule-making, and enhance their voice and representation. The resolution on Enhancing International Cooperation on Capacity-building of Artificial Intelligence jointly proposed by China and many southern countries has been overwhelmingly approved by the UN General Assembly, and we welcome BRICS countries to participate in its implementation so that developing countries can broadly benefit. ，。，。，。，，-，-。，，、，。--，，. He then talked about supporting Russia in hosting the BRICS summit in October. He also called to ‘create new landmark achievements in the fields of finance, artificial intelligence, energy and minerals to ensure that the BRICS+ cooperation can get off to a good start. We must also accelerate the completion of the work of setting up partner countries. This is the consensus reached by BRICS leaders at last year's Johannesburg Summit, and it is also the mission we should accomplish. Continue to open the door for expansion, to add vitality and momentum to BRICS development.- ，，、。，，、。、、，--、。，，，，、. If you are wondering what are the BRICS' specific processes and criteria for expansion, here is the document agreed upon in 2023. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, Wang's speech at an event called -Global Development Initiative Supports the Global South -- China in Action-. Wang said: -over the past three years since the inception of the GDI, it has evolved from a Chinese proposition to an international consensus, and from a cooperation concept to joint actions, contributing China's solutions and injecting Chinese strength into the implementation of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development…We held a High-level Dialogue on Global Development, a ministerial meeting of the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative, and two Global Shared Development Action Forums, effectively building consensus on international development cooperation and promoting all parties to recommit to and start again on the Sustainable Development Goals.- ，，、，2030，...，--，，，、. Then Wang put forward some data around GDI. Over the past three years, more than 100 countries and more than 20 international organizations have actively supported and participated in the Initiative, and 82 countries have joined the Friends of GDI group. More than 70 countries and international organizations have joined the Global Development Promotion Center Network, more than 50 parties have signed cooperation documents on GDI with China, and the United Nations has established a GDI Promotion Working Group.10020，82--。70，50，. We have invested and mobilised nearly $20 billion in various development funds, established more than 30 cooperation platforms in eight key areas, established a global development promotion center, and are actively preparing to build a ‘Global South Research Center.

Moreover, we have organized over 2,000 capacity-building projects for developing countries, training more than 60,000 talents in various fields. From technical cooperation to capacity building, from poverty alleviation and education to the digital economy, from high-yield rice to fungus grass processing, the cooperation under the initiative has deepened and materialized, bringing benefits to the Global South. 、。32，1100，600。2000，6。，，，，--. Share Tracking People's Daily Third, Wang Yi's speech at the High-level Conference on International Cooperation on AI Capacity Building. Wang called for: comprehensive and balanced governance of AI openness without building walls, interconnection without decoupling, equality without discrimination, and working together to create an open, inclusive, inclusive, and non-discriminatory environment for the development of AI, so that the dividends of AI can benefit all countries. He added that AI should not and cannot be reduced to a tool for maintaining hegemony and pursuing superiority. establishing an AI governance mechanism with universal participation from all countries under the UN framework, so that all countries can participate and benefit equally. Using one's own values ​​as the only criterion for judgement will only artificially create differences and obstacles, and will not be conducive to mankind working together to meet new challenges. 。、、、，，，。，。。，、、，、、、，。、。。，，。，、。，，. He then made five areas of China's work: China is willing to cooperate with all countries, especially developing countries, in building AI infrastructure and advancing the global layout of interoperable AI and digital infrastructure. China is willing to carry out AI models development and empowerment cooperation, build an international cooperation platform for AI capacity building, build an open source AI community in a responsible manner, and build a rich, diverse, healthy and benevolent AI development ecosystem in accordance with local conditions. China will organize short-term education and training on AI capacity building for developing countries, AI knowledge and expertise through a combination of online and offline methods. We will organize 10 AI training and seminar programs for developing countries by the end of 2025. China is willing to work with all countries, especially developing countries, to jointly develop AI corpora, promote and improve data infrastructure, promote and protect the diversity of civilizations, and promote fair and inclusive use of global data. China is ready to collaborate with all parties to strengthen strategic alignment and policy exchanges on AI, actively sharing policy and technical practices in AI testing, evaluation, certification, and regulation, and jointly addressing AI ethics and safety risks. ，。，。，-+-。，，，、。，。，，。2025。，。，，，。，。，、、，。，--，。 China proposes the establishment of a ‘Group of Friends for International Cooperation on AI Capacity Building' and welcomes all countries to actively support and participate. During this meeting, China announced the AI Capacity-Building Action Plan for Good and for All. The full document is available in English. Share Tracking People's Daily Fourth, Wang Yi's meeting with Sergei Lavrov. Wang said that the experience of China-Russia ties shows that -as long as we adhere to permanent good-neighborly friendship, comprehensive strategic cooperation, and mutually beneficial cooperation and win-win results, China-Russia relations will move forward…Both sides should continue to hold high the banner of multilateralism, defend the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and promote the building of a more just and reasonable global governance system with the United Nations at its core. China will fully support Russia in playing its role as the BRICS chair, ensure the complete success of the Kazan Summit, and open up a new situation for BRICS+ cooperation.- They also talked about the upcoming 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. Wang also met with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha. Wang told him that: -China has always advocated the peaceful settlement of disputes and advocated that all hotspot issues should be resolved politically through dialogue, and the same is true for the Ukrainian issue. China does not engage in geopolitical games or pursue its own self-interests, but has always actively promoted peace and negotiations, working to build consensus for peace. China has always paid attention to the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, has provided four batches of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, and is willing to provide new assistance according to Ukraine's needs. We hope that Ukraine will continue to take effective measures to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel and institutions in Ukraine. We are willing to maintain communication with all parties, including Ukraine, and continue to do what China believes is right to strive for peace at an early date.- ，，。，，，。，，。，。，，. While on this, do check out Politico's reporting on a Ukrainian assessment of Wang's agenda at the UNGA. The report says: -China wants to work behind the scenes at the United Nations to enlist international support for an agreement to end the war in Ukraine on terms favorable to Russia, according to a Ukrainian government document. The Chinese government came into this week's U.N. General Assembly with a plan to seek support from countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa that would freeze battle lines in the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II, according to the document obtained by POLITICO. The U.S. is opposed to the deal and Ukrainian officials are alarmed by it — so much so that they have circulated the document among diplomats gathered in New York for the UNGA. In its proposal, China is trying to persuade diplomats to support peace talks focused on -taking into account the security interests of each country- with the objective of -preventing Russia from losing- the war, according to the document. The paper, which was drafted by the Ukrainian government ahead of this week's high-level U.N. meetings, does not say how Kyiv is aware of China's strategy. Ukraine is also pushing on multiple fronts this week to dissuade allies from embracing the China-backed plan. Ukraine's U.N. mission in New York did not respond to a request for comment on the document. Beijing's game plan in New York involves enlisting the support of some two dozen countries -to form some kind of ‘core' group which in the future can quickly expand [to include] other countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia,- the document said. China seeks their endorsement for its plan to initiate peace talks between Russia and Ukraine based around a China-Brazil joint six-point proposal released in May. That document urges -no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no provocation by any party.- That would allow Russia to continue hostilities at their current intensity as well as its occupation of Ukrainian territory. The six-point proposal hinges on -an international peace conference … recognized by both Russia and Ukraine.- Also noteworthy part in the report is this bit: -China's pursuit of India's support could create particular trouble for Ukraine. Kyiv has been hoping that New Delhi may help broker a peace pact it can live with. The Indian embassy in Washington declined to comment.- Meanwhile, another interesting Politico report said this week that: Ukraine has found its favored middleman to help end the war with Russia: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi…A high-ranking Ukrainian official, granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive subject, confirmed that India was Kyiv's big hope to reach a peace pact it can live with. According to the official, Modi was clear in summertime discussions with Kyiv that — while Ukraine would inevitably need to compromise on some things to end Moscow's onslaught — any proposals to end the war should not include giving up territory to Russia. Modi, in Kyiv's eyes, has come a long way in a short time. When he visited Moscow in July and warmly embraced Russian President Vladimir Putin, the response from Kyiv was scathing. Zelenskyy called the hug — on the same day a Russian missile strike killed dozens of Ukrainians — -a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts.- But since then, Ukraine has come to increasingly view India — the world's most populous nation, which has long promoted non-alignment in its foreign relations — as its ideal intermediary in dealings with the Kremlin. While New Delhi has consistently refrained from condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it has spoken in support of respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity, and ending the war. Six weeks after his Moscow trip raised Ukrainian hackles, Modi traveled to Kyiv to meet with Zelenskyy. He vowed to be -a friend- to Kyiv and help bring about a peace deal. India may be the only global power player that can play the role — or at least the only one able to credibly portray itself as a neutral party to both Moscow and Kyiv. Subscribe now Another noteworthy report is about Wang's comments on Security Council reform. This was part of a dialogue between the P5 and C10 countries from Africa. Wang made three points: Effectively increase the representation of Global South countries, allow more developing countries, especially small and medium-sized countries including African countries, to participate in Security Council decision-making, enhance the authority and efficiency of the Security Council, and promote the development of international order towards a more just and reasonable direction. The Security Council cannot become a club for big countries or rich countries, let alone an arena for political confrontation. We must effectively change the imbalance between North and South in the composition of the Security Council and the over-representation of developed countries. We must anchor the reform path of giving priority to special arrangements for Africa. The Security Council structure with insufficient representation of Africa is hardly reasonable, and correcting this injustice requires creativity. Last year, President Xi Jinping took the lead in announcing that China supports making special arrangements for the priority resolution of Africa's demands, which has led to just calls in support for Africa's demands. China is willing to work with Africa and all parties to jointly explore the implementation path of the special arrangements for Africa's priority. We must support the main channel status of the General Assembly's Security Council reform intergovernmental negotiations. The Security Council reform intergovernmental negotiations are the only platform authorized by the General Assembly and widely recognized by member states. We should jointly maintain the intergovernmental negotiation platform where everyone can sit down and talk, and continuously accumulate and expand the consensus of the international community. 。--，，，。，。、。。，。，。，。。、。，.

The readout says: -China has always placed Nepal in an important position in its peripheral diplomacy and is committed to building a closer China-Nepal community with a shared future.

The two sides should take this opportunity to promote the joint construction of the BRI and other cooperation to bear more fruit and benefit the people of the two countries… China will, as always, support Nepal in safeguarding its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and hopes that Nepal will find a successful development path that suits its national conditions. He appreciated Nepal's repeated reiteration that it will not allow any forces to use Nepal's territory to engage in anti-China activities. China has granted zero tariff treatment to 100% of items imported from all least-developed countries that have diplomatic relations with China, which will facilitate more Nepali specialty products entering the Chinese market. China welcomes Nepal's announcement in China of 2025 as the ‘Nepal Tourism Year' and is willing to work with Nepal to plan a series of events to promote cultural exchanges.-，、，，。100%，。2025--，，.

China and Bangladesh share a traditional friendship, and the people of both countries have deep amicable feelings for each other. China is willing to work with Bangladesh to promote this traditional friendship, strengthen political mutual trust, deepen cooperation in jointly building BRI, and push forward the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries.

Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, Wang met with American representatives from the National Committee on United States-China Relations, the US-China Business Council, the US Chamber of Commerce, the Aspen Institute, the Asia Society, and the Council on Foreign Relations. Wang told them that: -This year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States. After nearly half a century of ups and downs, the most important revelation is that the two countries should be partners, not adversaries; they should help each other succeed rather than engage in vicious competition; and they should keep their word and follow through, rather than saying one thing and doing another. President Xi Jinping cares deeply about and attaches great importance to China-US relations. Based on profound reflection on the lessons learned, he has proposed the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation, which are the fundamental guidelines for China's approach to US relations. In contrast to China's stable and consistent policy towards the US, the US often sends mixed signals and presents two different faces in its China policy. The root cause lies in the inability of some in the US to view and accept China's development objectively. The US needs to recognize that China also has the right to develop, and that China's development is an opportunity for both the US and the world, rather than a challenge. 。，45。，，，；，；、，、。，，、、，。，、。。，。、. Wang Yi said that during his visit to New York for the UN General Assembly, he sensed the widespread concern over the international situation, with many hoping for greater unity and coordination among major powers to shoulder their responsibilities. As permanent members of the UN Security Council and the world's two largest economies, China and the US should first strive for stable, healthy, and sustainable development of their bilateral relationship. They should also work with the international community to address the numerous global challenges emerging today. China-US relations are an evolving process that requires continuous dialogue and communication to eliminate unnecessary misunderstandings and misjudgments. Wang Yi expressed hope that people of insight from various sectors in the US would contribute to these efforts, foster an objective and rational understanding of China, enhance mutual understanding and trust, and help improve and develop China-US relations. ，，，，。，，，。，，。，，，. Wang reportedly responded to questions about -questions about China's economy, the Taiwan issue, the Ukrainian crisis, Sino-Russian relations, the South China Sea issue, the Korean Peninsula, and AI.- Share Tracking People's Daily Moving on from Wang Yi's engagements. Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong held -candid, professional and pragmatic exchanges- with US Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday. Xinhua says: -Wang said that the two sides earnestly implement the important consensus of the two heads of state, adhere to mutual respect, dispute management and mutually beneficial cooperation, and have achieved many visible outcomes in areas such as drug control, repatriation of illegal immigrants and cooperation on individual cases. China is willing to maintain communication with the U.S. at all levels, and push for steady and long-term law enforcement cooperation between the two countries. The U.S. side should attach importance to addressing China's concerns, demonstrate sincerity with concrete actions, and remove obstacles for deepening cooperation, Wang noted. The two sides agreed to stay in communication on important issues in the field of law enforcement.- Page 6: There's a report informing that the NDRC and the Xi Jinping Economic Thought Research Center hosted the 2024 Annual Conference on Deeply Studying and Practising Xi Jinping's Economic Thought.
