Analysis of India-China SRs Meeting	Hello everyone, Xi Jinping's in Macao marking the 25th anniversary of the region's return to China. Today's paper is essentially full of the coverage of that trip. If you are interested, Xi's speech at the dinner last night is available via Xinhua English. Alas, I am unable to do the full newsletter owing to personal commitments. And I am going to take a break till the end of the year, unless something really significant develops. For the moment, I am leaving you with a brief discussion I had last night with StratNews Global on the meeting between the Indian and Chinese special representatives on the boundary issue in Beijing. Hope this is useful for those watching India-China ties. Wish you all a very happy holiday season! Manoj Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

New Survey on India-China Relations - Xi Visits Sanya - Wang Yi on China's Global Outlook in 2025 - Li Qiang on Plan to Ease Law-enforcement Challenge...	Hi folks, In today's People's Daily, there is a brief report confirming that India and China will be holding a meeting of the Special Representative on the India-China boundary question in Beijing today. This is a key outcome from the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Kazan in October. So I guess this is an opportune moment to share that last night, the Takshashila Institution released a new public opinion survey report on India-China ties. And not surprisingly, the report found that over half of Indians believe that the boundary issue is the biggest stressor between India and China. The report also has some rather counter-intuitive findings on issues related to trade, investment and skilled talent. But let me leave you with this bit, which I thought was rather interesting and perhaps said more about Indians' positive assessment of the system of multi-party democracy Cheers, Manoj Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, December 18, 2024.

He ended by talking about the need to implement the priorities from the CEWC and ensure social stability, food and energy supplies, etc, ahead of the New Year and Spring Festival. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on the State Council study session, which discussed the need to strengthen enforcement procedures, improve methods and enhance supervision to boost the quality and effectiveness of administrative law enforcement. Professor Hu Jianmiao of the Central Party School was the guest speaker at the session. Li Qiang then spoke. He said -that administrative law enforcement is an important means for the government to perform its duties according to law and manage economic and social affairs, and promoting strict, standardised, impartial, and civilised law enforcement is a key aspect of building a law-based government. Currently, there are still instances of abuse of administrative discretion and unjust law enforcement in certain areas and localities. Efforts must begin with issues strongly raised by the public and businesses, further improving the benchmark system for administrative discretion and standardising the operation of power. To address the issue of incomplete benchmark coverage, it is necessary to promptly improve benchmarks for discretion in areas such as licensing, collection, enforcement, and inspection. To resolve the problem of unreasonable discretion ranges, the severity of violations by business entities and their capacity to bear penalties should be considered, and the principle of ‘proportionality of offence and punishment' should be followed to determine penalty limits. Regarding the issue of inconsistent local standards, coordination and guidance should be strengthened, and timely adjustments should be promoted.- ，、，。、。，，。，、、、。，，--。，，. -Li Qiang pointed out that next year will launch a special action to standardise law enforcement involving enterprises, continuously optimise the business environment, promote stable expectations and strengthen confidence. It is necessary to standardise the law enforcement procedures, fully implement the publicity of administrative law enforcement, the record of the whole process of law enforcement, and the legal review system of major law enforcement decisions, unblock the channels of appeal, and protect the appeal rights of those being supervised according to law. In improving enforcement methods, flexible measures can be applied to minor offences that involve no intent and pose limited social harm. Strengthen law enforcement supervision, pay attention to abnormal growth in fines and confiscations, a large number of off-site law enforcement (this is largely about issues of jurisdiction), and large-scale maximum penalties, review and verify relevant law enforcement behaviours, and correct any problems in a timely manner. Strengthen the use of information technology to improve the effectiveness of law enforcement supervision.- ，，，。，、、，，。，、、，。，、、，，。，. Li ended with the need to -safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the people and enterprises, and maintain a fair and competitive market order.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: There's a brief report on Wang Yi's speech on China's diplomacy in 2024. The full English version of the speech is available on the Ministry's website. Let me highlight key excerpts. Wang began by talking about Xi Jinping's head of state diplomacy. He then said: -Over the past year, new breakthroughs have been made in building a community with a shared future for mankind, which has shaped the historical trend toward a shared future and greater solidarity in our global village…In the course of 2024, China and Brazil have announced joint efforts to build a China-Brazil community with a shared future for a more just world and a more sustainable planet, demonstrating their sense of responsibility as two emerging countries; China and Serbia have launched efforts to build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era, the first of its kind in China's relations with European countries. Globally, a growing number of countries have pitched in to build a community with a shared future. What's worth mentioning in particular is that Chinese and African leaders have agreed to build an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era, giving expression to the shared desire of the 2.8 billion Chinese and Africans to pursue common development in greater solidarity. China has also made efforts to build communities with a shared future with particular regions, including with Central Asia, ASEAN, countries in the Lancang-Mekong river basin, Arab states, and countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. These efforts are opening up new vistas of harmonious coexistence between different civilizations…With the joint efforts of China and other countries, the notion of humanity sharing a common future has been written into multiple resolutions of the General Assembly of the United Nations (U.N.) and multilateral documents, and the goal of building a community with a shared future has been established in various fields such as cybersecurity, climate change, and health. We have firmly upheld the authority and stature of the U.N., supported the U.N. in holding theSummit for the Future, and endeavored to promote an equal and orderly multipolar world, and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization. We have accelerated the implementation of the three major Global Initiatives. To date, 82 countries have joined the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative, 119 countries and international organizations have given support to the Global Security Initiative, and the 78th U.N. General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution proposed by China to establish an International Day of Dialogue among Civilizations. Building a community with a shared future for mankind has been established as the noble goal for practicing major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics.- -We have actively worked for the restoration of world peace and endeavored to save human lives. On the Ukraine crisis, we have always maintained an objective and impartial position, and actively pushed for peace talks. Over the past year, our special envoy conducted three rounds of shuttle diplomacy. China and Brazil jointly issued the six-point consensus on political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. We also brought other Global South countries together to launch the group of ‘friends for peace' to gather consensus for finding a path to peace. The Gaza conflict has taken too many civilian lives. The immediate priority is a comprehensive ceasefire, the key is to ensure humanitarian assistance, and the fundamental way out is to realize the two-state solution. Over the past year, we have pushed for the adoption of the first resolution by the Security Council on a ceasefire in Gaza, facilitated the reconciliation dialogue and the signing of the Beijing Declaration by various Palestinian factions, and delivered multiple batches of humanitarian assistance to Gaza. We will continue to make unremitting efforts toward a comprehensive, just, and lasting solution to the Palestinian question. We have mediated peace in northern Myanmar and facilitated multiple rounds of peace talks among conflicting parties. We have supported Afghanistan in building an inclusive political framework and realizing peace and reconstruction. We have also made consistent efforts to promote the political resolution of the Korean Peninsula issue. Facing the dramatic change in Syria, China will continue to stand with the Syrian people and uphold the ‘Syrian-led and Syrian-owned' principle. China opposes the attempt of terrorist forces to exploit the situation to create chaos, and will help Syria maintain its sovereignty and restore stability.- He then talked about how Chinese modernisation has created opportunities for the world. Under this, he said that 155 countries had joined BRI. The next bit was on the Global South. Wang said: -The collective rise of the Global South in the current chapter of history is a distinctive feature of the great transformation across the world. China will always be an important member of the Global South and always be committed to unity and invigoration of the Global South. China promoted new proposals and new developments of mechanisms and strengthened the force for unity and progress in the Global South. President Xi Jinping called for more open and inclusive Global South cooperation, and announced eight measures in support of Global South cooperation. He articulated the vision for countries in the Global South to work together as the staunch force for peace, the core driving force for open development, the construction team of global governance, and the advocates for exchange among civilizations, so as to leave their mark on the progress of humanity. Building on its historic expansion last year and setting off this year from the new starting point of greater BRICS cooperation, BRICS is bringing more partners into its big family to make the platform a primary channel for strengthening solidarity and cooperation among Global South nations. Considering the reasonable concerns of developing countries, China promoted the adoption of a U.N. General Assembly resolution on enhancing international cooperation on AI capacity-building, proposed the AI Capacity-Building Action Plan for Good and for All, worked with fellow Global South nations to jointly launch an Initiative on International Cooperation in Open Science with fellow Global South nations, and pushed for the adoption of the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance at COP29. China called on developed countries to take concrete actions to earnestly fulfill their due responsibilities, provide sufficient financial support to developing countries, and uphold global climate justice. China has stayed committed to the principle of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith, and helped fellow developing countries move faster in rejuvenation. At FOCAC, China and Africa agreed on the Beijing Declaration and the Beijing Action Plan for stronger cooperation between the two sides in the next three years, and agreed on ten partnership actions for modernization covering 10 key areas such as trade and investment, industrial chain cooperation and green development in an all-dimensional boost to Africa's development. China and Arab states saw significant early harvests from the ‘eight major cooperation initiatives' and went on to develop ‘five cooperation frameworks' in five dimensions: innovation, finance, energy, economy and trade, and people-to-people exchanges. China deepened the synergy of development strategies with Latin American and Caribbean countries, and continued to upgrade its cooperation with Pacific island countries.- Then Wang talked about specific relations. He cast this in terms of -all-round diplomacy, which has built up the trend toward a new type of international relations-. One of the goals for this is to build a -amicable and harmonious home in Asia-. He said that China-Russia ties had -grown more mature and stable, demonstrated in a clearer way its independence and resilience, and set an example of friendly exchanges between major countries and neighbors.- He added: -China-Russia relations are based on non-alliance, non-confrontation and not targeting any third party, and are not subject to interference or coercion from any external factor. Amid shifting global dynamics, China and Russia will maintain a high degree of strategic mutual trust, support each other's development and revitalization, and jointly safeguard global strategic stability.- On Europe, he said: -Europe holds an important position in China's diplomatic agenda. A healthier and more stable China-Europe relationship serves the fundamental interests of both sides and the common aspiration of the world.- During engagements with European leaders, Xi -encouraged the European side to take a long-term and strategic perspective, see China as a partner and strengthen dialogue and cooperation to the benefit of both sides and the world at large. China and Europe are two great civilizations of the world and two major forces of the times. China stands ready to work with the European side to handle differences and disputes properly, seek win-win solutions, and jointly safeguard free trade and multilateralism.- This is the paragraph on India and Japan, which are clubbed together. -China is having more trust and less suspicion with major countries in this region. When meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Xi Jinping put forth important propositions on improving China-India relations, which received positive response from Prime Minister Modi. The two sides agreed to step up strategic communication, safeguard peace and tranquility in the border areas, and strive to bring the bilateral relationship back to the track of stable development at an early date. China and Japan reaffirmed the commitment to promoting the China-Japan strategic relationship of mutual benefit in an all-round way, and to building a constructive and stable relationship that meets the requirements of the new era. In line with Japan's commitment on the discharge of nuclear contaminated water, China has recently started independent sampling and monitoring and will work with the international community to urge the Japanese side to earnestly fulfill its international obligations and responsibilities.- Share Tracking People's Daily Then there are two paragraphs dealing with the US. -There is a lot of interest in China-U.S. relations. How China and the United States get along concerns the well-being of the two peoples and also the future of the world. This year, we have followed the guidance of head-of-state diplomacy, focused on implementing the San Francisco Vision, and worked to maintain the overall stability of China-U.S. relations. China and the United States held two rounds of strategic communication and five meetings of the Financial Working Group and the Economic Working Group respectively. The two sides advanced practical cooperation in such areas as counternarcotics, law enforcement and climate change,extended the science and technology agreement, and co-signed each other's resolution on artificial intelligence at the U.N. General Assembly. Nearly 15,000 young Americans visited China through the initiative of ‘50,000 in five years', sowing the seeds of friendship between the two countries. Such progress has been widely welcomed by Chinese and Americans across the sectors as well as the international community at large. This fully shows that as long as China and the United States cooperate with each other, they can accomplish many great things together. In the meantime, China firmly safeguards its sovereignty, security and development interests, and firmly opposes the illegal and unreasonable suppression by the U.S. side. In particular, with regard to the U.S.' gross interference in China's internal affairs such as Taiwan, China has to make a firm and robust response to resolutely defend its legitimate rights and interests and safeguard the basic norms governing international relations. Last month, President Xi Jinping met with President Biden and sent a congratulatory message to President-Elect Trump, providing strategic guidance for the growth of China-U.S. relationship at this critical juncture. President Xi Jinping summed up seven pieces of experience and inspiration based on a thorough account of bilateral exchanges in recent years, and drew four clear red lines that must not be challenged, namely, the Taiwan question, China's path and system, democracy and human rights, and China's development right. He stressed that China's goal of a steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged; its commitment to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation as principles for handling China-U.S. relations remains unchanged; its position of resolutely safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests remains unchanged; and its desire to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American people remains unchanged. This is not only the authoritative interpretation of China's U.S. policy, but also our earnest expectation on future China-U.S. relationship. The fact that China has maintained its U.S. policy stable and consistent demonstrates its firm strategic resolve and broad-mindedness as a major country. We will engage in dialogue, manage differences, enhance mutual trust, remove misunderstandings and expand cooperation with the U.S. side, and work with the U.S. to explore the right way for our two major countries to get along with each other on this planet to the benefit of the two countries and the world.- Subscribe now Wang then made three points about China's diplomacy: First, China's diplomacy upholds Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy -as the fundamental guideline- and that -the Party's leadership is the most defining feature of our major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, and our greatest political strength to overcome all risks and challenges.- Second, China's diplomacy is -people's diplomacy.- Third, -China's diplomacy is always about standing up for responsibilities-, i.e., -We have resolutely countered the attempt of using Taiwan to contain China and the myth of seeking U.S. support for ‘Taiwan independence', firmly safeguarded China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and effectively strengthened the international community's commitment to the one-China principle. We have taken justified and firm measures to safeguard China's rights against certain countries' provocations in the South China Sea, and worked with ASEAN countries for peace and stability in the South China Sea. We have refuted false narratives hyping up the so-called ‘human rights issues', set the record straight, and gained overwhelming support from over 100 countries for China's just position. More countries have come to realize that playing double standards will only disgrace oneself and interfering in others' internal affairs is ultimately unpopular.- Leave a comment He then made five points about China's diplomacy for 2025. Before doing so, this is how he assessed China's global standing. -China today is already a responsible major country with enhanced international influence, stronger capacity to lead new endeavors, and greater moral appeal.- First, China will be a firm force for peace in a world of turbulence and conflicts. We hope the incoming U.S. administration will make the right choice and work with China in the same direction to avoid disruptions, overcome obstacles, and achieve the steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relations. We will deepen the comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination and all-round practical cooperation with Russia, and work for steady progress in China-EU relations toward independence, mutual success and benefit to the world. Stability in China will provide a strong underpinning for global strategic stability, and certainty in China will help cushion uncertainties in other parts of the world. We will carry forward the Chinese way of settling hotspot issues and continue our constructive role in the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and other hotspot issues such as the Korean Peninsula and Myanmar. Second, China will be a firm force for unity in the face of division and confrontation. We support the holding of the second China-Central Asia Summit, and will work for the signing and implementation of the China-ASEAN FTA 3.0 Upgrade Protocol. We have properly handled differences and are working with India to find the right and bright path for big, neighboring countries to live in harmony and develop side by side. We will partner with Africa in implementing the ten partnership actions for modernization, expedite the building of ‘five cooperation frameworks' with Arab states, and use the 10th anniversary of the China-CELAC Forum as an opportunity to open a new chapter of cooperation. We will continue to pool the collective strength of the Global South through unity. Third, China will be a firm force for openness in the face of decoupling and severing supply chains. We will deliver on the eight major steps of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, advance both the major flagship projects and the ‘small and beautiful' livelihood programs, and create new space for win-win cooperation of higher quality, enhanced resilience and greater sustainability. We are determined to pursue higher-standard opening up, accelerate the development of the FTAAP, and safeguard the global free trade system as well as the stable and unimpeded functioning of the industrial and supply chains. We advocate a world economy that is cooperative, stable, open, innovative and eco-friendly, and we are ready to join hands with all countries on the path toward modernization. Fourth, China will be a firm force for justice in the face of the counter currents of unilateralism and bullying. We will hold solemn commemorations for the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japanese aggression and the world anti-fascist war, promote a correct view of history, uphold true multilateralism, and firmly safeguard the international system with the U.N. at its core, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter. We will effectively fulfill the role as the SCO rotating chair, support Brazil in hosting the BRICS summit and the U.N. Climate Change Conference (COP30), support South Africa in hosting the G20 summit, and work for a more just and equitable international order. Fifth, China will be a firm force for inclusiveness in the face of ideological differences. We will promote the common values of humanity, deepen exchanges and mutual learning with other countries, join forces for the progress of human civilization, and enhance the mutual understanding and friendship among people of different countries. We will step up experience-sharing on governance and development, tell engaging stories of the CPC, of Chinese modernization, and of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and cement China's friendship with countries around the globe. We will expand two-way exchanges between the Chinese people and people elsewhere, and do our best to stage a successful Asian Winter Games to showcase a diverse China through the charm of ice and snow.- Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the page is a report on the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) foreign ministers' meeting. Xinhua reports: -Emphasizing that ensuring security, promoting development, pursuing cooperation and seeking win-win results are the urgent aspirations of the overwhelming majority of countries, Wang called on CICA to play a unique role in this regard, build an Asian community with a shared future and expand new space for win-win development. Wang called on CICA member countries to adhere to peaceful coexistence and seek common security; jointly advance Belt and Road cooperation to promote prosperity and development; respect diverse civilizations and promote exchanges and mutual learning; practice multilateralism and build a beautiful home together. Noting that Chinese modernization is a modernization that follows the path of peaceful development and brings more opportunities to Asian countries, Wang said that China stands ready to work with CICA member states to forge a new form of Asian civilization featuring win-win development through solidarity and coordination.- Subscribe now Page 4: There's a report with data from China's National Energy Administration. It says that: As of 2024, the installed capacity of operational and approved nuclear power units in China is approximately 113 million kilowatts.

Xi's Lessons from Qiao Shi's Life - State Council Plans CEWC Agenda Implementation - Change in Macroeconomic Policy Mainly Due to External Environment...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Tuesday, December 17, 2024. Page 1: The lead story today is on the event held in Beijing to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of late top legislator Qiao Shi. Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the event. Xi's full speech is available on Page 2. In the first part of the speech, Xi outlines Qiao's accomplishments and the positions he held. Some key points in this: Xi said that Qiao was -an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China, a time-tested and loyal communist fighter, an outstanding proletarian revolutionary and politician, and an outstanding leader of the Party and the country-. ，，、，... -During the ‘Cultural Revolution', Comrade Qiao Shi suffered severe persecution. He adhered to the Party's principles, sought truth from facts, and carried out a tenacious struggle. --，。，，. Xi said that during his tenure as the Secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, Qiao -attached great importance to maintaining national security and unity, resolutely opposed ethnic separatist activities, and made important contributions to maintaining national political stability and social order.- ，，、. During his tenure as a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the 13th Central Committee, Secretary of the Central Secretariat, and Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, Comrade Qiao Shi conscientiously implemented the principle of strict Party governance, emphasised strengthening the discipline awareness of the whole Party, strengthening Party conduct and clean governance, and fully utilising the important role of discipline inspection in promoting reform, opening up, and economic development. He attached great importance to the strict enforcement of the Party's political discipline and severely investigated and dealt with serious violations of the Party's political discipline. He resolutely opposed corruption, made great efforts to correct unhealthy tendencies within the Party, promoted the formulation and improvement of laws and regulations on clean government construction, led the formulation of a series of Party discipline regulations and provisions, and promoted and guided the establishment of the Ministry of Supervision. While serving as the president of the Central Party School, he vigorously deepened the reform of the party school and promoted the work of the party school into a new period of development. 、、，，，，。，。，，，，。，，. During his tenure as a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the 14th Central Committee and Chairman of the NPCSC, Comrade Qiao Shi devoted significant effort to upholding and improving the people's congress system. He emphasised combining the strengthening of democracy with the strengthening of the rule of law, advancing the orderly development of democratic political construction along the direction and path of socialism with Chinese characteristics…He attached great importance to the implementation of the Constitution and focused on strengthening supervision over the implementation of the Constitution and laws. He also attached great importance to legislative work, proposing that the NPC ‘make accelerating economic legislation its primary task', which promoted the initial establishment of the socialist market economy legal framework and laid a solid foundation for forming the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics. He emphasised the lawful exercise of supervisory powers, advancing the standardisation and institutionalisation of supervision work. After retiring from his leadership positions, he firmly supported the leadership of the Party Central Committee and remained committed to the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, with particular attention to democratic and legal development, Party conduct and clean governance, and the fight against corruption. 、，。，。，。，。，--，，。，。，，，、. In the next bit, Xi talks about what must be learned from Qiao's life. -To commemorate Comrade Qiao Shi is to learn from his noble character of adhering to beliefs and dedicating himself to ideals. Comrade Qiao Shi was unwavering in his belief in the lofty ideal of communism and infinitely loyal to the Party and the people. In 1991, in response to the setbacks and low ebb in international communism at the time, he clearly pointed out that ‘the communist ideal is our spiritual pillar and the driving force for the advancement of our cause. Holding firm to communist beliefs is the most basic requirement for Communist Party members.' ‘The development of human society from lower to higher stages will ultimately lead to a communist society; this is the inevitable course of historical development'. He emphasized: ‘to persist in the cause of socialism on the land of China and continuously achieve new victories is of great significance not only to the Chinese people but also to all mankind'. Ideals and beliefs are the foundation for the Party's establishment and development, as well as the anchor for Party members and officials. All Party members must regard strengthening their ideals and beliefs as a lifelong task, constantly cultivating, refining, understanding, and progressing in upholding the lofty communist ideal and the shared ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics, standing firm like a mountain in both favorable and adverse circumstances, and able to withstand the test of great waves.- ，、。，。1991，、，，-，。-，-，-。：-，，，。-，。，、，，，. -To commemorate Comrade Qiao Shi is to learn from his strong Party spirit of upholding the Party's work conduct and discipline. Comrade Qiao Shi always unwaveringly adhered to Party leadership, gave high importance to the issues of work conduct and Party building, and continuously strengthened Party discipline construction. He clearly stated that ‘anyone who does not execute or covertly resists the Party Central Committee's decisions, who damages the Party's centralization and unity, who violates Party discipline - this is absolutely unacceptable.' He deeply despised corruption and unhealthy practices. During his time leading the CCDI, he intensified efforts to investigate and handle cases, focusing on bureaucratism, formalism, abuse of power for personal gain, and other issues that seriously affected relations between the Party and the masses, achieving significant results. Party spirit, Party conduct, and Party discipline are an organic whole, wherein the Party spirit is the root, Party conduct is the manifestation, and Party discipline is the guarantee. We must always adhere to the Party's comprehensive leadership and the Party Central Committee's centralized and unified leadership, unwaveringly comprehensively enforce strict Party governance, unswervingly enforce strict Party governance, advance the building of Party integrity and the anti-corruption struggle, and maintain the Party's advanced nature and purity, ensuring that the Party always remains the strong leadership core of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.- ，、。，，。：-，，。。-，，，、，。、、，，，。，，，，. -To commemorate Comrade Qiao Shi is to learn from his precious quality of maintaining his original aspiration and diligently serving the people. Comrade Qiao Shi always placed the Party's cause and people's interests first, fulfilled his duties, and devoted himself entirely to public service. He held profound feelings for the people, clearly pointing out that ‘people from all walks of life across the country, the vast majority of ordinary people, regardless of gender or age, are the ones we serve'. While leading the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, he emphatically stressed that we should ‘take protecting the people, serving the people, being the people's servants as the fundamental starting point and the important standard for measuring the work of every political and legal cadre', and ‘only by constantly thinking about what the masses think about, being concerned about what the masses are concerned about, can we truly work wholeheartedly and make our team a team truly loved by the people'. The country is the people, and the people are the country. We must always adhere to the fundamental purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly, uphold the people-centered development philosophy, earnestly safeguard the fundamental interests of the people, strive to bring benefits to the people, and let the fruits of modernization benefit all people more fully and fairly.- ，、。，，。，：-，，，。-，，-，，，，-，-，，，-。，。，，、，. -To commemorate Comrade Qiao Shi is to learn from his political commitment of actively pursuing reform and daring to act. Comrade Qiao Shi resolutely supported and implemented the line, principles, and policies advanced since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, unwaveringly advancing reform and opening up. In the early period of reform and opening up, he clearly pointed out that ‘we must be determined to run the special economic zones well; it simply has to be done well, and running the special economic zones well will not be a mistake'. Regarding political and legal work in the new period, he emphasized that ‘everything conducive to reform and opening up and conducive to the development of productive forces must be protected and supported by law; everything detrimental to reform and opening up, detrimental to the development of productive forces, must be opposed and restricted by law; everything undermining reform and opening up, democracy and rule of law, and the development of productive forces must be struck down and punished by law.' In 1992, he emphasized the need to deeply study and implement the spirit of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour from the height of it being ‘another great liberation of thought'. Reform and opening up is the important magic weapon for the Party and people's cause in order to make great strides to catch up with the times. We must unwaveringly hold high the banner of reform and opening up, adhere to maintaining integrity while innovating, take the reform of the economic system as the guide, promoting social fairness and justice and improving people's well-being as the starting point and foothold, closely focus on Chinese-style modernization to further comprehensively deepen reform and promote high-level opening up, and strive to compose a new chapter of reform and opening up.- ，、。，。，：-，，。-，：-、，；、，；、、，。-1992，--。。，，，、，、，. To commemorate Comrade Qiao Shi is to learn from his persistent pursuit of respecting the rule of law and enforcing the rule of law. Comrade Qiao Shi was a faithful practitioner of democratic legal system construction. He clearly pointed out that ‘we must recognize that the legal system is absolutely not something optional or dispensable. Strengthening material civilization and spiritual civilization construction must rely on legal system guarantees; ensuring the economy does not distort and the country remains stable for a long time must also rely on legal system guarantees, thereby overcoming tendencies to slight or despise the legal system, and improving the consciousness of establishing and maintaining the legal system.' Under his leadership and effort, the 8th NPC and its Standing Committee issued a batch of important economic laws, creating a good legal environment for establishing and developing the socialist market economy. The rule of law is an important guarantee for Chinese-style modernization. We must always adhere to the path of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics, adhere to the joint promotion of ruling the country according to the law (reference to an overarching principle), governing (Party and state's processes and exercise of power within the boundaries of the legal framework) according to the law, and administering (rules for the actions of departments, ministries, officials, etc.) according to the law (、、), adhere to simultaneously building a law-based country, law-based government, and law-based society, comprehensively promote scientific legislation, strict law enforcement, fair justice, and adherence to the law by all people, and comprehensively build a socialist modern country on the track of the rule of law. ，、。。：-、。，；，，，、，、。-，，。。，、、，、、，、、、，. To commemorate Comrade Qiao Shi is to learn from his work style of seeking truth from facts and being pragmatic. No matter which position he worked in, Comrade Qiao Shi always attached importance to integrating theory with practice and creatively used Marxist standpoints, viewpoints and methods to analyse problems. During his investigation of the Dabie Mountain area, he said that ‘when researching economic development in mountain areas, borrowing experiences from other places is necessary, but one must definitely be grounded in local conditions, adapt to local circumstances, and absolutely must not blindly compare with big cities or coastal regions.' He emphasised that ‘we must be truly responsible to the people, always adhere to the spirit of seeking truth from facts, do not engage in empty talk, do not practice formalism, do not engage superficial actions/going through the motions, and practically fulfill responsibilities on the ground'. Seeking truth from facts is the fundamental requirement of our Party for understanding and transforming the world. We must always adhere to connecting theory with reality, persist in emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, keeping pace with the times, being practical and realistic, resolutely oppose formalism and bureaucratism, concentrate our hearts and strength to promote development, and solidly advance the construction of Chinese-style modernisation.- ，、。，，。：-，，，，、。-：-，，，，，。-。，、、、，、，，。 If you are interested in others' speeches, they are available on Page 6.

The report says that the meeting was held -to study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Central Economic Work Conference and make arrangements for the implementation of the decisions and arrangements of the Central Economic Work Conference.- 1216，，. -The meeting emphasized the need to align thoughts and actions with the Party Central Committee's scientific assessment of the economic situation and its decisions and arrangements for next year's economic work, and effectively enhance the sense of responsibility, urgency and initiative for implementation. All departments of the State Council must fully align themselves with the various arrangements determined by the Party Central Committee, be proactive, formulate implementation plans, and produce specific task lists, timelines, and roadmaps to ensure that all work progresses in an orderly manner.

Efforts should focus on improving the project review and management mechanism, moderately increasing the autonomy and flexibility of local governments, and enhancing the efficiency of bond issuance. It is necessary to strengthen the full process management of special bonds, and improve the fund supervision mechanism and repayment mechanism. It is necessary to do a good job in the issuance and use of special bonds next year, doing so as soon as possible, and provide strong support for promoting a sustained economic recovery.- ，--，、，。，，。，。，，. -The meeting studied policy measures to promote the high-quality development of government investment funds, pointing out that it is necessary to build a scientific and efficient management system, highlight government guidance and policy positioning, and operate government investment funds in a market-oriented, law-based and professional manner in order to better serve the overall national development. It is necessary to develop and expand long-term capital and patient capital, improve the differentiated management mechanism of different types of funds, and prevent the crowding-out effect on social capital. It is necessary to improve the responsibility mechanism with consistent rights and responsibilities and compatible incentives and constraints, and create a good atmosphere that encourages innovation and tolerates failure.- ，，，、、，。、，，。、，、.

It called for strengthened measures at the turn of the year to protect the safety of people and their property. the meeting also discussed the revitalisation of the football industry, seeing it as key in transforming China into a strong sports nation. The meeting urged intensified efforts to implement measures aimed at advancing work on football development. the meeting also deliberated and approved the adoption of a draft regulation on the management of China's public security video image information system. Subscribe now Third, there's a commentary drawing from the CEWC meeting. It says that the CEWC made a systematic deployment and put forward the overall requirements and policy orientation for economic work next year. -Currently, the most important things are: first, carefully study and comprehend, accurately understand the Party Central Committee's decision-making intentions; second, implement without deviation, and thoroughly integrate all requirements into doing well next year's economic work.- ，，，，. It adds that: -Economic and social development goals have strong guiding significance. The conference proposed the main expected objectives for next year's economic and social development, pointing out the need to maintain stable economic growth, maintain overall stability in employment and prices, maintain basic balance in international payments, and promote synchronized growth of resident income and economic growth. These were proposed based on in-depth research, accurate judgment, and scientific analysis, considering both the present and the long-term, releasing a strong signal of promoting continuous economic improvement, and powerfully boosting confidence and motivation. Economic growth is a fundamental and highly correlated indicator. Whether stabilizing employment, preventing risks, benefiting people's livelihood, strengthening confidence, or effectively responding to external environmental changes and challenges, resolving various contradictions in development requires maintaining a certain economic growth rate. Placing stability in growth, employment, and prices in a prominent position, while simultaneously proposing ‘seeking progress in stability, promoting stability through progress, maintaining integrity while innovating, establishing before breaking, systematic integration and collaborative coordination' provides a clear direction and scientific methodology for doing next year's economic work well.- 。，，、，，。、、，、，，。，、、、，，，。、、，-、，、，、-，，。 Scientific and effective macroeconomic regulation is an important guarantee for the steady and healthy development of the economy. The meeting emphasized that ‘more proactive and effective macroeconomic policies should be implemented next year'. It is clear that a more proactive fiscal policy will be implemented, the fiscal deficit ratio will be increased, the issuance of ultra-long-term special treasury bonds will be increased, and the issuance and use of local government special bonds will be increased. The tone of monetary policy has been adjusted from ‘prudent' to ‘moderately loose', which is the first time in 14 years. The tone of macroeconomic regulation has changed significantly, mainly due to the deepening of the adverse effects of the current changes in the external environment. China's economic operation still faces many difficulties and challenges. To do a good job in economic work next year, we must face up to the difficulties and take positive actions, increase the intensity of counter-cyclical regulation, further enrich and improve the policy toolbox, and provide strong policy support for promoting the continued improvement of the economy.- 。--。，、、。----，。，，，、，，，.

Xi on Self-Revolution - What the Party is Thinking about When Coordinating the Relationship between Demand & Supply	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, December 16, 2024. Just about the entire paper today is dedicated to featuring announcements of candidates for national moral models. Consequently, there are only two pieces that are worth noting in today's edition. First, there is a report on Qiushi publishing an article drawn from Xi Jinping's speech at the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CCDI on January 8, 2024. This was the meeting that framed Xi Jinping's thoughts on Self-Revolution. In the Qiushi piece, Xi begins by framing the self-revolution of the Party as the second answer for the Party to successfully break free from the historical cycle of rise and fall, and ensure that it never degenerates, changes color or flavor. The first answer, of course, was Mao's framing that -let the people supervise the government-, i.e., democracy. Xi said: -The ideals pursued by our Party are lofty and sacred, and the missions it shoulders are arduous and demanding. Only by examining ourselves against the requirements of the times, remaining vigilant with a strong sense of crisis awareness, and forging ourselves with the spirit of self-revolution can we continuously enhance our leadership capacity and governance level, ensuring that the Party never degenerates, never changes colour, never loses its flavour, and always remains the strong leadership core of the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics. At the same time, it must be recognised that, with changes in the situation and tasks, shifts in the external environment, and transformations within the Party's membership, various contradictions and problems will inevitably arise within the Party. It is essential to have the courage to turn the blade inward, promptly eliminate various negative influences, and ensure that the party always remains full of vigorous life and exuberant vitality. This is the reason why we must advance the Party's self-revolution.- ，，，，，，、、，。，、，，，，。. Xi added: -The courage to carry out self-revolution is the most distinctive character and greatest strength of our Party. The nature, purpose, original intention and mission of the Party determine that our Party always represents the fundamental interests of the broad masses. By not seeking private interests, we gain the thorough spirit of self-revolution, enabling us to seek the root and greater good, adhere to truth and correct mistakes, and dare to examine ourselves and constantly reflect on our shortcomings. By not shying away from the truth or glossing over mistakes, and by promptly discovering and solving our own problems, we can effectively fight back against the ‘entrapment/hunting' and corruption from all interest groups, power cliques, and privileged classes. This is the secret behind our Party's ability to maintain its advanced nature and purity and the source of its confidence to carry out self-revolution. To deeply advance the Party's self-revolution, it is necessary to address the following issues in practice.- 。、。，、，、，、；、，，、、--。、，.，. Share Tracking People's Daily Then Xi highlights the 9 issues that needed to be grasped () in order to promote self-revolution. These are: Taking the upholding the centralised and unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee as the fundamental guarantee Taking leading the great social revolution as the fundamental purpose. Under this, he said: Plan the self-revolution of the Party in light of the new requirements of the practice of the great social revolution, use the new achievements of great social revolutionary development to examine the actual effectiveness of the Party's self-revolution, and strive to achieve: leading the great social revolution through the Party's self-revolution, and promoting the Party's self-revolution through the great social revolution. At present, we should plan and promote the self-revolution of the Party closely around the central tasks of the Party, so that the self-revolution of the Party can better serve the central tasks of the Party. ，。，，、。，，. Taking the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the fundamental guideline that must be adhered to Taking breaking free from the historical cycle of rise and fall as the strategic goal. Under this, he said: -Advancing the Party's self-revolution is a magic weapon for breaking free from the historical cycle of dynastic rise and fall. To focus on this strategic goal, we must maintain a high level of political vigilance, promptly eliminate the viruses eroding the Party's healthy body, and promptly remove various hidden dangers that undermine the Party's governing foundation, thereby ensuring the Party's continued health and continuously consolidating its long-term governing position.- ，。。，，，，，. Taking solving the unique problems of a big Party as the main direction. Under this, Xi tells us that the unique problems of a big Party are encapsulated in the -six how to always .- Xi had articulated this in the January 2023 CCDI plenary session. Xi says: Solving these difficulties is definitely not the work of a single day or a moment. In advancing the Party's self-revolution, we must adhere to the problem-oriented approach, maintain strategic determination, treat both the symptoms and root causes, adopt comprehensive measures, coordinate efforts, persist unyieldingly, work persistently and long-term, transform small victories into great victories, and demonstrate the advantages of a big party through continuously resolving its unique challenges. ，。--，。，，、、、、，，. Taking establishing a sound system for comprehensive and strict Party governance as an effective approach to achieve objectives. Under this, Xi writes: -It is necessary to closely follow the general requirements of Party building in the new era, ensuring comprehensive coverage in content, universal coverage of targets, a full chain of responsibilities, and thorough integration of systems. Persist in governing the Party through systems and rules, continuously improve the Party's self-revolution system and normative framework, and further form a positive cycle of relying on the Party's own strength to discover problems, correct deviations, drive innovation, and achieve an overall enhancement of governing capabilities.- ，。，、、、，、，，、、、. Taking the forging of a strong organisation and building an excellent team as a key emphasis/focal point. Under this, Xi writes: Deeply implement the Party's organisational line in the new era, improve the organisational system that is connected from top to bottom and has strong execution, enhance the political and organisational functions of Party organizations, focus on resolving issues such as weakened Party leadership, lack of Party building, and ineffective Party management, and promote comprehensive improvement and comprehensive strengthening of Party organizations at all levels. Adhere to implementing the new era's standards for good cadres, strictly control the political gate, capability gate, and integrity gate, ensuring that the broad masses of Party members and cadres are loyal, clean and responsible. ，、。，、，，、、，、。，、、，. Taking rectifying discipline, upholding integrity, and combating corruption as an important starting point. Taking combining self-supervision with people's supervision as a powerful driving force. Under this, Xi said: -We must consciously accept supervision by the people, and effectively integrate intra-Party supervision with supervision by state organs, democratic supervision, judicial supervision, mass supervision, and public opinion supervision, so as to achieve a virtuous interaction and mutual gain between self-discipline and external discipline.- ，、、、、，、. Subscribe now The Six How to Always are below: How to always ensure that we always stay true to our original aspiration and keep the mission firmly in mind? How to always unify thoughts, will and actions? How to always ensure that we maintain a strong governing ability and leadership level? How to always maintain the entrepreneurial spirit? How to always identify and solve problems in a timely manner? How to always maintain a clean and upright political ecology? Share Tracking People's Daily Second, there is a commentary drawing from the conclusions of the CEWC. The article begins by talking about the need to coordinate the five important relationships that were highlighted in the CEWC readout. These are: It is necessary to coordinate the relationship between an effective market and a capable government, forming an economic order that is both ‘let loose/engender freedom or autonomy' () and ‘regulated/controlled'(). It is necessary to coordinate the relationship between total supply and total demand to ensure smooth circulation in the national economy. It is necessary to coordinate the relationship between cultivating new drivers of growth and renewing old ones, developing new quality productive forces according to local conditions. It is necessary to properly coordinate the relationship between improving incremental additions and revitalising existing stock, and comprehensively enhance resource allocation efficiency. It is necessary to properly coordinate the relationship between improving quality and expanding total volume, and consolidate the material foundation of Chinese-style modernisation.- Share Tracking People's Daily The commentary then takes the case of the relationship between total supply and total demand to ensure smooth circulation in the national economy. It says: China has the world's largest and most comprehensive manufacturing system. Among 500 major industrial products, over 220 rank first globally in production output. This robust supply capability not only supports steady growth in foreign trade, with China's share of global goods exports ranking first for 15 consecutive years, but also continuously generates effective demand through high-quality supply, providing a constant driving force for economic growth. 、，500，220。，，15，，. -Supply creates demand. Focusing on improving the quality and efficiency of the supply system can create and stimulate new demand. Taking the NEV industry as an example, it took 6 years from annual production of over 10,000 vehicles to annual production of over 1 million vehicles for the first time. It also took only 6 years for China's NEV industry to achieve a leap from annual production of 1 million vehicles to 10 million vehicles. Since July, retail sales of new energy passenger vehicles have begun to exceed fuel vehicles. The reason why NEVs have gained market favor and achieved overtaking opportunities by both continuously improving quality through technological innovation and meeting people's expectations for a high-quality lifestyle.- 。，。，，，6。6，。7，。、，，. -The core of deepening supply-side structural reform is to advance industrial innovation with scientific and technological innovation. This Central Economic Work Conference made important arrangements around leading the development of new quality productive forces through scientific and technological innovation, and proposed to carry out large-scale application and demonstration actions of new technologies, new products and new scenarios. Looking to the future, creating new consumer demand through high-quality supply and promoting the upgrading of consumption quality will surely achieve a virtuous cycle and coordinated efforts.- ，。，。，、，、. Demand drives supply. In recent years, the Party Central Committee has coordinated the expansion of domestic demand and the deepening of supply-side structural reforms, firmly grasped the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, and promoted a smoother domestic circulation and more efficient connection between domestic and foreign markets. Especially since this year, the ‘two heavy' and ‘two new' policies have continued to exert their strength, continuously releasing consumption potential and driving investment growth. The overall policy of replacing old consumer goods with new ones has driven the sales of related products to exceed 1 trillion yuan. From January to October, national fixed asset investment increased by 3.4% year-on-year. Among this, infrastructure investment increased by 4.3% year-on-year, 0.2 percentage points faster than the previous 9 months; manufacturing investment increased by 9.3%, 0.1 percentage points faster than the previous 9 months. 。，，，、。，----，、。1。1103.4%。，4.3%，90.2；9.3%，90.1. -The Central Economic Work Conference has deployed the key tasks for next year, with ‘vigorously boosting consumption, improving investment efficiency, and expanding domestic demand in all directions' as the top priority. This reflects an efficient coordination of total supply and demand and a deep understanding of economic laws. Implementing special action to boost consumption, expand and strengthen the implementation of ‘two new' policies, provide greater support for ‘two heavy' projects, these policy measures, both grounded in the present and looking toward the long-term, will inevitably effectively stimulate domestic demand potential, consolidate and expand domestic circulation, and better drive the domestic and international dual circulation.- ，-、，-，，。，--，--，、，，，. -Currently, China's economic operation faces numerous difficulties and challenges, including insufficient domestic demand and the adverse impact of an unstable and uncertain international environment on external demand. It is essential to recognise that expanding domestic demand is not only crucial for economic stability but also for economic security; it is a strategic move, not temporary expediency. In this context, it is particularly urgent and important to coordinate the relationship between total supply and total demand.- ，，。，，，，。，. -Practice has shown that achieving a virtuous cycle of the national economy requires coordinated efforts and dynamic balance between supply and demand. On one hand, it is necessary to focus on the supply side, continuously deepen supply-side structural reform, making advancements and retreats, providing support and applying pressure to enhance the alignment and balance between supply and demand. On the other hand, attention must be directed toward the demand side, accelerating efforts to address shortcomings in domestic demand, particularly in consumption, so that domestic demand becomes the primary driver and stabilising anchor of economic growth. Only by acting in accordance with economic laws can better outcomes and results be achieved. The ‘five must-coordinate' principles are an important understanding of economic work laws that must be firmly grasped. By studying, understanding, and applying Xi Jinping Economic Thought and using scientific methods to plan and promote economic work, we can surely take the initiative in development and achieve steady and long-lasting progress.- ，，、。，，、，、。，，。，。--，。、、，，、.

2024 CEWC Readout & Assessment - Xi Calls for 'Equal-footed Consultation' with US - Xi Meets Dmitry Medvedev	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, December 13, 2024. Page 1: The front page is all Xi Jinping, including the Central Economic Work Conference readout. So let's begin by breaking down the 2024 CEWC readout. In his speech at the CEWC, Xi reviewed the country's economic work in 2024, analyzed the current economic situation and arranged next year's economic work. My Note: I have some initial thoughts going through this readout, although I am sure I haven't spent enough time with it to come up with a detailed assessment yet. But here goes. First, there is a reaffirmation that the economic goals for the year will be achieved. I am highlighting this in light of recent discourse on Beijing wavering on the GDP target. Second, compared to last year's readout, this one talks about having a -more proactive fiscal policy- and specifically to -raise the fiscal deficit ratio.- Last year, the objective outlined was to -appropriately intensify- fiscal policy. In terms of fiscal policy changes, the document calls to increase the issuance and use of special bonds by local governments, expand the scope of investment domains, and broaden the use of these bonds as project capital. Third, also compared to last year, the document this time talks about implementing -a moderately loose monetary policy- from an earlier -prudent monetary policy-. This phrase was used in the Politburo meeting earlier this week. As reports have informed, this is the first time we are seeing such language since the 2008-09 financial crisis. The document also calls to reduce the reserve requirement ratio and interest rates in a timely manner. Fourth, the requirement of boosting domestic consumption is once again on the top of the list of tasks for next year. Last year's CEWC had it second among the nine tasks. The top task was to focus on technology. In 2022, domestic demand was the top priority in the CEWC readout. The document calls to -vigorously boost consumption- and support the two new policies and two heavy projects, through more central funding. Towards the end of the document, this is a very clear statement of intent: -It is necessary to closely grasp key links to complete the key tasks of economic work next year, targeting the prominent issues of insufficient demand by focusing on boosting domestic demand, especially residential consumption demand; address deep-seated development constraints and external challenges by unwaveringly deepening reforms and expanding opening up…- Fifth, the second priority in the list is to focus on technology linked to industrial development. In contrast, there's no real emphasis on consumer technology or platform economy, although it does get a mention. One noteworthy aspect of this is the call to -comprehensively rectify ‘involution-style' competition and standardize the behavior of local governments and enterprises-. This is indicative of far more intervention by the state, particularly through the central government and regulatory changes to ensure what it contends is market order. Sixth, with regard to the real estate sector, the readout calls to -reasonably control the supply of new land for real estate projects, revitalize existing land and commercial and office buildings, and promote the disposal of existing commercial housing. Promote the construction of a new model of real estate development and build relevant basic systems in an orderly manner.- This is somewhat different from the readout last year, which had called to -meet the reasonable financing needs of real estate enterprises of different ownerships equally-. The readout this year essentially entails a continuation of the policies that have been enacted this year. Seventh, I thought this was worth noting: -Support economically developed provinces to take the lead, and encourage other regions to adapt to local conditions and showcase their strengths. Deepen industrial cooperation among the eastern, central, western, and northeastern regions, and vigorously develop the marine economy and bay area economy-. I wonder if this is also somewhere a concern with regard to low-end industrial capacity being outsourced beyond China's border, and therefore, a call to transfer capacity to the interiors. Eighth, the exclusion of some ideas is interesting. For instance, there is a reference to balancing the relationship between total supply and total demand, but there is no mention of supply-side structural reform; it was mentioned in 2022 and 2023. Also, there's not really any substantive space given to boosting private sector confidence compared to last year's readout. There's no mention of the ‘Two Unswervings', which again was something that was referenced in 2022 and 2023. Finally, towards the end, the paragraph on implementation is rather scathing, and a reflection of systemic inertia and the frustration of the top leadership. Subscribe now Share Tracking People's Daily With that done, here's what the readout says: -The meeting held that this year was a crucial year for achieving the goals and tasks of the 14th Five-Year Plan. In the face of the complex and severe situation characterized by increasing external pressures and mounting internal difficulties, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core united and led the entire Party and people of all ethnic groups across the country to respond calmly and adopt comprehensive measures. Economic operation is generally stable while making steady progress, high-quality development is solidly advancing, and the main economic and social development goals and tasks are about to be successfully achieved. New quality productive forces have steadily developed, reform and opening-up have been continuously deepened, risks in key areas have been mitigated in an orderly and effective manner, work on people's livelihood security has been solid and effective, and solid strides have been made in Chinese-style modernization. The development journey over the past year has been extraordinary and the achievements have been encouraging, especially the decisive deployment of a package of incremental policies at the meeting of the Politburo on September 26, which effectively boosted social confidence and significantly led to economic recovery.- ，--。、，，、，、，，。，，，，。，，926，，. -The meeting pointed out that the adverse effects of the current changes in the external environment have deepened, and China's economic operation still faces many difficulties and challenges, mainly due to insufficient domestic demand, operational difficulties for some enterprises, pressures on employment and income growth for the people, and numerous risks and hidden dangers that still remain. At the same time, it must be seen that China's economic foundation is stable, has many advantages, strong resilience, and great potential, and the long-term supporting conditions and basic trends have not changed. We must face up to difficulties, strengthen our confidence, and strive to transform positive factors in all aspects into development results.- ，，，，，，。，、、、，。、，. -The meeting held that in practice, we have continuously deepened our understanding of the laws of economic work. The centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee is the fundamental guarantee for doing economic work well. At critical moments and important junctures, the Party Central Committee has promptly assessed the situation and made decisions and deployments, ensuring that China's economic ship can brave the waves and move forward steadily. It is necessary to coordinate the relationship between an effective market and a capable government, forming an economic order that is both ‘let loose/engender freedom or autonomy' () and ‘regulated/controlled'(). It is necessary to coordinate the relationship between total supply and total demand to ensure smooth circulation in the national economy. It is necessary to coordinate the relationship between cultivating new drivers of growth and renewing old ones, developing new quality productive forces according to local conditions. It is necessary to properly coordinate the relationship between improving incremental additions and revitalizing existing stock, and comprehensively enhance resource allocation efficiency. It is necessary to properly coordinate the relationship between improving quality and expanding total volume, and consolidate the material foundation of Chinese-style modernization.- ，，。，、，、，、。，----。，。，。，。，. -The meeting stressed that to do a good job in economic work next year, we must take Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the guide, fully implement the spirit of the 20th Party Congress and the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the 20th Central Committee, adhere to the general tone of work of seeking progress while maintaining stability, fully and accurately implement the new development concept, accelerate the construction of a new development pattern, solidly promote high-quality development, further comprehensively deepen reform, expand high-level opening up, build a modern industrial system, better coordinate development and security, implement more proactive and effective macroeconomic policies, expand domestic demand, promote the integrated development of scientific and technological innovation and industrial innovation, stabilize the property and stock markets, prevent and resolve risks and external shocks in key areas, stabilize expectations, stimulate vitality, promote the sustained recovery of the economy, continuously improve people's living standards, maintain social harmony and stability, and complete the goals and tasks of the ‘14th Five-Year Plan' with high quality, so as to lay a solid foundation for a good start to the ‘15th Five-Year Plan'.- ，，，、，，，，，，，，，，，，，，、，，，，--，--. -The meeting pointed out that next year, we must maintain stable economic growth, maintain overall stability in employment and prices, maintain a basic balance in international payments, and promote the synchronization of residents' income growth and economic growth.

Noting that the China-U.S. relationship is one of the most important relationships in the world, Xi said it concerns not only the immediate interests of the Chinese and American peoples, but also the future of and destiny of the entire humanity. Xi said both countries stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, adding China is prepared to stay in communication with the United States to expand cooperation, manage differences, continue exploring the right way for the two countries to get along with each other in the new era, and realize long-term, peaceful coexistence on this planet to the benefit of the two countries and the world at large.- -Economic and trade relations are an important part of bilateral relations, Xi said, noting the interests of the two countries are closely intertwined, and the room for cooperation is infinitely vast. The two sides should properly handle differences through equal-footed consultation, and make the pie of cooperation bigger based on their complementary advantages, said the Chinese president. The success of one side should be an opportunity rather than a challenge for the other, and one's achievement should help rather than hinder the development of the other, he added. Xi said openness is a key driving force for human civilization and progress, adding it is the only path toward prosperity and development for every country. Reform and opening up is a historic process in which China and the world achieve development and progress together, he said, adding a few months ago, the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China adopted a comprehensive plan for further deepening reform across the board to advance Chinese modernization. Xi said China will always uphold the basic state policy of opening up to the outside world, keep improving its market-oriented, law-based, and world-class business environment for companies from all countries including the United States, and continue to liberalize and facilitate trade and investment. Chinese modernization, with its new achievements, will provide new opportunities for the world, he added.

Xi emphasized that in a world marked by intertwined changes and turmoil, peace and development remain the shared aspirations of all peoples. China stands ready to work with other countries in the spirit of ‘promoting global solidarity', upholding fairness and justice to safeguard global peace and stability, adhering to win-win cooperation to promote sustainable global development, and committing to inclusiveness and mutual learning to advance human civilization to new heights, Xi said.- Finally, there's a report on Xi meeting with Chairman of the United Russia party Dmitry Medvedev. Xinhua says: -Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 75 years ago, China and Russia have blazed a new path featuring mutual respect, harmonious coexistence and win-win cooperation between major and neighboring countries, setting an example of new-type international relations as well as relations between major neighboring countries, Xi said. He said China is willing to work with Russia to strengthen the synergy of development strategies, tap the intrinsic momentum of bilateral cooperation, and continuously bring benefits to the two countries and peoples. China and Russia should strengthen communication and coordination within such multilateral frameworks as the United Nations (UN), the BRICS cooperation mechanism and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, firmly uphold the international system with the UN at its core, and practice true multilateralism so as to make the international order more just and equitable and jointly safeguard global strategic stability and international fairness and justice, Xi said. Xi pointed out that since the establishment of relations between the CPC and the United Russia party more than 20 years ago, the two sides have conducted high-level and constructive interactions, strengthened exchanges and mutual learning on party and state governance, continuously enriched the content of institutionalized exchanges between the two parties, and helped consolidate political and strategic mutual trust between China and Russia. As important forces promoting human progress, the two parties should further coordinate and cooperate closely, lead the global governance in the right direction, and pool the consensus of friendly political parties in countries around the world, especially in the Global South countries, to push the world forward in the right direction, Xi said. On the Ukraine crisis, China has repeatedly emphasized the need to uphold the three principles of no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no provocation by any party, to promote the easing of the situation as soon as possible, Xi said. He added that China will continue to adhere to its consistent position and work with the international community to create favorable conditions for the political settlement of the crisis.- The report adds: -Medvedev delivered a signed letter to Xi from Russian President Vladimir Putin-. -Noting that the exchanges and cooperation between the United Russia party and the CPC bear special responsibilities in the relations between the two countries, Medvedev said the United Russia party is willing to promote pragmatic cooperation and youth exchanges through the dialogue mechanism between the ruling parties of Russia and China, strengthen education on traditional values such as patriotism and promote the long-term development of bilateral relations. Medvedev said that the Russian side speaks highly of China's position on the Ukraine crisis, pays attention to the Group of Friends for Peace on the Ukraine crisis, an initiative put forward by China, Brazil and other countries, and is willing to actively promote the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis.- Finally, there's a report on Xi meeting with foreign envoys. The PD report says: Xi Jinping pointed out that China has a long history and a vast territory. He hoped that the envoys will visit more parts of China, listen more to the voices of the Chinese people, fully understand the China of the past, the present and the future, objectively reflect China's contemporary outlook, development path and direction, and actively play the role of bridge builders, promoters of cooperation and inheritors of friendship between China and the world … Chinese-style modernization is not a modernization pursued in isolation. China is willing to share its development opportunities with all countries, achieve mutual benefit and mutual success, and work together to achieve the modernization of all countries in the world with peaceful development, mutually beneficial cooperation and common prosperity.- ，、。，，、、，、、，、、...。，、，、、. Xi Jinping emphasized that the era we are in faces major challenges and crises, such as geopolitical conflicts, unilateral actions, rising protectionism, and climate change, which urgently require joint action by all countries. At this new historical crossroads, nations should draw lessons from human history, strengthen unity and collaboration, and pool greater efforts to safeguard world peace and development. As a stabilizing, positive, and progressive force in the international community, China will always unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development, and together with other countries, advocate an equal and orderly world multipolarization, inclusive and beneficial economic globalization, practice the common values ​​of all mankind, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.- ，、、，。，，，。、、，，，、，，.

China will further opening-up to the outside world, proactively align with high-standard international economic and trade rules, and build a market-oriented, law-based and internationalized business environment to provide more opportunities for and share more development dividends with other countries, he said.- -Noting the progress in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) over the past decade, Xi welcomed international economic organizations to continue actively participating in the BRI cooperation and promote the modernization of all countries that features peaceful development, mutually beneficial cooperation and common prosperity.- Regarding global economic governance, Xi stressed that promoting world economic growth is inseparable from effective and proactive global economic governance. International economic organizations should keep pace with the times, respond to the call of the times and the expectations of the people of the world; they should actively participate in and promote the reform of the global economic governance system, build a more fair and reasonable global economic governance system, reflect the development and changes in the global economic structure, and increase the representation and voice of the Global South. All parties have already reached some consensus in this regard; the key is to turn the vision into reality. Regardless of how global economic governance is reformed, it must adhere to the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits, uphold true multilateralism, and ensure equality of rights, opportunities, and rules for all countries. ，，，、。，，，，，。，。，，，、、. The on ties with the US, Xi said: -China is willing to maintain dialogue, expand cooperation and manage differences with the U.S. government, and push bilateral relations forward in the direction of steady, healthy and sustainable development, Xi said, expressing the hope that the U.S. side will work with China in the same direction. ‘Tariff wars, trade wars and sci-tech wars go against the trend of history and the laws of economics, and there will be no winners,' he said. China will always focus on doing its own things well and resolutely safeguard its sovereignty, security, and development interests. At the same time, China's determination to promote high-level opening up will not change. ，、、，、、，。、、，。，、、。. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a very long feature article that says that as 2024 draws to a close -China's economy is entering a new and critical phase-, which will require critical decisions. It says that: -The road ahead is by no means smooth. Looking at the outside world, the international environment is more severe and complex, the global economic growth momentum is insufficient, and some countries continue to increase their containment and suppression of China. Looking inside, domestic effective demand is insufficient, economic performance shows divergences, there are still several risks and hidden dangers in key areas, and there are pains associated with the transition between old and new drivers of growth … At present, China is at a critical stage of accelerating the pace of transformation and upgrading, striving to advance high-quality development. It is at a critical period of comprehensively promoting the construction of a strong country and the great cause of national rejuvenation with Chinese-style modernization. Critical periods require critical decisions. Facing various risks, challenges, and uncertainties, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, has taken a comprehensive view and courageously taken on responsibilities, uniting and leading the entire Party and the people of all ethnic groups across the country to tackle difficulties and forge ahead, steering the giant ship of China's economy fearlessly and bravely.- 。，，，。，，，，。-、，。-。，、，、。。，、，、，、. The first section of the article talks about the significance of the September 26 Politburo meeting. It says that the meeting sent -a strong signal to stabilize the overall economic development and continue the long-term positive trend.- It adds that -before and after this meeting, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the People's Bank of China, the State Administration for Market Regulation, the State Financial Regulatory Administration, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and other departments released a package of incremental policies.- There's a detailing of some of the steps that have been announced since September. But the focus of this section is essentially Xi's leadership. The second section talks about the development of new quality productive forces. It says: -At present, the world is at a new stage where informatization fully drives innovation and serves as the foundation for reshaping a nation's core competitiveness. Whoever can better understand and grasp this trend, better adapt to and lead the direction of productivity development, will be able to comprehensively enhance their overall national strength.- ，、。，，. This section essentially reiterates the importance of transforming traditional industries, focussing on emerging industries, and building a modern industrial layout with a focus on technology, along with the agenda of green transformation. For instance, it says: -Green development is the underlying color of high-quality development, and the new quality of productivity itself is green productivity.- ，. The third section discusses the need to focus on livelihood issues. It acknowledges that: -At present, some local governments are facing financial difficulties, incidents of companies laying off workers and delaying wages are increasing, employment pressure is rising, and the task of improving people's well-being has become even more arduous and challenging.- ，，，，. The section also touches on the issues of demographics, food security, urbanisation, etc. The fourth and final section discusses opening up. The basic idea here is that reform and opening up is a -firm choice- that comes from the Party's and Xi's -scientific assessment-. At one point, the article also says: At present, the profound changes unseen in a century are accelerating, and transformations of the world, the times, and history are unfolding in unprecedented ways. A few countries are engaging in ‘decoupling and breaking chains' and building ‘small yards with high walls', while protectionism, unilateralism, and hegemonism continue to rise. The more we encounter countercurrents, the more we must actively embrace and promote economic globalization. At the crossroads of choices in this era, China consistently stands on the right side of history and on the side of human progress.- ，，、、，----，、、。，。，，. Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

The report says: -The meeting pointed out that, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the National Supervisory Commission, and discipline inspection and supervisory organs at all levels have deeply studied and implemented Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, especially General Secretary Xi Jinping's important thought on the Party's self-revolution; focusing on the central tasks of the Party and the state, they have continuously strengthened political oversight, vigorously promoted the rectification of conduct, discipline enforcement, and anti-corruption efforts, and solidly carried out education on Party discipline.

The foundation of China's economy is stable, its advantages are numerous, its resilience is strong, and its potential is great. The supporting conditions and fundamental trends for long-term positive development have not changed. We must maintain strategic resolve, proactively shape an external environment favourable to us, stay firmly committed to managing our own affairs well, and transform various positive factors into tangible development results. Xi Jinping emphasised that doing a good job in economic work next year requires the joint efforts and hard work of the entire Party and all of society. At present, China's development faces many uncertainties and challenges, which must be taken seriously and effectively addressed. Difficulties and challenges are there every year, but we have always developed through trials and grown stronger through tests.

All parties should further focus on development, jointly foster a peaceful and stable development environment, advance the improvement of global governance, maintain the stability and smoothness of the global supply chain, and cultivate new momentum for economic growth.- ，，，。，、。，，，，. He added that -China is a staunch defender of economic globalization and multilateralism. Over the long term, China's economy has continuously injected strong momentum into the global economy, increasingly demonstrating its distinct characteristics of development.- He then made three points with regard to China's economic policy going forward: First, there is an operating mechanism for stable growth, adhering to the principle of seeking progress while maintaining stability and long-term planning. We will increase counter-cyclical adjustments, step up the implementation of macroeconomic policies, do everything possible to expand domestic demand and boost consumption, make greater efforts to solve outstanding problems, and promote the continued recovery of the economy. Second, there is incremental space for sustained growth, and new demands and new momentum will continue to form. We will further comprehensively deepen reforms, accelerate the construction of a unified national market, focus on promoting scientific and technological innovation and industrial innovation, and continuously enhance the endogenous driving force of the economy. Third, there are positive spillover effects, and we will always share development opportunities with the world. We will unwaveringly promote high-standard opening up, introduce more self-initiated and unilateral opening policies,expand a global network of high-standard free trade zones, and continue to create a world-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based, and internationalized. Li added: -China is willing to work with all parties to safeguard the basic norms of international relations and the multilateral trading system. China supports international economic organizations in playing an important role in global governance and will actively assume international obligations that match its own capabilities to jointly promote the healthy and stable development of the world economy.- ，、。，，。，、。，，、，，。，、。，，，。，。，，，、、。，，。，。，，.

China supports the continuous expansion of the New Development Bank and is willing to expand project and financing cooperation between the two sides to jointly contribute more to the economic and social development of BRICS countries and developing countries. China is willing to strengthen cooperation with the World Bank in international development, loans, knowledge and other fields to improve the quality and efficiency of cooperation, he said. China supports the WTO in carrying out necessary reforms, promoting the vitality of the multilateral trading system, and safeguarding economic globalization and free trade, and China is willing to deepen cooperation with the IMF and make greater contributions to maintaining global financial stability, promoting common development and tackling climate change, Li noted. Finally, there's a report on Wang Huning's comments at the 2024 annual conference of the Cross-Strait CEO Summit. Wang praised the summit for having -united enterprises and business people on both sides of the strait- and for making -important contributions to promoting the peaceful development and integrated development of cross-strait relations-.

Noting that ensuring the equal enjoyment of the Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ESCR) by all is an important goal for the realization of all human rights, Wang said it is important to uphold true multilateralism, adhere to a people-centered approach, and strengthen solidarity and coordination. Committed to putting the people first, China has found a path of human rights development that is in line with the trend of the times and suits its national conditions. Historic achievements have been made in China's human rights cause, and the protection of the ESCR has reached new heights, he added.

Chinese enterprises ‘going global' are continuously introducing new offerings to the global market with higher-quality goods, services, and technologies.- ，，，。--，、，--. -In the first 10 months, China's import and export of goods increased by 5.2% year-on-year, among which the export of automatic data processing equipment and its parts, integrated circuits and automobiles achieved double-digit growth. In the same period, China's import and export of services increased by 14.6% year-on-year, among which the export of services increased by 16.6% year-on-year; non-financial ODI increased by 10.6% year-on-year, and the newly-signed contract value of contracted projects in the BRI partner increased by 15.7% year-on-year. Behind the growth curve is a pragmatic approach of mutual benefit and win-win cooperation … Increasingly, Chinese companies are actively working with host country companies to strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation and complement each other's strengths. At the same time, they are actively fulfilling their corporate social responsibilities, creating jobs, providing vocational training, improving infrastructure, and integrating into local communities, making positive contributions to local economic and social development and improving people's well-being.

The essence of the global layout of enterprises is to achieve the best allocation of global resources.

For the global economy, as Chinese enterprises ‘go global', their products, technologies, business models, and management expertise promote connectivity in trade, economics, and other fields. This helps stabilise global supply chains and inject new vitality into the world economy. The ‘going global' of Chinese enterprises makes the Chinese economy more closely interconnected with the global economy.- ，，、，，。，--，、、，，，。--，.

It refers to several initiatives, including BRI, and says that the Third Plenum Decision has proposed to improve the system and mechanism for promoting and safeguarding outbound investment, improve the outbound investment management service system, and promote international cooperation in the industrial chain and supply chain. This bit is interesting: -At present, China is more actively connecting with high-standard international economic and trade rules, and steadily expanding institutional opening up such as rules, regulations, management, and standards. This requires Chinese companies to not only focus on building hard power, such as high-quality products and projects, but also to be more familiar with and master international common rules, respect the laws and regulations of the host country, strengthen compliance awareness, brand awareness, and corporate management, and lay a solid foundation for sustainable development.- ，，、、、。，、，、、，.

Xinhua says: -The book features a collection of 37 important works by Xi expounding on the theme between December 2012 and October 2024. Some of these works are made public for the first time. Since the 18th National Congress of the CPC in 2012, the CPC Central Committee with Xi Jinping at its core has comprehensively strengthened the Party's leadership over the work of people's congresses and vigorously promoted whole-process people's democracy.

With the effective implementation of proactive fiscal policies and prudent monetary policies, positive factors are continuously increasing.- 3.9；10，--；9270.5，1……，. The piece mentions policies related to the ‘two heavy' and ‘two new' goals, real estate policies, etc. The second section talks about the focus on technology and innovation. It says: In the first 10 months, investment in high-tech industries increased by 9.3% year-on-year, and the number of invention patents authorised was 889,000; in October, the added value of high-tech manufacturing increased by 9.4% year-on-year. 10，9.3%，88.9；109.4%. The piece highlights some breakthroughs, such as the formal commercial operation of China's first self-developed F-class heavy-duty gas turbine. This happened in late November. It mentions the C919 aircraft being picked up by three airlines and Origin Wukong, China's third-generation superconducting quantum computer, going into operation. It adds: -In the first three quarters, listed companies invested 1.10 trillion yuan in R&amp;D, up 3.9% year-on-year; by the end of October, the number of domestic valid invention patents reached 4.66 million ... R&amp;D investment increased, innovative achievements emerged, and industrial upgrading took solid steps.

Efforts are accelerating in deploying new industries and new tracks such as the low-altitude economy, commercial space, and bio-manufacturing. Emerging industries are developing rapidly, and new drivers of growth are continuously accumulating.- 5G414.1，-5G+-1.5，4500……、、，，。 The final section talks about policies related to reform and opening up. Finally, there's a report informing that -as of 24:00 on December 6, 29.638 million consumers had purchased 45.85 million units of eight major categories of home appliances, driving sales of 201.97 billion yuan, with over 90% of the sales revenue coming from first-level energy-efficient products. Recently, various regions have actively promoted home appliance trade-in programs, with policy effects becoming increasingly evident. Nationwide, it took 79 days for trade-in sales to surpass 100 billion yuan, while the jump from 100 billion to 200 billion yuan took only 40 days, accelerating the release of consumption potential for upgrades.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 6: Today's Xinhua piece on the economy deals with the policy shifts in the property sector since the September 26 Politburo meeting. The first sentence says that -the housing issue is both a people's livelihood issue and a development issue.- ，. The article says that after the Politburo meeting, -multiple departments introduced policies to promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, summarised as ‘Four Cancellations', ‘Four Reductions', and ‘Two Increases.' Many regions, especially first-tier cities, have actively adjusted and optimized related policies to help the market recover…Local governments have implemented city-specific measures to cancel or reduce restrictive policies, unlocking housing demand; tax policies have been optimized to lower transaction costs; land policies have been adjusted to control new supply and manage existing inventory, enhancing the ‘reservoir' function of land reserves; and financial support has been increased, injecting liquidity into the sector. How effective have these policy combinations been? Let's observe several key indicators.- The first indicator is sales data: -The latest data from the NBS shows that, from the sales situation of 40 key cities monitored, second-tier cities that previously had experienced larger declines earlier showed significant marginal improvement, with monthly sales area in October achieving positive growth, and the decline in sales volume narrowing significantly. From January to October, the nationwide newly-built commercial housing sales area year-on-year declined by 15.8%, with the decline range narrowing by 1.3 percentage points compared to January to September; newly-built commercial housing sales amount year-on-year declined by 20.9%, with the decline range narrowing by 1.8 percentage points compared to January to September. The online signing data of the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development showed that in October, the online signing volume of newly-built commercial housing transactions in China increased by 0.9% year-on-year, the first growth after 15 consecutive months of decline; the total transaction volume of newly-built commercial housing and second-hand housing increased by 3.9% year-on-year, the first growth after 8 consecutive months of decline. 926，--，，------。，。，，----：，；，；，、，--；，--……--？。——，40，，10，。110，15.8%，191.3；20.9%，191.8。，10，0.9%，15；3.9%，8. The second indicator is that the number of visits to first-hand houses and the number of viewings of second-hand houses have increased significantly. The third indicator is market confidence. It says that -According to the PMI survey, the real estate business activity index in October rebounded by 2.5 percentage points from the previous month, and the market expectation index rebounded by 1.8 percentage points. This indicates that under the influence of various policies, the real estate market's prosperity has begun to recover.- PMI，102.5，1.8。，。 The section ends by quoting the National Bureau of Statistics and the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development as assessing that: -‘Overall, the comprehensive set of measures to promote the stabilisation of the real estate market has shown effectiveness, with positive changes appearing in the real estate market in October. As the policy effectiveness of various measures continues to be released, the momentum to drive real estate market stabilisation will strengthen' … ‘Under the effect of a series of policies, after three years of adjustment, China's real estate market has begun to bottom out'.- -，，10。，。--，，.- The second section argues that: -On the one hand, we should see that the package of policies has begun to take effect; on the other hand, we should also see that the bottoming out of the real estate market is a process that requires a combination of long-term and short-term measures, addressing symptoms and root causes.- First, we must ‘adapt to the new situation in which the supply and demand relationship of China's real estate market has undergone major changes'. This was a major judgment made by the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee on July 24, 2023. To understand the current real estate situation, we must first grasp this change. The supply and demand relationship is a key factor affecting market prices, which is one of the basic principles of economics. Over the past 20-plus years, China's real estate market has generally shown an upward trend, playing an important role in guaranteeing and improving people's livelihood and supporting China's economic and social development. At the same time, the rapid expansion of the real estate market also saw some issues such as excessive capital concentration in real estate, and some real estate enterprises exhibiting ‘high debt, high leverage, high turnover'. From the past, when supply fell short of demand, leading to a booming market and even price distortions, to recent years, where the main contradiction has shifted from total quantity shortage to basically balanced total quantity with structural supply insufficiency, the underlying logic of the real estate market has changed. (Note: My understanding of this is that there are enough units available in the market but these do not match with consumer demand requirements, either in type, quality or price, etc.) Therefore, to further stabilize and improve the real estate market, commercial housing construction must focus on ‘strictly controlling new supply, optimizing existing inventory, and improving quality'. From the perspective of existing stock, China's new commercial housing supply scale is large, and stock digestion is an important adjustment direction. At the policy level, it has been clearly stated that in cities with relatively large commercial housing inventory, the government can purchase as needed, actively supporting the acquisition of existing commercial housing for use as affordable housing. Currently, various regions are accelerating the process of acquiring existing commercial housing for use as affordable housing, and special bond support for reclaiming idle existing stock land and adding new land reserves is also being rapidly implemented. From the perspective of increments and quality, people's housing demand has transformed from focussing on whether one has or not to quality, and meeting this market demand is an important direction for adjusting increments and improving quality.- ，；，，、。，--。724。，。，。20，，、。，，，-、、-。，、，。，，-、、-. ，，。，，，。，，、。，----，. -Secondly, it is essential to repair the credit chain, rebuild market confidence, and promote a virtuous cycle between finance and real estate. Winning the battle to ensure housing delivery is the top priority among these. For some time, during the adjustment of the real estate market, some commercial housing projects that are under construction or have been pre-sold have faced difficulties in delivery due to funding and debt problems. This phenomenon not only seriously damages the rights and interests of home buyers, but also affects market confidence and hinders the orderly operation of the market. In response to this ‘pain point', the work of ensuring the delivery of houses has been steadily promoted, and the urban real estate financing coordination mechanism has been launched in a timely manner — incorporating compliant real estate projects into a ‘white list', ensuring all eligible projects receive loans, satisfying projects' reasonable financing needs. This has become an important measure and strong guarantee for achieving a virtuous cycle between financial and real estate and improving market expectations. At present, 297 cities at or above the prefecture level across the country have established a real estate project financing coordination mechanism. As of October 31, 2024, the amount of loans approved for ‘white list' projects exceeded 3 trillion yuan. By the end of the year, as the ‘white list' is expanded in an orderly manner, this scale will increase to 4 trillion yuan. The increase in the scale of credit indicates that the financing of real estate projects is picking up pace and becoming more convenient, and the continued advancement of guaranteed housing delivery is increasingly secure. As of November 13, 2024, the battle for guaranteed housing delivery has been vigorously promoted, and 2.85 million units have been delivered nationwide. This has not only protected the legitimate rights and interests of home buyers, but also effectively improved market expectations. In addition, it is necessary to release the potential demand of the market and further activate the real estate market from both the supply and demand sides. Based on the current main contradiction in the real estate market, in terms of supply structure, the supply of affordable housing is relatively insufficient, housing prices in large cities are high, and the housing burden of new citizens and youth is relatively heavy. In terms of housing demand, improved housing demand continues to upgrade, with residents' desire to enhance living quality becoming stronger. Therefore, by ‘four cancellations' and ‘four reductions' to lower purchasing costs and increasing affordable housing construction and urban village transformation will inject new demand into the real estate market. From the medium and long-term trend of the real estate market, there is still development space in meeting the rigid and improved housing needs. China is still in the middle to late stages of urbanization, and continuously promoting people-oriented new-type urbanization will release greater real estate market demand potential.- ，，，。。，，、，。，，。--，，——--，、，，、。，297。1031，--3。，--，4。，，。1113，，285，，。，，。，，，，、。，，。，----，，。，。，，. Share Tracking People's Daily The final section says that the earlier real estate sector -development model is no longer adapted to the new requirements of high-quality development-. It adds that -accelerating the construction of a new real estate development model is the fundamental solution for stable and healthy real estate market development. Better satisfying rigid and improved housing needs, perfecting real estate development, transaction and usage systems, establishing a new mechanism for coordinated linkage of the factors of ‘people, houses, land, and money' are important aspects of accelerating the construction of a new real estate development model.- ，。，、，-、、、-，. -Creating safe, comfortable, green, and intelligent houses has become an important path to meet people's beautiful life needs, and is also the rightful meaning of promoting high-quality development of the real estate industry. From supporting urban expansion to participating in urban renewal, from driving growth through new supply to linking new supply with existing stock... Real estate development must focus on the diversified housing needs of the people in the new development stage, addressing aspects such as outdoor environments, age-friendly design, and green low-carbon features, and promoting a comprehensive upgrade in the quality of housing construction. At present, the policy support scope for urban village renovation has expanded from only 35 major cities at the beginning to all cities at prefecture level and above. A total of 1,632 urban village renovation projects have been implemented in major cities. From January to October, 3.17 million sets of affordable housing and urban village renovation resettlement housing have been built and raised nationwide; by the end of this year, more than 10 million people in need can be helped to improve their housing conditions. Actively implementing urban renewal actions is an important measure to transform urban development methods and achieve high-quality development. Systematically promoting ‘four good' construction, i.e., construction of good houses, good neighborhoods, good communities, and good urban areas, is the focus of real estate industry's future development. The nation has implemented over 66,000 urban renewal projects, with cumulative investment of 2.6 trillion yuan. The comprehensive effectiveness brought by urban renewal actions is gradually emerging. In 2024, the plan was to begin renovation of 54,000 old urban residential areas; 53,000 of these have already started in the first 10 months. Coordinated linkage and preventing dramatic fluctuations are key to achieving stable, healthy, and high-quality real estate market development.- 20，，。、、、，，。，……，、、，。，35。1632。110，317（）；，1000。，、。、、、--，。6.6，2.6，。2024，5.4，105.3. Share Tracking People's Daily Page 15: There's an article by Ding Duo, deputy director of the Research Center for Ocean Law and Policy, the National Institute for South China Sea Studies. Ding's basic argument is that -the Philippines' violations of China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, as well as other practices that deviate from the track of resolving disputes through negotiation and consultation and maliciously escalate the situation, violate international law, including the UN Charter, go against the spirit of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and undermine peace and stability in the South China Sea and the region.- The specific things that he points to are: -Instigated by extra-regional countries, the current Philippine government has frequently infringed, provoked and created trouble at at Huangyan Island (Scarborough Shoal), Ren'ai Reef (Second Thomas Shoal), Xianbin Reef (Sabina Shoal), Tiexian Reef (Sandy Cay) and other places, hyping the so-called illegal arbitration ruling of the South China Sea case in the international public opinion arena, disguising itself as a victim to deceive the world. Such manipulation cannot change the mainstream perception of the South China Sea issue within the international community, nor can it change China's firm will to defend its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights.- ，、、、、，，。，. Ding ends with this: -For a long time, China has resolutely safeguarded its legitimate rights and interests in the South China Sea, firmly maintained peace and stability in the South China Sea, and insisted on resolving disputes through negotiation and consultation. China's claims and position will not change due to fluctuations in the maritime situation, and China's determination and will will not be shaken by external interference. The Philippine side should abandon any baseless, unreasonable, and unhelpful fantasies, and work with China to seek a stable and long-term solution to the South China Sea issue.- ，，，。，。、、，，. Finally, there's a statement from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the developments in Syria. It said: -China is closely following the situation in Syria and hopes that stability will return as soon as possible. The Chinese government has been actively helping Chinese nationals who wish to leave the country to do so in a safe and orderly way, and staying in contact with those Chinese still in Syria and offering them advice on how to stay safe. We urge relevant parties in Syria to ensure the safety and security of the Chinese institutions and personnel in Syria. The Chinese Embassy is still up and running and carrying out its duty in Syria. We will continue to make every possible assistance to Chinese nationals in need.- Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

This shouldn't take more than 5 minutes of your time. You can take the survey by clicking here. Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, December 06, 2024. Page 1: The lead story today is about Xi Jinping's inspection of the Information Support Force of the PLA on Wednesday. Zhang Youxia, He Weidong, Liu Zhenli, and Zhang Shengmin were present for this. Xi emphasized that -it is necessary to implement the thought of strengthening the army in the new era, implement the new era's military strategic guidelines, strengthen mission responsibility, bravely innovate and break through, consolidate the foundation of the military, strive to build a powerful modern information support force, and realize the leapfrog development of the Chinese military's network information system.- ，，，，，，，. The report says: -Xi Jinping listened to the work report of the Information Support Force and delivered an important speech. He pointed out that currently, a new round of technological revolution and military revolution is developing rapidly, war forms are accelerating their evolution, and the position and role of network information systems in modern warfare are unprecedented. The Information Support Force is first and foremost a combat force. It must stand at the height of strengthening the military and being victorious in war, fully recognize the extreme importance of network information system construction, understand the historical mission it bears, and rapidly advance the construction of network information systems and service support capabilities for the military's combat readiness.- ，，。，，，，。，，，，. -Xi Jinping emphasized that it is necessary to persist in emancipating thinking, seeking truth from facts, keeping up with the times, strengthen overall planning, innovate development models, actively explore and practice, and solidly carry out various network information system construction tasks. It is necessary to focus on being able to fight and win wars, optimize information service guarantee methods, steadily promote the construction of network information public service platforms, integrate and make good use of various types of data and information, attach great importance to network information security protection, quickly integrate into the system, drive the system, and empower the system, and lead innovations in command models and transformations of combat methods. It is necessary to continuously promote the implementation of reform tasks, establish and improve work operation mechanisms, improve relevant laws and regulations, create a good ecology of co-construction and sharing, and improve the quality and efficiency of network information system construction.- ，、、，，，，。、，，，，，、、，、。，，，，. -Xi Jinping pointed out that the Information Support Force is currently in its initial creation period and must comprehensively strengthen self-construction, pay attention to laying foundations and planning for the long term, and solidify the developmental roots of the force. It is necessary to thoroughly implement the spirit of the Central Military Commission's Political Work Conference, uphold the fundamental principle and system of the Party's absolute leadership over the military, strengthen its arming with the Party's innovative theories, focus on deepening ideological rectification at the root of thought, strictly maintain political discipline and combat corruption, and ensure the force remains absolutely loyal, absolutely pure, and absolutely reliable. The first Party Committee of the Information Support Force must strengthen the sense of entrepreneurship and pioneering spirit, take on their first responsibilities, select and strengthen Party committees at all levels, build strong front-line command posts and front-line combat fortresses, and improve the leadership, organizational, and executive capabilities of Party organizations. It is necessary to implement the whole-chain construction concept, innovate talent cultivation models, and build a high-quality professional network information talent formation. It is necessary to adhere to precise construction, strengthen scientific management, focus on classified guidance, solidly promote grassroots construction, and maintain the force's normal order and stability.- ，，，、，。，，，，，、、。，，，，、、。，，。，，，，. Xi Jinping finally emphasized that the CMC should strengthen overall coordination, the relevant departments of the Commission should take the initiative to provide guidance, and all units should actively cooperate to jointly build the Information Support Force and create a new situation in the construction of the military's network information system. ，，，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on Xi's congratulatory letter to Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah on her election as president of Namibia. Xinhua reports: -Noting that China and Namibia enjoy a long-standing traditional friendship, Xi said that in recent years, the two countries have strengthened their political mutual trust, achieved fruitful outcomes in practical cooperation, and firmly supported each other on issues concerning their core interests and major concerns. Also in the message, Xi said that he highly regards the development of China-Namibia relations, and stands ready to work with Nandi-Ndaitwah to take the implementation of the outcomes of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Beijing Summit as an opportunity to carry forward the traditional friendship, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation and promote the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries, so as to better benefit the two peoples.- Third, there's a report on Wang Huning meeting a Vietnamese delegation led by Nguyen Xuan Thang, a member of the Politburo of the CPV Central Committee, president of the Ho Chi Minh National Academy of Politics and chairman of the Central Theoretical Council. Xinhua reports: Wang said that -China will work with Vietnam to follow through on the important consensus reached by the top leaders of the two parties, said Wang, also chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). The CPPCC National Committee is willing to maintain close communication and cooperation with the Vietnam Fatherland Front, Wang said. The CPV hopes to continuously learn from the CPC experience in national governance, strengthen the overall leadership of the party, and improve Vietnam's socialist development system, head of the delegation Nguyen Xuan Thang said.- Share Tracking People's Daily Fourth, there's a report on Han Zheng meeting with Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez.

Rodriguez said that Venezuela firmly adheres to the one-China principle, supports the series of major initiatives put forward by China and is willing to learn from China's successful experience in governance. Moreover, the country aims to strengthen bilateral cooperation and multilateral coordination, oppose unilateral illegal sanctions, and safeguard national security and development, as well as international fairness and justice.- Subscribe now Fifth, there's another commentary drawing from Xi's speech on BRI. It says: -In October 2023, President Xi Jinping announced eight action items at the Third BRI Forum, indicating that the joint construction of BRI has entered a new stage of high-quality development. This new stage of high-quality development is a new stage of three-dimensional connectivity across the Eurasian continent, led by the Green Silk Road, and empowered by the Digital Silk Road, marking a new starting point for China and all parties to make unremitting efforts to achieve modernization for countries worldwide, demonstrating the broad-minded approach of seeking progress for humanity, pursuing great harmony for the world, and showcasing the great power responsibility of having a global perspective and leading the era.- 202310，--，--。、、，，、、. General Secretary Xi Jinping profoundly elaborated on the overall requirements, guiding principles, practical paths, and key work for high-quality joint construction of BRI, providing important guidance and pointing out the direction for promoting high-quality development in the new stage. We must deeply recognise that seeking progress while maintaining stability is an important principle of our Party's governance. The more complex the international situation becomes, the more we must adhere to the work guideline of seeking progress while maintaining stability, steadily and cautiously advance project construction, and gradually expand new areas of cooperation. Adhering to consultation, joint construction, and shared benefits, openness, greenness, integrity, high standards, and benefiting people's livelihoods in a sustainable way; these are the guiding principles for the high-quality joint construction of BRI. We must actively advocate the concept of win-win cooperation and a correct view of righteousness and gain, uphold the essence of openness, the foundation of greenness, and the highlight of integrity, seek the points of intersection of interests and the greatest common divisor of cooperation, and continuously expand new spaces for win-win cooperation and development.- --、、、，--、。，。，，、，。、、，--。，、、，，. -The joint construction of BRI is a long-term, cross-border, and systemic global project; a century-long project. Looking toward the future, it is necessary to be guided by the eight action items for high-quality joint construction of BRI, take interconnectivity as the main line, combine high-quality development with high-level security, government guidance with market operations, scientific layout with dynamic optimisation, and quantitative growth with quality improvement coordinate the deepening of infrastructure ‘hard connectivity', the ‘soft connectivity' of rules and standards, and ‘heart connectivity' through people-to-people linkages across partner countries, coordinate the promotion of major landmark projects and ‘small but beautiful' livelihood projects, and coordinate the consolidation of cooperation in traditional fields and steady expansion of cooperation in emerging fields. Only then can we promote the joint construction of BRI to continuously advance along the direction of high-quality development.- --，、、、。，--，，、、、，--、----，--，，--. The final bit calls for mechanism or institutional construction. -At the symposium, General Secretary Xi Jinping made a systematic deployment for promoting high-quality joint construction of the BRI mechanism, clearly defining the major requirements for improving the ‘nine mechanisms'. All regions, departments, and units must raise their political standing, focus on implementation and execution, continuously strengthen strategic thinking, security awareness, systemic perspective, and international vision, put more effort into coordination and achieve results practically. It is necessary to focus on advancing systematization and institutionalization, continuously improve top-level design, formulate practical measures, deepen external cooperation, and promote the steady and long-term advancement of high-quality joint construction of BRI.- 、、。，--。，--，--。、，、、、，--，--。，，，，--。 Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, the full guideline on promoting the construction of new urban infrastructure and building resilient cities is published today. I am not detailing the entire document. Xinhua summarises it as follows: -By 2027, significant progress should have been made in the construction of new-type urban infrastructure, providing ever-increasing support for the development of resilient cities, while a number of experiences and practices that can be copied and expanded should have been established. By 2030, the construction of new-type urban infrastructure should have achieved remarkable results, to help push forward the building of a group of high-level resilient cities, improve urban safety and resilience, and ensure safer, more orderly, smarter and more efficient urban operations. To achieve these aims, major tasks must be fulfilled in 11 aspects, including implementing the building and upgrading of intelligent municipal infrastructure, promoting the coordinated development of smart city infrastructure and intelligent connected vehicles, and developing smart residential quarters, according to the guideline. In addition, there are other important tasks such as raising the intelligence level of housing and building management, carrying out digital home construction, improving city information modeling platforms, and maintaining cyber and data security.- Subscribe now Page 2: Just one report to note. It says that so far, 700 billion yuan of ultra-long-term special government bonds have been issued for the -two heavy- projects, i.e., projects related to major national strategies and those to build up security capacity in key areas. This allocation was done in three batches. Another 300 billion yuan has been allocated to increase support for the ‘two new' work, i.e., large-scale equipment renewal and consumer goods replacement. In all, 1 trillion yuan worth of bonds have been issued so far. ，--7000，3000--，，1. -The ‘two heavy' construction projects focus on supporting the development of railways, trunk highways, and airport construction along the Yangtze River, the construction of the new western land-sea corridor, high-standard farmland construction in the black soil region of Northeast China, the ‘Three-North' project, the public service system for the urbanization of agricultural migrant populations, and the upgrading of higher education quality, among other areas.- --、、，，，--，，.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had dismissed those rumours earlier. But then CMC member Admiral Miao Hua was officially removed, and that fuelled further speculation about Dong's fate. So this appearance is a statement of sorts. In the past few weeks, I have had a fair few people ask me what I made of the FT report on Dong and whether he was being probed. It is in such moments that China watchers must look to deeper truths, such as those in poetry. So here's the amateur poetic take that I offered for such questions: Kuch baaten hum hum tab jaan paate hai, jab hum unhe jaan paate hai; tab tak kuch afwah, kuch shikwah, aur kabhi umeed ke beech jeete hai hum Or the English version, which sounds less poetic to me at least: Some things we can only know, when we really know them; until then, we exist in a mist of rumours, grievances, and sometimes, hope. Anyway, back to the report. So Dong Jun met with the heads of delegations from various countries attending the Second Seminar on the Security Situation in the Gulf of Guinea in Shanghai on Thursday. He said that China is willing to work with the armed forces of regional countries to share the responsibility of maintaining security in the Gulf of Guinea. Xinhua reports: -Hosted by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy, the seminar brought together maritime armed force leaders and defense attachés from 18 nations, including Cameroon, the Republic of Congo, Gabon, Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria. During the meeting, Dong also called for efforts to promote systematic maritime cooperation, carry forward the traditional friendship with regional countries, and contribute to the building of an all-weather China-Africa community with a shared future for the new era.- Subscribe now Next, there's a report on Vice Premier He Lifeng meeting with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in Beijing.

China welcomes more foreign financial institutions and long-term capital, including BlackRock, to invest and do business in China, sharing China's development opportunities, the vice premier said. Fink said that BlackRock is optimistic about the prospects of the development of China's economy and financial market, and is willing to continue to deepen its engagement with the Chinese market and contribute to U.S.-China economic and trade cooperation.- Share Tracking People's Daily Third, there's a report on Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing. Xinhua reports: -Zhang emphasized that Iran holds significant regional and international influence and is a key comprehensive strategic partner for China. He highlighted the successful meeting between the presidents of both countries at the BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, in October, during which they provided top-level guidance for strengthening China-Iran relations. Zhang reiterated China's firm support for Iran in safeguarding its sovereignty, security, territorial integrity, and legitimate rights, expressing Beijing's readiness to implement the important consensus reached by the two leaders and to promote the stable and long-term growth of China-Iran relations. Pezeshkian, in turn, asked Zhang to convey his sincere regards to the Chinese president. He underscored Iran's strong commitment to developing its relations with China, highlighting the strategic importance of bilateral ties. Pezeshkian reaffirmed Iran's readiness to continue mutual support, deepen practical cooperation, and promote further growth in the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries. Also on Wednesday, Zhang held talks with Iran's First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref. The two officials engaged in in-depth discussions on implementing the China-Iran comprehensive cooperation plan.- Although it is not in the paper today, for folks tracking India-China relations, do note that ILD chief Liu Jianchao -met with a delegation of the Communist Party of India (CPI) cadres led by Rama Krushna Panda, a national secretariat member of the CPI, in Beijing on Thursday. Both sides agreed on the necessity of delivering on the latest important common understandings between the leaders of the two countries, of strengthening party-to-party exchanges and dialogues, of managing differences properly, and of promoting the improvement and development of China-India relations.- Subscribe now Page 5: Today's Xinhua article on the economy deals with the difficulties being encountered by enterprises.

It says: From a demand point of view, -some business leaders say that competition over ‘quantity' is becoming increasingly fierce, and every day when they open their eyes, they think about how to retain customers. Meanwhile, some companies report that the contest over ‘quality' is becoming more pronounced. With consumer demand growing increasingly diverse and personalized, if they cannot adapt to changes, they risk being replaced ‘at any moment'.- 、，。，--，。，--，、，，--. From the supply side perspective, the article claims: -In-depth analysis reveals that the various difficulties currently faced by enterprises are related to the broader economic development environment: Insufficient domestic effective demand. During the structural adjustment process, on the investment side, fixed asset investment growth has been below expectations; on the consumption side, the total retail sales of consumer goods are in a recovery phase. These factors all impact the sales of enterprise goods and services. Industrial upgrading continues to advance, and the squeeze from new and old momentum conversion is inevitable. On one hand, the development of emerging industries creates certain impacts and substitutions for traditional industries, with the market scale of some traditional industries shrinking; on the other hand, technological changes are accelerating, with time and opportunities waiting for no one. These factors place enterprises both in the midst of adjustment pains and compel them to race towards innovation. Global economic recovery is weak, global trade protectionism is intensifying, and uncertainty and instability are increasing. Some industries are experiencing cyclical fluctuations, and some enterprises have not yet adapted to changes in market and industrial development. These difficulties arise from both external pressures and internal challenges, involving environmental factors and enterprise-specific reasons. They are the result of multiple complex factors and are also the inevitable test that our country's economy must directly face while climbing over obstacles and moving towards high-quality development. ，，：。，，；，。。，。，，；，，、。，。、、。，。，，，，、. Subscribe now Do note that there is no comment or analysis about the Chinese government's policies and their impact on the economic environment. Anyway, the second section offers advice and a bit of a pep talk to enterprises. -The market is found, not waited for. When facing problems in the market, seek answers from the market. Recently, some changes are intriguing: The steel industry has been under short-term pressure, but by focusing on new ‘steel' demand through electric vehicles, high added-value product sales have been robust; the laptop market is approaching saturation, but market segments like gaming laptops and ultra-thin laptops targeting personalised needs have shown significant growth; large-scale performances have driven cultural tourism, with online e-commerce transactions in tourism, sightseeing, and entertainment services increasing by 15.3% year-on-year in the first three quarters...these emerging growth points in niche sectors are precisely the new business opportunities that enterprises have captured by recognizing change, responding to change, and seeking change. Exploring broader markets. In the first 10 months, China's private enterprises' exports increased by 9.3% year-on-year, new energy vehicle exports grew by 6.3%, and mechanical and electrical product exports increased by 8.5% ... behind these numbers are Chinese enterprises going out and battling waves in the international market. Competition is always intense, and difficulties will always exist. What determines an enterprise's development prospects is not the number of difficulties, but the perspective on difficulties, the methods of addressing difficulties, and the determination to resolve difficulties.- ，。，。，：，--，；，、；，15.3%……，、、，。。10，9.3%，6.3%，8.5%……，，。，。，，、、. The other piece of advice is to focus on innovation. Some useful data here is that -in the first three quarters, China's listed companies invested 1.10 trillion yuan in R&amp;D. The R&amp;D intensity of companies on the ChiNext Board, the STAR Market, and the Beijing Stock Exchange was 4.74%, 9.94%, and 4.73%, respectively, indicating strengthened innovation efforts. In the first three quarters, 6.191 million new private enterprises were established nationwide, with 40% of them belonging to the ‘four new' economy, signifying an expansion in business fields.- ，1.10。、、4.74%、9.94%、4.73%，。，619.1，--，. Share Tracking People's Daily The third and final section deals with the policy steps that have been taken to support enterprise. It says that steps have been taken to Effectively reduce the burden on enterprises: establish a coordination mechanism to support the financing of small and micro enterprises, promote the further reduction of the comprehensive financing costs of enterprises, maintain policies such as the tax deduction of R&amp;D expenses, and introduce a series of measures to effectively reduce the logistics costs of the whole society. Strictly regulate law enforcement supervision: improve the legal system and judicial mechanism for clearing enterprise account arrears, establish a cross-regional administrative law enforcement assistance system, improve a normalized mechanism for collecting problem clues, resolutely correct and seriously hold accountable behaviours of arbitrary fee collection, arbitrary fines, and arbitrary levies Precisely support enterprise development: multiple departments have established normalised communication mechanisms with enterprises, a new round of support policies for specialised, refined, and innovative enterprises has been launched, support has been provided to over 1,000 key Little Giant enterprises through central funds. ，，，，；，，，，、；，，，1000--. It also mentions policy support around the two heavy projects and two new work, the work related to the draft law on promoting the private economy, guidelines to support foreign trade and the building of a unified national market. The article adds: -At present, the effects of the policy changes are being released, and the trend of market recovery and stabilizing positive expectations is becoming more obvious. In the first three quarters, the main policies supporting scientific and technological innovation and manufacturing development in the current policies were tax reduction, fee reduction and tax rebate exceeding 2 trillion yuan. In October, nationwide enterprise sales revenue increased year-on-year, rising 1.3 percentage points month-on-month; the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 50.1%, returning to the expansion zone for the first time since May this year; the Non-Manufacturing Business Activity Index has remained stable around 50% for several consecutive months; and the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Index rose 0.3 points from September, the largest increase this year. Although current difficulties are still numerous, the confidence of economic entities is recovering, and more and more enterprises are moving forward more resolutely.- ，，、。，2。10，，1.3；PMI50.1%，5；50%；90.3，。，，. The piece ends by saying that the -Chinese economy is resilient, has great potential, and is full of vitality-. Its -long-term positive fundamentals will not change.- It also praises Chinese entrepreneurs as -courageous, visionary, brave in innovation, and exceling at taking action…- 、、、，. (My Note: It is noteworthy that the nationalism rhetoric seems to have taken a bit of a back seat when discussing economic issues. This article is an example of that. It argues that the current challenges are a product of several factors, including just something inherent to the stage of development that China is in. It does refer to the external environment as a factor but there's no nationalistic rabble-rousing. I also find it striking that patriotism is not one of the qualities that the authors mention when discussing entrepreneurs; a few years ago, patriotism was the rage.) Share Tracking People's Daily Page 15: There's an article by Bobby M. Tuazon, Director for Policy Studies of a Philippine think tank, Center for People Empowerment in Governance (CenPEG). He basically says that the Philippines government has adopted a -confrontational and reckless- approach with regard to China on the South China Sea issue. These actions -undermine ASEAN unity, damage its own reputation, and weaken its policy autonomy.- He writes- -The changes in the Philippine government's foreign policy are mainly reflected in three aspects. First, it has abandoned its earlier relatively pragmatic position, ignored China's concerns, and actively moved closer to the United States militarily, offering four more military bases to the United States in the northern Philippines near Taiwan and sensitive areas near the South China Sea. Although the Philippines claims this is -not targeting any third country,- it clearly aims to join the US' so-called ‘defense alliance', raising concerns among regional countries. Second, regardless of the content of the ‘Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea' such as -the directly concerned sovereign states shall resolve their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful means through friendly consultations and negotiations without resorting to force or the threat of force', it promoted its wrong stance on the South China Sea at the Shangri-La Dialogue and on other occasions, distorted and exaggerated the situation at sea, and held a series of military exercises with the United States and other extra-regional forces, posing challenges to regional peace and tranquility. Third, it has not fully adhered to or has even obscured the 2016 consensus reached between China and the Philippines.

Military adventurism is a dangerous attempt by the US to maintain its global hegemony. The Philippines, disregarding the common interests of regional countries, insisted on establishing a dangerous ‘alliance' with the US, which is more than 10,000 km away from its homeland. This violates the common desire of ASEAN countries to pursue regional peace, security and stability. The Philippine government has adopted military confrontation and adventurism, undermining its own reputation. The Philippines has ignored the historical facts that the Chinese people began to sail and engage in production activities in the South China Sea more than 2,000 years ago, and that China was the first to discover, name and develop and utilize the South China Sea islands and related waters. It has continued to escalate tensions and claim so-called ‘Chinese aggression', which has not only affected the peaceful dialogue between the Philippines and China, a major trading partner, but also impacted the credibility of the Philippine government. The Philippine government has adopted military confrontation and adventurism, undermining the Philippines' policy autonomy. The Philippines has provided support for the US geostrategy, helped the US military carry out so-called ‘freedom of navigation' operations in the South China Sea, opened additional military bases for the US, allowed the US military to deploy medium-range missiles in the Philippines, and blindly devoted itself to building the so-called ‘US-Japan-Philippines alliance', gradually exacerbating regional tensions and putting the Philippines at risk of becoming a US ‘tool of war'.- ，。。，1--，、。，。2000，、，--，，。，。，--，，，--，，--.

PD Commentary on BRI Warns of 'Empty Promises' & 'Unrealistic Expectations' - China-Japan Ties - He Lifeng Meets Goldman Sachs COO - Xinhua Series on ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, December 05, 2024. Page 1: There's another BRI-related commentary on the page today. It reiterates Xi's call to maintain -strategic determination- because -opportunities outweigh the challenges.- It says that Xi's speech provided -important ideological guidance and strategic leadership for overcoming various risks and challenges and promoting the steady and long-term development of the high-quality joint construction of BRI.- This bit below in the commentary is worth noting. -General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that ‘to promote the high-quality development of BRI, it is essential to appropriately address various risks and challenges and effectively mitigate the impacts of geopolitical conflicts.' At present, the world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation, marked by rising unilateralism and protectionism, frequent local conflicts and unrest, and increasing deficits in peace, development, security, and governance; uncertainty, instability, and unpredictability are on the rise. In this increasingly complex international environment, advancing the high-quality development of the BRI hinges on integrating high-quality development with high-level security. It is necessary to skillfully leverage advantages, avoid pitfalls, turn crises into opportunities, be proactive in analysis and forecasting, strengthen strategic, operational, and adaptive capacities, consolidate the basic foundation of cooperation, and expand new space for cooperation.- ，-‘'，，-。，，、，，、、、，、、。--，。、，，、、，、. -Correctly handling the relationship between enhancing the sense of gain of partner countries and adhering to what is beneficial to us is an inherent requirement for promoting the high-quality development of BRI, and it is also an important principle and direction that must be firmly grasped at all times. It is necessary to persist in doing our best and acting within our capabilities, find the points of cooperation and the intersection of interests, coordinate the construction of major landmark projects and ‘small but beautiful' livelihood projects — helping to jointly build national economic and social development of partner countries and improving people's livelihood—and continuously enhance the sense of participation, gain, and happiness of the people of partner countries. It is necessary to persist in what is beneficial to us, mutual benefit and win-win, do what should be done and not doing what should not be done, do not issue any ‘dishonoured/phony checks/empty promises' () and do not raise appetites/don't create unrealistic expectations (), balance the political, strategic, overall, long-term, and economic accounts, and effectively safeguard China's strategic interests.- ，--，。、，、，--，，、、。、，，--、，、、、、，. -As BRI continues to be further promoted, there is an increase in China's overseas assets. How to better safeguard the security of China's overseas interests is a major issue facing the country. The Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee made arrangements around improving the foreign-related national security mechanism, and proposed a series of reform measures such as ‘establishing and improving the coordination mechanism for peripheral security work', ‘strengthening the system and mechanism for early warning, prevention and control, and protection of overseas interests and investment risks, and deepening international law enforcement cooperation in the field of security'. It is necessary to establish a bottom-line thinking, enhance risk awareness, speed up the improvement of various mechanisms and plans, and carry out risk investigation, monitoring, assessment, and early warning on a regular basis in order to effectively safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens and legal persons overseas and ensure the security of China's overseas interests.- --，。，。《》，---、、，-。、，，、、、，、，。 Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the page is a Zhong Yin commentary, which focuses on the publication of the new reader on Xi Jinping Thought on Culture. It talks about how Xi's thought on this has outlined a -new cultural mission in the new era-. It says that: -Deeply rooted in excellent Chinese traditional culture, drawing on and absorbing all excellent achievements of human civilization, Chinese-style modernization represents the development direction of human civilization's progress, presents a new landscape different from Western modernization models, and creates a new form of human civilization.- ，，，，. It adds that the new reader -systematically expounds the core essence, spiritual substance, rich connotations, and practical requirements of Xi Jinping Thought on Culture, comprehensively reflecting the original contributions of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era in the cultural field, and provides an important study guide for us to deeply study and comprehend Xi Jinping Thought on Culture, feel the modern power of Chinese civilization, and consolidate the cultural foundation for national construction and national rejuvenation.- 《》，、、、，，，，、. The commentary is then divided into three parts, each making a specific point. The first of these stresses the importance of the -continuous and unceasing flow of Chinese civilization- which has remained -unbroken- for -thousands of years- and repeatedly encountered challenges yet enduring without decline-, thereby forging a -miracle of human civilization-. 。，，? So what accounts for this? The piece says: -The shared belief that ‘civilization cannot be interrupted' and the cultural consciousness of passing the torch are precisely the important codes for Chinese civilization's continuation to this day. The modern power of Chinese civilization is manifested in the unprecedented strengthening of our confidence, forged into the spiritual temperament and cultural character of the entire nation, firmly grasping the fate of the country's development and progress in our own hands.- --、，。，，，. The second point is that -reform and innovation and keeping pace with the times are the eternal spiritual temperament of Chinese civilization.- 、. It adds: -The modern strength of Chinese civilization is manifested in our innovative power continuously condensing, exploring and innovating in frontier practices and unknown domains, continuously expanding new paths to realize modernization.- ，，、，. The third point is the experience of inclusiveness and tolerance. -Chinese civilization is a civilization that originated on the land of China, and it is also a civilization that has been formed through continuous exchanges and mutual learning with other civilizations. In the new era, China is embracing the world with a more open attitude and contributing to the world with more dynamic civilizational achievements.- ，。、. In this context, the piece mentions BRI, GCI, GDI and GSI along with the proposal of building a community with a shared future for mankind. Finally, there's a report on Zhao Leji meeting Hun Sen. Xinhua reports Zhao said that -China stands ready to work with Cambodia to firmly support each other, deepen practical cooperation and expand people-to-people exchanges in accordance with the important consensus reached by the top leaders of the two parties. The NPC of China is willing to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with Cambodia's Senate and National Assembly to contribute to the building of the China-Cambodia community with a shared future, Zhao added.- Subscribe now Page 2: A few reports to note. First, Wang Yi addressed (English report) the 20th Beijing-Tokyo Forum via video conference. He said that -not long ago, President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba met for the first time during the APEC meeting. The two sides agreed to work together to comprehensively promote the strategic and mutually beneficial relationship between China and Japan in accordance with the principles and directions established in the four political documents between China and Japan, and to build a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship that meets the requirements of the new era. Both sides should be guided by the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, adhere to the original aspirations of relations, follow the right path, seek common ground, and coordinate actions, all with the aim of promoting stable, lasting bilateral relations. He then made four points. First, Wang said that the two sides should understand the correct positioning of bilateral relations. China has always regarded Japan as an important cooperation partner, and hopes that Japan can view China's development objectively and rationally. He also hoped that Japan will work with China to follow the correct positioning of the comprehensive advancement of the strategic, mutually beneficial relations between China and Japan, and implement the important consensus that the two countries should be cooperative partners and should not pose a threat to each other. Second, the two sides should maintain the political foundations of bilateral relations. The four political documents between China and Japan have laid the political and legal foundations for bilateral relations, and they should not be blurred, retrogressed or undermined. Third, China and Japan need to promote an open strategy of mutual benefits. Both sides should cherish their cooperation space and common interests that have already been established, and work together to maintain the stability and smooth operations of the global free trade system and industrial and supply chains. Fourth, Wang called on the two countries to uphold regional and international peace and stability. In the face of rising unilateralism and protectionism, China and Japan need to work in tandem to safeguard Asian unity and cooperation to prevent external forces from fomenting confrontation. Share Tracking People's Daily Second, there's a report on Wang's meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister of Chile Alberto van Klaveren Stork. Xinhua says: Wang said that -although China and Chile were separated by the long geographical distance, the people of the two countries have shared amity and friendship, and bilateral relations have developed steadily. Hailing the exemplary role Chile has played in developing ties with China, Wang said the meetings between the two countries' leaders over the past years have guided bilateral cooperation to achieve gratifying results. ‘China-Chile relations have entered the best period', said Wang. Noting that next year will mark the 55th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations and the 20th anniversary of the free trade agreement signed by the two sides, Wang said China is ready to work with Chile to act on the consensus reached by the two countries' heads of state, and advance the comprehensive strategic partnership by promoting high-level political mutual trust, pragmatic cooperation and connectivity. He said China is willing to maintain high-level exchanges with Chile and close communication at all levels, constantly improve economic and trade cooperation, expand cooperation in emerging fields such as information and clean energy, and strengthen the synergy of development strategies. Wang said China and Chile, both as important Asia-Pacific countries, should strengthen international coordination and jointly uphold multilateralism and free trade.- Subscribe now Third, there's a report on the comments from people attending the Understanding China conference in Guangzhou. Some of the key foreign commentators are: Yves Camille Désiré Leterme, former Prime Minister of Belgium: Wolfgang Schüssel, former Chancellor of Austria: Hassan Diab, former Prime Minister of Lebanon: Mulatu Teshome Wirtu, former President of Ethiopia: Former Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi: Andrey Bystritskiy, Chairman of the Board of the Foundation for Development and Support of the Valdai Discussion Club Joseph Stiglitz Fourth, there's a report on the Foreign Ministry hosting a promotional event to present the Hainan Free Trade Port to the world. Wang Yi said that -China is committed to development through high-level opening up and will continue to foster a business environment that is market-oriented, law-based and internationalized, promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and implement the Global Development Initiative.- Xinhua explains: -Major officials of the island province of Hainan were invited to make presentations to more than 500 attendees, including diplomats and officials from over 160 countries, representatives from international organizations, central and local government officials, and representatives from enterprises, international trade associations, and domestic and foreign media.- -Wang said that the construction of the Hainan free trade port has gained momentum and the region has attracted an increasing number of regional and global enterprises to invest and operate business, presenting a new and dynamic environment of openness and progress. The Hainan Free Trade Port has become a new frontier of China's institutional opening up, a new hot spot for regional mutually beneficial cooperation, and a new engine driving economic globalization, Wang said. ‘Seeing is believing, and everyone is welcome to visit Hainan and gain firsthand experience,' he added. Wang said China will adhere to open, innovative, green, inclusive, and peaceful development. ‘Choosing China means choosing opportunities, and embracing China means embracing the future,' he said.- Fifth, there's a report on He Lifeng's meeting with John Waldron, president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs Group, in Beijing. Xinhua says: He told Waldron that -China welcomes more U.S. financial institutions and long-term capital to continue deepening mutually beneficial cooperation with China…China is fully implementing the guiding principles of the 20th CPC Central Committee's third plenary session, steadily advancing major measures to deepen comprehensive reform, and continuously expanding opening-up at a high level, He noted. ‘We welcome more U.S. financial institutions and long-term capital, including Goldman Sachs Group, to continue deepening mutually beneficial cooperation with China, and to play a greater role in promoting the healthy development of China-U.S. relations,' He said. The Goldman Sachs Group is full of confidence in China's economy and future development, and is willing to continue expanding cooperation with China and making contributions to promoting U.S.-China economic and trade cooperation, Waldron said.- Share Tracking People's Daily Sixth, there's a brief report on Zhang Qingwei, Vice Chairman of the NPCSC, leading a delegation to Djibouti. Zhang met with President Ismail Omar Guelleh. Two other reports also inform of Party delegations visiting Malawi and Austria. Page 3: There's a report informing that in the first three quarters of the year, the scale of agricultural insurance premiums reached 137.1 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 6.2%, providing risk protection of 4.3 trillion yuan for 136 million insured farmers. Another report informs that in the first 10 months, the added value of China's machinery industry increased by 5.5% year-on-year, production and sales were generally stable, foreign trade saw accelerated development, and the overall operating situation was stable and improving. Page 5: Yesterday, there was a Xinhua article in the paper discussing the economy. This is a series that is likely to continue. All this leads to the CEWC meeting in the days ahead. The article yesterday did lead to some media kerfuffle, owing to this bit below. I did not find it particularly remarkable, perhaps because I didn't see the novelty in it. To me, this has been the leadership's consensus on the direction of economic development for some time. But it is useful to note it as a signal before the CEWC. -When looking at economic growth rate, we must not only look at the present or the immediate moment, but more importantly look dialectically and long-term. Valuing speed but not being solely focused on speed is the dialectical approach currently followed by China's economic development. GDP and its growth rate are typically used to measure a comprehensive economic strength and level of an economic entity. However, as a quantitative indicator, GDP emphasizes the concept of quantity and cannot comprehensively reflect the quality and efficiency of economic activities. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: Understanding economic development as simply an increase or decrease in quantity and simple repetition is a metaphysical view of development. Since the 1960s, among more than 100 middle-income economies globally, only a dozen have successfully become high-income economies. The ones who were successful have achieved a shift in economic development from quantitative expansion to qualitative improvement after experiencing a period of high-speed growth. Those countries that have stagnated or even regressed have not achieved this fundamental transformation. The extensive economic development model once played a significant role in our country, but also made us pay enormous resource and environmental costs, concealing some contradictions and risks. If we do not break the ‘speed worship', and continue to lay out projects and launch initiatives, even if we temporarily increase the speed, we will be overdrawing future growth. ‘No matter how fast the speed, it is not that we cannot, but that we choose not to.' Entering the new era, General Secretary Xi Jinping has distinctly proposed that our economic development has entered a new normal of speed changes, structural optimization, and motivation transformation, making the important assertion that our economy has shifted from high-speed growth to high-quality development stage. Development is a hard truth, and high-quality development is the hard truth of the new era. From comprehensively implementing the new development concept, to accelerating the construction of a new development pattern, to developing new quality productivity according to local conditions, the Chinese economy continues to be injected with new connotations of high-quality development. The current Chinese economy pays more attention to achieving effective qualitative improvement and reasonable quantitative growth, rather than simply hero-worshipping GDP. This year's annual economic growth target is around 5%, and we have been striving towards this goal. Through effort, whether it's slightly left or right of 5%, is acceptable. Compared to speed, to assess whether the economy is good, we must more importantly see whether the development momentum is strong, whether the economic structure is reasonable, whether the innovation drive is stronger, whether development is more coordinated, whether the green foundation is thicker, whether the opening-up level is higher, and whether the people are happier and more secure. ，、，、。、，。GDP，。，GDP，。：-、，。-60，100。，。，。，，。--，、，，。-，，。-，、、，。，。，，，。，，GDP。5%，。，5%，。，，、，、、、、. Share Tracking People's Daily Today's article deals with boosting domestic demand. Perhaps, the most significant bit to note is that while demand is being seen as a challenge, there are no new ideas being discussed. The article is a re-affirmation of the current policy path. It says: -At present, my country faces a complex and severe international environment, and the challenge of insufficient domestic demand is still significant. Striving to expand domestic demand is an important task of economic work at present and in the future.- ，，.，. The first part of the article talks about improving numbers, such as retail sales, fixed assets investments, and many others. The second part of the article says this: -For a period of time, our economic operation has faced challenges including insufficient domestic effective demand. In the first three quarters, the contribution rate of final consumption expenditure to economic growth was at its lowest level in recent years. Challenges and opportunities coexist. How to respond to challenges and seize opportunities? ... ‘Is Chinese consumption facing a crisis?' Recently, consulting firm McKinsey released a report titled ‘2024 Chinese Consumer Market Truth', responding to misreadings about Chinese consumption. ‘Although the growth rate of domestic consumption has declined, it is still growing, especially in some industries such as the service industry and tourism industry.' From the perspective of investment, the growth rate of private investment in the first 10 months fell by 0.3% year-on-year, the lowest growth rate since the beginning of this year. However, excluding real estate development investment, private investment increased by 6.3% year-on-year, nearly 3 percentage points higher than the overall investment growth rate. Private investment in manufacturing, general equipment manufacturing, transportation equipment manufacturing and other fields maintained double-digit growth. Understanding the Chinese economy requires not just looking at current data fluctuations, but seeing how challenges are addressed, how obstacles are overcome, continuously striving towards established goals, and solidly taking each step.- -In November, the General Office of the State Council issued the ‘Guidelines on Stimulating the Vitality of the Ice and Snow Economy through the High-quality Development of Ice and Snow Sports'. According to the document, by 2030, the total scale of the ice and snow economy will reach 1.5 trillion yuan. This will be an increase of nearly 70% over 2023. Entering the new era, the primary social contradictions in our country have undergone historic changes. By focusing on meeting people's needs for ‘good or not'/quality, the potential and opportunities of the domestic market are limitless. Cultivate new engines. Since the beginning of this year, from developing the silver economy to stimulating the vitality of the ice and snow economy, from the ‘take-off' of the low-altitude economy to the ‘ignition' of the pioneering economy, efforts on both supply and demand sides are leveraging investment and consumption, continuously upgrading and expanding the ultra-large-scale market. Expanding new spaces.

Facing new situations and problems in economic operation, the Party Central Committee made decisive decisions, with a coordinated package of policies working in the same direction, with a very clear orientation of expanding domestic demand. The 1 trillion yuan of ultra-long-term special treasury bonds for the ‘two heavy' construction and ‘two new' work have already been all issued. The 100 billion yuan central budget investment plan for next year and the 100 billion yuan list of -two-heavy- construction projects were issued ahead of schedule this year. Research and proposals have been made to further strengthen support for the ‘two new', expand the scope of support policies, and intensify efforts to boost investment and promote consumption. The reserve requirement ratio and policy interest rates were reduced, structural monetary policy tools to support the stable development of the stock market have been put in place, and greater support has been provided for the financing and investment activities of business entities. The most significant debt optimization measures in recent years to enhance local governments' spending capacity have been introduced, directing more resources toward expanding investment, promoting consumption, and safeguarding livelihoods. A ‘combination punch' to reduce home purchase costs, stimulate housing demand, and increase support for specific groups has been implemented. Going forward, we must strive at the key points of the national economy and people's livelihood, continue to stimulate potential consumption, and expand effective and profitable investment. International organizations have assessed that the package of policies aims to improve social welfare, ensure the healthy operation of local governments, and bring price and asset price expectations into a positive cycle.

Takeaways from Indian FM's Statement on Ties with China - Nepal's Oli Meets Xi - New Book on Xi's Thought on Culture - Panchen Lama's Tibet Visit - Wa...	Hi folks, I am beginning today's edition with a look at India-China relations. Yesterday Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar delivered a statement in Parliament on -recent developments in the India China border areas and their implications for our overall bilateral relations-. Before I detail the text, let me offer a few takeaways: First, it is really good to finally have such a statement from the government in Parliament. This is really important for informed discussion and debate within India about the nature of the situation along the border with China and the broader outlook from New Delhi's perspective. It is also important to build political consensus across party lines on China policy. Second, on disengagement from friction points, Jaishankar was clear that this was India's -immediate priority- and that it has been -achieved in full-. However, it is important to note that he does not say that this implies a return to normalcy in ties. In fact, Jaishankar reiterated that -we are clear that the maintenance of peace and tranquility in border areas is a pre-requisite for the development of our ties. In the coming days, we will be discussing both de-escalation as well as effective management of our activities in the border areas.- Third, in describing what disengagement entails, Jaishankar addressed the issue of the creation of buffer zones at several friction points. To me, his comments in this regard essentially seemed to suggest their acceptance by New Delhi. In that sense, the status quo has changed and is accepted as a new status quo. For instance, he said that -steps of a temporary and limited nature- that have been worked out in other places -can be revisited as the situation demands.- This seems to imply that the current situation does not demand this effort. Jaishankar seemed to justify this position by arguing that -in the past, earlier Governments have agreed to a range of steps to defuse situations that have arisen at different times, including offers on our side to create de-militarized zones, limited non-patrolling zones, relocation or withdrawal of posts, disengagement of troops and dismantlement of structures.- Fourth, towards the end, the EAM discussed India's border infrastructure building effort. To me, this was an important point being made, and I hope it is signalling that the agreement with Beijing in Ladakh does not entail any commitment from the Indian side to curtail or scale down border infrastructure development. Fifth, he ended with this bit: -The conclusion of the disengagement phase now allows us to consider other aspects of our bilateral engagement in a calibrated manner, keeping our national security interests first and foremost.- This is extremely important from my perspective, since it is indicative of the significance of security considerations in different dimensions of ties with China going forward, particularly when it comes to economic ties. Share Tracking People's Daily Leave a comment Anyway, below are key excerpts from the speech, and the full video if you would like to watch. -The House is cognizant of the fact that China is in illegal occupation of 38,000 Sq. kms. of Indian territory in Aksai Chin as a result of the 1962 conflict and the events that preceded it. Furthermore, Pakistan illegally ceded 5180 Sq. kms. of Indian territory to China in 1963, which had been under its occupation since 1948. India and China have held talks for multiple decades to resolve the boundary issue. While there is a Line of Actual Control (LAC), it does not have a common understanding in some areas. We remain committed to engaging with China through bilateral discussions to arrive at a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable framework for a boundary settlement. Hon'ble Members would recall that the amassing of a large number of troops by China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh in April/May 2020 resulted in face offs with our forces at a number of points. The situation also led to disruption of patrolling activities. It is to the credit of our armed forces that despite logistical challenges and the then-prevailing Covid situation, they were able to counter-deploy rapidly and effectively.- He termed China's actions in 2020 as an -unprecedented disruption- to a process of building ties which began in 1988. He added: -The situation arising after our counter-deployment in 2020 called for multiple set of responses. The immediate priority was to ensure disengagement from friction points so that there would be no further untoward incidents or clashes. This Sir, has been fully achieved as I will explain. The next priority will be to consider de-escalation, that would address the massing of troops along the LAC with associated accompaniments. It is also evident that the management of the border areas will require further attention in the light of our recent experiences. In all of this, we were and we remain very clear that the three key principles must be observed in all circumstances: (i) both sides should strictly respect and observe the LAC, (ii) neither side should attempt to unilaterally alter the status quo, and (iii) agreements and understandings reached in the past must be fully abided by in their entirety.- Jaishankar then highlighted the diplomatic effort in negotiating with China since the standoff of 2020. -Throughout this period, Hon'ble Members would also be aware that Government has maintained that India-China relations cannot be normal in the absence of peace and tranquility in the border areas. The combination of a firm and principled stance on the situation in the border areas as well as our clearly articulated approach to the totality of our ties have been the foundation of our engagement with China for the last four years. We have been very clear that the restoration of peace and tranquility would be the basis for the rest of the relationship to move forward. Since 2020, our engagement was therefore focused on that objective. This took place at various levels, involving different arms of the government. I myself have had meetings with my Chinese counterpart, as indeed has my senior colleague, Raksha Mantri ji. Our NSA has also engaged his Chinese counterpart, both being the Special Representatives on the boundary question. More detailed discussions were conducted by the Working Mechanism for Cooperation and Coordination (WMCC) at the diplomatic level. Its military counterpart was the Senior Highest Military Commanders meeting (SHMC) mechanism. The interactions were naturally very tightly coordinated with the combined presence in the negotiations of both diplomatic and military officials. Since June 2020, 17 meetings of the WMCC and 21 rounds of SHMC have taken place.- -In this background, I would like to inform the House today about the agreement reached on 21 October, 2024 regarding Depsang and Demchok. The twin considerations of an unstable local situation and an impacted bilateral relationship were clearly the drivers for these recent endeavors. These two areas have been the focus of our discussions in both WMCC and SHMC with the Chinese side since September 2022, when the last disengagement agreement was concluded at Hot Springs area. In the lead up to the October 21 agreement, I had discussed both the specific disengagement issue as well as the larger relationship with my Chinese counterpart in Astana on 4 July and Vientiane on 25 July. Our National Security Advisor and his Chinese counterpart also met in St. Petersburg on 12 September. The problem in these two areas pertained primarily to obstructions of our long-standing patrolling activity. In Demchok, there was also the question of access by our nomadic population to traditional grazing grounds, as well as to sites of significance to the local people. As a result of this recent understanding arrived at after intensive negotiations, resumption of patrolling to the traditional areas is underway. It was initially tested by sending out patrols for verification of disengagement on the ground and is being followed up by regular activities as per the agreed understanding. Following the October 21 understanding, Prime Minister and President Xi Jinping had a meeting on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit in Kazan on October 23. They welcomed the understanding and directed the Foreign Ministers to meet and stabilize and rebuild the relationship. The Special Representatives are also to oversee the management of peace and tranquility besides exploring a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution to the boundary question.- This is how he explained the completion of disengagement. -Through you I would like to inform the House, that disengagement has now been achieved in full in Eastern Ladakh through a step by step process, culminating in Depsang and Demchok. With the task of disengagement completed, it is now our expectation that discussions would commence in regard to the remaining issues that we had placed on the agenda. For the benefit of Hon'ble Members, I would also flag for your attention the previous positions articulated by the Government in Parliament previously on this issue. On 15 September, 2020, Raksha Mantri ji had made a detailed statement on Chinese attempts to transgress the LAC and the appropriate response given by our armed forces. On 11 February, 2021, Raksha Mantri ji again briefed the House about our disengagement agreement in the North and South banks of the Pangong Lake. Thereafter, in August 2021, a third phase of disengagement took place in the area of Gogra, whereby troops would henceforth be in their respective bases. The next step took place in September 2022, pertaining to the Hot Springs area. Again, forward deployments ceased in a phased, coordinated and verified manner, resulting in the return of troops to their respective areas. The most recent October 21, 2024 agreement comes in the wake of the earlier ones. It completes the first phase of what we had agreed to in Moscow in September 2020.- -As Members are aware, there is a long history of frictions, transgressions and face offs in several sectors of the India-China border. This goes back to Barahoti from 1954, to Longju in 1959, to Sumdorong Chu from 1986-1995 and Depsang in 2013, amongst others. In the past, earlier Governments have agreed to a range of steps to defuse situations that have arisen at different times, including offers on our side to create de-militarized zones, limited non-patrolling zones, relocation or withdrawal of posts, disengagement of troops and dismantlement of structures. Different locations have seen different solutions being examined. Where the October 21 understanding is concerned, our objective has been to ensure patrolling as in the past to the relevant patrolling points, as well as resumption of grazing by our civilians as per longstanding practice. This is indeed what we have agreed upon in regard to Depsang and Demchok. In a few other places where friction occurred in 2020, steps of a temporary and limited nature were worked out, based on local conditions, to obviate the possibility of further friction. This, I must stress, applies to both sides and can be revisited as the situation demands. In that sense, our stance has been resolute and firm and serves our national interest fully.- -In that context, the House would also recognize that there has been a significant improvement in the border infrastructure which has made such effective counter-deployment possible. This is reflected, amongst others, in the increase of border infrastructure allocations in the last decade. The Border Roads Organization (BRO) alone has incurred three times the expenditure level of what it was a decade ago. Whether it is the length of the road networks, of bridges or of the number of tunnels, there has been a substantial increase over the earlier period. Notable milestones in recent years include the Atal Tunnel to Lahul Spiti, the Sela and Nechiphu Tunnels to Tawang, the Umlingla Pass road in Southern Ladakh and the extended opening of the Zojila Axis. Work is progressing on some strategically important roads and air fields in Ladakh. The adoption of new technologies in high altitude, remote, inaccessible and permafrost areas has also been significant. All of this reflects the Government's firm commitment to protecting our borders and ensuring that our armed forces get the facilities and the logistical support that they deserve.- He ended with this: -We are clear that the maintenance of peace and tranquility in border areas is a pre-requisite for the development of our ties. In the coming days, we will be discussing both de-escalation as well as effective management of our activities in the border areas. The conclusion of the disengagement phase now allows us to consider other aspects of our bilateral engagement in a calibrated manner, keeping our national security interests first and foremost. In my recent meeting with FM Wang Yi, we reached an understanding that the Special Representatives and the Foreign Secretary level mechanisms will be convening soon.- Share Tracking People's Daily Subscribe now Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, December 04, 2024.

Xinhua says in 68,000 Chinese characters over 14 chapters, the outline systematically expounds on the essence, connotation and requirements of Xi Jinping Thought on Culture, fully reflecting the original contribution of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era in the realm of culture.- The PD report informs that: Xi Jinping Thought on Culture systematically -addresses the major questions of what kind of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics to uphold and develop in the new era, and how to uphold and develop it. It deeply elaborates on the status and role, objectives and tasks, principles and guidelines, strategic paths, and practical requirements of cultural development in the new era. It serves as a theoretical summary of the Party's practical experience in leading cultural development in the new era, represents a significant achievement in adhering to the ‘two integrations' and advancing innovation in Marxist cultural theory, and constitutes a scientific system that unifies essence and application. It constitutes the cultural chapter of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and provides a powerful ideological weapon and scientific action guide for doing well in propaganda, ideological, and cultural work in the new era and new journey, and for promoting cultural prosperity and building a culturally strong country.- 、，、、、、，，--、，、，，、、.

But I thought this was useful in terms of how the commentary department summarises the achievements of BRI. -We have used the joint construction of BRI as a practical platform to promote the building of a community with a shared future for humanity, establishing bilateral and regional communities of shared future with multiple countries and regions, and making the concept of building a community with a shared future for humanity deeply ingrained in people's hearts. We have signed BRI cooperation documents with over 150 countries and more than 30 international organizations, continuously expanding our network of cooperative partnerships. We have advanced regional openness, focusing on optimizing the regional opening-up layout, achieving mutual promotion and co-development between coastal opening and inland border opening, forming a comprehensive opening-up pattern of interconnected inland and maritime, east-west mutual assistance. From signing 23 free trade agreements with 30 countries and regions, to steadily expanding a high-standard global free trade zone network, from continuously reducing the negative list for foreign investment access to granting zero-tariff treatment for 100% of product categories from the least developed countries that have established diplomatic relations with China…through the joint construction of BRI, China's doors to the outside world are opening wider, and new horizons for open development are constantly being explored.- --，，。150、30--，。，，、，、。3023，，，100%……--，，.

Wang called for continued dialogue, saying that dialogue may not solve all the problems, but will help promote mutual understanding, avoid miscalculations and advance cooperation. The United States must not cross the bottom lines and red lines in bilateral relations, Wang said. He pointed out that the Taiwan question falls under China's internal affairs, and the United States should honor its commitment to the one-China principle and respect the development path chosen by the Chinese people, as well as their legitimate right to development.

Stephen said Nauru firmly adheres to the one-China principle, and thanks China for its assistance.- Zhao reportedly said that: -China will work with Nauru to deliver on the important common understandings between the two heads of state, and create a bright future for bilateral relations based on equality, mutual respect, win-win cooperation, openness, and inclusiveness…He said that the one-China principle is a universally recognized basic norm in international relations, and also the political foundation and prerequisite for China to develop its relations with other countries. It is hoped and believed that Nauru will continue to abide by the one-China principle, firmly support China in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and oppose ‘Taiwan independence' separatist activities, Zhao said, China will firmly support Nauru in safeguarding its national sovereignty, security and development interests, and in exploring a development path in line with its own national conditions, he said. He said that China's NPC is willing to expand multi-level exchanges in various fields with Nauru's parliament, and welcomes parliamentarians of Nauru to participate in seminars hosted by the NPC for representatives from Pacific island countries, Zhao added.- Page 5: There's a report on Panchen Gyaincain Norbu concluding 5 months of study, research, and religious activities in Tibet.

We must firmly maintain strategic confidence and strategic determination, take bold responsibility, and work to create an even brighter future for the joint construction of the Belt and Road.- 、、2--，，--，。，，，--. Cai Qi and Ding Xuexiang were in attendance. Ding presided over the symposium. Also in attendance were Wang Yi, He Lifeng and Wu Zhenglong. Among the officials who spoke were: Zheng Shanjie, Director of the National Development and Reform Commission Ma Zhaoxu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Yin Li, Beijing Party Secretary Wang Menghui, Hubei Party Secretary Hu Wangming, Chairman of China Baowu Steel Group Co., Ltd. Feng Xubin, Chairman of YXE Trade Service Group Co., Ltd. Xing Guangcheng, CASS Member, director of the Institute of Chinese Borderland Studies Xi then spoke. He said that since BRI was announced in 2013, it has -adhered to the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits; the areas of cooperation have continuously expanded, the scope of cooperation has steadily broadened, and the levels of cooperation have consistently deepened; its international appeal, influence, and cohesion have been increasingly enhanced, achieving significant accomplishments and making China's contribution to strengthening friendships with participating countries and promoting their economic and social development.- ，。，2013--，，，--、、、，，、、，、、，，、. -Xi Jinping emphasized that in recent years, the world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation, with unilateralism and protectionism increasing significantly, and local conflicts and unrest occurring frequently. In this context, in promoting the high-quality joint construction of BRI, we must properly respond to various risks and challenges, effectively overcome the impact of geopolitical conflicts, correctly handle enhancing the sense of gain for partner countries while maintaining relations beneficial to ourselves, and effectively safeguard China's overseas interests and security.- ，，，、，。，--，，，，. -Xi Jinping pointed out that the joint construction of BRI has entered a new stage of high-quality development.

Guided by the eight actions for high-quality BRI construction, with connectivity as the main line, we must combine high-quality development with high-level security, government guidance with market operations, scientific planning with dynamic optimization, and quantitative growth with qualitative improvement. Efforts should be coordinated to deepen ‘hard connectivity' in infrastructure, ‘soft connectivity' in rules and standards, and ‘people-to-people connectivity' with the populations of participating countries. There should be a balanced advancement of major landmark projects and ‘small but beautiful' livelihood projects, consolidation of cooperation in traditional fields, and steady expansion into emerging areas. Mechanisms for promoting high-quality BRI construction should be improved, continuously expanding a new space for higher-level, more resilient, and more sustainable win-win development.- ，--。，，，，、、，--，，、、、，--、----，--，，--，、、。 -Xi Jinping stressed that we should focus on advancing the construction of high-quality BRI mechanism, improve the overall management mechanism of cooperation planning for BRI, improve the coordination and promotion mechanism for ‘hard connectivity', ‘soft connectivity', and ‘people-to-people connectivity', improve the practical cooperation mechanisms for industrial and supply chains, improve the mechanisms for international exchanges and cooperation in emerging fields, improve the diversified investment and financing guarantee mechanisms, improve the internal and external coordination mechanisms for risk prevention and control, improve the mechanisms for safeguarding overseas interests, improve the high-level international communication mechanisms, and improve the clean Silk Road cooperation mechanisms, to ensure the stable and long-term development of high-quality joint construction of BRI.- ，--，--，--、--、--，，，，，，，，--. -Xi Jinping pointed out that we must persist with the blueprint to the end, continuing work from one phase to the next, bravely overcoming various risks and challenges, resolutely advancing the high-quality joint construction of BRI, and making greater contributions to promoting the construction of a community with a shared future for humanity.- ，，，，--，. Ding Xuexiang then said that Xi's speech had -made comprehensive arrangements for promoting the high-quality development of the joint construction of BRI in the current and future period.- He praised the speech for its -lofty intentions, profound thinking, refined arguments, and rich connotations- adding that -it provides important guidance and points out the direction forward for promoting high-quality joint construction of BRI in the next golden decade. We must study and understand it carefully and resolutely implement it. All regions, departments, and units must continuously strengthen strategic thinking, security awareness, systemic perspective, and international vision. They should focus on advancing systematization and institutional/mechanism-based approaches, continuously improve top-level design, formulate practical measures, deepen external cooperation, strive to cultivate a batch of well-known and substantial cooperation brands, form more exemplary and leading major achievements, and jointly create new spaces for win-win development of the Belt and Road Initiative that are at a higher level, more resilient, and more sustainable.- ，--，--。、、、，--、，，。、、、，，，，，、，、，、、--.

The report says: Ding Xuexiang said that China is comprehensively promoting the construction of a strong country and the great cause of national rejuvenation through Chinese-style modernization. We will carry out reforms to provide a strong impetus for Chinese-style modernization; unswervingly expand high-level opening up to the outside world and share development opportunities with countries around the world; closely focus on the primary task of high-quality development to promote the effective improvement of economic quality and reasonable growth in quantity; adhere to the path of peaceful development and provide more stability and certainty for the world. A China that comprehensively deepens reform, continuously expands openness, pursues high-quality development, and seeks world peace is bound to be a China with a bright future. ，、。，；，；，；，。、、、，. Subscribe now Third, there's a report on Wang Huning meeting with Cambodian People's Party (CPP) President Samdech Techo Hun Sen. Xinhua says: Wang said that -China is willing to work with Cambodia to implement the important consensus reached by the top leaders of the two parties and promote the continuous development of China-Cambodia relations. The CPPCC is willing to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with Cambodia to promote greater achievements in the building of a China-Cambodia community with a shared future in the new era, Wang said.- Also on the page is a feature article marking the 25th anniversary of Macao's return to China. I am not detailing this. Page 2: There's a report informing that as per the China National Intellectual Property Administration, as of the end of October 2024, the number of valid invention patents owned in China reached 4.66 million, of which 3.417 million are owned by enterprises, accounting for 73.3% of all valid invention patents. Page 3: Let's now cover the Chinese readout of the meeting between Wang Yi and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock for the 7th round of China-Germany Strategic Dialogue on Diplomacy and Security. It says: Wang Yi said that this year marks the 10th anniversary of the establishment of a comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Germany. Both sides need to seriously review the past and actively explore the future. The world today is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, and human society faces multiple challenges, with noticeable increases in uncertainty, instability, and unpredictability. The more turbulent the world becomes, the more major powers need to maintain composure, and the more it is required for major-power relations to maintain stability. China is responding to all external uncertainties with its own certainty. China's policy towards Germany also remains stable and consistent. Over the 52 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties, China has always regarded Germany as an important partner. Under the strategic guidance of the leaders of the two countries and the joint efforts of the two peoples, China-Germany relations have generally maintained a momentum of development, which has not only brought important benefits to the people of the two countries, but also become a stabilizer in China-Europe relations and even the international situation. There are differences and disagreements between China and Germany, but differences should not be an obstacle to cooperation, and disagreements should not be a reason for confrontation. The positive results and beneficial experience achieved in China-Germany relations so far are worth cherishing and inheriting by both sides. ，10，，。，，、、。，，。。，52。，，，。，，。，。 Wang added that earlier this year, the CPC held the third plenary session, which launched a new reform agenda. He said that -in the past few months, the Chinese government has successively introduced new measures for reform and opening up, which have garnered the attention of and been welcomed by the international community, including the German business community; practical cooperation between China and Germany faces an even broader prospect. As the world's second and third largest economies, respectively, China and Germany must overcome interference and eliminate resistance; adhere to the main tone of dialogue and cooperation; abandon outdated confrontational Cold War mentality; jointly resist external risks and jointly respond to global challenges; strive to be promoters of pragmatic cooperation, advocates of open development, and exemplars of multilateralism; and showcase the responsibilities of major powers the turbulent changes and turmoil in the international situation.- ，7，，，。，，，。、，、，、，，，、、，. Share Tracking People's Daily Wang Yi stressed that in order to maintain the stable development of China-Germany relations, it is necessary to first correct strategic perception. China is a force for peace, growth and stability in the world. Its strategic intentions and policy orientations are open and transparent. It is the only major country that has written its adherence to the path of peaceful development into its constitution. The historical logic that a ‘strong country will inevitably seek hegemony' () does not apply to China. The systems of China and Germany and China and Europe are different. This is a product of their respective historical and cultural traditions and is also the choice made by the people. Both sides should uphold mutual respect and mutual understanding as the foundation for mutually beneficial cooperation. China-Germany relations are not directed against third parties and should not be affected by third parties. ，。、，，，。、，，。、，。，. -Wang Yi pointed out that competition should be fair, not a zero-sum game. The EU's high anti-subsidy tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles violate the principles of fair competition and free trade and have become a prominent issue between China and Europe. It is hoped that Germany and the EU will view China's development objectively and rationally, adopt a positive and pragmatic policy toward China, and properly handle trade disputes through dialogue and consultation.- ，，。，。、，，. Among other things, the readout quotes Baerbock as saying that -Germany supports the EU and China to continue negotiations on the EVs anti-subsidy issue and strive to find a solution acceptable to both sides.- ，，. They also discussed the war in Ukraine. The readout only says that Baerbock -hoped that China, as a partner of Europe, would play an active role in this regard. Wang Yi comprehensively and systematically elaborated China's position on promoting peace and dialogue.- ，，. Subscribe now I haven't seen a German readout, but Baerbock told reporters in Beijing that: -every permanent member of the United Nations Security Council has a responsibility for peace and security in the world; they must not fuel conflicts that threaten the security of us all with its support…Drones from Chinese factories, and North Korean troops attacking peace in the middle of Europe, violate our core European security interests- -The Russian president is not only destroying our European peace order through his war against Ukraine, but is now also dragging Asia into it via North Korea. My Chinese counterpart and I have discussed extensively why this cannot be in China's interest,- she said. Acknowledging that Berlin and Beijing hold different perspectives on the conflict, Baerbock said both sides engaged in substantive discussions about diplomatic efforts for a peaceful resolution. ‘A process for a just peace is needed more urgently than ever, as these thousand days of brutal Russian aggression have brought not only devastation to Ukraine,' Baerbock said. ‘They have also caused worldwide consequences, with the soaring food prices and now with the risk of involvement of other regions to this conflict'.- Share Tracking People's Daily ILD chief Liu Jianchao also met with Baerbock. The report on that in the paper is far too brief. Next, there's a report on MoFA's statement on Lithuania asking Chinese personnel to leave the country. -On November 29, Lithuania's Foreign Ministry, without any reason, declared relevant diplomatic personnel of the Office of the Chargé d'Affaires of China in Lithuania ‘persona non grata' and demanded that they leave the country within the time required. China strongly condemns and firmly rejects this wanton and provocative action. As many are aware, on issues concerning China's Taiwan region, Lithuania has been acting in serious violation of the one-China principle and breached the political commitment Lithuania made in the communiqué on the establishment of China-Lithuania diplomatic relations. This has caused severe difficulty for bilateral ties. Three years on since the downgrade of bilateral ties with China, Lithuania has again taken detrimental action that further exacerbates the relations. China calls on Lithuania to immediately stop undermining China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and stop creating difficulty for bilateral relations. China reserves the right to take countermeasures against Lithuania. We hope the upcoming new government of Lithuania will follow the prevailing international consensus, abide by the one-China principle, and foster conditions for the normalization of China-Lithuania relations.- Another report (related English report) informs that Remin University of China and Complutense University of Madrid have jointly launched a research center in Madrid, with the aim of enhancing educational collaboration and promoting cultural exchange and mutual learning of civilizations between China and Spain.

This was convened by the People's Daily Commentary Department, and hosted by Hunan Daily in Changsha. The theme of this forum was ‘Demonstrating the Responsibility of Commentary to Shape a New Mainstream Public Opinion Landscape'. The report says that -representatives from central media outlets, provincial Party committee propaganda departments, over 30 provincial-level Party newspapers, academia, and new media platforms gathered to exchange ideas and pool their efforts to strengthen and expand mainstream ideological discourse in the new era-. Yang Haodong, a member of the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee and head of its Propaganda Department, and Ma Hongwei, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the People's Daily, attended the meeting and delivered speeches. The report adds: Participants focused on how Party newspaper commentaries should respond to challenges and opportunities in the all-media era. They conducted in-depth discussions around themes such as ‘change the style of writing and expand the space of influence of mainstream public opinion' and ‘develop practical strategies to cultivate more widely-known and popular commentary experts'. The forum also held a ‘Praising the New Era' Party Newspaper Commentary Integrated Media Excellent Works Sharing Activity, where representatives from provincial Party newspapers including Beijing Daily, Hunan Daily, Southern Daily, Sichuan Daily, Gansu Daily, Qinghai Daily and others showcased outstanding works and shared their experiences and insights. ，-，--，、-。--，、、、、、、。 Page 15: There's a report on the signing ceremony for a cooperation agreement on the Bagh Dara Hydropower Project, a key supporting project of the Aynak Copper Mine in Afghanistan, in Kabul.

BRI Takes Centrestage - China-Central Asia Foreign Ministers Meeting Outcomes - Lashing Out at the US on Taiwan - China-Russia Strategic Air Patrol	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, December 02, 2024. Page 1: There's a long article on the page, which talks about the continued deepening of BRI's development. The headline reads: -Benefit people's livelihoods, win people's hearts, and benefit the world- . On BRI, there are two propositions that I frequently hear. First, that it has been de-prioritised or has met its quiet demise. Second, that BRI has been replaced by GDI. Both of these arguments are misplaced. On the first point, there has, of course, been a re-orientation of BRI in terms of quantum of investments, sectoral focus, and type of projects. But I cannot fathom the BRI brand not remaining a priority since it has been formally included in the CPC constitution and is linked to Xi Jinping's legacy. On the second point, I have consistently argued that GDI and BRI are distinct pillars in the grand edifice of building a community of common destiny/shared future for mankind. There are overlaps in project areas. But these are distinct brands, which approach development and project funding and execution differently. Anyway, the article today begins by talking about the opening of the port in Chancay. The piece informs that over the past 11 years, more than 150 countries and more than 30 international organizations have signed cooperation documents on the Belt and Road Initiative. Some key excerpts: -The high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative is an important cooperative platform through which China, with an open mind, invites countries to share the opportunities of Chinese-style modernization and build a community with a shared future for humanity. It represents a magnificent chapter in China's head-of-state diplomacy.- --、，. -Under the personal planning, deployment, and promotion of President Xi Jinping, the joint construction of the Belt and Road has transformed from a concept into action, from a vision into reality. It has evolved from the broad brushstrokes of a ‘freehand sketch' to the meticulous refinement of a ‘fine brush painting', showcasing the outstanding political wisdom and mission of the leader of a major country. In the face of changes in the world, the era, and history, the joint construction of the Belt and Road takes the building of a community with a shared future for humanity as its ultimate goal, consistently upholds the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits, adheres to openness as its essence, green development as its foundation, and integrity as its hallmark. It emphasises high standards, sustainability, and benefits for people's livelihoods, and constantly realizss the people's desire for exchanges among civilisations, expectations for peace and tranquility, pursuit of common development and yearning for a better life. More than 11 years of progress have demonstrated that the joint construction of the Belt and Road stands on the right side of history.- 、、，--，，----，。、、，--，，、、，、、，、、、。11，--. The joint construction of the Belt and Road has driven an investment scale of nearly $1 trillion and helped nearly 40 million people get rid of poverty. --，4000. -The Luban Workshop has established 32 ‘technical stations' in countries jointly building the Belt and Road, providing vocational and technical training for local youth and continuously enhancing the endogenous development momentum of these countries.- --32--，，. -As the vast number of developing countries seek answers through exploration, Chinese-style modernization offers the world a brand-new mode of thinking and action — ‘The modernization of the world should be one of peaceful development, mutual benefit and cooperation, and shared prosperity'. ‘We must pursue a path of globalization that is people-centered, with more balanced development and more equitable opportunities, enabling different countries, social classes, and groups of people to share in the fruits of development'.- ，——-、、。--、、，、、.- -In July 2024, the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China outlined a grand blueprint for further deepening reform and advancing Chinese-style modernization. The meeting resolved to improve mechanisms for promoting high-quality joint construction of BRI. It decided to continue implementing the Belt and Road Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan, strengthen the construction of multilateral cooperation platforms in fields such as green development, digital economy, artificial intelligence, energy, taxation, finance, and disaster reduction. It also called for improving the integrated layout of land, sea, air, and cyberspace to build a multidimensional connectivity network under the Belt and Road. Efforts will also be coordinated to advance major landmark projects and ‘small but beautiful' livelihood projects.- 20247，、。--。--，、、、、、、。，--。--. Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: There's a report on Fifth China-Central Asia Foreign Ministers' Meeting. Xinhua says: -Wang noted that the China-Central Asia Mechanism has been in place for four years, during which the six countries, driven by good neighborliness, solidarity and pragmatism, have worked together to promote its development. He said that significant progress has been made since the first summit in Xi'an last May, with over half of the relevant projects being implemented or making substantial progress. The two sides have established ministerial platforms in areas such as trade, customs, agriculture, transportation, and industrial investment, Wang said, adding that China is willing to enhance cooperation with Central Asian countries and align development strategies.- Wang Yi made five points: First, we must adhere to the leadership of the heads of state. In accordance with the blueprint drawn up by the six heads of state, we will continue to implement the consensus reached at the Xi'an Summit and carefully prepare for the second summit to be held in Kazakhstan next year. Second, we should prioritise development. We should focus on the six priority areas of cooperation, namely, trade facilitation, industrial investment, connectivity, green mining, agricultural modernization, and streamlined people-to-people exchanges, improve the overall level of China-Central Asia cooperation, and implement GDI with practical actions. Third, we must uphold the principle of sharing weal and woe. We must implement the Global Security Initiative, deepen law enforcement and security cooperation, work together to respond to crises and challenges, and maintain a stable and peaceful development environment for the six countries. Fourth, we should uphold our generational friendship. We should jointly implement the Global Civilization Initiative, uphold the concept of civilization based on equality, mutual learning, dialogue and inclusiveness, and perpetuate the concept of good-neighborliness, friendship and peace from generation to generation. Fifth, we must uphold multilateralism. We must oppose any form of ‘decoupling' and ‘small yards and high fences', promote cooperation across the Global South, and promote the development of an equal and orderly multipolar world and inclusive economic globalization. 。，，。。、、、、、，，。。，，，。。，、、、，、。。----，，、. The English reporting has some differences. It says that: The Chinese foreign minister summed up five consensus reached by the six foreign ministers during the meeting. First, the six countries agree to adhere to the guidance of the head of states and make the China-Central Asia mechanism better and stronger. Second, the six countries will adhere to the goal of modernization and deepen all-round cooperation. China is willing to expand cooperation with Central Asian countries in BeiDou Navigation Satellite System applications, poverty reduction and alleviation, desertification control, higher education and people-to-people exchanges, and build platforms for exchanges. Third, the six countries will share weal and woe and uphold regional peace and tranquility and actively implement the China-proposed Global Security Initiative, oppose external interference in the internal affairs of Central Asian countries and assist Afghanistan in realizing peaceful reconstruction as early as possible. Fourth, the six countries will adhere to mutual learning among civilizations and strengthen the foundation of everlasting friendship. ‘In the coming three years, China will provide 1,500 training opportunities to the five Central Asian countries and increase the number of scholarships by 600, so as to train more talents in various fields that are urgently needed for their development'. Fifth, the six countries will uphold multilateralism and safeguard international equity and justice, continue to strengthen coordination and cooperation in international and regional affairs, promote solidarity and coordination in the Global South, and oppose any form of ‘decoupling and breaking chains.' The six countries will fully support China in assuming the rotating presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and jointly push the SCO to achieve new development and raise it to a new level.- Subscribe now The meeting ended with a joint statement. Key points: All parties pointed out that the ministerial cooperation mechanisms in the fields of economy and trade, industry and investment, agriculture, transportation, customs, security law enforcement, and emergency management established within the framework of the China-Central Asia Mechanism have been operating efficiently and have played an important role in promoting China-Central Asia cooperation. All parties are willing to continuously improve the construction of the China-Central Asia Mechanism and enrich the connotation of China-Central Asia cooperation in accordance with the actual needs of cooperation. All participating parties of the Secretariat believe that the China-Central Asia Mechanism Secretariat, which began operations in March 2024, provides an effective platform for promoting multilateral cooperation. All participating parties of the Secretariat are willing to make full efforts to complete the signing of secretariat legal documents and related work, ensuring the Secretariat transitions to comprehensive operations next year. ，—、、、、、、，。—，。，20243—。，. The document then talks about 7 areas of cooperation. These are: Cooperation in unimpeded trade: This covers enhancing the level of trade and investment liberalization and facilitation between China and Central Asian countries, expanding mutual market access, ensuring the stability and smoothness of supply and industrial chains, and promoting the development of new formats such as digital trade, trade in services, and e-commerce Cooperation in industrial investment: This covers consolidating cooperation in traditional fields such as building materials, light industry, and processing and manufacturing and expanding cooperation in new fields such as digital economy, green development, and renewable energy. Cooperation in connectivity: This calls to comprehensively promote cooperation between China and Central Asian countries in the fields of roads, railways, aviation, shipping, multimodal transport, logistics and transportation, port construction, and fibre optic cables, and promote the construction of the China-Central Asia transportation corridor. It adds that China is willing to strengthen cooperation with Central Asian countries on China-Europe trains and promote the establishment of an intergovernmental cooperation mechanism. Green minerals cooperation: This calls to expand cooperation between China and Central Asian countries in mineral exploration, extraction, smelting, processing, transportation, and sales fields, strengthen green development and utilization of mineral resource industrial chain's ‘exploration, production, supply, storage, and sales' links, and research drafting documents on strengthening investment cooperation in fields related to green mineral resources.——。，，，、、。。——。，、、，、、，，，。、，—。——。、、、、、、、，—。，、。（），。——。、、、、、，--，。 Agricultural cooperation, personnel exchanges and tourism cooperation It also talks about education and cultural cooperation.

Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the page is a report (English report) on Wang Yi's meetings with Kazakhstan's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Murat Nurtleu, Tajikistan's Minister of Foreign Affairs Sirojiddin Muhriddin and Uzbekistan's Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov. Page 10: Much of this page is dedicated to express anger over Lai Ching-te's stopover in the US. MoFA said (Chinese text): -China firmly opposes any form of official interaction between the US and the Taiwan region, firmly opposes any trip by leader of the Taiwan authorities to the US in any name or under whatever pretext, and firmly opposes any form of US connivance or support for ‘Taiwan independence' separatists and their separatist activities. China strongly condemns the US's arranging for Lai Ching-te's ‘stopover' and has lodged serious protests with the US. The Taiwan question is at the core of China's core interests, and the first red line that cannot be crossed in China-US relations. We urge the US to fully see the separatist nature of Lai Ching-te and the DPP authorities, fully understand the grave damage that ‘Taiwan independence' separatist activities do to cross-Strait peace and stability, fully abide by the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqués, act on the commitments made by US leaders such as not supporting ‘Taiwan independence,' stop having official interaction with the Taiwan region, and stop sending any wrong signal to ‘Taiwan independence' separatist forces. China will closely follow the developments and take resolute and strong measures to defend our nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity.- The foreign ministry also responded to a question on the State Department clearing arms sales to Taiwan totaling $385 million. It said: -The US arms sales to China's Taiwan region seriously violate the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqués, especially the August 17 Communiqué of 1982 and China's sovereignty and security interests. The sales are a severe breach of international law, send a gravely wrong signal to ‘Taiwan independence' separatist forces, and are detrimental to China-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. The decision to sell arms to Taiwan is simply inconsistent with US leaders' commitment of not supporting ‘Taiwan independence.' China deplores and firmly opposes it and has lodged serious protests to the US, according to the statement. The spokesperson called on the US to immediately stop arming Taiwan and stop abetting and supporting ‘Taiwan independence' separatist forces in seeking ‘Taiwan independence' by building up its military.- The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council also issued remarks regarding the arms sales and Lai's stopover. Global Times reports: -China firmly opposes official interaction between the US and Taiwan region, firmly opposes leader of the Taiwan region making ‘stopover' in the US in any name or under whatever pretext, a long-standing and clear position, the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office said on Sunday. Spokesperson Chen Binhua made the remarks in response to a media question on Taiwan regional leader Lai Ching-te's ‘stopover' in Hawaii in his trip to so-called ‘diplomatic allies' in the Pacific. Chen noted that the Chinese Foreign Ministry has lodged serious protests with the US. Since Lai took office, his authorities have stubbornly adhered to a separatist stance of ‘Taiwan independence', continuously sought ‘independence' and made provocations, escalating cross-Straits confrontation, threatening peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, and severely harming the safety and well-being of the Taiwan compatriots, Chen said. No matter what tricks the Lai authorities adopt to manipulate in the pursuit of ‘Taiwan independence', they cannot shake the basic pattern of the international community's adherence to the one-China principle, nor can they obstruct the historical trend of China's eventual reunification, the spokesperson said. ‘We urge the US to abide by the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqués, fully see the separatist nature and damage of Lai and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities, handle the Taiwan question with prudence,' Chen said.- On the arms sales, the spokesperson basically reiterated MoFA's remarks. When asked about the DPP's reaction to the arms package, Global Times reports: -Chen (Binhua) warned the Lai Ching-te authorities that buying weapons will not bring security, and ‘protection fees' cannot save ‘Taiwan independence'. Relying on the US to pursue ‘independence' is destined to fail, and attempting to achieve ‘independence' through military means will only lead Taiwan to danger and ultimately to its own demise. The Taiwan question is at the core of China's core interests, Chen said. ‘No one and no force should underestimate the firm will and strong capability of the Chinese people to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.'- Share Tracking People's Daily Xinhua reports: Zhang Xiaogang, spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, said that on Nov. 29 and 30, the militaries of China and Russia conducted a joint strategic air patrol over the Sea of Japan and the western part of the Pacific Ocean. The strategic patrol jointly conducted by the two air forces effectively tested and enhanced the joint training and operation capabilities. Reuters reports that -President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Monday the presence of a Russian attack submarine in the Philippines' exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea was ‘very worrisome'. ‘That's very concerning. Any intrusion into the West Philippine Sea, of our EEZ, of our baselines, is very worrisome,' Marcos told reporters, referring to part of the South China Sea within the Philippines' maritime zone. A Russian Kilo-class submarine was sighted 80 nautical miles off the western province of Occidental Mindoro on Nov. 28, Navy spokesperson Roy Vincent Trinidad said in a statement on Monday, confirming a report by the Philippine Daily Inquirer newspaper. Philippine navy frigate Jose Rizal established radio contact with the Russian submarine, which confirmed its identity as UFA 490 and its intent. ‘The Russian vessel stated it was awaiting improved weather conditions before proceeding to Vladivostok, Russia,' Trinidad said, without elaborating on why it was in the area.- Just before heading to Beijing, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock lashed out at China. Bloomberg reports: -‘Instead of taking responsibility for peace and security in the world as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China is opposing our core European interests with its economic and weapons aid to Russia,' Baerbock said in an emailed statement before departing Berlin airport on Sunday for her two-day visit to Beijing. Vladimir ‘Putin's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine is a direct threat to our peace. I will also speak in Beijing about the fact that we cannot simply ignore this in our relations with China'. The European Union is proposing to sanction several Chinese firms that it claims helped Russian companies develop attack drones that were deployed against Ukraine. Baerbock will meet her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing to address this issue, her spokesman said. Germany's top diplomat will also discuss the humanitarian situation in China, as well as EU tariffs against Chinese electric vehicles that were introduced in October. Brussels has claimed that Chinese state subsidies for EVs distort competition. The government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz voted against the tariffs because it fears counter measures against its own car industry. But in contrast to Scholz, who advocates a more pragmatic approach to China, Baerbock, a member of the co-governing Greens, is known for her more critical position. ‘As Europe's largest economy, we stand up for our interests just as the Chinese leadership does for its interests,' Baerbock said. ‘If our economic competition is abused for system competition, we will not turn a blind eye to it.' Germany would therefore ‘not tolerate others violating the international rules of the game to the detriment of German and European industry — be it through state-subsidized overproduction or on the subject of human rights, when ILO core labor standards are ignored for competitive advantage,' she added.

MSS' Warning on Open-Source Information	Hi folks, I am summarising a piece that was published on the Ministry of State Security's WeChat account. This was republished by Xinhua today. The piece basically talks about the need to be cautious with open-source information. The warning is that open-source information can become a source of leaking of secret and sensitive information. Before I get to the article, I think this is the opportune moment to announce that the next edition of my 6-week online course Watching China is scheduled for early February 2025. The course is designed to equip those aspiring to study and analyse China's domestic and foreign policies with the skills that are essential to engage in such a task. Over a period of six weeks, Watching China will provide an introduction to the philosophy, structures and processes of the Leninist Party-state system, discuss the role of ideology and familiarise students with the language of Communist Party discourse. Students will also be introduced to key analytical frameworks and China's information ecosystem allowing them to undertake effective open source research. Further details will be provided in the days ahead. If you would like to be personally notified when applications open, please can drop me a line through the link below or by replying to this email. Back to the MSS' article. The article says that in the era of big data and cyberspace, -some sensitive information is being publicly disseminated through the Internet without undergoing declassification processing or risk assessment, thereby becoming an important source of open source intelligence for foreign espionage and intelligence agencies, posing a threat to our national security.- It adds: -Open-source information generally refers to legally accessible information resources, including but not limited to social media posts, online forum discussions, blog articles, news reports, satellite images, etc. These information sources are extensive, have low acquisition costs, and often contain a wealth of valuable data and intelligence, which may become a critical source of network-based intelligence theft for foreign espionage and intelligence agencies. Be vigilant when it comes to leaks in procurement bidding. Classified procurement refers to procurement activities that require confidentiality measures during the process to ensure the security of state secrets, such as classified construction projects or digitization of classified archives. In practice, due to inadequate management or weak confidentiality awareness among personnel, procurement content or purposes may be improperly disclosed, or classified technical parameters may be marked in public bidding documents on occasion, threatening the security of state secrets. Be vigilant of leaks during information disclosure. According to regulations, government agencies must, as per the law, conduct confidentiality reviews of information proposed for public disclosure before making it public. However, it has been found in practice that some agencies fail to strictly follow confidentiality review regulations when publishing information, uploading classified documents to public websites, thereby leading to incidents of information leaks. Be vigilant of leaks on social media. In today's society, self-media is flourishing, and videos casually filmed or comments posted by netizens can attract widespread attention. Some outdoor enthusiasts share images with classified sensitive forbidden areas as backgrounds on social media to attract attention. Such behaviour not only severely disrupts the management order of classified and sensitive areas but may also be exploited by foreign espionage and intelligence agencies, posing a threat to our national security. ，、、、、。，，，。——。，，、。，、，、，。——。，，。，，，，。——。，，、。，，，. The next bit of the article says that: -The openness and easy accessibility of open-source information makes sensitive information easily exploitable by foreign espionage and intelligence agencies. Foreign espionage and intelligence agencies can gather fragmented, blurred data together, and through big data correlation analysis, can implement precise, continuous, and stable information tracking on targets, obtaining valuable intelligence. This poses great challenges when it comes to maintaining confidentiality, necessitating the adoption of stricter and more effective measures to prevent information leaks. Improve systems and clarify responsibilities. Relevant units should establish and improve confidentiality responsibility systems and management protocols, clearly defining the confidentiality duties and authorities of leaders and staff at all levels. Strengthen the management and supervision of personnel involved in dealing with classified information to ensure strict compliance with confidentiality regulations and systems. Strengthen control and conduct strict reviews. Relevant units should strengthen information disclosure control at the source, strictly implement confidentiality review systems, absolutely prohibit the disclosure of classified information, and implement categorised and graded protection for non-classified but sensitive information. Network platforms should strictly fulfil main body responsibilities, strengthen full-process management of information circulation, improve content review mechanisms, and ensure compliance in editing and compilation, conduct declassification before publication, and review materials before re-sharing. Raise awareness and be cautious in speech and action. Citizens in general should enhance risk prevention awareness, be vigilant against behaviours that endanger national security, maintain clear-headedness and caution in network-related behaviours, and prevent themselves from becoming sources of open-source intelligence for foreign espionage and intelligence agencies. 。、，，、、，，，。——，。，。，。——，。，，，。，，，、、。——，。，，、，. The piece ends with a call to action, i.e., to report suspicious activities through the 12339 hotline, through www.12339.gov.cn, the WeChat public account of the Ministry of State Security or directly to the local national security authorities.

He stressed the need to establish a fair, safe, non-discriminatory, and predictable business environment for enterprises. China has always regarded Europe as a key priority in its diplomacy and an important partner in achieving Chinese-style modernization. China is willing to promote the high-level development of China-Spain relations to contribute to the steady and long-term growth of China-Europe relations, said Zhao. Sanchez said Spain abides by the one-China policy. Extending welcome for China's investment, the prime minister called for more cooperation in such fields as trade, electric vehicles, agricultural products, culture and sports. Spain is willing to play an active role in the European Union (EU) and push for better development of EU-China relations, said Sanchez, adding the Spanish side will strengthen coordination with China on international and multilateral affairs, uphold the authority of international law, and work together to safeguard global peace and stability.- In his meetings with Rollan and Armengol, Xinhua reports that Zhao said the NPC -is willing to strengthen exchanges with the Spanish Senate and the Congress of Deputies at all levels, promote mutual learning on legislation and supervision, and timely formulate, revise and approve legal documents conducive to bilateral cooperation…Zhao underscored the readiness to advance the exchanges between the two countries' legislators, and cement bilateral collaboration within multilateral frameworks such as the Inter-Parliamentary Union.

I am not detailing the entire plan. Xinhua says: -China aims to cut the ratio of social logistics costs to GDP to around 13.5 percent by 2027…By 2027, the country expects to further optimize the structure of goods transportation, and strengthen the national logistics hub system and modern logistics service network…Toward that end, efforts will be made to advance reforms in key areas of the railways and in the road freight market, boost the openness and interconnectivity of logistics data, speed up the building of a modern supply-chain system, and improve the modern commercial logistics system, it said.

Dragon TV: China recently rolled out measures to facilitate cross-border travel. Last week, a new batch of countries were added to the visa-free list. We noticed that China is becoming an increasingly popular destination for foreign tourists. Places in China have become trending searches on multiple tourism platforms, and the number of reservations for tours to China surged on many foreign e-commerce tourism platforms. Can you give us more details? Mao Ning: China has extended the visa-free policy to 38 countries since the end of last year and so far has realized comprehensive mutual visa exemption with 25 countries in total. We have also made Chinese visa application more efficient and easier by improving the visa application form, canceling visa reservation, expanding the scope of fingerprinting exemption, lowering visa fees and other measures. While streamlining the procedure of travelling to China, we are also committed to making life and work in China more convenient and comfortable for foreign friends. Places including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong Province improved payment services, including by mobile devices, bank cards and cash, to make online shopping and transportation more problem-free for foreign friends. Chinese telecom providers, by opening new shops, improving foreign language services and launching new packages, have enabled foreign friends to access and use 5G network more conveniently. More cities have set up special windows to provide one-stop service to help foreign nationals to get work permit and residence permit faster. We will make continued effort to facilitate cross-border travel. We welcome friends from all countries to visit China, experience the country's glamour and share in the dividends of China's development. Subscribe now Mao Ning also responded to the G7 Foreign Ministers' statement, which had a lot of content related to China. The G7 statement said: -We will take appropriate measures, consistent with our legal systems, against actors in China and in other third countries that materially support Russia's war machine, including financial institutions and other entities that facilitate Russia's acquisition of equipment and items for its defense industrial base…We urge countries with ties to Russia and the DPRK, including China, to uphold international law by opposing this dangerous expansion of the conflict and implementing all relevant UNSC resolutions.- And then there is this big chunk on China: -As we seek constructive and stable relations with China, we recognize the importance of direct and candid engagement to express concerns and manage differences. We reaffirm our readiness to cooperate with China to address global challenges We are deeply concerned by China's increasing support to Russia and Russia's defense industrial base, which is decisively enabling Russia to maintain its illegal war in Ukraine and to reconstitute its armed forces and has significant broad-based security implications. China must prevent its companies from transferring weapons, especially attack Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), dual-use materials, including weapons components, and equipment. We also call on China to step up efforts to promote international peace and security and to press Russia to stop its military aggression and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw its troops from Ukraine.- We recognize the importance of China in global trade. We are not trying to harm China or thwart its economic development, indeed a growing China that plays by international rules and norms would be of global interest. However, we express our concerns about China's non-market policies and practices that are leading to harmful overcapacity and market distortions, undermining our workers, industries and economic resilience and security. We are not decoupling or turning inwards. Together with our partners, we are de-risking and diversifying supply chains, where necessary and appropriate to reduce critical dependencies and vulnerabilities and to foster resilience to economic coercion. We further call on China to refrain from adopting export control measures, particularly on critical minerals, that could lead to significant supply chain disruptions. We remain seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas. We reiterate our strong opposition to any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion. There is no legal basis for China's expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea. We reiterate our opposition to China's militarization and coercive and intimidation activities in the South China Sea. We re-emphasize the universal and unified character of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and reaffirm its important role in setting out the legal framework that governs all activities in the oceans and seas. We continue to oppose China's dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia in the South China Sea and its repeated obstruction of countries' freedom of navigation and overflight. We express deep concern over the increasing use of dangerous maneuvers and water cannons against Philippine and Vietnamese vessels. We reiterate that the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal on 12 July 2016 is a significant milestone, which is legally binding upon the parties to those proceedings and a useful basis for peacefully resolving disputes between the parties. Maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is indispensable to international security and prosperity. We call for the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. There is no change in the basic position of the G7 members on Taiwan, including stated One-China policies. We support Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations as a member where statehood is not a prerequisite and as an observer or guest where it is. We remain concerned by the human rights situation in China, including in Xinjiang and Tibet. We remain concerned by the erosion of civil society, human rights and fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong. The sentencing of 45 pro-democracy politicians and activists marks a further deterioration of democratic participation and pluralism, which undermines confidence in the rule of law as enshrined in the Hong Kong Basic Law, and therefore Hong Kong's and the People's Republic of China's international legal obligations. We urge China and the Hong Kong authorities to abide by their international human rights commitments and legal obligations. We call on China not to conduct or condone activities aimed at undermining the security and safety of our communities and the integrity of our democratic institutions, and to act in strict accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Xi Meets Lee Hsien Loong - China-Samoa Joint Statement - Zhong Yin Commentary on Recent Violent Crimes - CPC Delegation Visits Sri Lanka - Boosting Te...	Hi folks, I hope this finds you well. Before we get to today's paper, I am sharing my latest podcast with my colleague Anushka Saxena, discussing the key takeaways from Xi Jinping's recent visit to Peru and Brazil. Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, November 27, 2024. Page 1: The lead report on the page is about Xi Jinping meeting with Senior Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong. Xi praised the -remarkable achievements Singapore made during Lee's tenure as prime minister.- He called on the two sides to -strengthen high-level exchanges, further strengthen the alignment of development strategies, deepen cooperation in various fields, bring more benefits to the people of the two countries, and make greater contributions to regional peace and prosperity.- He said that the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park is a -vivid example of bilateral cooperation and bears witness to Singapore's deep involvement in China's reform and opening up-. Xi added: -China will always focus on running its own affairs well, and has confidence in maintaining sound economic momentum in the long run and achieving high-quality development. China welcomes Singapore to continue being a forerunner in cooperation with China, advance major cooperation projects, seize the opportunities brought by digital and green development, and write a new chapter in bilateral cooperation in the new era. Xi Jinping pointed out that the world today is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century. In the face of risks and challenges, no single country can be immune. Upholding solidarity, cooperation, openness and inclusiveness is the right path to tread. China is willing to work together with Singapore to practice genuine multilateralism, follow the trend of economic globalization, safeguard international fairness and justice, resist bloc confrontation and division, and build an Asian community with a shared destiny.- ，，。，，，、，。，。，，、。，，，，、，. As per the report, Lee said: -China has already found a successful path to modernization. Singapore is full of confidence in China's future and believes that China will maintain development and prosperity, making greater contributions to global peace and development. Singapore will continue to commit to deepening cooperation with China and actively participate in China's modernization process. In the current complex international situation, all countries should adopt a long-term perspective, uphold multilateralism, commit to unity and cooperation, and jointly address risks and challenges to better benefit their peoples.- ，，，。，。，，，，，. They also discussed China-US relations and the regional situation. Wang Huning also met with Lee. Xinhua reports Wang said that -China is willing to maintain close, high-level exchange with Singapore, strengthen practical cooperation in various fields, enhance the friendship between the two peoples, push for new progress in China-Singapore relations, and contribute to regional peace, stability, development and prosperity.- Do also note that on Tuesday, the militaries of China and Singapore held a -force-on-force joint drill- at a training base in Henan. China's Ministry of National Defense said that the exercise was divided into three main phases: infiltration and positioning, assault and rescue, and evacuation. Subscribe now Xi also met with visiting Samoan Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa in Beijing. Xinhua's report says: Xi said that -China is willing to make empowering Pacific Island countries to tackle climate change a priority in its cooperation with these countries. China will work with Pacific Island countries to promote the full and effective implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement, honor the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, uphold fairness, justice and the common interests of the Global South, and build a community with a shared future for mankind, Xi told Mata'afa. Noting that Samoa was among the first Pacific Island countries to establish diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China nearly five decades ago, Xi said the two countries have maintained traditional friendship, mutual respect, equal treatment and win-win cooperation. He said China supports Samoa in safeguarding its sovereignty and independence, and exploring a development path suited to its national conditions. China will continue to provide assistance to Samoa in its economic and social development, and tap the potential of economy, trade, investment, agriculture and fisheries to achieve common development, Xi said. Xi stressed that China does not attach political strings to its assistance to the Pacific Island countries, and China's policy toward Pacific Island countries is open and inclusive, without targeting any third party or engaging in geopolitical competition or spheres of influence.- Among other things, -Mata'afa said Samoa firmly adheres to the one-China principle and supports the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative proposed by President Xi.- The two sides issued a joint statement too. This is available on Page 3. The English version is also available. Key points: -The Chinese side supports Samoa in upholding its sovereignty and independence. Samoa firmly adheres to the one-China principle, and recognizes there is but one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory; the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. Furthermore, Samoa recognizes efforts by the Chinese government to realize national reunification, and that issues relating to Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Xizang and human rights are internal matters for China to deal with. By the same token, Samoa believes that the South China Sea issue is a matter for China to settle amicably through peaceful negotiations and dialogue with all parties involved.- -China reiterated the principles of respect President Xi Jinping believes are essential for developing relations with Pacific island countries, namely: respect for sovereignty and independence; respect for the will of the countries; respect the ethnic and cultural traditions and respect for the countries' commitment to unity. China reaffirms the absence of conditionality to its assistance. It neither imposes its will onto countries nor makes empty promises in assisting countries, values commended by Samoa.- It mentions GDI, GSI, GCI and building a community for a shared future of mankind, along with BRI. -The two sides agreed to reaching a mutual visa free arrangement as soon as possible. The Chinese side will continue to send medical team to Samoa, provide scholarships and various training opportunities and support Samoa in Chinese language teaching.- -The two sides agreed to advocate humanity's common values of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom, strengthen communication and coordination on international and regional affairs, defend the international system with the U.N. at its core, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, safeguard the WTO-centered multilateral trading system, oppose hegemony and power politics, and promote an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization.- -The Chinese side will within the framework of South-South cooperation continue to provide assistance and support within its capacity to Samoa's climate response through bilateral and multilateral channels. The two sides will deepen cooperation in disaster prevention and mitigation and emergency management and will cooperate to build a low carbon demonstration zone for addressing climate change under South-South cooperation.- -The two sides agreed to deepen practical maritime cooperation in ocean observation and forecasting, marine disaster prevention and mitigation, marine ecosystem protection and restoration, marine spatial planning, blue economy and other fields, consider a blue partnership, and promote the building of a sustainable maritime community. The two sides reiterated their commitment to firmly upholding the international nuclear non-proliferation regime with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as the cornerstone and the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, and called on all countries to fulfill international obligations and the prudent handling of related issues.- Share Tracking People's Daily Also on the front page is a report on Li Qiang meeting with the Samoan PM. Xinhua reports: -China is ready to work with Samoa to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, further deepen political mutual trust, firmly support each other's core interests, strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation, and constantly enrich the connotation of China-Samoa comprehensive strategic partnership, he said.

Han said: -President Xi Jinping has emphasized that maintaining the resilience and stability of global industrial and supply chains is an important guarantee for promoting world economic development. Over the years, China has been not only a participant and beneficiary of global industrial and supply chain cooperation but also a steadfast defender and builder, making active contributions to global economic development. China continues to improve its industrial system, providing strong support for the operation of global industrial and supply chains; adheres to open cooperation, injecting continuous momentum into global industrial and supply chains; and leverages its ultra-large-scale market, opening vast space for the operation of global industrial and supply chains. China is willing to work with all countries to promote the establishment of an open global economic system and to ensure the stability and smooth operation of global industrial and supply chains.- ，，。，、，、，。，；，；，。，. Han then made three points: China will adhere to the correct direction of economic globalization, promote industrial and production capacity cooperation with various countries, and better achieve mutual promotion of industries, shared benefits, and win-win development.

China is willing to expand cooperation with various countries in green industries, clean energy and other fields to help the world's green development. 。，。，、，、、。，。，，。，。、，. Subscribe now Page 2: There is an important Zhong Yin commentary today discussing the spate of recent knife and car attacks that have taken place in China. The fact that we are seeing this commentary is an indication of the serious concern at the highest levels about the increase in these incidents. The article, however, is rather shallow. There is no reflection about policy issues, economic or social, that are leading to the rise in such crimes. Rather, the call is to intensify crackdowns and prevention at source to remedial actions. The article says: -Recently, several extreme cases endangering public safety have occurred one after another, with their nature being exceptionally vile. In this regard, we must learn profound lessons, draw broader conclusions from specific instances, and maintain a high level of vigilance as if treading on thin ice, strengthen the prevention of risks at their source, intensify efforts in combating, managing, and preventing such incidents, and strive with all efforts to safeguard the lives and safety of the people and maintain social stability.- ，。，、，，，，. -Nothing is more precious than the lives and safety of the people. Innocent citizens suffering harm and vibrant lives being abruptly lost are profoundly shocking and heartbreaking! The public deeply empathises with the pain of the victims and their families and strongly condemns these extreme, retaliatory crimes against society. There is a unified call for the perpetrators to be punished severely in accordance with the law to serve as a deterrent. People from all walks of life have extended a helping hand, doing their utmost to treat the injured, save lives, and minimize harm to the greatest extent possible. Defending life and preventing crime have become a shared understanding and collective action.- 。，，、！，，。，、，，、. -Using extreme actions to retaliate against society and harm others is utterly unforgivable. Such criminals who obliterate humanity and conscience are despicable. Regardless of any personal reasons, any attempts to excuse such extreme behavior have no rationality, no legitimacy, will not obtain any person's understanding or sympathy, and will only receive universal condemnation and disdain. Venting personal grievances by targeting innocent people's lives and seeking attention through extreme means are actions that leave an eternal stain of infamy. They solve no problems but instead expose the perpetrators' inner malice and depravity, permanently nailing them to the pillar of shame. What awaits them is the stern punishment of the law and the contempt of the public.- ，，。，、，，，。，，，，、，。，，. The commentary then says that we must never relax or waver in safeguarding people's lives. -Party committees and governments at all levels must earnestly implement the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping and the decisions of the Party Central Committee. They must bear in mind that public safety is the most fundamental aspect of people's livelihoods and must put the protection of people's lives and safety in a more important position. They must severely crack down on extreme criminal acts in accordance with the law without mercy and severe violent crimes must be punished with a heavy hand, leaving no opportunity for any criminal to exploit. It is imperative to fully assume the political responsibility of ‘promoting local development and ensuring local safety'. We must adhere to and develop the Fengqiao Experience in the new era, building a comprehensive governance mechanism to address social conflicts that includes prevention at the source, investigation and screening, dispute resolution, and emergency response. A robust public safety protection network should be established, along with improved systems for social psychological services and crisis intervention, to fully safeguard the peace and stability of the broader social landscape.- ，、。，，，、，，，-、-。--，、、、，，，. The article ends by saying that -each of us is a beneficiary of social stability and should also be a guardian of public safety. We must take a clear stand against actions that harm social stability, fulfil our social responsibilities, be law-abiding citizens, cherish the hard-won safe environment, and work together to foster a harmonious and friendly social atmosphere.- ，，，、，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: There's a report on Wang Yi's meeting with Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto in Beijing. Xinhua says: -Wang said the practical bilateral cooperation has yielded fruitful results, which fully demonstrates that as long as there is mutual respect, trust, and support, economic cooperation between the two sides will enjoy broad prospects. Wang expressed the hope that the new European Union institutions will adhere to the orientation and cooperative tone of the China-EU partnership, view China's development objectively, pursue a positive and pragmatic policy toward China, and promote the sustained, healthy, and stable development of China-EU relations.- On the issue of China's ties with Europe, do note this SCMP report: -The European Union and China are not close to finalising a deal that would end their long-running electric vehicle dispute, according to a senior EU official, who called reports suggesting otherwise -confusing-. -I think there have been some quite confusing reports about the imminent deal on battery electric vehicles,- said Sabine Weyand, the EU's director general for trade, said in Brussels on Tuesday. -We have had 50 hours of discussions with our Chinese counterparts. They were constructive, but they have not led to an agreement on price undertakings. And there are structural issues that remain unresolved,- she said. The dispute concerns an anti-subsidy investigation conducted over the course of a year by the European Commission. The inquiry found that Beijing had distributed substantial state subsidies across China's electric vehicle sector and led to the EU imposing countervailing duties on EV imports from China at the end of October. The commission argues that the subsidies have assisted in China's enormous growth in the sector and fears that if allowed to continue unfettered, the underpriced imports will harm the sales of Europe's own EV industry. The tariffs, which range from 7 per cent for Tesla to a top end of 35.3 per cent for state-owned SAIC, have become a huge bone of contention in the EU-China relationship. Some EU member states – including Germany, Sweden and Spain – have urged the commission to negotiate a settlement which would make some tariff reductions in exchange for a commitment from Chinese companies to set a minimum price on EVs sold in the EU. The trade dispute has spread to other sectors too, with Beijing retaliating by launching anti-dumping probes against EU brandy, dairy and pork shipments.- Meanwhile, the European Union on Monday formally launched a challenge at the World Trade Organization against China's move to impose anti-dumping measures on brandy imported from the bloc.

Xinhua reports that the delegation was led by ILD deputy head Sun Haiyan. -During the visit, the delegation met with Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya, as well as the main leaders of the ruling and opposition parties and representatives of parliamentarians. During the meetings, the delegation introduced the spirit of the third plenary session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, and had in-depth exchanges with the Sri Lankan side on China-Sri Lanka relations and cooperation in various fields. Expressing its firm commitment to a friendly policy toward China, the Sri Lankan side hoped to deepen cooperation in various fields between China and Sri Lanka, share China's development opportunities, further strengthen inter-party relations and exchanges of experience in governance, and promote the comprehensive development and expansion of China-Sri Lanka relations.- Subscribe now Page 4: Two reports to note. First, there's a report informing that the People's Bank of China, National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Ministry of Transport, State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, and the State Financial Regulatory Administration held a meeting recently to step up the implementation of loan policies for scientific and technological innovation and technological transformation. The report says that in April this year, the People's Bank of China, together with the Ministry of Science and Technology and other departments, set up a 500 billion yuan re-lending facility to support scientific and technological innovation and technological transformation. Since relevant policies were issued, -as of November 15, banks have signed loan contracts with 1,737 enterprises and projects totaling nearly 400 billion yuan-. The report says that financial institutions have made independent decisions on these loans. For the loans that meet the requirements, the PBOC can issue re-lending funds to financial institutions amounting to 60% of the loan principal. The report adds: -In line with the meeting's directives, banking institutions will fully leverage policy resources to comprehensively support listed enterprises and projects, ensuring maximum coverage of financial support. They will focus on improving the efficiency of loan review and disbursement, optimizing mechanisms and processes, enhancing resource allocation, revising and refining credit management policies based on the latest industrial policy standards, establishing a ‘green channel' for loan review and approval, and developing loan products that better align with the financing needs of startup technology companies and small-to-medium-sized enterprises undergoing technological transformation. This includes expanding the range of acceptable collateral and accelerating loan signing and investment timelines. The PBOC's branch offices will work closely with relevant government departments, strategically directing more support towards private and small-to-medium enterprises. By implementing nuanced, targeted approaches, they aim to enhance the efficiency of financial institution-business interactions and create a more supportive environment for financial services.- ，，-、-；，，，，--，，，。，，，.

Preventing Food Waste - Li Qiang Meets CEOs on Supply Chain Stability - Coordinating Development & Security - CPC-CEEC Political Parties Dialogue	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Tuesday, November 26, 2024. Page 1: There's a report on the publication of the full action plan for food conservation and the reduction of food waste is published in the paper today. The plan seeks to establish a more sound long-term mechanism by the end of 2027. Xinhua reports that: -The loss rates of grain and food during their production, storage, transportation and processing will be below the average international levels by the end of 2027. Meanwhile, per capita food waste per meal in the catering industry, government canteens, school canteens and enterprise canteens will decrease significantly, and food waste will be effectively curbed.- I am not detailing the entire document. But I thought this was interesting, because it identifies certain incentives to encourage reduced consumption. -Encourage consumers to purchase small-portion meals through methods such as establishing environmental protection virtual accounts, granting conservation points, and issuing discount coupons, etc. Support food producers, operators, retailers and others to directly donate food that meets safety and quality requirements to welfare institutions and assistance institutions in their locality on a regular basis. Strictly implement price tagging regulations, with catering service operators clearly indicating to consumers the prices of the catering and services provided, as well as prices of individual dishes within set meals. Encourage catering service operators hosting banquets to negotiate anti-food waste obligations with consumers, with contracts able to include a separate anti-waste clause.- 、、。、、。，、。，. The document also calls to -make food conservation an important part of the life of the Communist Youth League and the Young Pioneers-, as part of a campaign of Youth Guarding China's Grain. In addition, it calls to -integrate food security education and thrift education into ideological and political courses, national conditions education and other educational and teaching activities in primary, secondary and high schools…- --，、，--，。、、，、，，、. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, a report on the page informs that the Arabic language version of a book featuring discourses on Chinese modernization by President Xi Jinping has been published by the Central Compilation and Translation Press. The book collects a series of important discourses by Xi between November 2012 and October 2023. Third, there's a report with Li Qiang's comments at a symposium with representatives of enterprises and organizations participating in the upcoming second China International Supply Chain Expo. Xinhua says that present at the symposium were representatives of Apple Inc., Rio Tinto, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd. and the US-China Business Council, among others. Li told them that -China is a key link in the global supply chain and will continue to take practical actions to maintain the stability and smoothness of the global supply chain.- He added that -while global economic growth now lacks momentum, certain protectionist acts and moves that overstretch the concept of security continue to damage global industrial and supply chains, pushing up corporate costs further, reducing economic efficiency and hindering common development…Li called for firm efforts to safeguard stable, unimpeded global industrial and supply chains, as well as the common interests of all parties.- He then said: -Since the beginning of this year, China's economic operation has been generally stable and steady. We will continue to increase counter-cyclical adjustments, promote the continued improvement of China's economy, continuously cultivate and strengthen new momentum, and solidly promote high-quality development, so as to contribute more to deepening global supply chain cooperation and promoting global economic recovery. We will accelerate the construction of a modern industrial system, and continue to provide solid support for the efficient operation of the global supply chain with stronger supporting capabilities and more stable production capacity supply. We will focus on strengthening the deep integration of scientific and technological innovation and industrial innovation, better integrate into international innovation cooperation, and continue to provide strong momentum for the transformation and upgrading of the global supply chain. We will firmly promote high-level opening up to the outside world, further expand market access, welcome more foreign companies to carry out industrial cooperation in China, and continue to provide a broad space for the expansion of global supply chain cooperation.- ，，。，、，，，，，、。，、，。，，。，，，.

As reported on Page 1, Bettel also met with Ding Xuexiang and with ILD chief Liu Jianchao. Xinhua's report on the Wang-Bettel meeting says: -China speaks highly of Luxembourg's positive and practical policy toward China, and stands ready to work with Luxembourg to consolidate political mutual trust, enhance complementarity, create new growth points for green development cooperation, increase people-to-people exchanges and push for further progress in bilateral relations, he said. Wang noted that next year marks the 50th anniversary of China-EU diplomatic relations. China and the EU are partners not rivals, he said, expressing the hope that the EU side will uphold its strategic autonomy. China is willing to work with Luxembourg to promote the sustained and sound development of China-EU relations, Wang said. Bettel said that Luxembourg firmly adheres to the one-China principle and looks forward to closer cooperation with China. As one of the founding members of the EU, Luxembourg is willing to enhance EU-China mutual trust and promote EU-China partnership. Bettel noted that China is a major country worthy of trust, voicing the hope that China will play a bigger role in world peace and stability.- Next, there's a report on the CPC's Dialogue with Political Parties of Central and Eastern European Countries. Xinhua reports: -Noting that the 2021 China-CEEC Summit outlined a blueprint for the development of China-CEEC relations, Liu Jianchao, head of the International Department of the CPC Central Committee, said that the CPC is willing to work with CEEC political parties to deepen strategic and theoretical communication, tap into the potential of relevant cooperation platforms, and promote the quality and effectiveness of China-CEEC cooperation. The foreign attendees said that China's development path has provided an alternative approach to development for the world, and that they are willing to strengthen exchange and dialogue with the CPC to enhance mutual understanding, and to promote the development of Europe-China relations. The event was themed ‘China's Modernization and New Opportunities for China-CEEC Relations: Contribution of Political Parties' and attracted nearly 50 representatives of 19 political parties in 12 countries across Central and Eastern Europe.- Finally, there's a report on He Lifeng's meeting with Senior Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong in Suzhou. Xinhua says: He said that -the two sides should focus on the new positioning of bilateral relations, make full use of cooperation platforms such as the Suzhou Industrial Park, and work together to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries. Noting that Singapore-China relations have been deepening with strong development momentum under the guidance of the two countries' top leaders, Lee said Singapore is willing to work with China to push for new development in major cooperative projects, and further consolidate and upgrade bilateral relations. The two senior officials also attended the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park High-Quality Development Forum on Monday. The two sides comprehensively reviewed the achievements of the park in the past 30 years, and mapped out the direction and focus of cooperation for its next stage. They agreed the two countries should give better play to the pioneering role of the park, deepen institutional reform, and work together to build a world-class science and technology park that is open and innovative. They also witnessed the signing of cooperation documents.- Leave a comment Page 9: There's an article by He Yiting, from the Research Center for Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era of the Central Party School, discussing the significance of national security. He writes that: -In a certain sense, the history of human social development is also the history of human efforts to achieve and satisfy security needs, and to promote societal development in relative stability. Security also reflects the level of human civilization, especially at the national and social levels, where humans increasingly view security as the foundation of civilizational progress. It is precisely this concept of security that motivates human society as a whole to continuously pursue tranquility, stability, and peace, striving to eliminate various conflicts, chaos, and disorder. Security is like air and sunlight - beneficial without being noticed, but difficult to survive without.- ，、。，，。、，、。，，. National security is the foundation of national rejuvenation and an important cornerstone of stabilizing the country. With the deepening of economic globalization and the development of human civilization, the connotation and extension of security are constantly expanding. Today, national security mainly refers to the state power, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity, people's well-being, sustainable economic and social development and other major interests of the country being relatively free from danger and internal and external threats, as well as the ability to guarantee such a continuous state of security. National security is not only the goal pursued by all the people, but also an important foundation for national development and the fundamental guarantee for the happiness and well-being of the people. ，。，。，、、、、，。，. Subscribe now In the second section, He adds that -one of the keys to achieving modernization is to properly handle the relationship between development and security-; -high-quality development must promote high-level security, and high-level security must be used to ensure high-quality development-. He adds: -Development is the foundation and purpose of security. Only by continuously promoting high-quality development can there be a solid material foundation for people to live and work in peace, for society to be stable and orderly, and for the country to enjoy long-term peace and security, and only then can powerful force support for achieving high-level security be provided. Security is the condition and guarantee of development. If a country cannot hold its security baseline, its political regime may be overturned at any time, its core interests may be invaded at any time, and economic and social development may be interrupted or stagnate at any time. Adhering to the equal emphasis on development and security must mean adhering to the overall planning of development and security as two major matters, being adept at using development achievements to reinforce the strength foundation of national security, and being adept at shaping a security environment favorable to economic and social development. At present, China has entered a period prone to various contradictions and risks. Advancing Chinese-style modernization requires balancing development and security, focusing on resolving various contradictions and problems, and effectively fighting a strategic proactive battle to turn dangers into safety and crises into opportunities.- 。，、、，。。，，，。，，，。，，，，、. This next bit is important: -Achieving high-quality development is the essential requirement of Chinese-style modernization. Development is the Party's top priority in governing and rejuvenating the country. Without the improvement of material conditions through development, it would be impossible to achieve the remarkable accomplishments of Chinese-style modernization, let alone gain broad support from the people. Properly handling the relationship between development and security means we cannot discuss security without development, nor can we halt development due to the existence of risks. Our country is the largest developing nation in the world, and development is the foundation and key to solving all problems. On the new journey, resolving prominent contradictions and problems and preventing and defusing various risks ultimately rely on development. Only by promoting the sustained and healthy development of the economy and society can we lay a solid material foundation for the prosperity of the country, the happiness and well-being of the people, and the harmony and stability of society. This requires the complete, accurate and comprehensive implementation of the new development concept, adhering to the general tone of work of seeking progress while maintaining stability, taking the promotion of high-quality development as the theme, deepening supply-side structural reform as the main line, reform and innovation as the fundamental driving force, and meeting the people's growing needs for a better life as the fundamental purpose, constantly enhancing China's economic strength, scientific and technological strength, and comprehensive national strength, and providing a more solid foundation and conditions for achieving higher levels and higher levels of security.- 。。，，。，，。，。，，，。，、、。、、，，，，，，、、，. Achieving high-level security is an important guarantee of Chinese-style modernization. Ensuring people live and work in peace and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation are inseparable from high-level security guarantees. High-level security is both an inherent requirement of achieving high-quality development and an important yardstick for measuring developmental effectiveness. Without high-level security guarantees, development is like a tree without roots, and the development achievements already made in modernization construction may be lost. With the high-quality advancement of Chinese-style modernization and the continuous expansion of high-level opening up, various foreseeable and unforeseeable risk factors have increased significantly. We must enhance awareness of opportunities and risks, estimate difficulties more fully, think about risks more deeply, grasp contradictions more comprehensively and thoroughly, strengthen foundations, leverage advantages, make up for shortcomings, and reinforce weaknesses in the process of advancing Chinese-style modernization, effectively preventing and responding to potential systemic risks, and guaranteeing the continuous stability of high-quality development through the controllability of one's own security. We must be adept at integrating various conditions and utilizing diverse resources, effectively identifying risk factors across broad spatial and temporal dimensions, reasonably allocating resources between security and development, clarifying the methods for addressing and resolving national security issues, and effectively safeguarding national security.- 。、，。，。，，。、，。，，，，、、、，，。、，，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily In the final section, He writes that to effectively address the challenges of this era, one must adhere to the -overall national security concept as the fundamental guideline, better coordinate development and security, solidly promote the modernization of the national security system and capabilities, strive to build a higher level of safe China, and provide strong security guarantees for Chinese-style modernization.- ，，，，，. He makes three points: First, implement the overall national security concept. He calls this -a powerful ideological weapon and action guide for safeguarding and shaping- China's security. He says that it is important to -integrate the maintenance of national security into all aspects of the work of the Party and the state-. -Adhering to the Party's absolute leadership over national security work is the fundamental principle for ensuring the success of national security efforts and the fundamental guarantee for safeguarding national security and social stability. We must uphold the Party's absolute leadership over national security work, prioritize the prevention and resolution of national security risks, and coordinate the advancement of security across various domains. We must adhere to the principle of people-centered security as our purpose, political security as the foundation, economic security as the basis, and military, technological, cultural, and social security as safeguards, and promote international security as the support, integrating external and internal security, territorial and citizen security, traditional and non-traditional security, self-security and collective security, coordinate the maintenance and shaping of national security, consolidate the grassroots foundation of national security and social stability, improve the mechanism for participating in global security governance, and safeguard the new development pattern with a new security pattern.- ，，。，，。、、、、，、、、，，，，. Second, establish the correct thinking for maintaining national security. It is necessary to establish the strategic awareness of ‘a game of chess', base ourselves on China and look to the world, and effectively respond to the new situations, new problems and new challenges brought about by the changes in the domestic and international environments by coordinating the domestic and international situations and utilizing domestic and international resources. Adhere to using systematic thinking to grasp the main thread of national security work, comprehensively analyzing security issues and their mutual influences in multiple domains such as politics, military, economy, finance, culture, society, science and technology, network, food, and ecology, placing various types of security within the overall national development framework for coordinated planning, continuously enhancing the ability to shape national security situations, coordinating the relationship between high-quality development and high-level security, promoting linkage and integration of national security work in all aspects, jointly constructing a comprehensive security pattern. Adhere to bottom line thinking and extreme-case thinking, be prepared for danger in times of peace, and use high-probability thinking to deal with low-probability events, having both proactive risk prevention and high-level strategies for responding to and resolving risks and challenges, fighting a well-prepared battle to prevent and resist risks, firmly maintaining the bottom line of not allowing systemic risks to occur. Adhere to using legal thinking and legal means to consolidate ruling position, improve governing methods, enhance governing capabilities, better leveraging the fundamental, stabilizing, and far-reaching guarantee role of rule of law, ensuring long-term peace and stability for the Party and the country, guaranteeing orderly advancement of Chinese-style modernization through comprehensive rule of law. Adhere to dialectical thinking, enhance national security strength through development, and deepen the innovation of national security ideas, systems, and means, create a safe environment conducive to economic and social development, and strive to achieve a dynamic balance between development and security. 。--，、，、，。，、、、、、、、、、，，，，，。，、，，，，，。、、，、、，，。，，、、，，. Third, promote the modernization of the national security system and capabilities. In this context, He calls to -strengthen the coordination mechanism for national security work, improve the national security legal system, strategic system, policy system, and risk monitoring and early warning system, improve the security guarantee system in key areas and the coordination and command system for important projects, and build a coordinated and efficient national security protection system.- ，，、、、，，. He also calls to improve public security governance mechanism, emergency response guarantee system, improve the food and drug safety responsibility system, improve the biosafety supervision early warning and prevention and control system, strengthen the network security system construction, and establish an AI safety supervision system. He also wants to improve the Fengqiao Experience in the new era, social work system and mechanism, the legalization of petition work, urban social governance capacity, and social organization management system. The final bit is this: -Improve foreign-related national security mechanisms, establish and refine coordination mechanisms for peripheral security work, strengthen early warning, prevention, control, and protection systems for risks related to overseas interests and investments, deepen international law enforcement cooperation in the field of security, safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of our citizens and legal entities abroad, improve mechanisms for counter-sanctions, counter-interference, and countering ‘long-arm jurisdiction', enhance mechanisms for safeguarding maritime rights and interests, and improve mechanisms for participating in global security governance.- ，，、、，，、，、、--，，.

Messages from Xi's APEC, G20 Visits - Discussing the Building of the Chinese Discourse and Narrative System	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, November 25, 2024. Page 1: Today's front page carries two feature articles discussing Xi's trips to Peru and Brazil. The first article talks about his visit to Lima for the APEC summit. It says that: -The diplomatic footprints of this great Eastern power demonstrate its pioneering and enterprising spirit, its vision and responsibility, and reflect its growing international influence, appeal and shaping power.- The first part of the article talks about some of the key developments: China-Peru ties were upgraded to a comprehensive strategic partnership. Since Xi's last visit to Peru in 2016, bilateral trade volume has increased by 1.6 times, and the stock of Chinese companies' investment in Peru has doubled, bringing tangible benefits to the people of both countries. 15 years ago, Peru became the first Latin American country to sign a package of FTAs with China. During this visit, the two sides formally signed the protocol to upgrade the free trade agreement. The two heads of state attended the opening ceremony of the Port of Chancay. The second part deals with APEC: The article reiterates that economic globalisation was the theme of Xi's speech. It quotes this bit from Xi's speech: -Economic globalization is an objective requirement of growing social productive forces. It is a natural outcome of advancement in science and technology and a mighty historical trend. Despite headwinds and undertows, economic globalization has always been the general trend. The attempt to block economic cooperation under all sorts of pretexts and break up the interdependence of the world is nothing but backpedaling. Economic globalization is caught now in a tug of war between driving and obstructive forces, but the driving forces still prevail.- And this: -We should steer economic globalization in the right direction. We must reject the beaten path that a few countries have taken to pursue dominance and hegemony. We should see to it that economic globalization generates more positive outcomes and is taken to a new phase that is more dynamic, inclusive and sustainable.- There's this quote when talking about economic globalisation: -The world watches and sighs: -China is the true leader of openness and cooperation- ... -Chairman Xi makes us feel China's stability and reliability- … -The world needs leaders like Chairman Xi-... ，：------… The final section deals with Xi's bilateral meetings, beginning with the meeting with Biden. The article says: Over the past 4 years, although China-US relations have experienced ups and downs, they have also carried out dialogue and cooperation, and overall achieved stability. 4，，，. President Xi listed seven experiences and inspirations that the two countries should draw from the course of their relations, i.e., to have a correct strategic perception, match words with actions, treat each other as equals, not to challenge red lines and paramount principles, conduct more dialogue and cooperation, respond to the expectations of the people, and step forward to shoulder the responsibilities of major countries. ，7：，、，，、，，，. The report adds: -The dust has settled on the US election, and the world is paying close attention to the future direction of China-US relations. ‘China is willing to continue to maintain dialogue, expand cooperation, and manage differences with the US government, and strive to achieve a smooth transition in China-US relations for the benefit of the people of both countries', President Xi Jinping clarified his position. ，。-、、，，。-. It also talks about Xi's argument for the four unchanged: China's goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged. Its commitment to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation as principles for handling China-U.S. relations remains unchanged. Its position of resolutely safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests remains unchanged. And its desire to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples remains unchanged.- The piece then talks about Xi's other bilateral meetings. It ends with this: -Each dazzling achievement in cooperation makes the world more certain that China is not only an ancient civilization, but also an opportunity for prosperity and a model for development. Each firm policy declaration also makes the Asia-Pacific and the world more convinced that ‘the next ‘China' will still be China'. Listen to these Chinese voices resonating on the grand stage of Asia-Pacific cooperation: ‘China will comprehensively deepen reform and continue to inject strong momentum into the global economy'; ‘China will promote high-quality development and continue to lead the world economy in improving quality and efficiency'; ‘China will unswervingly follow the path of green development and continue to provide important momentum for global green transformation'; ‘China will build a new system of open economy at a higher level and continue to share China's development opportunities with the world'; ‘China welcomes all parties to continue riding China's development express train, develop together with China's economy, and work together to achieve modernization of all countries in the world characterized by peaceful development, mutual benefit and cooperation, and common prosperity' ... Some scholars point out that unlike the historical ‘rise of great powers', China's development is the rise of a ‘civilizational state'. Having seen so many landscapes and experienced so many storms, Chinese civilization has, over more than 5,000 years, forged a progressive spirit, an inclusive mindset, and an unwavering belief in peaceful development.- ，，，、。，，-‘'，-。：-，-；-，-；-，-；-，-；-，，、、-……，--，--。，，5000，、、. The second article deals with the G20 summit in Rio. The first section talks about poverty alleviation and covers Xi's speech in which he talks about It says that China's achievements provide -accumulation of poverty alleviation experience and innovation in poverty reduction methods- along with giving the Global South -confidence and hope from China's story.- ，、，--，. Share Tracking People's Daily The second section says that in his other speech, Xi made the -most systematic and complete exposition on the issue of global governance reform.- The article adds: -Every step is a choice for the future. In the face of increasingly intense competition between economic globalisation and anti-globalisation, the world expects the G20 to make the right choice: continuously promoting the liberalisation and facilitation of trade and investment, avoiding the politicisation of economic issues and the artificial fragmentation of global markets, and refraining from using the banner of green and low-carbon initiatives to implement protectionism ... These voices are not only China's proposals but have also become a harmonious chorus gathering strength from more and more contributors.- ，。，G20。，、，、……，，. It adds: -Looking around the world today, governance deficits are often closely related to fairness deficits. The international balance of power has undergone profound changes, and the long-delayed reform of the global governance system is imperative … China firmly advocates guiding the reform of global governance with the principles of fairness and justice. ‘Building a just world requires the G20 to uphold the principles of mutual respect, equal cooperation, and win-win outcomes, supporting the ‘Global South' countries in achieving greater development. Within and beyond the venue, the resonance and support for China's proposals are unceasing…- ，。，，。，。：-，、、，‘'。-，：---，-……，，-，-. The next few sections simply recap Xi's bilateral meetings. I've covered those over the past week. Next, there's a report on the publication of a new book on Xi's discourses on law-based governance of the military. Xinhua says: -The discourses were excerpted from speeches and written works by Xi between November 2012 and June 2024. The CMC has urged military officers and soldiers at all levels to thoroughly study the book and especially required senior officers to play an exemplary role in respecting, learning about, observing and applying laws.- As this Economist article notes, data from China Media Project shows that in his first decade in power, around 120 volumes of Xi's discourses have been published. Subscribe now Page 3: There's a report on the BRI emergency rescue drill for Pacific Island countries being held in Jiangmen City, Guangdong, on Sunday. A total of 300 participants, including emergency rescue teams from 8 Pacific Island countries and Chinese rescue teams took part in the drill. Subscribe now Page 9: The entire page is dedicated to articles drawn from the Fifth High-End Forum on Chinese Discourse, which was held in Jinan, Shandong Province. This was organised by the Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era Research Center at the Central Party School, the School of Marxism of the Central Party School, Chinese Marxism Research Foundation, and Shandong University. The first piece is by Hao Lixin from the School of Philosophy at Renmin University of China. Hao writes: -Accelerating the construction of the Chinese discourse and narrative system is an inevitable requirement of advancing Chinese-style modernization, an urgent necessity for enhancing the international influence of Chinese culture, and an important manifestation of the developmental laws of modern civilization. This profoundly reflects the dialectical relationship between cognition and practice, and embodies the adherence to and development of Marxist epistemology.- ，，，。，. -The Chinese discourse and Chinese narrative system is a cultural expression based on Chinese practice. The discourse system mainly refers to the cognitive relationships between expression, interpretation, evaluation and acceptance, understanding, recognition that people establish through linguistic symbols in practice and cultural exchange, including two basic aspects of discourse content and form, specifically manifested as certain thoughts, viewpoints, concepts and modes of expression. The narrative system mainly refers to the sum of narrative processes, narrative elements and narrative methods for certain objects, texts, and facts. The Chinese discourse and Chinese narrative system, based on Chinese practice, has distinctive Chinese characteristics, Chinese style, and Chinese manner, possessing both significant national character and prominent global character.- 。，、、、、，，、、。、、、。，、、，，. Hao adds: -Why should we construct Chinese discourse and Chinese narrative system, and how should we construct Chinese discourse and Chinese narrative system? The answer lies in the practice of Chinese-style modernization, in the interactive relationship between China and the world, and in the development process of mutual influence between Chinese civilization and world civilization. Engels pointed out: ‘Civilization is a matter of practice.' In the process of creating a new form of human civilization and in further opening up to the outside world, China's connection with the world is becoming closer and cultural exchanges are increasingly frequent. Practical development requires us to present a true, multi-dimensional, and comprehensive China to the world, and better express and contribute Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions. However, in reality, our international communication still faces problems such as insufficient appeal and influence in the construction of discourse and narrative systems. Facing modernization, facing the world, and facing the future are important directions for constructing China's discourse and narrative system; responding to issues of modernization, world issues, and future issues are important topics in constructing China's discourse and narrative system; better adapting to the needs of practical development and civilizational exchange and mutual learning, focusing on enhancing the appeal and influence of discourse and narrative, are important tasks in constructing China's discourse and narrative system.- 。，？，，。：--。，，，，、、，。，、。、、，；、，；、，、，. Hao also says that -Accurately and concisely summarising and expressing Chinese practices and experiences, and telling China's story well, is aimed at enabling the world to comprehensively and authentically understand China's development and the changes in the lives of the Chinese people, to grasp Chinese-style modernization and the new forms of human civilization, and to create favourable conditions for both China's development and global progress.- 、，，，，. Subscribe now In the second section, Hao calls for -highlighting cultural subjectivity- when constructing the Chinese discourse and narrative system. In this context, he calls to: Adhere to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Culture, strengthen cultural confidence, uphold openness and tolerance, and adhere to the principle of maintaining integrity while pursuing innovation. Strengthening cultural confidence is specifically manifested in adhering to one's own path, achieving independence in spirit and discourse, and taking the construction of an independent knowledge system of Chinese philosophy and social sciences as the theoretical basis for building Chinese discourse and Chinese narrative system. Adhering to openness and tolerance is reflected in maintaining a broad mind and looking at the world, and treating all the outstanding achievements of human civilization with an open mind. Adhering to the principle of maintaining integrity while pursuing innovation is reflected in adhering to the position of Chinese culture, inheriting the genes of Chinese culture, and constantly exploring and innovating in light of new situations and new problems on the basis of adhering to the path of socialist cultural development with Chinese characteristics, and constantly achieving new breakthroughs in building Chinese discourse and Chinese narrative system. ，、、。，，，。，、，。，，，，、，. Adopt different discourse methods, narrative methods, and carrier channels based on different objects and different situations, and vividly present the Chinese-style modernization that leads the trend in the process of world modernization and the Chinese civilization that shines in the world's garden of civilization. ，，、、，、. Understand that -generally speaking, the construction of discourse and narrative systems in international communication and cultural exchange should possess characteristics of objectivity, uniqueness, specificity, compatibility, complementarity, and vividness. Among these, objectivity mainly refers to authenticity, which is the prerequisite for discourse and narrative to have influence. Uniqueness mainly refers to the cultural characteristics formed by different ethnic groups and countries in the long historical evolution. Specificity mainly implies that discourse and narrative should be concrete and clear, rather than remaining at the level of empty language and abstract grand narratives. Compatibility mainly refers to the fact that both parties in cultural exchange should be easily understood by each other in terms of discourse semantics, narrative content and form, and should be able to generate a certain resonance in expression. Complementarity mainly refers to discourse and narrative between different subjects should have commensurability and mutual benefit. Vividness mainly refers to in the narrative process, there should be both rational exposition and emotional expression.- ，，、、、、、。，，。。，。、，。。，。 In the final section, Hao says: To build the Chinese discourse and narrative system, we need to follow the law of cognitive development. On this basis, we can refine the iconic concepts of Chinese discourse and grasp the key contents of Chinese narrative. The series of iconic concepts and original viewpoints contained in Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, such as ‘community of human destiny', ‘common values ​​of all mankind' and ‘new form of human civilization', provide scientific guidelines and practical examples for building Chinese discourse and narrative system. ，，，。------、，. To build a Chinese discourse and a Chinese narrative system, it is important to tell the story of Chinese-style modernization well…and make clear the historical inevitability, distinctive features and global significance of Chinese-style modernization, and that Chinese-style modernization is a major innovation in world modernization. ，，、，、，。 -Demonstrate the outstanding inclusiveness of Chinese civilization…Openness and inclusiveness are the cultural genes of the Chinese nation, and inclusiveness is the outstanding characteristic of Chinese civilization. In building the Chinese discourse and narrative system, it is necessary to deeply grasp the characteristics of the coexistence and integration of human civilization, highlight the remarkable inclusiveness of Chinese civilization, and showcase the values and ideas contained in Chinese culture, Chinese wisdom, and Chinese solutions, such as harmony without uniformity, and seeking common ground while reserving differences, and the profound wisdom of ‘all things grow together without harming each other, and all paths run parallel without contradicting each other'.- 。。、、，、，、。，。，、，，、、、，-，-。 In building the Chinese discourse and narrative system, it is important to grasp the logic, focus the narrative on people living in a community of shared future for mankind, take the personal feelings, real situations and common expectations of people from different countries and cultures in life as the entry point and foothold, integrate the values ​​generally accepted by the people into the construction of Chinese discourse and Chinese narrative system, and continuously enhance the empathy and appeal of the Chinese discourse and narrative system. ，，，、、，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's an article by Hu Daping from the School of Philosophy at Nanjing University. Hu writes about the principle of learning while keeping the world in mind. Hu laments, and I agree with this lament: -Today, China is increasingly approaching the centre of the world stage, and our international discourse power and cultural soft power continue to strengthen. The system of disciplines in our philosophy and social sciences is constantly improving, the research team is continuously growing, and the level of research and innovation capabilities is consistently advancing, with its influence in the international academic community and global society steadily increasing. In this process, the global vision of Chinese philosophy and social science workers is continuously expanding, and the spirit of openness is increasingly enhanced. Significant research achievements at the forefront of international academia have been made in many fields. At the same time, some issues and phenomena in domestic academia also require attention. For instance, some scholars are accustomed to ‘closing the door' to do their research, and they do not pay enough attention to new things, new phenomena, and new trends in the outside world, and lack the interest and awareness of deepening research. Some scholars become engrossed in obscure and cumbersome conceptual constructions, failing to explain clearly to themselves and making it difficult for others to understand, thus losing the openness and accessibility that philosophical and social science research should have. In reality, the so-called ‘world' is not an abstract and isolated existence. It manifests as the world where people coexist under the same sky, it manifests as people of the world pursuing a better life, and it manifests as vibrant, lively common practices. Without engaging with fresh and vivid life, and being confined to the mere words and phrases in books, the academic research loses the ‘liveliness' and practicality it should have. Without this, there can be no world in one's sight, and no ‘world' in one's heart, making the idea of doing research with a global perspective impossible to talk about.- ，，、。，，，。，、，。，，，--，、、，；，、，、。，--，，，。，，--，，，. Hu subsequently calls for adhering to -people-centred research orientation- and to recognize and understand the traditional culture of different nations. More importantly, Hu writes: -Adhering to doing scholarly work with a global perspective does not mean pursuing or catering to so-called ‘universality'. Instead, it involves approaching research with confidence and awareness of ‘what makes me, me' (what defines or constitutes one's unique self) while firmly upholding cultural and academic subjectivity. On this foundation, it seeks to understand and grasp the relationship between oneself and the external world, to discern regularity from universality and diversity from particularity. Through learning from and absorbing all the outstanding achievements of human civilization, it aims to safeguard Marxism as the spiritual core and China's excellent traditional culture as the foundational root, thereby promoting and developing philosophy and social sciences with Chinese characteristics.- ，--，--，，，、，，，.

Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: There's a report (English report) on Vice Premier He Lifeng meeting with Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser. He told her that -China is deepening the reform of its financial system and continuing to expand the high-level, two-way opening-up of its financial sector. China welcomes more foreign financial institutions and long-term capital, including Citigroup, to invest and do business in China, and to share opportunities and participate in the development of the country's financial market.- As per Xinhua, -Fraser said that Citigroup is optimistic about the prospects of China's economy and financial market, and is willing to explore the Chinese market further, contributing to the promotion of U.S.-China economic and trade cooperation and maintaining the healthy development of the global economy.- Next, there's a report on China, Brazil, South Africa and the African Union launching the Initiative on International Cooperation in Open Science. Xinhua says: -The initiative also aims to promote global scientific and technological innovation to benefit the Global South. It notes that the open and sustainable sci-tech innovation is conducive to enhancing the strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth of the global economy. The initiative proposes that governments, scientific communities, enterprises, non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders should support the free flow of sci-tech innovation personnel and resources on a global scale, and ensure that different stakeholders can equitably participate in and are treated fairly in the open science cause. Scientific knowledge should be publicly available, according to the initiative, which also states that scientific practices should be diverse, inclusive and sustainable. The initiative says that governments of all countries should increase investment in open science and encourage the cooperation, joint construction and sharing of major scientific research infrastructure.- Share Tracking People's Daily Third, there's a report on Defense Minister Dong Jun's speech at the ASEAN Defense Ministers' Plus Meeting. -The Asia-Pacific region remains generally stable, but the risk of being drawn into geopolitical conflicts is a real possibility. The strategic choices we make today will affect the future safety and well-being of the region and its people. All countries should join hands and work together to safeguard our shared beautiful homeland. Dong Jun stated that China is willing to work with all parties to resolutely consolidate ASEAN's central position, firmly support the improvement and upgrading of existing cooperation frameworks, and oppose ‘creating a new architecture' or forming ‘exclusive cliques'. China is committed to firmly maintain unity among regional countries, oppose bringing bloc politics and camp confrontation into the region. China firmly supports resolving problems through dialogue, opposes provoking disputes, resorting to force, ganging up together or even bringing in external forces. China is dedicated to deepen defense and security cooperation, promote the implementation of the Global Security Initiative in the region, and build a closer security community. In particular, China and ASEAN should take a long-term view to expand common maritime interests, conduct flexible and diverse maritime security cooperation, enhance joint capacity to maintain maritime security, and contribute to maintaining regional and even world peace and stability.- ，。。，。，，，，--、--。，、。，、、。，，。，，，. Subscribe now Dong also met with the defense ministers of India, Malaysia and New Zealand. There was no meeting between Dong and US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Beijing's official reasoning was as follows: -Senior Colonel Wu pointed out that the US can't damage China's core interests on the Taiwan question while seeking to communicate with the Chinese military as if nothing has happened. ‘It is imperative for the US to immediately correct its mistake, earnestly respect China's core interests, and strive to create favorable conditions for high-level exchanges between the two militaries.- (Note: This is clearly bunkum. It appears that Beijing wants to set new baselines for military talks with the incoming Trump administration. This likely is a step towards that.) The US Defense Secretary said: -It's unfortunate. It affects the region because the region really wants to see us, you know, two significant players in the region, two significant powers, talk to each other…I don't think that it has any sort of implications for the future. I just think that it's something that they chose to do at this point in time and only they can explain why they chose to not take advantage of a good opportunity.- Anyway, Dong did meet India's Defense Minister Rajnath Singh. I have not been able to locate a substantive Chinese readout. The Indian readout from that meeting says: -This was the first meeting of the two Defence Ministers following the recent disengagement agreements, and the meeting of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi &amp; Chinese President Mr Xi Jinping on the sidelines of BRICS summit. Raksha Mantri highlighted the fact that amicable relations between India and China, the two largest nations in the world, would have positive implications for global peace and prosperity. Considering that both countries are and will continue to remain neighbours, he mentioned that ‘we need to focus on cooperation rather than conflict'. Shri Rajnath Singh called for reflecting on the lessons learnt from the unfortunate border clashes of 2020, take measures to prevent recurrence of such events and safeguard peace and tranquility along the India-China border. He emphasised and looked forward to greater trust and confidence building between the two sides through de-escalation. Both sides agreed to work together towards a roadmap for rebuilding mutual trust and understanding.- Finally, there's a report on the 14th China-ASEAN Defense Ministers' Informal Meeting. The report says: -Dong Jun said that in recent years, under the strategic guidance of leaders from both sides, China-ASEAN security cooperation has not only benefited both parties but also the region and even the world. Regardless of how the international situation evolves, China will unswervingly work with ASEAN to strengthen solidarity and mutual trust, deepen practical cooperation, promote Eastern wisdom, properly manage differences, and always be good partners who share safety and risks and support each other. Maritime issues concern the common interests of all parties and require adopting a long-term strategic perspective, steadily advancing maritime security cooperation, and striving to transform contradictions and challenges into opportunities for cooperation.- ，，，—，。，，，，，，、。，，，. Dong also met with Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani. Kyodo reports: -Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told his Chinese counterpart, Dong Jun, that he is ‘seriously concerned' about the intensifying military activities near Japan, as they met in Laos months after an airspace breach involving a Chinese spy plane. Nakatani lodged a stern protest with China over the violation of Japan's airspace on Aug. 26 and demanded that it not be repeated, according to Japanese officials. However, the two agreed to promote dialogue between their defense authorities to foster ‘mutually beneficial' relations, as recently agreed by the countries' leaders. Noting that the two countries have various outstanding security issues, Nakatani said at the outset of the meeting, which was held on the sidelines of an annual regional security meeting, ‘It is extremely important to hold candid discussions between defense authorities and continue communications.' Dong agreed that face-to-face discussions between the two countries' defense authorities are important for the bilateral relationship and regional peace. However, he countered that China is concerned about Japan's actions on issues such as Taiwan, which Beijing views as a renegade province.- Share Tracking People's Daily First, the Ministry of Commerce issued a new notice with measures to support foreign trade. These include: First, insurance companies are encouraged to increase underwriting support for ‘little giant' and ‘hidden champion' firms in their efforts to expand to diversified markets, according to the notice. ‘Little giants' refer to the novel elites of China's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are engaged in manufacturing, specialising in a niche market and boasting cutting-edge technologies. ‘Hidden champions' refer to highly successful yet lesser-known SMEs that are global leaders in terms of market share in their respective niches. Second, banking institutions should continuously optimise financial services for foreign trade enterprises in areas such as credit approval, loan disbursement, and repayment while ensuring rigorous verification of trade authenticity and effective risk management. Third, financial institutions are encouraged to increase financing support for micro, small and medium-sized companies based on market-oriented and law-based principles, said the notice. Fourth, efforts should be made to optimise cross-border trade settlement, promote the development of cross-border e-commerce, expand agricultural product exports, and support the imports of key equipment and energy resources. Second, Xinhua reports that -China's Ministry of Public Security on Thursday declared that all large-scale telecom fraud centers located near the China-Myanmar border in northern Myanmar had been wiped out. Over 53,000 Chinese nationals suspected of telecom frauds have been arrested with cooperative efforts from Chinese and Myanmar police since the ministry launched a crackdown on telecom frauds in northern Myanmar last year, the ministry said in a statement. In a recent coup, 1,079 telecom fraud suspects were arrested in northern Myanmar's Tangyan area for the first time. The suspects were caught during a joint operation by police of southwest China's Yunnan Province and local law enforcers of Myanmar. All of the 763 Chinese citizens among them have been handed over to China, the ministry said, calling the operation another breakthrough in the crackdown campaign. According to the statement, China's public security bodies will continue to maintain high pressure in the crackdown on cross-border telecom fraud, especially in areas where scam dens are concentrated.- Third, there's a report on the second meeting of the China-Saudi Arabia-Iran Trilateral Joint Committee held in Riyadh on November 19. The readout says: -Saudi Arabia and Iran reaffirmed their commitment to all provisions of the Beijing Agreement, and their continued efforts to consolidate good-neighborly and friendly relations between the two countries by adhering to the United Nations Charter, the Charter of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and international law, including respecting national sovereignty, independence and security…The current escalation of regional tensions will have serious consequences for regional and global security. Against this backdrop, it is very important for senior officials from Saudi Arabia and Iran to engage in contacts, meetings, and mutual visits. The participating parties appreciated the progress made in consular services between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which enabled more than 87,000 Iranian pilgrims to perform Hajj, and more than 25,000 Iranian pilgrims to perform Umrah rituals with ease and security in the first ten months of 2024. They also appreciated the convening of the first meeting of the Saudi-Iranian Joint Media Committee, and the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Prince Saud Al-Faisal Institute for Diplomatic Studies and the Institute of Political and International Studies of the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Saudi Arabia and Iran also expressed their readiness to sign a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement, and the three countries look forward to expanding trilateral cooperation in economic, political and other fields.- They all called -for an immediate end to the Israeli military operations in both Palestine and Lebanon, condemn the Israeli attack and its violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iran, and call for ensuring the unimpeded flow of humanitarian and relief aid to Palestine and Lebanon. The three countries hold that the ongoing cycle of violence and escalation poses a serious threat to the security of the region and the world, including maritime security. The three countries reaffirm their support for a comprehensive political solution to the Yemeni issue in accordance with internationally recognized principles under the auspices of the United Nations.- Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

China-Brazil Deals & Joint Statement - Global Cooperation Initiative on Cross-Border Data Flows - Liu Jianchao Meets Communist Party of Nepal Delegati...	As I opened the front page of the paper today, I felt a bit like Marty McFly. Everything on the page I covered in my newsletter yesterday. So I will keep staying ahead of the curve, and cover some developments that you can expect tomorrow. First, let's look at Xi Jinping's meeting with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Xinhua reports (English readout): -Xi Jinping pointed out that he was very pleased to visit Brazil in this year of great historical significance, marking the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil. Just now, President Lula held a grand welcoming ceremony with the highest courtesies for me, fully demonstrating the high importance attached to China-Brazil relations and the deep affection for the Chinese people, which deeply moved me. China and Brazil are two major developing countries in the eastern and western hemispheres. Looking back over the past 50 years, China-Brazil relations have spanned mountains and seas, exploring the right path for large developing countries to engage based on mutual respect, mutual benefit, friendship, and win-win cooperation. Brazil was the first country to establish a strategic partnership with China and the first Latin American country to establish a comprehensive strategic partnership with China. In recent years, under the strategic guidance of President Lula and myself, the two countries have increasingly become reliable friends with a shared destiny and a positive force for promoting peace. China-Brazil relations are now at their historical best, not only enhancing the well-being of the two peoples but also safeguarding the shared interests of the vast number of developing countries, strengthening the power and voice of the Global South, and making outstanding contributions to world peace and stability.- ，50。，，。。50，，、、。、。，，、，，，，，. As per the Chinese readout, -Lula specially arranged for the Brazilian artist to sing the famous Chinese song My Motherland to thank the Chinese side for its warm hospitality during his visit to China last year-. Xi Jinping emphasized that today, we are elevating the positioning of China-Brazil relations to the level of a China-Brazil community with a shared future for a more just world and a more sustainable planet. At the same time, we are aligning BRI with Brazil's development strategy. This marks another historic moment in the development of China-Brazil relations, highlighting the global, strategic, and long-term nature of the bilateral relationship. This aligns with the general expectations of the two peoples and will provide a driving force for both sides to advance their modernization agendas. It also demonstrates the determination of China and Brazil to jointly uphold international fairness and justice and promote common global development. China is willing to work with Brazil, keeping the future of humanity in mind and focusing on the well-being of the people, to continually enrich the connotations of the new-era China-Brazil relationship, becoming ‘golden partners' that achieve mutual success, and steadily progress toward building a community with a shared future for humanity, a fairer world, and a more sustainable planet, thereby making greater contributions to the cause of peace and progress for humankind.- ，，--，，、、，，，、。，、，，--，、，. Xi then made four points: First, we must share a common destiny and should continue to consolidate strategic mutual trust. We must firmly support each other on issues involving core interests, such as sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity, and become strategic partners that trust each other and a model of solidarity, cooperation, mutual benefit, and common development among the Global South countries. We must strengthen exchanges in the fields of culture, education, and youth, and consolidate the public opinion foundation of the China-Brazil community with a shared future. Second, we must develop together and continue to deepen the linkages between our development strategies. We must seize the historical opportunity of building interlinkages between the BRI and Brazil's development strategy, deepen cooperation in key areas such as economy, trade, infrastructure, finance, science and technology, and environmental protection, and strengthen cooperation in aerospace, agricultural science and technology, and clean energy. China has placed poverty alleviation in a prominent position in state governance and supports Brazil's ‘Zero Hunger' plan. It is willing to continue to strengthen poverty reduction cooperation with Brazil so that the people of the two countries can live a better life. Third, we must share responsibilities and demonstrate the strength of China and Brazil in maintaining world peace and justice. We must practise true multilateralism, make fair remarks and take fair actions, so as to make global governance more just and equitable. China attaches great importance to Brazil's international status and influence and supports Brazil in playing a greater role on the international stage. China stands ready to strengthen communication and coordination with Brazil at the United Nations, BRICS and other multilateral mechanisms, support Brazil's presidency of BRICS next year, promote high-quality development of greater BRICS cooperation, and make BRICS voice louder on upholding multilateralism and improving global governance. Fourth, we must share weal and woe and make distinctive contributions to building a community with a shared future for mankind. As major developing countries, China and Brazil should take the lead in conducting consultations, promoting global solidarity, jointly addressing global challenges concerning the future of mankind, and strengthening cooperation in such fields as green transformation, sustainable development, climate change, and AI governance. China is willing to support Brazil in hosting the 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. ，。、、，、、。、、，。，。--，、、、、，、、。，--，，。，。，、，。，，，，--，、。，。，，--，。、、、。《》. In terms of outcomes: The two sides issued a joint statement on jointly building the China-Brazil community with a shared future for a more just world and a more sustainable planet. They also signed -more than 30 bilateral cooperation documents in the fields of economy and trade, investment, agriculture, digital economy, sustainable development, science and technology, AI, and global development cooperation.- They also agreed to a Plan of Cooperation Between the People's Republic of China and the Federative Republic of Brazil on Synergizing the Belt and Road Initiative with the Growth Acceleration Program, the New Industry Brazil, the Ecological Transformation Plan, and the Program on South American Integration Routes. The Chinese readout quotes Lula saying that: -China is Brazil's most important strategic partner, and the Chinese people are the most trustworthy friends of the Brazilian people.- -The working groups of the two sides should expeditiously explore and advance cooperation in priority areas such as infrastructure, finance, industrial chain, science and technology, and ecological and environmental protection. The Brazilian side welcomes more Chinese companies to Brazil for investment and cooperation.- -Brazil opposes a ‘new Cold War-, and advocates a multipolar world and a global partnership based on equality and mutual respect. Brazil is ready to further deepen communication and cooperation with China under multilateral frameworks such as the U.N., BRICS, and the G20 to enhance the voice and influence of the Global South in global governance.- Share Tracking People's Daily The list of all the agreements and the full text of the cooperation plan is available on the website of Brazil's foreign affairs ministry. The joint statement is available on China's ministry of foreign affairs' website. AMong other things, it says: In the process of connecting the development strategies of the two countries, the two sides will focus on promoting strategic cooperation in the fields of finance, infrastructure, industrial chain development, investment, ecological transformation, scientific and technological innovation. ，、、、、、. Both sides recognize the potential for cooperation in national defense and defense industries and agree to enhance high-level exchanges and explore new avenues of cooperation. ，. The two sides agreed to set 2026 as the ‘China-Brazil Cultural Year' Brazil reaffirms its adherence to the one-China principle, recognizes that there is only one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, and the Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing all of China. Brazil supports China's efforts to achieve peaceful reunification of the country. China highly appreciates this. ，，，。。. Both sides reaffirmed their support for maintaining the authority of the United Nations and supporting the United Nations to play a central role in maintaining international peace and security and promoting development. Both sides believe that it is necessary to reform the United Nations and its Security Council to make them more representative and democratic. Both sides stressed that promoting necessary and reasonable reforms of the Security Council will help enhance the role of developing countries and enable the composition of the Security Council to properly respond to current global challenges. China highly values Brazil's influence and role in regional and international affairs, understands and supports () Brazil's desire to play a greater role in the United Nations, including in the Security Council. ，、。，、。，、，。，. Both sides believe that China and Brazil, as important representatives of the Global South and members of the G20 and BRICS, have similar positions on major international and regional issues. Both sides emphasise the importance of maintaining the authority and core role of the United Nations and promoting global governance based on multilateralism, international law, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. Both sides will further strengthen strategic cooperation at multilateral platforms such as the United Nations, the G20, and the BRICS, promote the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction, and strive to achieve an equal and orderly world multipolarization and inclusive economic globalization. Both sides emphasize that as an example of similar views in the field of international peace and security, the two countries reached the ‘China-Brazil Consensus on the Political Settlement of the Ukrainian Crisis', promoted the ‘Global South' countries to hold a high-level meeting on the Ukrainian crisis in New York on September 27, established a ‘Friends of Peace' group and issued a joint communiqué. ，--、，。，、《》。、、，，。，，《、》，--927，--。 Brazil welcomes China's GDI, GSI and GCI. 、、. China supports the Global Alliance to Fight Hunger and Poverty initiated by Brazil; it also backs the Call to Action on Global Governance Reform initiated during Brazil's chairing of G20. China supports Brazil's BRICS presidency and supports Brazil in holding the 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Belém in 2025. Both sides agree to deepen China-Latin America overall cooperation. Share Tracking People's Daily The two leaders also met the press later. The only additional bit from that to highlight is this: -President Xi stressed that the world today is far from being tranquil. Many regions are still suffering from conflicts, turmoil and insecurity. Humanity is an indivisible community of security. Only by embracing the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security can countries find a path to universal security. China and Brazil jointly issued the six-point consensus on a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, and launched the group of Friends for Peace on the Ukraine crisis together with other Global South countries. The two sides should bring together more voices for peace to pave the way for realizing a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. The two sides are deeply concerned about the continued expansion of the conflict in Gaza, and call for realizing a ceasefire and end of hostilities as early as possible, implementing the two-State solution, and working tirelessly for a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian question. China and Brazil share a tradition and responsibility in upholding justice and moral principles. China will work with Brazil to continually enrich the China-Brazil community with a shared future to enhance its relevance with our times. Together, the two sides will firmly defend true multilateralism, send a powerful message of the new era on pursuing development, cooperation and justice and rejecting poverty, confrontation and hegemonism, and join hands to make the world a better place.- Subscribe now Second, let's now look at the new Global Cooperation Initiative on Cross-Border Data Flows, which was detailed by the CAC. It says that: -We noticed that, while promoting global cross-border data flows, countries are primarily concerned with risks related to national security, public interests, personal privacy, and intellectual property. We believe that the international community should fully respect the different policies and practices adopted by various countries and regions based on their specific conditions. It is crucial to pay heed to each party's concerns regarding data security and development and to work toward building consensus on cross-border data flow rules through consultation among countries and regions.- In this context, China has proposed: Governments should encourage electronic cross-border data transmission to meet the needs of business and social activities. This will help global e-commerce and digital trade serve as new drivers for economic growth and sustainable development. Governments should respect the regulatory differences of various countries and regions in cross-border data flows. They should support free data flows that do not violate national security, public interests, and personal privacy. Regulations on cross-border data flows should be permitted when they aim to achieve legitimate public policy objectives on the premise that such regulatory measures do not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade, and do not cross the limits of the goals they seek to achieve. Governments should respect security measures taken by all countries in accordance with their laws to protect non-personal data related to national security and public interests, and ensure the secure and orderly cross-border flows of relevant non-personal data. Governments should respect measures taken by all countries to protect personal information rights and interests including individual privacy. Countries should be encouraged to provide convenient channels for cross-border transmission of personal information on the condition that such information is well protected.

Xi at G20: If China Can Make it, Other Developing Countries Can Too - Jaishankar-Wang Meeting Analysis - Xi Meets Macron, Scholz, Milei, Arce & Sheinb...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, November 20, 2024. Page 1: I covered Xi Jinping's G20 speech on global governance yesterday. Today, let's look at Xi's speech (full speech) at Session I of the G20 Summit in Rio. Both these are covered in the paper today. Xi said: -The Rio Summit this year has chosen the theme ‘Building a Just World and a Sustainable Planet.' It places fighting hunger and poverty at the top of the agenda, and decides to establish a Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty. From Hangzhou to Rio, we have been working for one and the same goal, that is, to build a just world of common development. To build such a world, we need to channel more resources to such fields as trade, investment and development cooperation, and strengthen development institutions. There should be more bridges of cooperation, and less ‘small yard, high fences', so that more and more developing countries will be better off and achieve modernization. To build such a world, we need to support developing countries in adopting sustainable production and lifestyle, properly responding to challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental pollution, enhancing ecological conservation, and achieving harmony between man and nature. To build such a world, we need an open, inclusive and non-discriminatory environment for international economic cooperation. We should promote a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, energize sustainable development with new technologies, new industries and new business forms, and support developing countries in better integrating in digital, smart and green development to bridge the North-South gap. To build such a world, we need to stay committed to multilateralism. We should uphold the UN-centered international system, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.- He added: -China's story is proof that developing countries can eliminate poverty, and that a weaker bird can start early and fly high, when there is the endurance, perseverance, and striving spirit that enables water drops to penetrate rocks over time and turns blueprints into reality. If China can make it, other developing countries can make it too. This is what China's battle against poverty says to the world.- He then termed China a member of the Global South and outlined 8 actions. Apart from the initiative on open science and the decision to join the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty, nothing seems new in this list. First, pursuing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. On top of RMB700 billion yuan added financing windows and an additional RMB80 billion yuan injection into the Silk Road Fund, China is moving ahead with the development of the multidimensional Belt and Road connectivity network, one that is led by the building of a green Silk Road and will empower a digital Silk Road. Second, implementing the Global Development Initiative. On the basis of over 1,100 development projects already in operation, we will make sure the Global South research center that is being built is fit for purpose, and the 20 billion U.S. dollars of development funds will continue to be put to good use to support developing countries and deepen practical cooperation in areas such as poverty reduction, food security and the digital economy. Third, supporting development in Africa. At the Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation held in September this year, I unveiled ten partnership actions on joining hands with Africa to advance modernization over the next three years and, in this connection, a commitment of RMB360 billion yuan in financial support. Fourth, supporting international cooperation on poverty reduction and food security. China has decided to join the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty. We support the G20 in continuing to convene the Development Ministerial Meeting, and will stay a committed host of the International Conference on Food Loss and Waste. Fifth, China, alongside Brazil, South Africa and the African Union, is proposing an Initiative on International Cooperation in Open Science to help the Global South gain better access to global advances in science, technology and innovation. Sixth, supporting the G20 in carrying out practical cooperation for the benefit of the Global South and using such outcomes as the Roadmap to Increase Investment in Clean Energy in Developing Countries and the High-Level Principles on Bioeconomy to good effect. China supports the work of the Entrepreneurship Research Center on G20 Economies based in Beijing, and supports cooperation on digital education and the digitization of museums and ancient archives. Seventh, implementing the G20 Anti-Corruption Action Plan. We are strengthening cooperation with fellow developing countries in fugitive repatriation and asset recovery, denial of safe haven, and anti-corruption capacity building. Eighth, China is pursuing high-standard opening up, and unilaterally opening our doors wider to the least developed countries (LDCs). We have announced the decision to give all LDCs having diplomatic relations with China zero-tariff treatment for 100 percent tariff lines. From now to 2030, China's imports from other developing countries are likely to top 8 trillion dollars. Subscribe now Next, there is a report about Xi's meeting with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo. Xinhua says: -Xi once again congratulated Sheinbaum on becoming the first female president in the history of Mexico…Xi said China and Mexico share similar views and ideas on many international issues, and both countries advocate a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalisation. China is ready to work with Mexico to uphold multilateralism and international fairness and justice, and inject positive energy into the development of the world economy.- The report adds: -Sheinbaum expressed her pleasure in meeting Xi, noting that she fully agrees with Xi's assessment of the relationship between the two countries. Although Mexico and China are far apart in distance, their ties are very close. Many Chinese companies operate in Mexico, including participating in the construction of major infrastructure projects in Mexico City, she said. She also expressed her gratitude for China's generous and sincere assistance during Mexico's difficult times such as the hurricane disaster, which is testament to the friendship between the two peoples. Both Mexico and China are committed to upholding multilateralism. Mexico is willing to work with China to explore potential opportunities while further expanding cooperation in various fields, added Sheinbaum.- Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, there's a report (English report) on Xi and Emmanuel Macron having prefaced an exhibition titled ‘Tang China -- A Cosmopolitan Dynasty (7th-10th Century)'. Subscribe now Although it is not in the paper today, Xi also met with Macron at the sidelines of the G20 in Rio. The Chinese readout says: -Xi Jinping pointed out that both China and France are independent, mature and responsible major countries. The relationship between the two countries has unique strategic value and global significance…At present, the international situation is undergoing many new changes, and leading the international community to unite in addressing global challenges is a major power responsibility jointly borne by China and France. Both sides should deepen strategic communication, strengthen mutual support, and maintain the steady and positive development momentum of China-France relations, contributing more to the healthy development of China-Europe relations and to world peace and stability. Xi Jinping stressed that China is willing to continue close high-level exchanges with France, continue to deepen exchanges and cooperation in the humanities fields, such as culture, education, local governance, and youth, to enhance mutual understanding between the Chinese and French people. The Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee has opened a new round of reform and opening up in China, which will provide new opportunities for China-France cooperation and the prospects for practical cooperation between the two sides are broad. It is hoped that the two sides will make good use of mechanisms such as high-level economic and financial dialogues and the mixed economic and trade committees to tap the potential for cooperation, strengthen complementary advantages, properly resolve differences, and achieve mutual benefit and win-win results. ，、、，...，，。，，、，。，，、、、，。，，。、，，，，. As per the Chinese readout, Macron said that: -The world today is full of various instability and uncertainty. France is willing to work with China to earnestly implement the consensus reached by the two heads of state, continue to strengthen high-level exchanges, enhance cultural exchanges, continue traditional friendship, and build a new type of state-to-state relations. France adheres to strategic autonomy and is willing to conduct dialogue and cooperation with China in the spirit of mutual respect, properly handle economic and trade disputes, maintain the healthy and stable development of bilateral economic and trade relations, and strengthen cooperation in areas such as addressing climate change and global governance of AI.- 。，，，，。，，，，、。 They also talked about the war in Ukraine. Xi said that -China hopes to see the conflict situation eased, does not wish to see the crisis spill over or the war escalate, and will continue to play a constructive role in its own way to promote a ceasefire and the cessation of hostilities.- ，，，、，. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, Xi met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The Chinese readout says: At present, the profound, once-in-a-century changes taking place in the world are accelerating, and global development is at a crucial crossroads. China and Germany, as the world's second and third largest economies and influential major powers, should persist in consolidating their comprehensive strategic partnership from a long-term and strategic perspective, and continue writing the story of mutually beneficial cooperation. Xi Jinping emphasised that China's policy toward Germany maintains high stability and continuity. China is willing to work with Germany to persist in respecting each other's core interests and major concerns, persist in seeking common ground while reserving differences, and exchange and learn from each other. China and Germany's economic interests are highly intertwined, and China-Germany cooperation is an opportunity to jointly promote development and create the future. China views Germany as an important partner in advancing Chinese-style modernization, and will continue to provide broad market opportunities for German enterprises. Both sides should focus on digitalization, intelligence, and low-carbon development to promote cooperation quality upgrade, work together to develop third-party markets, and achieve win-win cooperation. China believes Europe is an important pole in a multipolar world, is committed to carrying out cooperation with Europe, working together to respond to challenges, and promoting the continued stable and healthy development of China-EU relations. The EU's imposition of tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles has attracted worldwide attention. China has always insisted on resolving differences through dialogue and consultation, and hopes Germany will continue to play an important role in this.- ，，。、，，。，，，，、。，、。，。、、，，。，，，。。，. As per the Chinese readout, Scholz touched upon the -complex international situation- that persists and expressed a desire to -further develop a comprehensive strategic partnership with China; strengthen bilateral and multilateral dialogue and cooperation in the spirit of equality, candidness and mutual respect; properly resolve differences, achieve mutual benefit and win-win outcomes, and contribute to the recovery, growth and common prosperity of the world economy. It is hoped that Europe and China will resolve the issue of electric vehicles as soon as possible through dialogue and negotiation, and Germany is willing to make positive efforts in this regard.- ，、，，，。，. Share Tracking People's Daily They also discussed the Ukraine war and the situation in the Middle East. Third, there's a readout from Xi's meeting with Bolivian President Luis Arce. It says: Xi called China and Bolivia -good friends and brothers-. He talked about BRI cooperation and said that he hoped to take the 40th anniversary of the establishment of ties next year to push their -strategic partnership to a new level-. -Xi Jinping stressed that the two sides should strengthen exchanges between governments, legislatures, political parties and at sub-national levels, carry out in-depth exchanges of experience in governance, align BRI with Bolivia's 2025 development plan, expand cooperation in infrastructure construction, highland agriculture, green development, digital economy and other fields, deepen collaboration within multilateral mechanisms such as the United Nations and BRICS to promote unity, self-reliance, and common development among Global South countries. China supports the development of Latin American regional integration and is willing to work with Bolivia to strengthen the construction of the China-Latin America Forum mechanism.- ，、、、，，--2025，、、、，、，。，，. Acre praised the -deep brotherly friendship- between China and Bolivia. He added: -Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, China's modernisation has made great achievements, providing an important reference point and guidance for the development of Bolivia and other countries.- ，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Fourth, Xi met with Argentine President Javier Milei. The Chinese readout says: Xi said that since the establishment of diplomatic ties, -both sides have adhered to mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit. China's policy toward Argentina has always been focused on the entire Argentine people, and China-Argentina cooperation has likewise benefited all people. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Argentina, placing bilateral relations at an important juncture to build on the past and usher in the future. China values the traditional friendship between the peoples of the two countries, supports Argentina in exploring a development path suited to its national conditions through reform, and is willing to work with Argentina to promote the long-term stable development of the China-Argentina comprehensive strategic partnership to better support the development of both countries.- ，，、、。，。10，、。，，，，。 -Xi Jinping stressed that the current world situation is undergoing profound changes. China and Argentina should continue to firmly support each other on issues of core interests and major concerns, strengthen exchanges at all levels and in all fields, promote cultural exchanges and cooperation, and make China-Argentina friendship more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The economic and trade structures of China and Argentina are highly complementary, and the prospects for cooperation are broad. Argentina is welcome to seize the important opportunities brought by China's high-level opening up to the outside world and further expand its market share in China. China is willing to continue to promote high-quality joint construction of the BRI with Argentina, and deepen cooperation in energy, mining, infrastructure, agriculture, scientific and technological innovation, digital economy and other fields. China is also willing to continue financial cooperation with Argentina to help Argentina maintain economic and financial stability.- ，，，，，。，，，。--，、、、、。，. As per the readout, Milei -thanked China for its valuable help in stabilising Argentina's domestic economic and financial situation-. He added that -Argentina hopes to become a reliable and stable partner of China. Argentina firmly supports China's position on the Taiwan issue and firmly adheres to the one-China principle.

Argentina highly appreciates President Xi Jinping's insightful propositions on global governance at the G20 Leaders' Summit and is willing to strengthen communication and cooperation with China…- ，。。。。，。、、，，，。，。，. Xi is now in Brasilia, kicking off his state visit to Brazil. Subscribe now Page 3: There are two reports of meetings by Wang Yi. First, Wang met with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. The Chinese readout says: Wang said that -China and Russia should work with BRICS partners to implement the outcomes of the BRICS Kazan Summit, expand and strengthen the BRICS mechanism, enhance the influence of the Global South, and play a greater role in world multipolarization. China has taken over the presidency of the SCO and is willing to work closely with Russia to promote greater development of the SCO and move it to a new level. Next year marks the 80th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War. China and Russia should jointly organise commemorative activities, firmly defend the results of the victory of the Second World War and international fairness and justice, learn from history and open up the future.- ，，，，，。，，，。80，,，、. Lavrov reportedly said that -Russia-China relations are at an unprecedented high level.- He added: -The UN is the most important achievement of the victory of the Second World War, and commemorating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations is of great significance. The international community should take this opportunity to oppose the destruction of the post-war international order and jointly maintain global peace and stability.- ，80。，，. The readout said that they discussed the war in Ukraine, the situation on the Korean Peninsula and other issues. Subscribe now Second, Wang met with Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. Before I detail the readouts, let me offer a brief analysis. My Brief Takeaway: As you go through both the readouts, you will notice that there is remarkable divergence in just how the Chinese side has characterised Jaishankar's position and what the MEA's readout actually says. The differences in the readouts are indicative of how far the two sides are in terms of their interests and perceptions of each other, despite the patrolling rights deal that was agreed in October and the Modi-Xi meeting in Kazan. Here are four points to consider: First, the Chinese readout essentially has Jaishankar agreeing with Beijing's proposition that -specific differences-, i.e., the boundary tensions, should not define the relationship. In contrast, the Indian readout says that both ministers -recognized that the disengagement in our border areas had contributed to the maintenance of peace and tranquility-. In other words, the Chinese side also appreciated the Indian position that you cannot have a stable relationship if tensions persist on the boundary. Second, the Chinese readout seems to indicate far greater common cause between India and China on global issues, while accepting that there are issues of attrition and suspicion between the two. The MEA's readout, on the other hand, explicitly says that on global issues -India and China have both differences and convergences-. In particular, the Chinese readout talks about world multipolarity; the Indian readout also calls for a multipolar Asia. Third, on specific actions, the Chinese readout calls for easing visa processes, exchanging journalists and resuming direct flights. It does not mention the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra pilgrimage and data sharing on trans-border rivers, which the MEA's readout mentions. Finally, the Chinese readout attributes this to Jaishankar -India also opposes unilateralism, does not approve of military alliances, advocates the democratisation of international relations, and is willing to strengthen coordination and cooperation with China in multilateral mechanisms such as the G20 and BRICS-. The underlying message in this appears to be directed at the US. In contrast the MEA's readout says that Jaishankar told Wang -where India is concerned, its foreign policy has been principled and consistent, marked by independent thought and action. We are against unilateral approaches to establish dominance. India does not view its relationships through the prism of other nations.- To me, the underlying message in this is directed at China and its assertive and aggressive policies. Share Tracking People's Daily The Chinese readout says: Wang said that -the successful meeting between President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Kazan not long ago and the restart of China-India relations are in line with the fundamental interests of the two peoples, the expectations of Global South countries and the right direction of history. The two sides should implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state, respect each other's core interests, enhance mutual trust through dialogue and communication, handle differences properly with sincerity and integrity, and bring the bilateral relationship back on the track of stable and sound development at an early date. The two sides should send more positive signals and engage in actions that facilitate bilateral exchanges, enhance mutual trust and reduce suspicion, and carry out more cooperation and reduce attrition. The two sides should strive to make practical progress in such issues as resuming direct flights, exchanging journalists and easing visa procedures as soon as possible. Next year marks the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and India. The two sides should plan commemorative activities, and encourage exchanges and visits in various fields and at different levels to enhance understanding and mutual trust.- ，，，，，。，，，，。，；，；，。、、。75，，，. -Wang said China and India, as two neighbouring major developing countries, have more common interests than differences, and they should view each other's development as an opportunity and work together to achieve common development and rejuvenation, which will help safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries and contribute to global multipolarity. Both China and India adhere to a non-aligned foreign policy and multilateralism, and support the democratisation of international relations. The two countries should continue to strengthen coordination and cooperation in international affairs and further develop mechanisms such as BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.- ，，，，，，。，，，，、. The Chinese readout quotes Jaishankar as saying: -During the BRICS Summit in Kazan, leaders of both countries reached a consensus on promoting the stable development of India-China relations. It is gratifying to see that both sides are taking measures to implement the consensus of the leaders and have made positive progress. The Indian side hopes to restart the relevant dialogue mechanism as soon as possible and maintain the momentum of improvement and development of bilateral relations through strengthened communication. The consensus between India and China far outweighs the differences. Both sides should view bilateral relations from a strategic perspective, properly handle relevant issues with a more positive attitude, and not let specific differences define the relationship between the two countries. The Indian side is willing to take the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries next year as an opportunity to push forward India-China relations. Both India and China play an important role in international affairs, which also reflects the potential of India-China cooperation. India also opposes unilateralism, does not approve of military alliances, advocates the democratisation of international relations, and is willing to strengthen coordination and cooperation with China in multilateral mechanisms such as the G20 and BRICS.- ，，。。，。，，，。75，。，。，，，、. The Indian MEA's readout of the meeting says: -The Ministers recognized that the disengagement in our border areas had contributed to the maintenance of peace and tranquility. The discussions focused on the next steps in India-China relations. It was agreed that a meeting of the Special Representatives and of the Foreign Secretary-Vice Minister mechanism will take place soon. Among the steps discussed were the resumption of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra pilgrimage, data sharing on trans-border rivers, direct flights between India and China and media exchanges.- -On the global situation and international issues, EAM noted that India and China have both differences and convergences. We have worked constructively in the BRICS and the SCO framework. Our cooperation in the G20 has also been evident. EAM said that we are strongly committed to a multipolar world, including a multipolar Asia. Where India is concerned, its foreign policy has been principled and consistent, marked by independent thought and action. We are against unilateral approaches to establish dominance. India does not view its relationships through the prism of other nations. FM Wang Yi concurred with EAM that India-China relations have particular salience in world politics. He noted that our leaders had agreed in Kazan on the way forward. The two Ministers felt that it was imperative that the focus should be on stabilizing ties, managing differences and taking the next steps.- Subscribe now Next, there's a Zhong Sheng commentary. It talks about the Xi-Biden meeting, saying that in the past four years, -overall stability has been achieved- in ties. It says that: -President Xi Jinping expounded on strategic, directional, and guiding opinions on the development of China-US relations, proposing that the two countries should respect each other, coexist peacefully, and cooperate for win-win results. He clearly outlined China's four red lines regarding the Taiwan issue, democracy and human rights, the choice of path and system, and development rights. He suggested that both sides should jointly establish correct perceptions, effectively manage differences, advance mutually beneficial cooperation, shoulder great power responsibilities, and promote people-to-people exchanges, making the great edifice of China-US relations have not only a dome but also a foundation and pillars. To promote stable, healthy, and sustainable development of China-US relations, both sides need to add bricks and tiles to this great edifice of China-US relations.- 4，，，，。、、，、、，、、、4，、、、、，，。、、，. -Strategic perception is the fundamental and overarching issue in Sino-US relations. The ‘Thucydides Trap' is not a historical destiny, and a ‘new Cold War' cannot be fought or won. Containment of China is unwise, undesirable, and will not succeed. If the two countries are partners and seek common ground while reserving differences, Sino-US relations will be able to achieve substantial development. If the other side is regarded as an opponent and vicious competition is carried out, Sino-US relations will encounter setbacks or even regress. In the interaction between these two major powers, neither side can reshape the other according to their own wishes, nor can they suppress the other based on so-called ‘position of strength', let alone deprive the other of legitimate development rights to maintain their own leading position. China and the US are two major powers, and some contradictions and differences are inevitable, but they cannot harm each other's core interests, much less engage in conflict and confrontation. The One China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiques are the political foundation of bilateral relations and must be strictly observed.- 、。--，--，、，。，，。，，。，，--，。，，，。，. Share Tracking People's Daily -The interests of China and the United States are deeply intertwined, and the space for cooperation is infinite. In terms of economic ties, the trade volume between China and the United States exceeds $660 billion. More than 70,000 American companies in China have an annual profit of $50 billion; in terms of employment, exports to China alone support 930,000 jobs in the United States, and Chinese investment has also boosted American employment; in terms of people's livelihood, Chinese products have not only enriched the choices of American consumers, but also reduced the cost of living. McDonald's new stores in China in the past year accounted for about 60% of global presence. Tesla's Shanghai Super Factory delivered electric vehicles accounting for half of its global production capacity last year. And Starbucks has more than 1,000 stores in Shanghai alone...The story of mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the United States fully shows that under the current situation, the common interests of China and the United States have not decreased, but rather increased. China and the United States should always focus on the well-being of the people of the two countries, continuously extend the list of cooperation, expand the pie of cooperation, and achieve win-win cooperation.- ，。，6600，7500；，93，；，，。，，1000……，，，。，，，. The next paragraph talks about global turbulence and then outlines this vision for bilateral ties. In essence, this is a call for a G2-style relationship. -China and the US should take into account the interests of the world, constantly consider the future destiny of humanity, take responsibility for world peace, provide public goods for the global community, and play a positive role in world unity. Major power competition should not be the underlying theme of the era; only unity and cooperation can overcome difficulties together. ‘Decoupling and breaking chains' is not the solution; only mutually beneficial cooperation can lead to joint development. ‘Small yards with high walls' are not behaviours befitting of major powers; only openness and sharing can benefit humanity. Only by demonstrating the pattern of major powers, shouldering the responsibilities of major powers, and playing the role of major powers can we be responsible to history, to the people, and to the world, and only then can we win the world's respect.-，，，，。，。--，。--，。、、，、、，. The next bit reiterates Xi's framing of the -four unchanged- , i.e., China's goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged. Its commitment to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation as principles for handling China-U.S. relations remains unchanged. Its position of resolutely safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests remains unchanged. And its desire to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples remains unchanged. It then says: -To achieve a smooth transition in China-US relations, both sides need to uphold the already agreed-upon guiding principles, i.e., mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, maintaining communication, preventing conflict, adhering to the UN Charter, cooperating in areas of common interest, and responsibly managing competitive elements in bilateral relations. At present, China-US relations once again stand at a crossroads. The people of both countries have expectations for the stable development of China-US relations, and the international community also has expectations for the stable development of China-US relations. It is hoped that the US side will meet China halfway, continue to explore the correct way for two major powers to get along, achieve long-term peaceful coexistence between China and the US on this planet, and inject more certainty and provide positive energy for the world.- ，，、、、、《》，，。，。，。，，，、.

He said that -with the strong support of the central government, effective leadership of the HKSAR Government, and joint efforts from all sectors of Hong Kong society, the city has achieved new accomplishments in economic and social development, and its financial system remains vibrant.- 、，，. He added that -building, consolidating, and developing Hong Kong as an international financial center is not only essential for Hong Kong but also of great importance to the country. The central government has always positioned the development of Hong Kong as an international financial center from a strategic and overall perspective. It will continue to improve the policy system that supports the construction of Hong Kong as an international financial center and will, as always, provide full support and protection for Hong Kong's financial reform and development, as well as the maintenance of financial stability and security.- ，、、，，。，，，、、. He then talked about China's reform agenda and said: -The long-term positive trend of China's economic development has not changed and will not change. A strong country means a strong Hong Kong; a strong Hong Kong will make the country even better. It is hoped that Hong Kong will seize the historic opportunities brought by the country's reform and development, continuously deepen financial reform and innovation, expand financial openness and cooperation, actively align with national development strategies, safeguard financial security, and continue to write a brilliant chapter of ‘one country, two systems' in the new journey.- ，、。，，。，；，。，，，，，--.

Second, there have been a total of 100,000 China-Europe freight trains this year, with 7 trains going and 6 trains returning per week. More than 11 million standard containers of goods have been shipped with a value of more than $420 billion. Note this bit: Economic globalisation is an unstoppable historical tide. Although it is facing headwinds and setbacks, this overall trend has never changed and will not change. At 6:00 p.m. on October 11, the 3 millionth vehicle rolled off the production line at Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory. In the first three quarters of this year, the Shanghai Gigafactory has delivered 676,000 vehicles, accounting for more than half of Tesla's global deliveries in the same period, becoming the ‘capacity pillar' for Tesla. Of these 3 million vehicles, one-third were exported to Europe and Asia-Pacific markets. The localization rate of parts at the Shanghai Gigafactory exceeds 95%, and Tesla has signed over 400 local first-tier suppliers, with more than 60 suppliers entering Tesla's global supply chain system. Tesla's development in China is a fruit of economic globalization and a strong proof of ‘harmony and coexistence'. Not just Tesla. In April, Mercedes-Benz announced the upgrade of its Shanghai R&amp;D center, further accelerating innovation in China; Volkswagen Group (China) announced a 2.5 billion euro investment to expand its production and innovation center in Hefei; BMW's Shenyang production base has invested nearly 100 billion yuan since 2010... China's creation of complete industrial chains, efficient market mechanisms, and healthy industrial competition ecology has attracted global capital to invest and develop business. As the economy becomes increasingly globalised, the interdependence between countries further deepens. Research and development, production, circulation, and consumption are interlinked; no country can achieve full lifecycle management of industrial and supply chains on its own. ‘I exist in you, you exist in me', the cooperation pattern becomes more solid. Unilateralism and protectionism offer no way forward, and ‘small yards with high walls' will only trap oneself. For some time, certain people in the US and the West have exaggerated the so-called ‘Chinese new energy overcapacity theory', which in essence is a ‘development anxiety theory' and a ‘zero-sum game theory', which harms others and benefits no one…Facts show that the development of China's new energy industry is a contribution and opportunity to the world. Coming from the depths of history, every Chinese understands what isolation will bring to us and the world. China is a beneficiary of economic globalisation and a firm promoter, because we understand that ‘when the world is good, China will be good; when China is good, the world will be even better'.- ，。，，，。10116，300。，67.6，，--。300，1/3、。95%，400，60。，，--。。4，—，；（），25；20101000……、、，。，。、、、，，。-、-，。、，--。，--，----，。。ATTO32023，E，H6……，。，，。，，、。，，-，；，-. The rest of the piece says that China will continue to reform and open up and that China's reform and opening up are opportunities for the world. Page 6: There's a report on the publication of the Annual Report on Human Rights report (2024) by the China Society for Human Rights Studies. You can read this English report, if interested. Another report on the page talks about the successful trial of large-scale trial transportation of lithium batteries via trains. A related English report informs: -China Railway has conducted its first large-scale trial transportation of lithium batteries for electric vehicles (EVs). On Tuesday, three trains loaded with lithium batteries departed from Chongqing Municipality, Sichuan Province and Guizhou Province, all of which are located in southwest China. For China, the world's largest producer of lithium batteries, this is a major step forward in the transportation of these vehicle batteries, which are listed as dangerous goods and were previously transported only by sea or road. The transport of lithium batteries is risky as they may burn or explode if jolted. ‘For the trial run, we are using a new type of container designed solely for the transport of lithium batteries. The containers are made of non-combustible materials and equipped with smoke and temperature detectors and venting devices,' said Jia Ping, deputy general manager of China Railway Chengdu Group Co., Ltd. Rail transport will facilitate the export of Chinese lithium batteries as it has a larger capacity than road transport and is faster than sea transport, Jia said.- Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!
