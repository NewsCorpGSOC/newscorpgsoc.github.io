MSS' Warning on Open-Source Information	Hi folks, I am summarising a piece that was published on the Ministry of State Security's WeChat account. This was republished by Xinhua today. The piece basically talks about the need to be cautious with open-source information. The warning is that open-source information can become a source of leaking of secret and sensitive information. Before I get to the article, I think this is the opportune moment to announce that the next edition of my 6-week online course Watching China is scheduled for early February 2025. The course is designed to equip those aspiring to study and analyse China's domestic and foreign policies with the skills that are essential to engage in such a task. Over a period of six weeks, Watching China will provide an introduction to the philosophy, structures and processes of the Leninist Party-state system, discuss the role of ideology and familiarise students with the language of Communist Party discourse. Students will also be introduced to key analytical frameworks and China's information ecosystem allowing them to undertake effective open source research. Further details will be provided in the days ahead. If you would like to be personally notified when applications open, please can drop me a line through the link below or by replying to this email. Back to the MSS' article. The article says that in the era of big data and cyberspace, -some sensitive information is being publicly disseminated through the Internet without undergoing declassification processing or risk assessment, thereby becoming an important source of open source intelligence for foreign espionage and intelligence agencies, posing a threat to our national security.- It adds: -Open-source information generally refers to legally accessible information resources, including but not limited to social media posts, online forum discussions, blog articles, news reports, satellite images, etc. These information sources are extensive, have low acquisition costs, and often contain a wealth of valuable data and intelligence, which may become a critical source of network-based intelligence theft for foreign espionage and intelligence agencies. Be vigilant when it comes to leaks in procurement bidding. Classified procurement refers to procurement activities that require confidentiality measures during the process to ensure the security of state secrets, such as classified construction projects or digitization of classified archives. In practice, due to inadequate management or weak confidentiality awareness among personnel, procurement content or purposes may be improperly disclosed, or classified technical parameters may be marked in public bidding documents on occasion, threatening the security of state secrets. Be vigilant of leaks during information disclosure. According to regulations, government agencies must, as per the law, conduct confidentiality reviews of information proposed for public disclosure before making it public. However, it has been found in practice that some agencies fail to strictly follow confidentiality review regulations when publishing information, uploading classified documents to public websites, thereby leading to incidents of information leaks. Be vigilant of leaks on social media. In today's society, self-media is flourishing, and videos casually filmed or comments posted by netizens can attract widespread attention. Some outdoor enthusiasts share images with classified sensitive forbidden areas as backgrounds on social media to attract attention. Such behaviour not only severely disrupts the management order of classified and sensitive areas but may also be exploited by foreign espionage and intelligence agencies, posing a threat to our national security. ，、、、、。，，，。——。，，、。，、，、，。——。，，。，，，，。——。，，、。，，，. The next bit of the article says that: -The openness and easy accessibility of open-source information makes sensitive information easily exploitable by foreign espionage and intelligence agencies. Foreign espionage and intelligence agencies can gather fragmented, blurred data together, and through big data correlation analysis, can implement precise, continuous, and stable information tracking on targets, obtaining valuable intelligence. This poses great challenges when it comes to maintaining confidentiality, necessitating the adoption of stricter and more effective measures to prevent information leaks. Improve systems and clarify responsibilities. Relevant units should establish and improve confidentiality responsibility systems and management protocols, clearly defining the confidentiality duties and authorities of leaders and staff at all levels. Strengthen the management and supervision of personnel involved in dealing with classified information to ensure strict compliance with confidentiality regulations and systems. Strengthen control and conduct strict reviews. Relevant units should strengthen information disclosure control at the source, strictly implement confidentiality review systems, absolutely prohibit the disclosure of classified information, and implement categorised and graded protection for non-classified but sensitive information. Network platforms should strictly fulfil main body responsibilities, strengthen full-process management of information circulation, improve content review mechanisms, and ensure compliance in editing and compilation, conduct declassification before publication, and review materials before re-sharing. Raise awareness and be cautious in speech and action. Citizens in general should enhance risk prevention awareness, be vigilant against behaviours that endanger national security, maintain clear-headedness and caution in network-related behaviours, and prevent themselves from becoming sources of open-source intelligence for foreign espionage and intelligence agencies. 。、，，、、，，，。——，。，。，。——，。，，，。，，，、、。——，。，，、，. The piece ends with a call to action, i.e., to report suspicious activities through the 12339 hotline, through www.12339.gov.cn, the WeChat public account of the Ministry of State Security or directly to the local national security authorities.

The Netherlands is ready to serve as a gateway for China's cooperation with Europe, and looks forward to further strengthening cooperation in economic, trade, and other fields to advance Netherlands-China relations.- ，，，。，。，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Third, there's a detailed report on Zhao Leji's visit to Spain. Zhao met with Spanish King Felipe VI and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, and held talks with Pedro Rollan, president of the Spanish Senate, and Francina Armengol, speaker of the Spanish Congress of Deputies. Xinhua reports: Zhao told King Felipe VI that -China is committed to collaborating with Spain to deepen their traditional friendship, uphold mutual understanding and respect for each other's core interests and major concerns, achieve new cooperation achievements, and tackle global challenges like climate change together, ultimately striving for shared development and prosperity…The King said as next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the establishment of China-Spain comprehensive strategic partnership, Spain will deepen its cooperation with China in areas such as trade and investment, new energy, climate change, culture, education, and the promotion of each other's languages, bringing fresh momentum to the growth of their relationship.- The report adds: -When meeting with Sanchez, Zhao said Spain is an important strategic partner of China in Europe.

China has always regarded Europe as a key priority in its diplomacy and an important partner in achieving Chinese-style modernization. China is willing to promote the high-level development of China-Spain relations to contribute to the steady and long-term growth of China-Europe relations, said Zhao. Sanchez said Spain abides by the one-China policy. Extending welcome for China's investment, the prime minister called for more cooperation in such fields as trade, electric vehicles, agricultural products, culture and sports. Spain is willing to play an active role in the European Union (EU) and push for better development of EU-China relations, said Sanchez, adding the Spanish side will strengthen coordination with China on international and multilateral affairs, uphold the authority of international law, and work together to safeguard global peace and stability.- In his meetings with Rollan and Armengol, Xinhua reports that Zhao said the NPC -is willing to strengthen exchanges with the Spanish Senate and the Congress of Deputies at all levels, promote mutual learning on legislation and supervision, and timely formulate, revise and approve legal documents conducive to bilateral cooperation…Zhao underscored the readiness to advance the exchanges between the two countries' legislators, and cement bilateral collaboration within multilateral frameworks such as the Inter-Parliamentary Union.

Dragon TV: China recently rolled out measures to facilitate cross-border travel. Last week, a new batch of countries were added to the visa-free list. We noticed that China is becoming an increasingly popular destination for foreign tourists. Places in China have become trending searches on multiple tourism platforms, and the number of reservations for tours to China surged on many foreign e-commerce tourism platforms. Can you give us more details? Mao Ning: China has extended the visa-free policy to 38 countries since the end of last year and so far has realized comprehensive mutual visa exemption with 25 countries in total. We have also made Chinese visa application more efficient and easier by improving the visa application form, canceling visa reservation, expanding the scope of fingerprinting exemption, lowering visa fees and other measures. While streamlining the procedure of travelling to China, we are also committed to making life and work in China more convenient and comfortable for foreign friends. Places including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong Province improved payment services, including by mobile devices, bank cards and cash, to make online shopping and transportation more problem-free for foreign friends. Chinese telecom providers, by opening new shops, improving foreign language services and launching new packages, have enabled foreign friends to access and use 5G network more conveniently. More cities have set up special windows to provide one-stop service to help foreign nationals to get work permit and residence permit faster. We will make continued effort to facilitate cross-border travel. We welcome friends from all countries to visit China, experience the country's glamour and share in the dividends of China's development. Subscribe now Mao Ning also responded to the G7 Foreign Ministers' statement, which had a lot of content related to China. The G7 statement said: -We will take appropriate measures, consistent with our legal systems, against actors in China and in other third countries that materially support Russia's war machine, including financial institutions and other entities that facilitate Russia's acquisition of equipment and items for its defense industrial base…We urge countries with ties to Russia and the DPRK, including China, to uphold international law by opposing this dangerous expansion of the conflict and implementing all relevant UNSC resolutions.- And then there is this big chunk on China: -As we seek constructive and stable relations with China, we recognize the importance of direct and candid engagement to express concerns and manage differences. We reaffirm our readiness to cooperate with China to address global challenges We are deeply concerned by China's increasing support to Russia and Russia's defense industrial base, which is decisively enabling Russia to maintain its illegal war in Ukraine and to reconstitute its armed forces and has significant broad-based security implications. China must prevent its companies from transferring weapons, especially attack Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), dual-use materials, including weapons components, and equipment. We also call on China to step up efforts to promote international peace and security and to press Russia to stop its military aggression and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw its troops from Ukraine.- We recognize the importance of China in global trade. We are not trying to harm China or thwart its economic development, indeed a growing China that plays by international rules and norms would be of global interest. However, we express our concerns about China's non-market policies and practices that are leading to harmful overcapacity and market distortions, undermining our workers, industries and economic resilience and security. We are not decoupling or turning inwards. Together with our partners, we are de-risking and diversifying supply chains, where necessary and appropriate to reduce critical dependencies and vulnerabilities and to foster resilience to economic coercion. We further call on China to refrain from adopting export control measures, particularly on critical minerals, that could lead to significant supply chain disruptions. We remain seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas. We reiterate our strong opposition to any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion. There is no legal basis for China's expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea. We reiterate our opposition to China's militarization and coercive and intimidation activities in the South China Sea. We re-emphasize the universal and unified character of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and reaffirm its important role in setting out the legal framework that governs all activities in the oceans and seas. We continue to oppose China's dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia in the South China Sea and its repeated obstruction of countries' freedom of navigation and overflight. We express deep concern over the increasing use of dangerous maneuvers and water cannons against Philippine and Vietnamese vessels. We reiterate that the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal on 12 July 2016 is a significant milestone, which is legally binding upon the parties to those proceedings and a useful basis for peacefully resolving disputes between the parties. Maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is indispensable to international security and prosperity. We call for the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. There is no change in the basic position of the G7 members on Taiwan, including stated One-China policies. We support Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations as a member where statehood is not a prerequisite and as an observer or guest where it is. We remain concerned by the human rights situation in China, including in Xinjiang and Tibet. We remain concerned by the erosion of civil society, human rights and fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong. The sentencing of 45 pro-democracy politicians and activists marks a further deterioration of democratic participation and pluralism, which undermines confidence in the rule of law as enshrined in the Hong Kong Basic Law, and therefore Hong Kong's and the People's Republic of China's international legal obligations. We urge China and the Hong Kong authorities to abide by their international human rights commitments and legal obligations. We call on China not to conduct or condone activities aimed at undermining the security and safety of our communities and the integrity of our democratic institutions, and to act in strict accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Xi Meets Lee Hsien Loong - China-Samoa Joint Statement - Zhong Yin Commentary on Recent Violent Crimes - CPC Delegation Visits Sri Lanka - Boosting Te...	Hi folks, I hope this finds you well. Before we get to today's paper, I am sharing my latest podcast with my colleague Anushka Saxena, discussing the key takeaways from Xi Jinping's recent visit to Peru and Brazil. Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, November 27, 2024. Page 1: The lead report on the page is about Xi Jinping meeting with Senior Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong. Xi praised the -remarkable achievements Singapore made during Lee's tenure as prime minister.- He called on the two sides to -strengthen high-level exchanges, further strengthen the alignment of development strategies, deepen cooperation in various fields, bring more benefits to the people of the two countries, and make greater contributions to regional peace and prosperity.- He said that the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park is a -vivid example of bilateral cooperation and bears witness to Singapore's deep involvement in China's reform and opening up-. Xi added: -China will always focus on running its own affairs well, and has confidence in maintaining sound economic momentum in the long run and achieving high-quality development. China welcomes Singapore to continue being a forerunner in cooperation with China, advance major cooperation projects, seize the opportunities brought by digital and green development, and write a new chapter in bilateral cooperation in the new era. Xi Jinping pointed out that the world today is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century. In the face of risks and challenges, no single country can be immune. Upholding solidarity, cooperation, openness and inclusiveness is the right path to tread. China is willing to work together with Singapore to practice genuine multilateralism, follow the trend of economic globalization, safeguard international fairness and justice, resist bloc confrontation and division, and build an Asian community with a shared destiny.- ，，。，，，、，。，。，，、。，，，，、，. As per the report, Lee said: -China has already found a successful path to modernization. Singapore is full of confidence in China's future and believes that China will maintain development and prosperity, making greater contributions to global peace and development. Singapore will continue to commit to deepening cooperation with China and actively participate in China's modernization process. In the current complex international situation, all countries should adopt a long-term perspective, uphold multilateralism, commit to unity and cooperation, and jointly address risks and challenges to better benefit their peoples.- ，，，。，。，，，，，. They also discussed China-US relations and the regional situation. Wang Huning also met with Lee. Xinhua reports Wang said that -China is willing to maintain close, high-level exchange with Singapore, strengthen practical cooperation in various fields, enhance the friendship between the two peoples, push for new progress in China-Singapore relations, and contribute to regional peace, stability, development and prosperity.- Do also note that on Tuesday, the militaries of China and Singapore held a -force-on-force joint drill- at a training base in Henan. China's Ministry of National Defense said that the exercise was divided into three main phases: infiltration and positioning, assault and rescue, and evacuation. Subscribe now Xi also met with visiting Samoan Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa in Beijing. Xinhua's report says: Xi said that -China is willing to make empowering Pacific Island countries to tackle climate change a priority in its cooperation with these countries. China will work with Pacific Island countries to promote the full and effective implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement, honor the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, uphold fairness, justice and the common interests of the Global South, and build a community with a shared future for mankind, Xi told Mata'afa. Noting that Samoa was among the first Pacific Island countries to establish diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China nearly five decades ago, Xi said the two countries have maintained traditional friendship, mutual respect, equal treatment and win-win cooperation. He said China supports Samoa in safeguarding its sovereignty and independence, and exploring a development path suited to its national conditions. China will continue to provide assistance to Samoa in its economic and social development, and tap the potential of economy, trade, investment, agriculture and fisheries to achieve common development, Xi said. Xi stressed that China does not attach political strings to its assistance to the Pacific Island countries, and China's policy toward Pacific Island countries is open and inclusive, without targeting any third party or engaging in geopolitical competition or spheres of influence.- Among other things, -Mata'afa said Samoa firmly adheres to the one-China principle and supports the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative proposed by President Xi.- The two sides issued a joint statement too. This is available on Page 3. The English version is also available. Key points: -The Chinese side supports Samoa in upholding its sovereignty and independence. Samoa firmly adheres to the one-China principle, and recognizes there is but one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory; the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. Furthermore, Samoa recognizes efforts by the Chinese government to realize national reunification, and that issues relating to Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Xizang and human rights are internal matters for China to deal with. By the same token, Samoa believes that the South China Sea issue is a matter for China to settle amicably through peaceful negotiations and dialogue with all parties involved.- -China reiterated the principles of respect President Xi Jinping believes are essential for developing relations with Pacific island countries, namely: respect for sovereignty and independence; respect for the will of the countries; respect the ethnic and cultural traditions and respect for the countries' commitment to unity. China reaffirms the absence of conditionality to its assistance. It neither imposes its will onto countries nor makes empty promises in assisting countries, values commended by Samoa.- It mentions GDI, GSI, GCI and building a community for a shared future of mankind, along with BRI. -The two sides agreed to reaching a mutual visa free arrangement as soon as possible. The Chinese side will continue to send medical team to Samoa, provide scholarships and various training opportunities and support Samoa in Chinese language teaching.- -The two sides agreed to advocate humanity's common values of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom, strengthen communication and coordination on international and regional affairs, defend the international system with the U.N. at its core, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, safeguard the WTO-centered multilateral trading system, oppose hegemony and power politics, and promote an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization.- -The Chinese side will within the framework of South-South cooperation continue to provide assistance and support within its capacity to Samoa's climate response through bilateral and multilateral channels. The two sides will deepen cooperation in disaster prevention and mitigation and emergency management and will cooperate to build a low carbon demonstration zone for addressing climate change under South-South cooperation.- -The two sides agreed to deepen practical maritime cooperation in ocean observation and forecasting, marine disaster prevention and mitigation, marine ecosystem protection and restoration, marine spatial planning, blue economy and other fields, consider a blue partnership, and promote the building of a sustainable maritime community.

Xinhua reports: -China is ready to work with Samoa to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, further deepen political mutual trust, firmly support each other's core interests, strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation, and constantly enrich the connotation of China-Samoa comprehensive strategic partnership, he said. Li pointed out that China is willing to strengthen the synergy of development strategies with Samoa, expand economic and trade cooperation, promote trade and investment facilitation, strengthen cooperation on agriculture, fisheries, clean energy, and disaster prevention and mitigation, and promote common development and prosperity.

Han said: -President Xi Jinping has emphasized that maintaining the resilience and stability of global industrial and supply chains is an important guarantee for promoting world economic development. Over the years, China has been not only a participant and beneficiary of global industrial and supply chain cooperation but also a steadfast defender and builder, making active contributions to global economic development. China continues to improve its industrial system, providing strong support for the operation of global industrial and supply chains; adheres to open cooperation, injecting continuous momentum into global industrial and supply chains; and leverages its ultra-large-scale market, opening vast space for the operation of global industrial and supply chains. China is willing to work with all countries to promote the establishment of an open global economic system and to ensure the stability and smooth operation of global industrial and supply chains.- ，，。，、，、，。，；，；，。，. Han then made three points: China will adhere to the correct direction of economic globalization, promote industrial and production capacity cooperation with various countries, and better achieve mutual promotion of industries, shared benefits, and win-win development. China will deeply implement its innovation-driven development strategy, accelerate the development of new quality productive forces, and create greater opportunities for cooperation to foster the deep integration of industrial and supply chains. China is willing to expand cooperation with various countries in green industries, clean energy and other fields to help the world's green development. 。，。，、，、、。，。，，。，。、，. Subscribe now Page 2: There is an important Zhong Yin commentary today discussing the spate of recent knife and car attacks that have taken place in China. The fact that we are seeing this commentary is an indication of the serious concern at the highest levels about the increase in these incidents. The article, however, is rather shallow. There is no reflection about policy issues, economic or social, that are leading to the rise in such crimes. Rather, the call is to intensify crackdowns and prevention at source to remedial actions. The article says: -Recently, several extreme cases endangering public safety have occurred one after another, with their nature being exceptionally vile. In this regard, we must learn profound lessons, draw broader conclusions from specific instances, and maintain a high level of vigilance as if treading on thin ice, strengthen the prevention of risks at their source, intensify efforts in combating, managing, and preventing such incidents, and strive with all efforts to safeguard the lives and safety of the people and maintain social stability.- ，。，、，，，，. -Nothing is more precious than the lives and safety of the people. Innocent citizens suffering harm and vibrant lives being abruptly lost are profoundly shocking and heartbreaking! The public deeply empathises with the pain of the victims and their families and strongly condemns these extreme, retaliatory crimes against society. There is a unified call for the perpetrators to be punished severely in accordance with the law to serve as a deterrent. People from all walks of life have extended a helping hand, doing their utmost to treat the injured, save lives, and minimize harm to the greatest extent possible. Defending life and preventing crime have become a shared understanding and collective action.- 。，，、！，，。，、，，、. -Using extreme actions to retaliate against society and harm others is utterly unforgivable. Such criminals who obliterate humanity and conscience are despicable. Regardless of any personal reasons, any attempts to excuse such extreme behavior have no rationality, no legitimacy, will not obtain any person's understanding or sympathy, and will only receive universal condemnation and disdain. Venting personal grievances by targeting innocent people's lives and seeking attention through extreme means are actions that leave an eternal stain of infamy. They solve no problems but instead expose the perpetrators' inner malice and depravity, permanently nailing them to the pillar of shame. What awaits them is the stern punishment of the law and the contempt of the public.- ，，。，、，，，。，，，，、，。，，. The commentary then says that we must never relax or waver in safeguarding people's lives. -Party committees and governments at all levels must earnestly implement the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping and the decisions of the Party Central Committee. They must bear in mind that public safety is the most fundamental aspect of people's livelihoods and must put the protection of people's lives and safety in a more important position. They must severely crack down on extreme criminal acts in accordance with the law without mercy and severe violent crimes must be punished with a heavy hand, leaving no opportunity for any criminal to exploit. It is imperative to fully assume the political responsibility of ‘promoting local development and ensuring local safety'. We must adhere to and develop the Fengqiao Experience in the new era, building a comprehensive governance mechanism to address social conflicts that includes prevention at the source, investigation and screening, dispute resolution, and emergency response. A robust public safety protection network should be established, along with improved systems for social psychological services and crisis intervention, to fully safeguard the peace and stability of the broader social landscape.- ，、。，，，、，，，-、-。--，、、、，，，. The article ends by saying that -each of us is a beneficiary of social stability and should also be a guardian of public safety. We must take a clear stand against actions that harm social stability, fulfil our social responsibilities, be law-abiding citizens, cherish the hard-won safe environment, and work together to foster a harmonious and friendly social atmosphere.- ，，，、，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: There's a report on Wang Yi's meeting with Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto in Beijing. Xinhua says: -Wang said the practical bilateral cooperation has yielded fruitful results, which fully demonstrates that as long as there is mutual respect, trust, and support, economic cooperation between the two sides will enjoy broad prospects. Wang expressed the hope that the new European Union institutions will adhere to the orientation and cooperative tone of the China-EU partnership, view China's development objectively, pursue a positive and pragmatic policy toward China, and promote the sustained, healthy, and stable development of China-EU relations.- On the issue of China's ties with Europe, do note this SCMP report: -The European Union and China are not close to finalising a deal that would end their long-running electric vehicle dispute, according to a senior EU official, who called reports suggesting otherwise -confusing-. -I think there have been some quite confusing reports about the imminent deal on battery electric vehicles,- said Sabine Weyand, the EU's director general for trade, said in Brussels on Tuesday. -We have had 50 hours of discussions with our Chinese counterparts. They were constructive, but they have not led to an agreement on price undertakings. And there are structural issues that remain unresolved,- she said. The dispute concerns an anti-subsidy investigation conducted over the course of a year by the European Commission. The inquiry found that Beijing had distributed substantial state subsidies across China's electric vehicle sector and led to the EU imposing countervailing duties on EV imports from China at the end of October. The commission argues that the subsidies have assisted in China's enormous growth in the sector and fears that if allowed to continue unfettered, the underpriced imports will harm the sales of Europe's own EV industry. The tariffs, which range from 7 per cent for Tesla to a top end of 35.3 per cent for state-owned SAIC, have become a huge bone of contention in the EU-China relationship. Some EU member states – including Germany, Sweden and Spain – have urged the commission to negotiate a settlement which would make some tariff reductions in exchange for a commitment from Chinese companies to set a minimum price on EVs sold in the EU. The trade dispute has spread to other sectors too, with Beijing retaliating by launching anti-dumping probes against EU brandy, dairy and pork shipments.- Meanwhile, the European Union on Monday formally launched a challenge at the World Trade Organization against China's move to impose anti-dumping measures on brandy imported from the bloc. Share Tracking People's Daily Another report worth noting on the page is the visit of a CPC delegation to Sri Lanka from November 23 to 26. Xinhua reports that the delegation was led by ILD deputy head Sun Haiyan. -During the visit, the delegation met with Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya, as well as the main leaders of the ruling and opposition parties and representatives of parliamentarians. During the meetings, the delegation introduced the spirit of the third plenary session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, and had in-depth exchanges with the Sri Lankan side on China-Sri Lanka relations and cooperation in various fields. Expressing its firm commitment to a friendly policy toward China, the Sri Lankan side hoped to deepen cooperation in various fields between China and Sri Lanka, share China's development opportunities, further strengthen inter-party relations and exchanges of experience in governance, and promote the comprehensive development and expansion of China-Sri Lanka relations.- Subscribe now Page 4: Two reports to note. First, there's a report informing that the People's Bank of China, National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Ministry of Transport, State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, and the State Financial Regulatory Administration held a meeting recently to step up the implementation of loan policies for scientific and technological innovation and technological transformation. The report says that in April this year, the People's Bank of China, together with the Ministry of Science and Technology and other departments, set up a 500 billion yuan re-lending facility to support scientific and technological innovation and technological transformation. Since relevant policies were issued, -as of November 15, banks have signed loan contracts with 1,737 enterprises and projects totaling nearly 400 billion yuan-. The report says that financial institutions have made independent decisions on these loans. For the loans that meet the requirements, the PBOC can issue re-lending funds to financial institutions amounting to 60% of the loan principal. The report adds: -In line with the meeting's directives, banking institutions will fully leverage policy resources to comprehensively support listed enterprises and projects, ensuring maximum coverage of financial support. They will focus on improving the efficiency of loan review and disbursement, optimizing mechanisms and processes, enhancing resource allocation, revising and refining credit management policies based on the latest industrial policy standards, establishing a ‘green channel' for loan review and approval, and developing loan products that better align with the financing needs of startup technology companies and small-to-medium-sized enterprises undergoing technological transformation. This includes expanding the range of acceptable collateral and accelerating loan signing and investment timelines. The PBOC's branch offices will work closely with relevant government departments, strategically directing more support towards private and small-to-medium enterprises. By implementing nuanced, targeted approaches, they aim to enhance the efficiency of financial institution-business interactions and create a more supportive environment for financial services.- ，，-、-；，，，，--，，，。，，，. Second, there's a report on the new 5G plan, which aims that by the end of 2027, there will be 38 5G base stations per 10,000 people, the penetration rate of 5G individual users will exceed 85%, the proportion of 5G network access traffic will exceed 75%, and the number of 5G IoT terminal connections will exceed 100 million.

Preventing Food Waste - Li Qiang Meets CEOs on Supply Chain Stability - Coordinating Development & Security - CPC-CEEC Political Parties Dialogue	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Tuesday, November 26, 2024. Page 1: There's a report on the publication of the full action plan for food conservation and the reduction of food waste is published in the paper today. The plan seeks to establish a more sound long-term mechanism by the end of 2027. Xinhua reports that: -The loss rates of grain and food during their production, storage, transportation and processing will be below the average international levels by the end of 2027. Meanwhile, per capita food waste per meal in the catering industry, government canteens, school canteens and enterprise canteens will decrease significantly, and food waste will be effectively curbed.- I am not detailing the entire document. But I thought this was interesting, because it identifies certain incentives to encourage reduced consumption. -Encourage consumers to purchase small-portion meals through methods such as establishing environmental protection virtual accounts, granting conservation points, and issuing discount coupons, etc. Support food producers, operators, retailers and others to directly donate food that meets safety and quality requirements to welfare institutions and assistance institutions in their locality on a regular basis. Strictly implement price tagging regulations, with catering service operators clearly indicating to consumers the prices of the catering and services provided, as well as prices of individual dishes within set meals. Encourage catering service operators hosting banquets to negotiate anti-food waste obligations with consumers, with contracts able to include a separate anti-waste clause.- 、、。、、。，、。，. The document also calls to -make food conservation an important part of the life of the Communist Youth League and the Young Pioneers-, as part of a campaign of Youth Guarding China's Grain. In addition, it calls to -integrate food security education and thrift education into ideological and political courses, national conditions education and other educational and teaching activities in primary, secondary and high schools…- --，、，--，。、、，、，，、. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, a report on the page informs that the Arabic language version of a book featuring discourses on Chinese modernization by President Xi Jinping has been published by the Central Compilation and Translation Press. The book collects a series of important discourses by Xi between November 2012 and October 2023. Third, there's a report with Li Qiang's comments at a symposium with representatives of enterprises and organizations participating in the upcoming second China International Supply Chain Expo. Xinhua says that present at the symposium were representatives of Apple Inc., Rio Tinto, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd. and the US-China Business Council, among others. Li told them that -China is a key link in the global supply chain and will continue to take practical actions to maintain the stability and smoothness of the global supply chain.- He added that -while global economic growth now lacks momentum, certain protectionist acts and moves that overstretch the concept of security continue to damage global industrial and supply chains, pushing up corporate costs further, reducing economic efficiency and hindering common development…Li called for firm efforts to safeguard stable, unimpeded global industrial and supply chains, as well as the common interests of all parties.- He then said: -Since the beginning of this year, China's economic operation has been generally stable and steady. We will continue to increase counter-cyclical adjustments, promote the continued improvement of China's economy, continuously cultivate and strengthen new momentum, and solidly promote high-quality development, so as to contribute more to deepening global supply chain cooperation and promoting global economic recovery. We will accelerate the construction of a modern industrial system, and continue to provide solid support for the efficient operation of the global supply chain with stronger supporting capabilities and more stable production capacity supply. We will focus on strengthening the deep integration of scientific and technological innovation and industrial innovation, better integrate into international innovation cooperation, and continue to provide strong momentum for the transformation and upgrading of the global supply chain. We will firmly promote high-level opening up to the outside world, further expand market access, welcome more foreign companies to carry out industrial cooperation in China, and continue to provide a broad space for the expansion of global supply chain cooperation.- ，，。，、，，，，，、。，、，。，，。，，，.

As reported on Page 1, Bettel also met with Ding Xuexiang and with ILD chief Liu Jianchao. Xinhua's report on the Wang-Bettel meeting says: -China speaks highly of Luxembourg's positive and practical policy toward China, and stands ready to work with Luxembourg to consolidate political mutual trust, enhance complementarity, create new growth points for green development cooperation, increase people-to-people exchanges and push for further progress in bilateral relations, he said. Wang noted that next year marks the 50th anniversary of China-EU diplomatic relations. China and the EU are partners not rivals, he said, expressing the hope that the EU side will uphold its strategic autonomy. China is willing to work with Luxembourg to promote the sustained and sound development of China-EU relations, Wang said. Bettel said that Luxembourg firmly adheres to the one-China principle and looks forward to closer cooperation with China. As one of the founding members of the EU, Luxembourg is willing to enhance EU-China mutual trust and promote EU-China partnership. Bettel noted that China is a major country worthy of trust, voicing the hope that China will play a bigger role in world peace and stability.- Next, there's a report on the CPC's Dialogue with Political Parties of Central and Eastern European Countries. Xinhua reports: -Noting that the 2021 China-CEEC Summit outlined a blueprint for the development of China-CEEC relations, Liu Jianchao, head of the International Department of the CPC Central Committee, said that the CPC is willing to work with CEEC political parties to deepen strategic and theoretical communication, tap into the potential of relevant cooperation platforms, and promote the quality and effectiveness of China-CEEC cooperation. The foreign attendees said that China's development path has provided an alternative approach to development for the world, and that they are willing to strengthen exchange and dialogue with the CPC to enhance mutual understanding, and to promote the development of Europe-China relations. The event was themed ‘China's Modernization and New Opportunities for China-CEEC Relations: Contribution of Political Parties' and attracted nearly 50 representatives of 19 political parties in 12 countries across Central and Eastern Europe.- Finally, there's a report on He Lifeng's meeting with Senior Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong in Suzhou. Xinhua says: He said that -the two sides should focus on the new positioning of bilateral relations, make full use of cooperation platforms such as the Suzhou Industrial Park, and work together to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries. Noting that Singapore-China relations have been deepening with strong development momentum under the guidance of the two countries' top leaders, Lee said Singapore is willing to work with China to push for new development in major cooperative projects, and further consolidate and upgrade bilateral relations. The two senior officials also attended the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park High-Quality Development Forum on Monday. The two sides comprehensively reviewed the achievements of the park in the past 30 years, and mapped out the direction and focus of cooperation for its next stage. They agreed the two countries should give better play to the pioneering role of the park, deepen institutional reform, and work together to build a world-class science and technology park that is open and innovative. They also witnessed the signing of cooperation documents.- Leave a comment Page 9: There's an article by He Yiting, from the Research Center for Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era of the Central Party School, discussing the significance of national security. He writes that: -In a certain sense, the history of human social development is also the history of human efforts to achieve and satisfy security needs, and to promote societal development in relative stability. Security also reflects the level of human civilization, especially at the national and social levels, where humans increasingly view security as the foundation of civilizational progress. It is precisely this concept of security that motivates human society as a whole to continuously pursue tranquility, stability, and peace, striving to eliminate various conflicts, chaos, and disorder. Security is like air and sunlight - beneficial without being noticed, but difficult to survive without.- ，、。，，。、，、。，，. National security is the foundation of national rejuvenation and an important cornerstone of stabilizing the country. With the deepening of economic globalization and the development of human civilization, the connotation and extension of security are constantly expanding. Today, national security mainly refers to the state power, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity, people's well-being, sustainable economic and social development and other major interests of the country being relatively free from danger and internal and external threats, as well as the ability to guarantee such a continuous state of security. National security is not only the goal pursued by all the people, but also an important foundation for national development and the fundamental guarantee for the happiness and well-being of the people. ，。，。，、、、、，。，. Subscribe now In the second section, He adds that -one of the keys to achieving modernization is to properly handle the relationship between development and security-; -high-quality development must promote high-level security, and high-level security must be used to ensure high-quality development-. He adds: -Development is the foundation and purpose of security. Only by continuously promoting high-quality development can there be a solid material foundation for people to live and work in peace, for society to be stable and orderly, and for the country to enjoy long-term peace and security, and only then can powerful force support for achieving high-level security be provided. Security is the condition and guarantee of development. If a country cannot hold its security baseline, its political regime may be overturned at any time, its core interests may be invaded at any time, and economic and social development may be interrupted or stagnate at any time. Adhering to the equal emphasis on development and security must mean adhering to the overall planning of development and security as two major matters, being adept at using development achievements to reinforce the strength foundation of national security, and being adept at shaping a security environment favorable to economic and social development. At present, China has entered a period prone to various contradictions and risks. Advancing Chinese-style modernization requires balancing development and security, focusing on resolving various contradictions and problems, and effectively fighting a strategic proactive battle to turn dangers into safety and crises into opportunities.- 。，、、，。。，，，。，，，。，，，，、. This next bit is important: -Achieving high-quality development is the essential requirement of Chinese-style modernization. Development is the Party's top priority in governing and rejuvenating the country. Without the improvement of material conditions through development, it would be impossible to achieve the remarkable accomplishments of Chinese-style modernization, let alone gain broad support from the people. Properly handling the relationship between development and security means we cannot discuss security without development, nor can we halt development due to the existence of risks. Our country is the largest developing nation in the world, and development is the foundation and key to solving all problems. On the new journey, resolving prominent contradictions and problems and preventing and defusing various risks ultimately rely on development. Only by promoting the sustained and healthy development of the economy and society can we lay a solid material foundation for the prosperity of the country, the happiness and well-being of the people, and the harmony and stability of society. This requires the complete, accurate and comprehensive implementation of the new development concept, adhering to the general tone of work of seeking progress while maintaining stability, taking the promotion of high-quality development as the theme, deepening supply-side structural reform as the main line, reform and innovation as the fundamental driving force, and meeting the people's growing needs for a better life as the fundamental purpose, constantly enhancing China's economic strength, scientific and technological strength, and comprehensive national strength, and providing a more solid foundation and conditions for achieving higher levels and higher levels of security.- 。。，，。，，。，。，，，。，、、。、、，，，，，，、、，. Achieving high-level security is an important guarantee of Chinese-style modernization. Ensuring people live and work in peace and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation are inseparable from high-level security guarantees. High-level security is both an inherent requirement of achieving high-quality development and an important yardstick for measuring developmental effectiveness. Without high-level security guarantees, development is like a tree without roots, and the development achievements already made in modernization construction may be lost. With the high-quality advancement of Chinese-style modernization and the continuous expansion of high-level opening up, various foreseeable and unforeseeable risk factors have increased significantly. We must enhance awareness of opportunities and risks, estimate difficulties more fully, think about risks more deeply, grasp contradictions more comprehensively and thoroughly, strengthen foundations, leverage advantages, make up for shortcomings, and reinforce weaknesses in the process of advancing Chinese-style modernization, effectively preventing and responding to potential systemic risks, and guaranteeing the continuous stability of high-quality development through the controllability of one's own security. We must be adept at integrating various conditions and utilizing diverse resources, effectively identifying risk factors across broad spatial and temporal dimensions, reasonably allocating resources between security and development, clarifying the methods for addressing and resolving national security issues, and effectively safeguarding national security.- 。、，。，。，，。、，。，，，，、、、，，。、，，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily In the final section, He writes that to effectively address the challenges of this era, one must adhere to the -overall national security concept as the fundamental guideline, better coordinate development and security, solidly promote the modernization of the national security system and capabilities, strive to build a higher level of safe China, and provide strong security guarantees for Chinese-style modernization.- ，，，，，. He makes three points: First, implement the overall national security concept. He calls this -a powerful ideological weapon and action guide for safeguarding and shaping- China's security. He says that it is important to -integrate the maintenance of national security into all aspects of the work of the Party and the state-. -Adhering to the Party's absolute leadership over national security work is the fundamental principle for ensuring the success of national security efforts and the fundamental guarantee for safeguarding national security and social stability. We must uphold the Party's absolute leadership over national security work, prioritize the prevention and resolution of national security risks, and coordinate the advancement of security across various domains. We must adhere to the principle of people-centered security as our purpose, political security as the foundation, economic security as the basis, and military, technological, cultural, and social security as safeguards, and promote international security as the support, integrating external and internal security, territorial and citizen security, traditional and non-traditional security, self-security and collective security, coordinate the maintenance and shaping of national security, consolidate the grassroots foundation of national security and social stability, improve the mechanism for participating in global security governance, and safeguard the new development pattern with a new security pattern.- ，，。，，。、、、、，、、、，，，，. Second, establish the correct thinking for maintaining national security. It is necessary to establish the strategic awareness of ‘a game of chess', base ourselves on China and look to the world, and effectively respond to the new situations, new problems and new challenges brought about by the changes in the domestic and international environments by coordinating the domestic and international situations and utilizing domestic and international resources. Adhere to using systematic thinking to grasp the main thread of national security work, comprehensively analyzing security issues and their mutual influences in multiple domains such as politics, military, economy, finance, culture, society, science and technology, network, food, and ecology, placing various types of security within the overall national development framework for coordinated planning, continuously enhancing the ability to shape national security situations, coordinating the relationship between high-quality development and high-level security, promoting linkage and integration of national security work in all aspects, jointly constructing a comprehensive security pattern. Adhere to bottom line thinking and extreme-case thinking, be prepared for danger in times of peace, and use high-probability thinking to deal with low-probability events, having both proactive risk prevention and high-level strategies for responding to and resolving risks and challenges, fighting a well-prepared battle to prevent and resist risks, firmly maintaining the bottom line of not allowing systemic risks to occur. Adhere to using legal thinking and legal means to consolidate ruling position, improve governing methods, enhance governing capabilities, better leveraging the fundamental, stabilizing, and far-reaching guarantee role of rule of law, ensuring long-term peace and stability for the Party and the country, guaranteeing orderly advancement of Chinese-style modernization through comprehensive rule of law. Adhere to dialectical thinking, enhance national security strength through development, and deepen the innovation of national security ideas, systems, and means, create a safe environment conducive to economic and social development, and strive to achieve a dynamic balance between development and security. 。--，、，、，。，、、、、、、、、、，，，，，。，、，，，，，。、、，、、，，。，，、、，，. Third, promote the modernization of the national security system and capabilities. In this context, He calls to -strengthen the coordination mechanism for national security work, improve the national security legal system, strategic system, policy system, and risk monitoring and early warning system, improve the security guarantee system in key areas and the coordination and command system for important projects, and build a coordinated and efficient national security protection system.- ，，、、、，，. He also calls to improve public security governance mechanism, emergency response guarantee system, improve the food and drug safety responsibility system, improve the biosafety supervision early warning and prevention and control system, strengthen the network security system construction, and establish an AI safety supervision system. He also wants to improve the Fengqiao Experience in the new era, social work system and mechanism, the legalization of petition work, urban social governance capacity, and social organization management system. The final bit is this: -Improve foreign-related national security mechanisms, establish and refine coordination mechanisms for peripheral security work, strengthen early warning, prevention, control, and protection systems for risks related to overseas interests and investments, deepen international law enforcement cooperation in the field of security, safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of our citizens and legal entities abroad, improve mechanisms for counter-sanctions, counter-interference, and countering ‘long-arm jurisdiction', enhance mechanisms for safeguarding maritime rights and interests, and improve mechanisms for participating in global security governance.- ，，、、，，、，、、--，，.

Messages from Xi's APEC, G20 Visits - Discussing the Building of the Chinese Discourse and Narrative System	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, November 25, 2024. Page 1: Today's front page carries two feature articles discussing Xi's trips to Peru and Brazil. The first article talks about his visit to Lima for the APEC summit. It says that: -The diplomatic footprints of this great Eastern power demonstrate its pioneering and enterprising spirit, its vision and responsibility, and reflect its growing international influence, appeal and shaping power.- The first part of the article talks about some of the key developments: China-Peru ties were upgraded to a comprehensive strategic partnership. Since Xi's last visit to Peru in 2016, bilateral trade volume has increased by 1.6 times, and the stock of Chinese companies' investment in Peru has doubled, bringing tangible benefits to the people of both countries. 15 years ago, Peru became the first Latin American country to sign a package of FTAs with China. During this visit, the two sides formally signed the protocol to upgrade the free trade agreement. The two heads of state attended the opening ceremony of the Port of Chancay. The second part deals with APEC: The article reiterates that economic globalisation was the theme of Xi's speech. It quotes this bit from Xi's speech: -Economic globalization is an objective requirement of growing social productive forces. It is a natural outcome of advancement in science and technology and a mighty historical trend. Despite headwinds and undertows, economic globalization has always been the general trend. The attempt to block economic cooperation under all sorts of pretexts and break up the interdependence of the world is nothing but backpedaling. Economic globalization is caught now in a tug of war between driving and obstructive forces, but the driving forces still prevail.- And this: -We should steer economic globalization in the right direction. We must reject the beaten path that a few countries have taken to pursue dominance and hegemony. We should see to it that economic globalization generates more positive outcomes and is taken to a new phase that is more dynamic, inclusive and sustainable.- There's this quote when talking about economic globalisation: -The world watches and sighs: -China is the true leader of openness and cooperation- ... -Chairman Xi makes us feel China's stability and reliability- … -The world needs leaders like Chairman Xi-... ，：------… The final section deals with Xi's bilateral meetings, beginning with the meeting with Biden. The article says: Over the past 4 years, although China-US relations have experienced ups and downs, they have also carried out dialogue and cooperation, and overall achieved stability. 4，，，. President Xi listed seven experiences and inspirations that the two countries should draw from the course of their relations, i.e., to have a correct strategic perception, match words with actions, treat each other as equals, not to challenge red lines and paramount principles, conduct more dialogue and cooperation, respond to the expectations of the people, and step forward to shoulder the responsibilities of major countries. ，7：，、，，、，，，. The report adds: -The dust has settled on the US election, and the world is paying close attention to the future direction of China-US relations. ‘China is willing to continue to maintain dialogue, expand cooperation, and manage differences with the US government, and strive to achieve a smooth transition in China-US relations for the benefit of the people of both countries', President Xi Jinping clarified his position. ，。-、、，，。-. It also talks about Xi's argument for the four unchanged: China's goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged. Its commitment to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation as principles for handling China-U.S. relations remains unchanged. Its position of resolutely safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests remains unchanged. And its desire to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples remains unchanged.- The piece then talks about Xi's other bilateral meetings. It ends with this: -Each dazzling achievement in cooperation makes the world more certain that China is not only an ancient civilization, but also an opportunity for prosperity and a model for development. Each firm policy declaration also makes the Asia-Pacific and the world more convinced that ‘the next ‘China' will still be China'. Listen to these Chinese voices resonating on the grand stage of Asia-Pacific cooperation: ‘China will comprehensively deepen reform and continue to inject strong momentum into the global economy'; ‘China will promote high-quality development and continue to lead the world economy in improving quality and efficiency'; ‘China will unswervingly follow the path of green development and continue to provide important momentum for global green transformation'; ‘China will build a new system of open economy at a higher level and continue to share China's development opportunities with the world'; ‘China welcomes all parties to continue riding China's development express train, develop together with China's economy, and work together to achieve modernization of all countries in the world characterized by peaceful development, mutual benefit and cooperation, and common prosperity' ... Some scholars point out that unlike the historical ‘rise of great powers', China's development is the rise of a ‘civilizational state'. Having seen so many landscapes and experienced so many storms, Chinese civilization has, over more than 5,000 years, forged a progressive spirit, an inclusive mindset, and an unwavering belief in peaceful development.- ，，，、。，，-‘'，-。：-，-；-，-；-，-；-，-；-，，、、-……，--，--。，，5000，、、. The second article deals with the G20 summit in Rio. The first section talks about poverty alleviation and covers Xi's speech in which he talks about It says that China's achievements provide -accumulation of poverty alleviation experience and innovation in poverty reduction methods- along with giving the Global South -confidence and hope from China's story.- ，、，--，. Share Tracking People's Daily The second section says that in his other speech, Xi made the -most systematic and complete exposition on the issue of global governance reform.- The article adds: -Every step is a choice for the future. In the face of increasingly intense competition between economic globalisation and anti-globalisation, the world expects the G20 to make the right choice: continuously promoting the liberalisation and facilitation of trade and investment, avoiding the politicisation of economic issues and the artificial fragmentation of global markets, and refraining from using the banner of green and low-carbon initiatives to implement protectionism ... These voices are not only China's proposals but have also become a harmonious chorus gathering strength from more and more contributors.- ，。，G20。，、，、……，，. It adds: -Looking around the world today, governance deficits are often closely related to fairness deficits. The international balance of power has undergone profound changes, and the long-delayed reform of the global governance system is imperative … China firmly advocates guiding the reform of global governance with the principles of fairness and justice. ‘Building a just world requires the G20 to uphold the principles of mutual respect, equal cooperation, and win-win outcomes, supporting the ‘Global South' countries in achieving greater development. Within and beyond the venue, the resonance and support for China's proposals are unceasing…- ，。，，。，。：-，、、，‘'。-，：---，-……，，-，-. The next few sections simply recap Xi's bilateral meetings. I've covered those over the past week. Next, there's a report on the publication of a new book on Xi's discourses on law-based governance of the military. Xinhua says: -The discourses were excerpted from speeches and written works by Xi between November 2012 and June 2024. The CMC has urged military officers and soldiers at all levels to thoroughly study the book and especially required senior officers to play an exemplary role in respecting, learning about, observing and applying laws.- As this Economist article notes, data from China Media Project shows that in his first decade in power, around 120 volumes of Xi's discourses have been published. Subscribe now Page 3: There's a report on the BRI emergency rescue drill for Pacific Island countries being held in Jiangmen City, Guangdong, on Sunday. A total of 300 participants, including emergency rescue teams from 8 Pacific Island countries and Chinese rescue teams took part in the drill. Subscribe now Page 9: The entire page is dedicated to articles drawn from the Fifth High-End Forum on Chinese Discourse, which was held in Jinan, Shandong Province. This was organised by the Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era Research Center at the Central Party School, the School of Marxism of the Central Party School, Chinese Marxism Research Foundation, and Shandong University. The first piece is by Hao Lixin from the School of Philosophy at Renmin University of China. Hao writes: -Accelerating the construction of the Chinese discourse and narrative system is an inevitable requirement of advancing Chinese-style modernization, an urgent necessity for enhancing the international influence of Chinese culture, and an important manifestation of the developmental laws of modern civilization. This profoundly reflects the dialectical relationship between cognition and practice, and embodies the adherence to and development of Marxist epistemology.- ，，，。，. -The Chinese discourse and Chinese narrative system is a cultural expression based on Chinese practice. The discourse system mainly refers to the cognitive relationships between expression, interpretation, evaluation and acceptance, understanding, recognition that people establish through linguistic symbols in practice and cultural exchange, including two basic aspects of discourse content and form, specifically manifested as certain thoughts, viewpoints, concepts and modes of expression. The narrative system mainly refers to the sum of narrative processes, narrative elements and narrative methods for certain objects, texts, and facts. The Chinese discourse and Chinese narrative system, based on Chinese practice, has distinctive Chinese characteristics, Chinese style, and Chinese manner, possessing both significant national character and prominent global character.- 。，、、、、，，、、。、、、。，、、，，. Hao adds: -Why should we construct Chinese discourse and Chinese narrative system, and how should we construct Chinese discourse and Chinese narrative system? The answer lies in the practice of Chinese-style modernization, in the interactive relationship between China and the world, and in the development process of mutual influence between Chinese civilization and world civilization. Engels pointed out: ‘Civilization is a matter of practice.' In the process of creating a new form of human civilization and in further opening up to the outside world, China's connection with the world is becoming closer and cultural exchanges are increasingly frequent. Practical development requires us to present a true, multi-dimensional, and comprehensive China to the world, and better express and contribute Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions. However, in reality, our international communication still faces problems such as insufficient appeal and influence in the construction of discourse and narrative systems. Facing modernization, facing the world, and facing the future are important directions for constructing China's discourse and narrative system; responding to issues of modernization, world issues, and future issues are important topics in constructing China's discourse and narrative system; better adapting to the needs of practical development and civilizational exchange and mutual learning, focusing on enhancing the appeal and influence of discourse and narrative, are important tasks in constructing China's discourse and narrative system.- 。，？，，。：--。，，，，、、，。，、。、、，；、，；、，、，. Hao also says that -Accurately and concisely summarising and expressing Chinese practices and experiences, and telling China's story well, is aimed at enabling the world to comprehensively and authentically understand China's development and the changes in the lives of the Chinese people, to grasp Chinese-style modernization and the new forms of human civilization, and to create favourable conditions for both China's development and global progress.- 、，，，，. Subscribe now In the second section, Hao calls for -highlighting cultural subjectivity- when constructing the Chinese discourse and narrative system. In this context, he calls to: Adhere to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Culture, strengthen cultural confidence, uphold openness and tolerance, and adhere to the principle of maintaining integrity while pursuing innovation. Strengthening cultural confidence is specifically manifested in adhering to one's own path, achieving independence in spirit and discourse, and taking the construction of an independent knowledge system of Chinese philosophy and social sciences as the theoretical basis for building Chinese discourse and Chinese narrative system. Adhering to openness and tolerance is reflected in maintaining a broad mind and looking at the world, and treating all the outstanding achievements of human civilization with an open mind. Adhering to the principle of maintaining integrity while pursuing innovation is reflected in adhering to the position of Chinese culture, inheriting the genes of Chinese culture, and constantly exploring and innovating in light of new situations and new problems on the basis of adhering to the path of socialist cultural development with Chinese characteristics, and constantly achieving new breakthroughs in building Chinese discourse and Chinese narrative system. ，、、。，，，。，、，。，，，，、，. Adopt different discourse methods, narrative methods, and carrier channels based on different objects and different situations, and vividly present the Chinese-style modernization that leads the trend in the process of world modernization and the Chinese civilization that shines in the world's garden of civilization. ，，、、，、. Understand that -generally speaking, the construction of discourse and narrative systems in international communication and cultural exchange should possess characteristics of objectivity, uniqueness, specificity, compatibility, complementarity, and vividness. Among these, objectivity mainly refers to authenticity, which is the prerequisite for discourse and narrative to have influence. Uniqueness mainly refers to the cultural characteristics formed by different ethnic groups and countries in the long historical evolution. Specificity mainly implies that discourse and narrative should be concrete and clear, rather than remaining at the level of empty language and abstract grand narratives. Compatibility mainly refers to the fact that both parties in cultural exchange should be easily understood by each other in terms of discourse semantics, narrative content and form, and should be able to generate a certain resonance in expression. Complementarity mainly refers to discourse and narrative between different subjects should have commensurability and mutual benefit. Vividness mainly refers to in the narrative process, there should be both rational exposition and emotional expression.- ，，、、、、、。，，。。，。、，。。，。 In the final section, Hao says: To build the Chinese discourse and narrative system, we need to follow the law of cognitive development. On this basis, we can refine the iconic concepts of Chinese discourse and grasp the key contents of Chinese narrative. The series of iconic concepts and original viewpoints contained in Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, such as ‘community of human destiny', ‘common values ​​of all mankind' and ‘new form of human civilization', provide scientific guidelines and practical examples for building Chinese discourse and narrative system. ，，，。------、，. To build a Chinese discourse and a Chinese narrative system, it is important to tell the story of Chinese-style modernization well…and make clear the historical inevitability, distinctive features and global significance of Chinese-style modernization, and that Chinese-style modernization is a major innovation in world modernization. ，，、，、，。 -Demonstrate the outstanding inclusiveness of Chinese civilization…Openness and inclusiveness are the cultural genes of the Chinese nation, and inclusiveness is the outstanding characteristic of Chinese civilization. In building the Chinese discourse and narrative system, it is necessary to deeply grasp the characteristics of the coexistence and integration of human civilization, highlight the remarkable inclusiveness of Chinese civilization, and showcase the values and ideas contained in Chinese culture, Chinese wisdom, and Chinese solutions, such as harmony without uniformity, and seeking common ground while reserving differences, and the profound wisdom of ‘all things grow together without harming each other, and all paths run parallel without contradicting each other'.- 。。、、，、，、。，。，、，，、、、，-，-。 In building the Chinese discourse and narrative system, it is important to grasp the logic, focus the narrative on people living in a community of shared future for mankind, take the personal feelings, real situations and common expectations of people from different countries and cultures in life as the entry point and foothold, integrate the values ​​generally accepted by the people into the construction of Chinese discourse and Chinese narrative system, and continuously enhance the empathy and appeal of the Chinese discourse and narrative system. ，，，、、，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's an article by Hu Daping from the School of Philosophy at Nanjing University. Hu writes about the principle of learning while keeping the world in mind. Hu laments, and I agree with this lament: -Today, China is increasingly approaching the centre of the world stage, and our international discourse power and cultural soft power continue to strengthen. The system of disciplines in our philosophy and social sciences is constantly improving, the research team is continuously growing, and the level of research and innovation capabilities is consistently advancing, with its influence in the international academic community and global society steadily increasing. In this process, the global vision of Chinese philosophy and social science workers is continuously expanding, and the spirit of openness is increasingly enhanced. Significant research achievements at the forefront of international academia have been made in many fields. At the same time, some issues and phenomena in domestic academia also require attention. For instance, some scholars are accustomed to ‘closing the door' to do their research, and they do not pay enough attention to new things, new phenomena, and new trends in the outside world, and lack the interest and awareness of deepening research. Some scholars become engrossed in obscure and cumbersome conceptual constructions, failing to explain clearly to themselves and making it difficult for others to understand, thus losing the openness and accessibility that philosophical and social science research should have. In reality, the so-called ‘world' is not an abstract and isolated existence. It manifests as the world where people coexist under the same sky, it manifests as people of the world pursuing a better life, and it manifests as vibrant, lively common practices. Without engaging with fresh and vivid life, and being confined to the mere words and phrases in books, the academic research loses the ‘liveliness' and practicality it should have. Without this, there can be no world in one's sight, and no ‘world' in one's heart, making the idea of doing research with a global perspective impossible to talk about.- ，，、。，，，。，、，。，，，--，、、，；，、，、。，--，，，。，，--，，，. Hu subsequently calls for adhering to -people-centred research orientation- and to recognize and understand the traditional culture of different nations. More importantly, Hu writes: -Adhering to doing scholarly work with a global perspective does not mean pursuing or catering to so-called ‘universality'. Instead, it involves approaching research with confidence and awareness of ‘what makes me, me' (what defines or constitutes one's unique self) while firmly upholding cultural and academic subjectivity. On this foundation, it seeks to understand and grasp the relationship between oneself and the external world, to discern regularity from universality and diversity from particularity. Through learning from and absorbing all the outstanding achievements of human civilization, it aims to safeguard Marxism as the spiritual core and China's excellent traditional culture as the foundational root, thereby promoting and developing philosophy and social sciences with Chinese characteristics.- ，--，--，，，、，，，.

Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: There's a report (English report) on Vice Premier He Lifeng meeting with Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser. He told her that -China is deepening the reform of its financial system and continuing to expand the high-level, two-way opening-up of its financial sector. China welcomes more foreign financial institutions and long-term capital, including Citigroup, to invest and do business in China, and to share opportunities and participate in the development of the country's financial market.- As per Xinhua, -Fraser said that Citigroup is optimistic about the prospects of China's economy and financial market, and is willing to explore the Chinese market further, contributing to the promotion of U.S.-China economic and trade cooperation and maintaining the healthy development of the global economy.- Next, there's a report on China, Brazil, South Africa and the African Union launching the Initiative on International Cooperation in Open Science. Xinhua says: -The initiative also aims to promote global scientific and technological innovation to benefit the Global South. It notes that the open and sustainable sci-tech innovation is conducive to enhancing the strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth of the global economy. The initiative proposes that governments, scientific communities, enterprises, non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders should support the free flow of sci-tech innovation personnel and resources on a global scale, and ensure that different stakeholders can equitably participate in and are treated fairly in the open science cause. Scientific knowledge should be publicly available, according to the initiative, which also states that scientific practices should be diverse, inclusive and sustainable. The initiative says that governments of all countries should increase investment in open science and encourage the cooperation, joint construction and sharing of major scientific research infrastructure.- Share Tracking People's Daily Third, there's a report on Defense Minister Dong Jun's speech at the ASEAN Defense Ministers' Plus Meeting. -The Asia-Pacific region remains generally stable, but the risk of being drawn into geopolitical conflicts is a real possibility. The strategic choices we make today will affect the future safety and well-being of the region and its people. All countries should join hands and work together to safeguard our shared beautiful homeland. Dong Jun stated that China is willing to work with all parties to resolutely consolidate ASEAN's central position, firmly support the improvement and upgrading of existing cooperation frameworks, and oppose ‘creating a new architecture' or forming ‘exclusive cliques'. China is committed to firmly maintain unity among regional countries, oppose bringing bloc politics and camp confrontation into the region. China firmly supports resolving problems through dialogue, opposes provoking disputes, resorting to force, ganging up together or even bringing in external forces. China is dedicated to deepen defense and security cooperation, promote the implementation of the Global Security Initiative in the region, and build a closer security community. In particular, China and ASEAN should take a long-term view to expand common maritime interests, conduct flexible and diverse maritime security cooperation, enhance joint capacity to maintain maritime security, and contribute to maintaining regional and even world peace and stability.- ，。。，。，，，，--、--。，、。，、、。，，。，，，. Subscribe now Dong also met with the defense ministers of India, Malaysia and New Zealand. There was no meeting between Dong and US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Beijing's official reasoning was as follows: -Senior Colonel Wu pointed out that the US can't damage China's core interests on the Taiwan question while seeking to communicate with the Chinese military as if nothing has happened. ‘It is imperative for the US to immediately correct its mistake, earnestly respect China's core interests, and strive to create favorable conditions for high-level exchanges between the two militaries.- (Note: This is clearly bunkum. It appears that Beijing wants to set new baselines for military talks with the incoming Trump administration. This likely is a step towards that.) The US Defense Secretary said: -It's unfortunate. It affects the region because the region really wants to see us, you know, two significant players in the region, two significant powers, talk to each other…I don't think that it has any sort of implications for the future. I just think that it's something that they chose to do at this point in time and only they can explain why they chose to not take advantage of a good opportunity.- Anyway, Dong did meet India's Defense Minister Rajnath Singh. I have not been able to locate a substantive Chinese readout. The Indian readout from that meeting says: -This was the first meeting of the two Defence Ministers following the recent disengagement agreements, and the meeting of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi &amp; Chinese President Mr Xi Jinping on the sidelines of BRICS summit. Raksha Mantri highlighted the fact that amicable relations between India and China, the two largest nations in the world, would have positive implications for global peace and prosperity. Considering that both countries are and will continue to remain neighbours, he mentioned that ‘we need to focus on cooperation rather than conflict'. Shri Rajnath Singh called for reflecting on the lessons learnt from the unfortunate border clashes of 2020, take measures to prevent recurrence of such events and safeguard peace and tranquility along the India-China border. He emphasised and looked forward to greater trust and confidence building between the two sides through de-escalation. Both sides agreed to work together towards a roadmap for rebuilding mutual trust and understanding.- Finally, there's a report on the 14th China-ASEAN Defense Ministers' Informal Meeting. The report says: -Dong Jun said that in recent years, under the strategic guidance of leaders from both sides, China-ASEAN security cooperation has not only benefited both parties but also the region and even the world. Regardless of how the international situation evolves, China will unswervingly work with ASEAN to strengthen solidarity and mutual trust, deepen practical cooperation, promote Eastern wisdom, properly manage differences, and always be good partners who share safety and risks and support each other. Maritime issues concern the common interests of all parties and require adopting a long-term strategic perspective, steadily advancing maritime security cooperation, and striving to transform contradictions and challenges into opportunities for cooperation.- ，，，—，。，，，，，，、。，，，. Dong also met with Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani. Kyodo reports: -Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told his Chinese counterpart, Dong Jun, that he is ‘seriously concerned' about the intensifying military activities near Japan, as they met in Laos months after an airspace breach involving a Chinese spy plane. Nakatani lodged a stern protest with China over the violation of Japan's airspace on Aug. 26 and demanded that it not be repeated, according to Japanese officials. However, the two agreed to promote dialogue between their defense authorities to foster ‘mutually beneficial' relations, as recently agreed by the countries' leaders. Noting that the two countries have various outstanding security issues, Nakatani said at the outset of the meeting, which was held on the sidelines of an annual regional security meeting, ‘It is extremely important to hold candid discussions between defense authorities and continue communications.' Dong agreed that face-to-face discussions between the two countries' defense authorities are important for the bilateral relationship and regional peace. However, he countered that China is concerned about Japan's actions on issues such as Taiwan, which Beijing views as a renegade province.- Share Tracking People's Daily First, the Ministry of Commerce issued a new notice with measures to support foreign trade. These include: First, insurance companies are encouraged to increase underwriting support for ‘little giant' and ‘hidden champion' firms in their efforts to expand to diversified markets, according to the notice. ‘Little giants' refer to the novel elites of China's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are engaged in manufacturing, specialising in a niche market and boasting cutting-edge technologies. ‘Hidden champions' refer to highly successful yet lesser-known SMEs that are global leaders in terms of market share in their respective niches. Second, banking institutions should continuously optimise financial services for foreign trade enterprises in areas such as credit approval, loan disbursement, and repayment while ensuring rigorous verification of trade authenticity and effective risk management. Third, financial institutions are encouraged to increase financing support for micro, small and medium-sized companies based on market-oriented and law-based principles, said the notice. Fourth, efforts should be made to optimise cross-border trade settlement, promote the development of cross-border e-commerce, expand agricultural product exports, and support the imports of key equipment and energy resources. Second, Xinhua reports that -China's Ministry of Public Security on Thursday declared that all large-scale telecom fraud centers located near the China-Myanmar border in northern Myanmar had been wiped out. Over 53,000 Chinese nationals suspected of telecom frauds have been arrested with cooperative efforts from Chinese and Myanmar police since the ministry launched a crackdown on telecom frauds in northern Myanmar last year, the ministry said in a statement. In a recent coup, 1,079 telecom fraud suspects were arrested in northern Myanmar's Tangyan area for the first time. The suspects were caught during a joint operation by police of southwest China's Yunnan Province and local law enforcers of Myanmar. All of the 763 Chinese citizens among them have been handed over to China, the ministry said, calling the operation another breakthrough in the crackdown campaign. According to the statement, China's public security bodies will continue to maintain high pressure in the crackdown on cross-border telecom fraud, especially in areas where scam dens are concentrated.- Third, there's a report on the second meeting of the China-Saudi Arabia-Iran Trilateral Joint Committee held in Riyadh on November 19. The readout says: -Saudi Arabia and Iran reaffirmed their commitment to all provisions of the Beijing Agreement, and their continued efforts to consolidate good-neighborly and friendly relations between the two countries by adhering to the United Nations Charter, the Charter of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and international law, including respecting national sovereignty, independence and security…The current escalation of regional tensions will have serious consequences for regional and global security. Against this backdrop, it is very important for senior officials from Saudi Arabia and Iran to engage in contacts, meetings, and mutual visits. The participating parties appreciated the progress made in consular services between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which enabled more than 87,000 Iranian pilgrims to perform Hajj, and more than 25,000 Iranian pilgrims to perform Umrah rituals with ease and security in the first ten months of 2024. They also appreciated the convening of the first meeting of the Saudi-Iranian Joint Media Committee, and the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Prince Saud Al-Faisal Institute for Diplomatic Studies and the Institute of Political and International Studies of the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Saudi Arabia and Iran also expressed their readiness to sign a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement, and the three countries look forward to expanding trilateral cooperation in economic, political and other fields.- They all called -for an immediate end to the Israeli military operations in both Palestine and Lebanon, condemn the Israeli attack and its violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iran, and call for ensuring the unimpeded flow of humanitarian and relief aid to Palestine and Lebanon. The three countries hold that the ongoing cycle of violence and escalation poses a serious threat to the security of the region and the world, including maritime security. The three countries reaffirm their support for a comprehensive political solution to the Yemeni issue in accordance with internationally recognized principles under the auspices of the United Nations.- Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

China-Brazil Deals & Joint Statement - Global Cooperation Initiative on Cross-Border Data Flows - Liu Jianchao Meets Communist Party of Nepal Delegati...	As I opened the front page of the paper today, I felt a bit like Marty McFly. Everything on the page I covered in my newsletter yesterday. So I will keep staying ahead of the curve, and cover some developments that you can expect tomorrow. First, let's look at Xi Jinping's meeting with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Xinhua reports (English readout): -Xi Jinping pointed out that he was very pleased to visit Brazil in this year of great historical significance, marking the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil. Just now, President Lula held a grand welcoming ceremony with the highest courtesies for me, fully demonstrating the high importance attached to China-Brazil relations and the deep affection for the Chinese people, which deeply moved me. China and Brazil are two major developing countries in the eastern and western hemispheres. Looking back over the past 50 years, China-Brazil relations have spanned mountains and seas, exploring the right path for large developing countries to engage based on mutual respect, mutual benefit, friendship, and win-win cooperation. Brazil was the first country to establish a strategic partnership with China and the first Latin American country to establish a comprehensive strategic partnership with China. In recent years, under the strategic guidance of President Lula and myself, the two countries have increasingly become reliable friends with a shared destiny and a positive force for promoting peace. China-Brazil relations are now at their historical best, not only enhancing the well-being of the two peoples but also safeguarding the shared interests of the vast number of developing countries, strengthening the power and voice of the Global South, and making outstanding contributions to world peace and stability.- ，50。，，。。50，，、、。、。，，、，，，，，. As per the Chinese readout, -Lula specially arranged for the Brazilian artist to sing the famous Chinese song My Motherland to thank the Chinese side for its warm hospitality during his visit to China last year-. Xi Jinping emphasized that today, we are elevating the positioning of China-Brazil relations to the level of a China-Brazil community with a shared future for a more just world and a more sustainable planet. At the same time, we are aligning BRI with Brazil's development strategy. This marks another historic moment in the development of China-Brazil relations, highlighting the global, strategic, and long-term nature of the bilateral relationship. This aligns with the general expectations of the two peoples and will provide a driving force for both sides to advance their modernization agendas. It also demonstrates the determination of China and Brazil to jointly uphold international fairness and justice and promote common global development. China is willing to work with Brazil, keeping the future of humanity in mind and focusing on the well-being of the people, to continually enrich the connotations of the new-era China-Brazil relationship, becoming ‘golden partners' that achieve mutual success, and steadily progress toward building a community with a shared future for humanity, a fairer world, and a more sustainable planet, thereby making greater contributions to the cause of peace and progress for humankind.- ，，--，，、、，，，、。，、，，--，、，. Xi then made four points: First, we must share a common destiny and should continue to consolidate strategic mutual trust. We must firmly support each other on issues involving core interests, such as sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity, and become strategic partners that trust each other and a model of solidarity, cooperation, mutual benefit, and common development among the Global South countries. We must strengthen exchanges in the fields of culture, education, and youth, and consolidate the public opinion foundation of the China-Brazil community with a shared future. Second, we must develop together and continue to deepen the linkages between our development strategies. We must seize the historical opportunity of building interlinkages between the BRI and Brazil's development strategy, deepen cooperation in key areas such as economy, trade, infrastructure, finance, science and technology, and environmental protection, and strengthen cooperation in aerospace, agricultural science and technology, and clean energy. China has placed poverty alleviation in a prominent position in state governance and supports Brazil's ‘Zero Hunger' plan. It is willing to continue to strengthen poverty reduction cooperation with Brazil so that the people of the two countries can live a better life. Third, we must share responsibilities and demonstrate the strength of China and Brazil in maintaining world peace and justice. We must practise true multilateralism, make fair remarks and take fair actions, so as to make global governance more just and equitable. China attaches great importance to Brazil's international status and influence and supports Brazil in playing a greater role on the international stage. China stands ready to strengthen communication and coordination with Brazil at the United Nations, BRICS and other multilateral mechanisms, support Brazil's presidency of BRICS next year, promote high-quality development of greater BRICS cooperation, and make BRICS voice louder on upholding multilateralism and improving global governance. Fourth, we must share weal and woe and make distinctive contributions to building a community with a shared future for mankind. As major developing countries, China and Brazil should take the lead in conducting consultations, promoting global solidarity, jointly addressing global challenges concerning the future of mankind, and strengthening cooperation in such fields as green transformation, sustainable development, climate change, and AI governance. China is willing to support Brazil in hosting the 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. ，。、、，、、。、、，。，。--，、、、、，、、。，--，，。，。，、，。，，，，--，、。，。，，--，。、、、。《》. In terms of outcomes: The two sides issued a joint statement on jointly building the China-Brazil community with a shared future for a more just world and a more sustainable planet. They also signed -more than 30 bilateral cooperation documents in the fields of economy and trade, investment, agriculture, digital economy, sustainable development, science and technology, AI, and global development cooperation.- They also agreed to a Plan of Cooperation Between the People's Republic of China and the Federative Republic of Brazil on Synergizing the Belt and Road Initiative with the Growth Acceleration Program, the New Industry Brazil, the Ecological Transformation Plan, and the Program on South American Integration Routes. The Chinese readout quotes Lula saying that: -China is Brazil's most important strategic partner, and the Chinese people are the most trustworthy friends of the Brazilian people.- -The working groups of the two sides should expeditiously explore and advance cooperation in priority areas such as infrastructure, finance, industrial chain, science and technology, and ecological and environmental protection. The Brazilian side welcomes more Chinese companies to Brazil for investment and cooperation.- -Brazil opposes a ‘new Cold War-, and advocates a multipolar world and a global partnership based on equality and mutual respect. Brazil is ready to further deepen communication and cooperation with China under multilateral frameworks such as the U.N., BRICS, and the G20 to enhance the voice and influence of the Global South in global governance.- Share Tracking People's Daily The list of all the agreements and the full text of the cooperation plan is available on the website of Brazil's foreign affairs ministry. The joint statement is available on China's ministry of foreign affairs' website. AMong other things, it says: In the process of connecting the development strategies of the two countries, the two sides will focus on promoting strategic cooperation in the fields of finance, infrastructure, industrial chain development, investment, ecological transformation, scientific and technological innovation. ，、、、、、. Both sides recognize the potential for cooperation in national defense and defense industries and agree to enhance high-level exchanges and explore new avenues of cooperation. ，. The two sides agreed to set 2026 as the ‘China-Brazil Cultural Year' Brazil reaffirms its adherence to the one-China principle, recognizes that there is only one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, and the Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing all of China. Brazil supports China's efforts to achieve peaceful reunification of the country. China highly appreciates this. ，，，。。. Both sides reaffirmed their support for maintaining the authority of the United Nations and supporting the United Nations to play a central role in maintaining international peace and security and promoting development. Both sides believe that it is necessary to reform the United Nations and its Security Council to make them more representative and democratic. Both sides stressed that promoting necessary and reasonable reforms of the Security Council will help enhance the role of developing countries and enable the composition of the Security Council to properly respond to current global challenges. China highly values Brazil's influence and role in regional and international affairs, understands and supports () Brazil's desire to play a greater role in the United Nations, including in the Security Council. ，、。，、。，、，。，. Both sides believe that China and Brazil, as important representatives of the Global South and members of the G20 and BRICS, have similar positions on major international and regional issues. Both sides emphasise the importance of maintaining the authority and core role of the United Nations and promoting global governance based on multilateralism, international law, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. Both sides will further strengthen strategic cooperation at multilateral platforms such as the United Nations, the G20, and the BRICS, promote the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction, and strive to achieve an equal and orderly world multipolarization and inclusive economic globalization. Both sides emphasize that as an example of similar views in the field of international peace and security, the two countries reached the ‘China-Brazil Consensus on the Political Settlement of the Ukrainian Crisis', promoted the ‘Global South' countries to hold a high-level meeting on the Ukrainian crisis in New York on September 27, established a ‘Friends of Peace' group and issued a joint communiqué. ，--、，。，、《》。、、，，。，，《、》，--927，--。 Brazil welcomes China's GDI, GSI and GCI. 、、. China supports the Global Alliance to Fight Hunger and Poverty initiated by Brazil; it also backs the Call to Action on Global Governance Reform initiated during Brazil's chairing of G20. China supports Brazil's BRICS presidency and supports Brazil in holding the 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Belém in 2025. Both sides agree to deepen China-Latin America overall cooperation. Share Tracking People's Daily The two leaders also met the press later. The only additional bit from that to highlight is this: -President Xi stressed that the world today is far from being tranquil. Many regions are still suffering from conflicts, turmoil and insecurity. Humanity is an indivisible community of security. Only by embracing the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security can countries find a path to universal security. China and Brazil jointly issued the six-point consensus on a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, and launched the group of Friends for Peace on the Ukraine crisis together with other Global South countries. The two sides should bring together more voices for peace to pave the way for realizing a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. The two sides are deeply concerned about the continued expansion of the conflict in Gaza, and call for realizing a ceasefire and end of hostilities as early as possible, implementing the two-State solution, and working tirelessly for a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian question. China and Brazil share a tradition and responsibility in upholding justice and moral principles. China will work with Brazil to continually enrich the China-Brazil community with a shared future to enhance its relevance with our times. Together, the two sides will firmly defend true multilateralism, send a powerful message of the new era on pursuing development, cooperation and justice and rejecting poverty, confrontation and hegemonism, and join hands to make the world a better place.- Subscribe now Second, let's now look at the new Global Cooperation Initiative on Cross-Border Data Flows, which was detailed by the CAC. It says that: -We noticed that, while promoting global cross-border data flows, countries are primarily concerned with risks related to national security, public interests, personal privacy, and intellectual property. We believe that the international community should fully respect the different policies and practices adopted by various countries and regions based on their specific conditions. It is crucial to pay heed to each party's concerns regarding data security and development and to work toward building consensus on cross-border data flow rules through consultation among countries and regions.- In this context, China has proposed: Governments should encourage electronic cross-border data transmission to meet the needs of business and social activities. This will help global e-commerce and digital trade serve as new drivers for economic growth and sustainable development. Governments should respect the regulatory differences of various countries and regions in cross-border data flows. They should support free data flows that do not violate national security, public interests, and personal privacy. Regulations on cross-border data flows should be permitted when they aim to achieve legitimate public policy objectives on the premise that such regulatory measures do not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade, and do not cross the limits of the goals they seek to achieve. Governments should respect security measures taken by all countries in accordance with their laws to protect non-personal data related to national security and public interests, and ensure the secure and orderly cross-border flows of relevant non-personal data. Governments should respect measures taken by all countries to protect personal information rights and interests including individual privacy. Countries should be encouraged to provide convenient channels for cross-border transmission of personal information on the condition that such information is well protected. Countries should be encouraged to establish and improve legal and supervision frameworks on personal information protection, conduct exchanges on best practices and experiences, improve the compatibility of personal information protection mechanisms and rules, and foster mutual recognition of relevant standards, technology regulations and conformity assessment procedures. Enterprises should be encouraged to obtain personal information protection certifications to demonstrate their compliance with personal information protection standards and ensure the secure and orderly cross-border flows of personal information. (Note: This bit on certification is important) Governments should support exploring the establishment of negative lists for managing cross-border data flow to promote efficient, convenient and safe cross-border data flow. Governments should work together to create a data flow and usage environment that is open, inclusive, secure, and non-discriminatory, jointly uphold a fair and just market order, and promote the orderly and healthy development of the digital economy. Governments should enhance the transparency, predictability, and non-discriminatory nature of measures managing the cross-border flows of various types of data, as well as the interoperability of policy frameworks. Governments should actively conduct international cooperation in the field of cross-border data flows. Support should be given to developing countries and the least developed countries to enable them to effectively participate in and utilize cross-border data flows so as to promote their digital economic growth. Developed countries should be encouraged to provide capacity building and technical assistance to developing countries, especially the least developed ones, in order to bridge the digital divide and achieve fair and sustainable development. Governments should encourage the use of digital technologies to promote innovative applications in cross-border data flows. They should improve technological capabilities to ensure efficient, convenient and safe cross-border data flows. They should advance international mutual recognition of evaluation standards for technical and security assurance capabilities related to cross-border data flows, and ensure effective intellectual property protection. Governments should oppose overstretching the concept of national security on data issues. They should object to making restrictive and differentiated policies on cross-border data flows targeting specific countries and enterprises without factual evidence, or implementing discriminatory restrictions, prohibitions, and other similar measures against specific countries and enterprises. Governments should prohibit illicit acquisition of data through methods such as setting up backdoors in digital products and services or exploiting vulnerabilities in digital technology infrastructure. They should collaborate to crack down on cross-border illegal activities in the data field and jointly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and enterprises in all countries. We are ready to carry out and deepen exchanges and cooperation in the field of cross-border data flows with all parties based on the above initiative. We call on all countries and regions to respond to and endorse the above initiative through bilateral, multilateral, or regional agreements and arrangements. We welcome the support of international organizations, businesses, and civil society for this initiative.- Share Tracking People's Daily Third, the paper today has reports on three sackings today.

Xi at G20: If China Can Make it, Other Developing Countries Can Too - Jaishankar-Wang Meeting Analysis - Xi Meets Macron, Scholz, Milei, Arce & Sheinb...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, November 20, 2024. Page 1: I covered Xi Jinping's G20 speech on global governance yesterday. Today, let's look at Xi's speech (full speech) at Session I of the G20 Summit in Rio. Both these are covered in the paper today. Xi said: -The Rio Summit this year has chosen the theme ‘Building a Just World and a Sustainable Planet.' It places fighting hunger and poverty at the top of the agenda, and decides to establish a Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty. From Hangzhou to Rio, we have been working for one and the same goal, that is, to build a just world of common development. To build such a world, we need to channel more resources to such fields as trade, investment and development cooperation, and strengthen development institutions. There should be more bridges of cooperation, and less ‘small yard, high fences', so that more and more developing countries will be better off and achieve modernization. To build such a world, we need to support developing countries in adopting sustainable production and lifestyle, properly responding to challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental pollution, enhancing ecological conservation, and achieving harmony between man and nature. To build such a world, we need an open, inclusive and non-discriminatory environment for international economic cooperation. We should promote a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, energize sustainable development with new technologies, new industries and new business forms, and support developing countries in better integrating in digital, smart and green development to bridge the North-South gap. To build such a world, we need to stay committed to multilateralism. We should uphold the UN-centered international system, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.- He added: -China's story is proof that developing countries can eliminate poverty, and that a weaker bird can start early and fly high, when there is the endurance, perseverance, and striving spirit that enables water drops to penetrate rocks over time and turns blueprints into reality. If China can make it, other developing countries can make it too. This is what China's battle against poverty says to the world.- He then termed China a member of the Global South and outlined 8 actions. Apart from the initiative on open science and the decision to join the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty, nothing seems new in this list. First, pursuing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. On top of RMB700 billion yuan added financing windows and an additional RMB80 billion yuan injection into the Silk Road Fund, China is moving ahead with the development of the multidimensional Belt and Road connectivity network, one that is led by the building of a green Silk Road and will empower a digital Silk Road. Second, implementing the Global Development Initiative. On the basis of over 1,100 development projects already in operation, we will make sure the Global South research center that is being built is fit for purpose, and the 20 billion U.S. dollars of development funds will continue to be put to good use to support developing countries and deepen practical cooperation in areas such as poverty reduction, food security and the digital economy. Third, supporting development in Africa. At the Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation held in September this year, I unveiled ten partnership actions on joining hands with Africa to advance modernization over the next three years and, in this connection, a commitment of RMB360 billion yuan in financial support. Fourth, supporting international cooperation on poverty reduction and food security. China has decided to join the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty. We support the G20 in continuing to convene the Development Ministerial Meeting, and will stay a committed host of the International Conference on Food Loss and Waste. Fifth, China, alongside Brazil, South Africa and the African Union, is proposing an Initiative on International Cooperation in Open Science to help the Global South gain better access to global advances in science, technology and innovation. Sixth, supporting the G20 in carrying out practical cooperation for the benefit of the Global South and using such outcomes as the Roadmap to Increase Investment in Clean Energy in Developing Countries and the High-Level Principles on Bioeconomy to good effect. China supports the work of the Entrepreneurship Research Center on G20 Economies based in Beijing, and supports cooperation on digital education and the digitization of museums and ancient archives. Seventh, implementing the G20 Anti-Corruption Action Plan. We are strengthening cooperation with fellow developing countries in fugitive repatriation and asset recovery, denial of safe haven, and anti-corruption capacity building. Eighth, China is pursuing high-standard opening up, and unilaterally opening our doors wider to the least developed countries (LDCs). We have announced the decision to give all LDCs having diplomatic relations with China zero-tariff treatment for 100 percent tariff lines. From now to 2030, China's imports from other developing countries are likely to top 8 trillion dollars. Subscribe now Next, there is a report about Xi's meeting with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo. Xinhua says: -Xi once again congratulated Sheinbaum on becoming the first female president in the history of Mexico…Xi said China and Mexico share similar views and ideas on many international issues, and both countries advocate a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalisation. China is ready to work with Mexico to uphold multilateralism and international fairness and justice, and inject positive energy into the development of the world economy.- The report adds: -Sheinbaum expressed her pleasure in meeting Xi, noting that she fully agrees with Xi's assessment of the relationship between the two countries. Although Mexico and China are far apart in distance, their ties are very close. Many Chinese companies operate in Mexico, including participating in the construction of major infrastructure projects in Mexico City, she said. She also expressed her gratitude for China's generous and sincere assistance during Mexico's difficult times such as the hurricane disaster, which is testament to the friendship between the two peoples. Both Mexico and China are committed to upholding multilateralism. Mexico is willing to work with China to explore potential opportunities while further expanding cooperation in various fields, added Sheinbaum.- Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, there's a report (English report) on Xi and Emmanuel Macron having prefaced an exhibition titled ‘Tang China -- A Cosmopolitan Dynasty (7th-10th Century)'. Subscribe now Although it is not in the paper today, Xi also met with Macron at the sidelines of the G20 in Rio. The Chinese readout says: -Xi Jinping pointed out that both China and France are independent, mature and responsible major countries. The relationship between the two countries has unique strategic value and global significance…At present, the international situation is undergoing many new changes, and leading the international community to unite in addressing global challenges is a major power responsibility jointly borne by China and France. Both sides should deepen strategic communication, strengthen mutual support, and maintain the steady and positive development momentum of China-France relations, contributing more to the healthy development of China-Europe relations and to world peace and stability. Xi Jinping stressed that China is willing to continue close high-level exchanges with France, continue to deepen exchanges and cooperation in the humanities fields, such as culture, education, local governance, and youth, to enhance mutual understanding between the Chinese and French people. The Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee has opened a new round of reform and opening up in China, which will provide new opportunities for China-France cooperation and the prospects for practical cooperation between the two sides are broad. It is hoped that the two sides will make good use of mechanisms such as high-level economic and financial dialogues and the mixed economic and trade committees to tap the potential for cooperation, strengthen complementary advantages, properly resolve differences, and achieve mutual benefit and win-win results. ，、、，...，，。，，、，。，，、、、，。，，。、，，，，. As per the Chinese readout, Macron said that: -The world today is full of various instability and uncertainty. France is willing to work with China to earnestly implement the consensus reached by the two heads of state, continue to strengthen high-level exchanges, enhance cultural exchanges, continue traditional friendship, and build a new type of state-to-state relations. France adheres to strategic autonomy and is willing to conduct dialogue and cooperation with China in the spirit of mutual respect, properly handle economic and trade disputes, maintain the healthy and stable development of bilateral economic and trade relations, and strengthen cooperation in areas such as addressing climate change and global governance of AI.- 。，，，，。，，，，、。 They also talked about the war in Ukraine. Xi said that -China hopes to see the conflict situation eased, does not wish to see the crisis spill over or the war escalate, and will continue to play a constructive role in its own way to promote a ceasefire and the cessation of hostilities.- ，，，、，. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, Xi met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The Chinese readout says: At present, the profound, once-in-a-century changes taking place in the world are accelerating, and global development is at a crucial crossroads. China and Germany, as the world's second and third largest economies and influential major powers, should persist in consolidating their comprehensive strategic partnership from a long-term and strategic perspective, and continue writing the story of mutually beneficial cooperation. Xi Jinping emphasised that China's policy toward Germany maintains high stability and continuity. China is willing to work with Germany to persist in respecting each other's core interests and major concerns, persist in seeking common ground while reserving differences, and exchange and learn from each other. China and Germany's economic interests are highly intertwined, and China-Germany cooperation is an opportunity to jointly promote development and create the future. China views Germany as an important partner in advancing Chinese-style modernization, and will continue to provide broad market opportunities for German enterprises. Both sides should focus on digitalization, intelligence, and low-carbon development to promote cooperation quality upgrade, work together to develop third-party markets, and achieve win-win cooperation. China believes Europe is an important pole in a multipolar world, is committed to carrying out cooperation with Europe, working together to respond to challenges, and promoting the continued stable and healthy development of China-EU relations. The EU's imposition of tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles has attracted worldwide attention. China has always insisted on resolving differences through dialogue and consultation, and hopes Germany will continue to play an important role in this.- ，，。、，，。，，，，、。，、。，。、、，，。，，，。。，. As per the Chinese readout, Scholz touched upon the -complex international situation- that persists and expressed a desire to -further develop a comprehensive strategic partnership with China; strengthen bilateral and multilateral dialogue and cooperation in the spirit of equality, candidness and mutual respect; properly resolve differences, achieve mutual benefit and win-win outcomes, and contribute to the recovery, growth and common prosperity of the world economy. It is hoped that Europe and China will resolve the issue of electric vehicles as soon as possible through dialogue and negotiation, and Germany is willing to make positive efforts in this regard.- ，、，，，。，. Share Tracking People's Daily They also discussed the Ukraine war and the situation in the Middle East. Third, there's a readout from Xi's meeting with Bolivian President Luis Arce. It says: Xi called China and Bolivia -good friends and brothers-. He talked about BRI cooperation and said that he hoped to take the 40th anniversary of the establishment of ties next year to push their -strategic partnership to a new level-. -Xi Jinping stressed that the two sides should strengthen exchanges between governments, legislatures, political parties and at sub-national levels, carry out in-depth exchanges of experience in governance, align BRI with Bolivia's 2025 development plan, expand cooperation in infrastructure construction, highland agriculture, green development, digital economy and other fields, deepen collaboration within multilateral mechanisms such as the United Nations and BRICS to promote unity, self-reliance, and common development among Global South countries. China supports the development of Latin American regional integration and is willing to work with Bolivia to strengthen the construction of the China-Latin America Forum mechanism.- ，、、、，，--2025，、、、，、，。，，. Acre praised the -deep brotherly friendship- between China and Bolivia. He added: -Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, China's modernisation has made great achievements, providing an important reference point and guidance for the development of Bolivia and other countries.- ，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Fourth, Xi met with Argentine President Javier Milei. The Chinese readout says: Xi said that since the establishment of diplomatic ties, -both sides have adhered to mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit. China's policy toward Argentina has always been focused on the entire Argentine people, and China-Argentina cooperation has likewise benefited all people. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Argentina, placing bilateral relations at an important juncture to build on the past and usher in the future. China values the traditional friendship between the peoples of the two countries, supports Argentina in exploring a development path suited to its national conditions through reform, and is willing to work with Argentina to promote the long-term stable development of the China-Argentina comprehensive strategic partnership to better support the development of both countries.- ，，、、。，。10，、。，，，，。 -Xi Jinping stressed that the current world situation is undergoing profound changes. China and Argentina should continue to firmly support each other on issues of core interests and major concerns, strengthen exchanges at all levels and in all fields, promote cultural exchanges and cooperation, and make China-Argentina friendship more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The economic and trade structures of China and Argentina are highly complementary, and the prospects for cooperation are broad. Argentina is welcome to seize the important opportunities brought by China's high-level opening up to the outside world and further expand its market share in China. China is willing to continue to promote high-quality joint construction of the BRI with Argentina, and deepen cooperation in energy, mining, infrastructure, agriculture, scientific and technological innovation, digital economy and other fields. China is also willing to continue financial cooperation with Argentina to help Argentina maintain economic and financial stability.- ，，，，，。，，，。--，、、、、。，. As per the readout, Milei -thanked China for its valuable help in stabilising Argentina's domestic economic and financial situation-. He added that -Argentina hopes to become a reliable and stable partner of China. Argentina firmly supports China's position on the Taiwan issue and firmly adheres to the one-China principle. Argentina hopes to further strengthen cooperation with China in the fields of economy, trade, energy, minerals, finance; it welcomes more Chinese companies to invest and cooperate in Argentina, and is willing to provide a good business environment for companies investing in Argentina and protect the legitimate rights and interests of companies in accordance with the law. Argentina highly appreciates President Xi Jinping's insightful propositions on global governance at the G20 Leaders' Summit and is willing to strengthen communication and cooperation with China…- ，。。。。，。、、，，，。，。，. Xi is now in Brasilia, kicking off his state visit to Brazil. Subscribe now Page 3: There are two reports of meetings by Wang Yi. First, Wang met with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. The Chinese readout says: Wang said that -China and Russia should work with BRICS partners to implement the outcomes of the BRICS Kazan Summit, expand and strengthen the BRICS mechanism, enhance the influence of the Global South, and play a greater role in world multipolarization. China has taken over the presidency of the SCO and is willing to work closely with Russia to promote greater development of the SCO and move it to a new level. Next year marks the 80th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War. China and Russia should jointly organise commemorative activities, firmly defend the results of the victory of the Second World War and international fairness and justice, learn from history and open up the future.- ，，，，，。，，，。80，,，、. Lavrov reportedly said that -Russia-China relations are at an unprecedented high level.- He added: -The UN is the most important achievement of the victory of the Second World War, and commemorating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations is of great significance. The international community should take this opportunity to oppose the destruction of the post-war international order and jointly maintain global peace and stability.- ，80。，，. The readout said that they discussed the war in Ukraine, the situation on the Korean Peninsula and other issues. Subscribe now Second, Wang met with Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. Before I detail the readouts, let me offer a brief analysis. My Brief Takeaway: As you go through both the readouts, you will notice that there is remarkable divergence in just how the Chinese side has characterised Jaishankar's position and what the MEA's readout actually says. The differences in the readouts are indicative of how far the two sides are in terms of their interests and perceptions of each other, despite the patrolling rights deal that was agreed in October and the Modi-Xi meeting in Kazan. Here are four points to consider: First, the Chinese readout essentially has Jaishankar agreeing with Beijing's proposition that -specific differences-, i.e., the boundary tensions, should not define the relationship. In contrast, the Indian readout says that both ministers -recognized that the disengagement in our border areas had contributed to the maintenance of peace and tranquility-. In other words, the Chinese side also appreciated the Indian position that you cannot have a stable relationship if tensions persist on the boundary. Second, the Chinese readout seems to indicate far greater common cause between India and China on global issues, while accepting that there are issues of attrition and suspicion between the two. The MEA's readout, on the other hand, explicitly says that on global issues -India and China have both differences and convergences-. In particular, the Chinese readout talks about world multipolarity; the Indian readout also calls for a multipolar Asia. Third, on specific actions, the Chinese readout calls for easing visa processes, exchanging journalists and resuming direct flights. It does not mention the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra pilgrimage and data sharing on trans-border rivers, which the MEA's readout mentions. Finally, the Chinese readout attributes this to Jaishankar -India also opposes unilateralism, does not approve of military alliances, advocates the democratisation of international relations, and is willing to strengthen coordination and cooperation with China in multilateral mechanisms such as the G20 and BRICS-. The underlying message in this appears to be directed at the US. In contrast the MEA's readout says that Jaishankar told Wang -where India is concerned, its foreign policy has been principled and consistent, marked by independent thought and action. We are against unilateral approaches to establish dominance. India does not view its relationships through the prism of other nations.- To me, the underlying message in this is directed at China and its assertive and aggressive policies. Share Tracking People's Daily The Chinese readout says: Wang said that -the successful meeting between President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Kazan not long ago and the restart of China-India relations are in line with the fundamental interests of the two peoples, the expectations of Global South countries and the right direction of history. The two sides should implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state, respect each other's core interests, enhance mutual trust through dialogue and communication, handle differences properly with sincerity and integrity, and bring the bilateral relationship back on the track of stable and sound development at an early date. The two sides should send more positive signals and engage in actions that facilitate bilateral exchanges, enhance mutual trust and reduce suspicion, and carry out more cooperation and reduce attrition. The two sides should strive to make practical progress in such issues as resuming direct flights, exchanging journalists and easing visa procedures as soon as possible. Next year marks the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and India. The two sides should plan commemorative activities, and encourage exchanges and visits in various fields and at different levels to enhance understanding and mutual trust.- ，，，，，。，，，，。，；，；，。、、。75，，，. -Wang said China and India, as two neighbouring major developing countries, have more common interests than differences, and they should view each other's development as an opportunity and work together to achieve common development and rejuvenation, which will help safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries and contribute to global multipolarity. Both China and India adhere to a non-aligned foreign policy and multilateralism, and support the democratisation of international relations. The two countries should continue to strengthen coordination and cooperation in international affairs and further develop mechanisms such as BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.- ，，，，，，。，，，，、. The Chinese readout quotes Jaishankar as saying: -During the BRICS Summit in Kazan, leaders of both countries reached a consensus on promoting the stable development of India-China relations. It is gratifying to see that both sides are taking measures to implement the consensus of the leaders and have made positive progress. The Indian side hopes to restart the relevant dialogue mechanism as soon as possible and maintain the momentum of improvement and development of bilateral relations through strengthened communication. The consensus between India and China far outweighs the differences. Both sides should view bilateral relations from a strategic perspective, properly handle relevant issues with a more positive attitude, and not let specific differences define the relationship between the two countries. The Indian side is willing to take the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries next year as an opportunity to push forward India-China relations. Both India and China play an important role in international affairs, which also reflects the potential of India-China cooperation. India also opposes unilateralism, does not approve of military alliances, advocates the democratisation of international relations, and is willing to strengthen coordination and cooperation with China in multilateral mechanisms such as the G20 and BRICS.- ，，。。，。，，，。75，。，。，，，、. The Indian MEA's readout of the meeting says: -The Ministers recognized that the disengagement in our border areas had contributed to the maintenance of peace and tranquility. The discussions focused on the next steps in India-China relations. It was agreed that a meeting of the Special Representatives and of the Foreign Secretary-Vice Minister mechanism will take place soon. Among the steps discussed were the resumption of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra pilgrimage, data sharing on trans-border rivers, direct flights between India and China and media exchanges.- -On the global situation and international issues, EAM noted that India and China have both differences and convergences. We have worked constructively in the BRICS and the SCO framework. Our cooperation in the G20 has also been evident. EAM said that we are strongly committed to a multipolar world, including a multipolar Asia. Where India is concerned, its foreign policy has been principled and consistent, marked by independent thought and action. We are against unilateral approaches to establish dominance. India does not view its relationships through the prism of other nations. FM Wang Yi concurred with EAM that India-China relations have particular salience in world politics. He noted that our leaders had agreed in Kazan on the way forward. The two Ministers felt that it was imperative that the focus should be on stabilizing ties, managing differences and taking the next steps.- Subscribe now Next, there's a Zhong Sheng commentary. It talks about the Xi-Biden meeting, saying that in the past four years, -overall stability has been achieved- in ties. It says that: -President Xi Jinping expounded on strategic, directional, and guiding opinions on the development of China-US relations, proposing that the two countries should respect each other, coexist peacefully, and cooperate for win-win results. He clearly outlined China's four red lines regarding the Taiwan issue, democracy and human rights, the choice of path and system, and development rights. He suggested that both sides should jointly establish correct perceptions, effectively manage differences, advance mutually beneficial cooperation, shoulder great power responsibilities, and promote people-to-people exchanges, making the great edifice of China-US relations have not only a dome but also a foundation and pillars. To promote stable, healthy, and sustainable development of China-US relations, both sides need to add bricks and tiles to this great edifice of China-US relations.- 4，，，，。、、，、、，、、、4，、、、、，，。、、，. -Strategic perception is the fundamental and overarching issue in Sino-US relations. The ‘Thucydides Trap' is not a historical destiny, and a ‘new Cold War' cannot be fought or won. Containment of China is unwise, undesirable, and will not succeed. If the two countries are partners and seek common ground while reserving differences, Sino-US relations will be able to achieve substantial development. If the other side is regarded as an opponent and vicious competition is carried out, Sino-US relations will encounter setbacks or even regress. In the interaction between these two major powers, neither side can reshape the other according to their own wishes, nor can they suppress the other based on so-called ‘position of strength', let alone deprive the other of legitimate development rights to maintain their own leading position. China and the US are two major powers, and some contradictions and differences are inevitable, but they cannot harm each other's core interests, much less engage in conflict and confrontation. The One China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiques are the political foundation of bilateral relations and must be strictly observed.- 、。--，--，、，。，，。，，。，，--，。，，，。，. Share Tracking People's Daily -The interests of China and the United States are deeply intertwined, and the space for cooperation is infinite. In terms of economic ties, the trade volume between China and the United States exceeds $660 billion. More than 70,000 American companies in China have an annual profit of $50 billion; in terms of employment, exports to China alone support 930,000 jobs in the United States, and Chinese investment has also boosted American employment; in terms of people's livelihood, Chinese products have not only enriched the choices of American consumers, but also reduced the cost of living. McDonald's new stores in China in the past year accounted for about 60% of global presence. Tesla's Shanghai Super Factory delivered electric vehicles accounting for half of its global production capacity last year. And Starbucks has more than 1,000 stores in Shanghai alone...The story of mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the United States fully shows that under the current situation, the common interests of China and the United States have not decreased, but rather increased. China and the United States should always focus on the well-being of the people of the two countries, continuously extend the list of cooperation, expand the pie of cooperation, and achieve win-win cooperation.- ，。，6600，7500；，93，；，，。，，1000……，，，。，，，. The next paragraph talks about global turbulence and then outlines this vision for bilateral ties. In essence, this is a call for a G2-style relationship. -China and the US should take into account the interests of the world, constantly consider the future destiny of humanity, take responsibility for world peace, provide public goods for the global community, and play a positive role in world unity. Major power competition should not be the underlying theme of the era; only unity and cooperation can overcome difficulties together. ‘Decoupling and breaking chains' is not the solution; only mutually beneficial cooperation can lead to joint development. ‘Small yards with high walls' are not behaviours befitting of major powers; only openness and sharing can benefit humanity. Only by demonstrating the pattern of major powers, shouldering the responsibilities of major powers, and playing the role of major powers can we be responsible to history, to the people, and to the world, and only then can we win the world's respect.-，，，，。，。--，。--，。、、，、、，. The next bit reiterates Xi's framing of the -four unchanged- , i.e., China's goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged. Its commitment to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation as principles for handling China-U.S. relations remains unchanged. Its position of resolutely safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests remains unchanged. And its desire to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples remains unchanged. It then says: -To achieve a smooth transition in China-US relations, both sides need to uphold the already agreed-upon guiding principles, i.e., mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, maintaining communication, preventing conflict, adhering to the UN Charter, cooperating in areas of common interest, and responsibly managing competitive elements in bilateral relations. At present, China-US relations once again stand at a crossroads. The people of both countries have expectations for the stable development of China-US relations, and the international community also has expectations for the stable development of China-US relations. It is hoped that the US side will meet China halfway, continue to explore the correct way for two major powers to get along, achieve long-term peaceful coexistence between China and the US on this planet, and inject more certainty and provide positive energy for the world.- ，，、、、、《》，，。，。，。，，，、.

Second, there have been a total of 100,000 China-Europe freight trains this year, with 7 trains going and 6 trains returning per week. More than 11 million standard containers of goods have been shipped with a value of more than $420 billion. Note this bit: Economic globalisation is an unstoppable historical tide. Although it is facing headwinds and setbacks, this overall trend has never changed and will not change. At 6:00 p.m. on October 11, the 3 millionth vehicle rolled off the production line at Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory. In the first three quarters of this year, the Shanghai Gigafactory has delivered 676,000 vehicles, accounting for more than half of Tesla's global deliveries in the same period, becoming the ‘capacity pillar' for Tesla. Of these 3 million vehicles, one-third were exported to Europe and Asia-Pacific markets. The localization rate of parts at the Shanghai Gigafactory exceeds 95%, and Tesla has signed over 400 local first-tier suppliers, with more than 60 suppliers entering Tesla's global supply chain system. Tesla's development in China is a fruit of economic globalization and a strong proof of ‘harmony and coexistence'. Not just Tesla. In April, Mercedes-Benz announced the upgrade of its Shanghai R&amp;D center, further accelerating innovation in China; Volkswagen Group (China) announced a 2.5 billion euro investment to expand its production and innovation center in Hefei; BMW's Shenyang production base has invested nearly 100 billion yuan since 2010... China's creation of complete industrial chains, efficient market mechanisms, and healthy industrial competition ecology has attracted global capital to invest and develop business. As the economy becomes increasingly globalised, the interdependence between countries further deepens. Research and development, production, circulation, and consumption are interlinked; no country can achieve full lifecycle management of industrial and supply chains on its own. ‘I exist in you, you exist in me', the cooperation pattern becomes more solid. Unilateralism and protectionism offer no way forward, and ‘small yards with high walls' will only trap oneself. For some time, certain people in the US and the West have exaggerated the so-called ‘Chinese new energy overcapacity theory', which in essence is a ‘development anxiety theory' and a ‘zero-sum game theory', which harms others and benefits no one…Facts show that the development of China's new energy industry is a contribution and opportunity to the world. Coming from the depths of history, every Chinese understands what isolation will bring to us and the world. China is a beneficiary of economic globalisation and a firm promoter, because we understand that ‘when the world is good, China will be good; when China is good, the world will be even better'.- ，。，，，。10116，300。，67.6，，--。300，1/3、。95%，400，60。，，--。。4，—，；（），25；20101000……、、，。，。、、、，，。-、-，。、，--。，--，----，。。ATTO32023，E，H6……，。，，。，，、。，，-，；，-.

Another report on the page talks about the successful trial of large-scale trial transportation of lithium batteries via trains. A related English report informs: -China Railway has conducted its first large-scale trial transportation of lithium batteries for electric vehicles (EVs). On Tuesday, three trains loaded with lithium batteries departed from Chongqing Municipality, Sichuan Province and Guizhou Province, all of which are located in southwest China. For China, the world's largest producer of lithium batteries, this is a major step forward in the transportation of these vehicle batteries, which are listed as dangerous goods and were previously transported only by sea or road. The transport of lithium batteries is risky as they may burn or explode if jolted. ‘For the trial run, we are using a new type of container designed solely for the transport of lithium batteries. The containers are made of non-combustible materials and equipped with smoke and temperature detectors and venting devices,' said Jia Ping, deputy general manager of China Railway Chengdu Group Co., Ltd. Rail transport will facilitate the export of Chinese lithium batteries as it has a larger capacity than road transport and is faster than sea transport, Jia said.- Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Xi's G20 Speech - Xi Meets Starmer & Albanese - Wang Huning on Spreading China's Voice - Song Tao Meets Wang Jin-pyng	Earlier today, Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the G20 summit in Brazil. Last year, when the G20 was held in India and Xi had skipped it, there was a fair amount of commentary in India about how Beijing was de-prioritising the G20 as a forum in favour of BRICS. I recall saying, wait till it's in Brazil; he will go. And look what we have now. Anyway, Xi said: -the G20 needs to build on its past achievements and continue to act as a force to improve global governance and move history forward. We should keep in mind that mankind lives in a community with a shared future, see each other's development as opportunities rather than challenges, and view each other as partners rather than rivals. We should observe the basic norms of international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and defend the international order based on international law. In light of the G20's mandate, we could build greater international consensus in the economic, financial, trade, digital and eco-environmental fields, among others, to improve global governance and promote an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization.- He then made five points: First, improve global economic governance. -We should stay committed to strengthening global economic partnerships, reinforcing macro policy coordination in fiscal, financial, monetary and structural reform policies, cultivating new quality productive forces, and raising total factor productivity, in a bid to open up more possibilities for the global economy. It is important to make good use of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meetings, let them serve as a ballast for macro policy coordination, and foster an open, inclusive, and nondiscriminatory environment for international economic cooperation. As main creditors, international financial institutions and commercial creditors need to take part in debt reduction and suspension for developing countries. It is also important to create a clean business environment by upholding a zero-tolerance stance against corruption, stepping up international cooperation on fugitive repatriation and asset recovery, and denying safe haven to corrupt officials and their assets.- Second, improve global financial governance. -To increase the voice and representation of developing countries, the World Bank should carry out shareholding review and the International Monetary Fund should carry out quota share realignment in line with the agreed timeframe and roadmap. Joint efforts are needed to keep the international financial market stable and prevent negative spillover of domestic monetary policy adjustments. Developed countries should fulfill their responsibilities in this regard. It is important to enhance the systems for financial risks monitoring, early warning and handling, reinforce cooperation in such areas as digital currency and taxation, and strengthen the global financial safety net. The G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap should be implemented at a faster pace to better meet the green financing needs of developing countries.- Third, improve global trade governance. -We should place development at the center of the international economic and trade agenda, and steadily advance trade and investment liberalization and facilitation. We should press ahead with reforming the World Trade Organization (WTO), oppose unilateralism and protectionism, restore the normal functioning of the dispute settlement mechanism as soon as possible, include the Investment Facilitation for Development Agreement into the WTO legal framework, and reach early consensus on the e-commerce agreement. We should work actively to keep the WTO rules relevant, both addressing long-pending issues and exploring the formulation of new, future-oriented rules, to enhance the authority, efficacy and relevance of the multilateral trading system. It is important to avoid politicizing economic issues, avoid fragmenting the global market, and avoid taking protectionist moves in the name of green and low-carbon development.- Fourth, improve global digital governance. -We should step up international governance and cooperation on artificial intelligence (AI), to make sure that AI is for good and for all, not a game of the rich countries and the wealthy. China hosted the 2024 World AI Conference and High-Level Meeting on Global AI Governance, and issued the Shanghai Declaration on Global AI Governance. Together with other parties, China promoted the adoption of a UN General Assembly resolution on enhancing international cooperation on AI capacity-building. China will hold another world AI conference in 2025 and welcomes the participation of fellow G20 members-. Fifth, improve global ecological governance. -We should honor the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, and fully and effectively implement the Paris Agreement and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework for the sake of man's harmonious coexistence with nature. Developed countries should provide developing countries with the necessary funding, technology and capacity-building support…Energy transition and energy security is a major issue. We should follow the approach of ‘establishing the new before abolishing the old,' and replace traditional energy with clean energy in a stable and well-ordered way, as we expedite the green and low-carbon transition of the world economy. China stands ready to continue to deepen international cooperation with all sides on green infrastructure, green energy, green mining and green transport, and will provide support to developing countries to the best of its ability.- Share Tracking People's Daily Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Tuesday, November 19, 2024. Page 1: The lead story today is about Xi's arrival in Rio for the G20 summit. On the sidelines of the summit, Xi met with (English report) British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. -Noting that the world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation, Xi said that China and Britain, both as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and major global economies, share the responsibilities of advancing their respective national development and addressing global challenges. Both countries should stick to their strategic partnership, adhere to the principles of mutual respect, open cooperation, and mutual learning, strive for mutual benefit and win-win outcomes, and jointly write the next chapter of healthy and stable development of bilateral relations, he added. Xi said that while the two countries differ in history, culture, values, and social systems, they share extensive common interests. Both sides should view each other's development rationally and objectively, strengthen strategic communication, enhance political mutual trust, and ensure that China-UK relations remain stable, practical, and long-lasting. The two countries have extensive room for cooperation in areas such as trade and investment, clean energy, financial services, and healthcare, which should be continuously expanded to better benefit the people of both nations. Both sides should work to promote the political resolution of hotspot issues, strengthen global governance of artificial intelligence, and contribute to global economic growth and the shared development of all countries. ，。，，。，、、，，。，、、，，，，，、、。、、、，，。，，、. As per Xinhua, Starmer said that Britain and China share extensive common interests. He added that Britain -hopes to strengthen dialogue with China, enhance mutual understanding and carry out exchanges and cooperation in a wide range of areas, including economy and trade, technology, finance, healthcare, education, and addressing climate change, in a spirit of mutual respect, equality and candor-. Share Tracking People's Daily The UK side's readout says: Starmer told Xi that -the UK and China have a shared responsibility to work together in pursuit of global stability, economic co-operation and the clean energy transition…They also discussed deepening the partnership bilaterally on trade and investment, health, education and other areas of mutual interest. The Prime Minister set out that our approach would be consistent, respectful and pragmatic in order to advance these shared goals…The Prime Minister said that he also wanted to engage honestly and frankly on those areas where we have different perspectives, including on Hong Kong, human rights and Russia's war in Ukraine. He reiterated that his approach would always be rooted in the national interests of the UK, but that we would be a predictable and pragmatic partner. They discussed next steps and agreed that the Chancellor should visit Beijing next year to discuss economic and financial cooperation with her counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng.- Subscribe now Xi also met with (English report) Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. He said -that in November last year, we had in-depth communication in Beijing on strategic, overall and directional issues concerning the long-term development of China-Australia relations. Over the past year, the two countries have maintained close communication and exchanges at all levels, actively promoted the implementation of the important consensus we reached, and made positive progress. There is no fundamental conflict of interests between China and Australia. As long as the two sides insist on mutual respect, equality, and seeking common ground while reserving differences, China-Australia relations will surely develop well. China is willing to work with Australia to promote the construction of a more mature, stable and fruitful China-Australia comprehensive strategic partnership, and inject more stability and certainty into the region and the world.- ，11，、、。，，，。，、、，。，、，. Xi added that this year more than 250 Australian companies participated in the CIIE. This was their -vote of confidence- in the Chinese economy. -Both sides should continue to expand the pattern of mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation. China is willing to import more high-quality Australian products and encourages Chinese enterprises to invest and do business in Australia. It is hoped that Australia will provide Chinese companies with a fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory business environment. Both China and Australia are supporters and defenders of economic globalization and free trade. The two sides should strengthen coordination and cooperation, oppose protectionism, and promote the sharing of opportunities and benefits through openness to achieve common development.- 。，，、、。、，，，，. Among other things, Xinhua quotes the Australian PM as saying that -the Australian side stays committed to the one-China policy, opposes ‘decoupling', advocates promoting economic globalization, and hopes to strengthen cooperation with China in such areas as energy transition and climate change.- Subscribe now In his press briefing in Rio, Albanese said the following: -Earlier today, I also met with President Xi to talk about the progress in stabilising relations between our two countries. This is the third bilateral meeting I've had with President Xi. We have restored trade between our two countries. Impediments have been removed across a range of industries – wine, timber, coal, barley, seafood. And as a result of that, some $20 billion of trade has been resumed. That means Australian jobs. I was in Geraldton talking to the co-op that runs the lobster industry there. That's important not just for those people who work with the lobster trade, it's a driver of that town's regional economy as well. And so these things do matter. And I'm confident that the agreement which will see the lobster trade resume by the end of the year in time for the Lunar New Year in 2025, will be delivered and those negotiations between our respective departments is taking place. I've also said that dialogue is crucial. I've said, a number of times, that we'll cooperate with China where we can, we'll disagree where we must, but we'll engage in our national interests. And we've managed to improve relations without compromising any of Australia's national interests, which we have continued to pursue and will continue to pursue. This patient, calibrated and deliberate approach has made a difference and has both saved but also created many thousands of new jobs in Australia. We discussed areas that present opportunities for greater practical cooperation, such as the renewable energy transition and climate change. And I also made clear Australia's views on issues affecting regional and international peace, stability and prosperity, ranging a number of bilateral points as well, including consular matters which included Dr. Yang Jun.- He was then asked questions about the meeting. He was asked if the policies of the incoming Trump administration in the US were discussed. He said no, they weren't. But he added that -our alliance, is with the United States and that is the only context in which the US was raised, was that.- Albanese also confirmed that he will be visiting China next year for dialogue with Premier Li. In terms of the issues he raised, Albanese said -I raised the issues of human rights. I raised Taiwan. I raised cyber. I raised the supply of assets to Russia. I raised the ICBM missile test that I previously raised as well with the Chinese Premier. So, we raised issues that matter to us, to Australia.- Another interaction is this: JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you said that Taiwan was one of the issues that was discussed at the meeting. Chinese state media suggested that the Australian delegation said it wasn't in support of decoupling. Are you able to elaborate a bit further on Taiwan discussions? PRIME MINISTER: Well that's not about Taiwan, that's about the economy. We support the bipartisan support that is there for One China Policy. We also support the status quo. That is no unilateral action, and that's been a consistent bipartisan position for a long period of time. We support peace in the Taiwan Strait. Decoupling refers to the idea that you would decouple your economies. That the trade sanctions, those issues, that is what that's referring to. And our economic relationship with China is important because that is where a whole lot of, for example, our iron ore and coal goes to China and creates steel and construction that's the relationship which is there. Also worth noting is Albanese's characterisation of the significance of the trade relationship with China, which he said brings -substantial benefit for Australians and for Australian jobs and Australian businesses…- He added: -one in four Australian jobs as export dependent, and one in four of our export dollars comes from China.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: There's a report on Li Qiang's comments (English report) when he visited the China Construction Technology Exhibition in Beijing. The report says that Li said that -China's housing situation is shifting from addressing ‘whether there is housing' to focusing on ‘how good the housing is'; guided by the goal of enhancing residents' quality of life and sense of happiness, housing development should take into account functionality, quality, and experience, addressing the diverse needs of people with different living habits, age groups, and economic capacities, especially new demands such as elder-friendly and child-friendly housing. Efforts should be tailored to local conditions to promote the construction of quality housing. This includes setting higher standards and leveraging technology to build good new houses, as well as scientifically renovating old houses to transform them into quality housing.- ，----，，、、，、、、，，、，. He also -called for efforts to advance scientific and technological innovation, and improve design, construction and maintenance levels, with the aim of promoting the high-quality development of the real estate and construction industries. Li noted that urban renewal is an important task for ongoing urban construction. He said that combining the improvement of people's livelihoods with the expansion of domestic demand is necessary, as is strengthening efforts to renovate old urban residential compounds, urban villages and dilapidated houses. Li also stressed the importance of protecting and passing on historical and cultural heritage in the urban renewal process, as part of efforts to build harmonious cities and ensure residents can live happily.- Subscribe now Next, there's a report on Wang Huning's remarks at the China Overseas Friendship Association executive directors' meeting in Beijing. Wang said that -to do a good job with overseas friendship work with Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan in the new era, we must take Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the guide, adhere to great unity and great solidarity, adhere to holding high the banner of patriotism, adhere to playing the role of Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and overseas united front work in winning hearts and minds, form a vivid situation wherein all children of China think and act in unison, and pool hearts, consensus, wisdom, and strength to broadly rally support for advancing Chinese modernization.- ，，，，，，、，、、、. -Wang Huning said that over the past 75 years since the founding of the PRC, the great motherland has undergone earth-shaking changes. Entering the new era, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the cause of the Party and the country has achieved historic achievements and undergone historic changes; a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way has been built, achieving the first centennial goal. We have also embarked on a new journey of building a comprehensively modern socialist country. The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation now holds an unprecedentedly bright future. The great achievements of the motherland's development are the result of the full support and dedication of compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and overseas Chinese. In this great era, with the strong backing of the motherland, the vast number of compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and overseas Chinese have great potential to serve the motherland and realise their dreams.- ，75，。，，、，，，，。，、，、. Wang added that the China Overseas Friendship Association is an important platform for gathering patriotic people from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and overseas Chinese, an important bridge for strengthening the unity of Chinese people at home and abroad, and an important force dedicated to the reunification of the motherland and national rejuvenation.- He called on its directors to -better shoulder their responsibilities in promoting Chinese-style modernization, gather the wisdom and strength of Chinese people at home and abroad to promote reform and development, and share the great glory of the motherland's prosperity.- ，，，，。，、，. -We should make better contributions to the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao, fully and accurately implement the ‘one country, two systems' policy and the Basic Law, develop and strengthen patriotic forces and those that love Hong Kong and Macao, and support the two regions' deeper integration into the country's overall national development. We should better unite our hearts and minds to achieve the complete reunification of the motherland, adhere to the one-China principle and the ‘1992 Consensus', do more to promote cross-strait economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation, cross-strait integration and development in various fields, and the spiritual harmony of compatriots on both sides of the strait, and resolutely oppose ‘Taiwan independence' separatist activities and external interference. We should better contribute to the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind, actively promote exchanges and mutual learning between Chinese and foreign civilizations, tell Chinese stories well, and spread China's voice effectively.- ，、--，，。，--，、、，--。，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Page 6: There's a report on Song Tao from the Taiwan Affairs Office meeting with Wang Jin-pyng, former leader of Taiwan legislature. The report says: -Song Tao said that General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered an important speech during his visit to Fujian, which pointed out the direction for exploring a new path for cross-strait integration and development, promoting cross-strait cultural exchanges, and enhancing the identification and affinity between compatriots. We will earnestly implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech, adhere to the one-China Principle, resolutely oppose ‘Taiwan independence' separatism, jointly promote Chinese culture, strengthen the national confidence of being upright Chinese people, advance the unification of the motherland, and work together to achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.- ，，、、。，，--，，，，.

Xi Pitches for 'Open & Interconnected' Asia-Pacific - Biden-Xi Meeting Breakdown - Xi's Bilaterals in Lima - China Taiping's Party Committee on Financ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, November 18, 2024. Page 1: The lead story today is about Xi Jinping's speech at the APEC Leaders Summit. First, let's look at the key points from Xi's speech (English text) at the summit. First, we need to build an open and interconnected paradigm for Asia-Pacific cooperation. We should stay committed to multilateralism and an open economy, firmly uphold the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core, fully reactivate APEC's role as an incubator of global economic and trade rules, and advance regional economic integration and connectivity. We should tear down the walls impeding the flow of trade, investment, technology and services, uphold stable and smooth industrial and supply chains, and promote economic circulation in the region and the world. A Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) is an ambitious vision for regional economic integration, and is critical for long-term development and prosperity of our region. Ten years ago, a historic decision to kick off the FTAAP process was taken at the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Beijing. Today, we will adopt a new document to guide this process. I believe that this will give new impetus to our efforts toward an open Asia-Pacific economy. On China's approach to FTAs, he added: -We continue to implement the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) against high standards. We are also working actively to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA). We have just signed a protocol to upgrade the free trade agreement with Peru, and have substantially concluded negotiations with ASEAN to upgrade to free trade area 3.0. Together with the relevant parties, we will seek to discuss trade agreements in digital and green areas, and steadily expand the globally-oriented network of high-standard free trade areas.- Second, we need to make green innovation a catalyst for the Asia-Pacific. We need to firmly seize the opportunities presented by the new round of sci-tech revolution and industrial transformation, and strengthen exchanges and cooperation in artificial intelligence (AI), quantum information, life and health, and other frontier areas. We need to foster an open, fair, just and nondiscriminatory ecosystem for innovation, and promote a leapfrog development of productive forces across our region. To build a clean and beautiful Asia-Pacific, we should prioritize ecological protection, promote resources conservation and their efficient use as well as green and low-carbon development, and engineer an all-round green transition in economic and social development. We need to push forward coordinated digital and green transformation and development to create new momentum and new drivers for Asia-Pacific development. Then he talked about China's initiatives: -China will launch a Global Cross-Border Data Flow Cooperation Initiative, and seek deeper cooperation with other parties to promote efficient, convenient and secure cross-border data flows. China has put forward initiatives in the APEC framework concerning, among others, the application of digital bill of lading, capacity building on green supply chains, exchanges and dialogue on approaches to AI, and the digitalization of food supply chains, with a view to contributing to high-quality development of the Asia-Pacific.- Third, Xi talked about the need to support -developing economies and disadvantaged groups, and work together to grow the pie and distribute it equitably to allow more economies and people to benefit from development…China will advance initiatives through the APEC platform on increasing residents' income and promoting the industrial cluster development of small and medium-sized enterprises, for the purpose of bringing about universally beneficial and inclusive development of Asia-Pacific economies.- Subscribe now Also, earlier Xi spoke at the APEC CEOs summit. Here's an interesting excerpt from his remarks: -…the world is in a new period of turbulence and transformation. Unbridled unilateralism and protectionism and an increasingly fragmented world economy threaten to reverse the trend toward economic globalization. The grave challenge for us is like sailing up a river -- we either forge ahead or drift downstream. Where will the Asia-Pacific economy be going? It is a decision we must make. Economic globalization is an objective requirement of growing social productive forces. It is a natural outcome of advancement in science and technology and a mighty historical trend. Despite headwinds and undertows, economic globalization has always been the general trend. The attempt to block economic cooperation under all sorts of pretexts and break up the interdependence of the world is nothing but backpedaling. Economic globalization is caught now in a tug of war between driving and obstructive forces, but the driving forces still prevail. New technological revolution and industrial transformation are getting more profound, and the world is moving faster to embrace a digital, green and smart economy. All this is building up powerful energy for further expedition of economic globalization down the road. We should steer economic globalization in the right direction. We must reject the beaten path that a few countries have taken to pursue dominance and hegemony. We should see to it that economic globalization generates more positive outcomes and is taken to a new phase that is more dynamic, inclusive and sustainable.- Another excerpt says: -APEC was born on the eve of the end of the Cold War when a new round of economic globalization was gradually emerging, and has since taken it as its mission to promote economic globalization. It has contributed immensely to boosting trade and investment liberalization and facilitation in the Asia-Pacific, economic mutual benefit between member economies, and the interests and well-being of the people in our region. Asia-Pacific economies have maintained robust growth and created the remarkable Asia-Pacific miracle. The success of the Asia-Pacific is due to our firm commitment to peace and stability in the region, to our continuous practices of true multilateralism and open regionalism, and to our deep faith in the trend toward economic globalization as well as mutual benefit and mutual success. The Asia-Pacific should remain the locomotive of economic globalization in the future. We should stay on the right course and seek to break new ground at the same time. While further burnishing the Asia-Pacific hallmark of openness and inclusiveness, we should make new brand-building efforts to foster a green and digital Asia-Pacific, build an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future, and usher in another 30 golden years of development for our region.- Share Tracking People's Daily Let's now look at Xi's bilateral meetings. Today's paper covers the meeting between Xi and US President Joe Biden. The Chinese readout says that: Xi said that -over the past four years, China-U.S. relations have gone through ups and downs, but the two sides have also been engaged in dialogue and cooperation. The relationship has remained stable on the whole. Under the stewardship of the two Presidents, the two teams have worked out through consultations a number of guiding principles for China-U.S. relations. The two Presidents have jointly brought China-U.S. dialogue and cooperation back on track. More than 20 communication mechanisms have been restarted or established, and positive achievements have been made in such areas as diplomacy, security, economy, trade, fiscal affairs, finance, military, counternarcotics, law enforcement, agriculture, climate change, and people-to-people exchange. President Xi underscored that it is worthwhile to review the experiences of the past four years and draw inspirations from them. He listed the following: First, it is important to have a correct strategic perception. The Thucydides's Trap is not a historical inevitability. A new Cold War should not be fought and cannot be won. Containing China is unwise, unacceptable and bound to fail. Second, it is important to match words with actions. A man cannot establish himself without credibility. China has always honored its words. If the U.S. side always says one thing but does another, it will be detrimental to its own image, and undermine trust between China and the United States. Third, it is important to treat each other as equals. As two major countries, neither China nor the United States should seek to remodel the other according to one's own will, suppress the other from the so-called ‘position of strength', or deprive the other of the legitimate right to development so as to maintain its leading status. Fourth, it is important not to challenge red lines and paramount principles. Contradictions and differences between two major countries like China and the United States are unavoidable. But one side should not undermine the core interests of the other, let alone seek conflict or confrontation. The one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiqués are the political foundation of China-U.S. relations. They must be observed. The Taiwan question, democracy and human rights, China's path and system, and China's development right are four red lines for China. They must not be challenged. These are the most important guardrails and safety nets for China-U.S. relations. Fifth, it is important to conduct more dialogue and cooperation. Under the current circumstances, common interests between China and the United States are expanding rather than shrinking. Their cooperation is crucial not only for the economy, trade, agriculture, counternarcotics, law enforcement and public health, but also for handling global challenges of climate change and artificial intelligence (AI) as well as addressing international hotspot issues. The two sides should expand the list of cooperation and make a bigger pie of cooperation to achieve a win-win result. Sixth, it is important to respond to the expectations of the people. China-U.S. relations should always advance the well-being of the two peoples and bring them closer together. To facilitate personnel and cultural exchange, the two sides need to build bridges and roads, remove distractions and obstacles, and refrain from making any moves that have a chilling effect. Seventh, it is important to step forward to shoulder the responsibilities of major countries. China and the United States should always keep in mind humanity's future and their responsibilities for world peace, provide public good for the world, and act in a way conducive to global unity, including carrying out constructive interactions, refraining from mutual attrition, and not coercing other countries into taking sides.- Share Tracking People's Daily Xi added: -When the two countries treat each other as partner and seek common ground while shelving differences, their relationship will make considerable progress. But if they regard each other as rival and pursue vicious competition, they will roil the relationship or even set it back…Neither decoupling nor supply-chain disruption is the solution; common development can only be achieved through mutually beneficial cooperation. ‘Small yard, high fences' is not what a major country should do; only openness and sharing can advance the well-being of humanity. A stable China-U.S. relationship is critical not only to the interests of the Chinese and American peoples, but also to the future and destiny of the entire humanity. China and the United States should keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along well with each other, realize long-term, peaceful coexistence on this planet, and inject more certainty and positive energy into the world.- Some other key points: -Xi stressed that cross-Strait peace and stability and ‘Taiwan independence' separatist activities are irreconcilable as water and fire. If the U.S side cares about maintaining peace across the Taiwan Strait, it is crucial that it sees clearly the true nature of Lai Ching-te and the DPP authorities in seeking ‘Taiwan independence', handles the Taiwan question with extra prudence, unequivocally opposes ‘Taiwan independence', and supports China's peaceful reunification.- -The Chinese people's right to development is not to be deprived of or ignored. While all countries need to safeguard their national security, they should not overstretch the national security concept, still less use it as a pretext for malicious moves to constrain and contain other countries.- -China firmly upholds its territory, sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea. Dialogue and consultation between states concerned is always the best way to manage differences in the South China Sea. The United States should not get involved in bilateral disputes over the relevant islands and reefs of Nansha Qundao, nor should it aid or abet the impulsion to make provocations.- The report adds that -the two Presidents reiterated the seven-point common understandings on the guiding principles for China-U.S. relations, namely treating each other with respect, finding a way to live alongside each other peacefully, maintaining open lines of communication, preventing conflict, upholding the United Nations Charter, cooperating in areas of shared interest, and responsibly managing competitive aspects of the relationship.

Dear Elon, Let's Talk Cooperation	Hi folks, Doing an extra edition today, detailing one rather interesting article in the paper today. This one is bylined Hua Ping (). It talks about the Tesla Effect as part of China's NEV sector. The article's purpose is to praise Tesla's impact on China's NEV sector and make the case for open economic cooperation between China and the US. The argument is that China's opening benefited Tesla; Tesla's factory and presence in the Chinese market benefited the Chinese NEV sector as a whole; and the consequent expansion of China's NEV sector has benefited the global economy and green transition. Ergo, Dear Elon, your company is awesome; please let President-elect Donald Trump know that the US and China must focus on win-win and multi-win collaboration. -The article argues that after the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, restrictions on foreign investment in the manufacturing sector were fully lifted, demonstrating China's confidence in steadily expanding institutional opening-up.- ，，。 It adds: -In April 2018, General Secretary Xi Jinping announced, ‘we must quickly relax foreign ownership restrictions, especially foreign investment restrictions, in the automotive industry'. Three months later, Tesla announced the construction of a factory in Shanghai, with a total investment of 50 billion yuan and planned annual production capacity of 500,000 vehicles. In January 2019, Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory broke ground, and in December of the same year, the first complete vehicle rolled off the production line. As the first wholly foreign-owned new energy vehicle project, Tesla's ‘complete vehicle manufacturing', with its ‘Tesla speed' of starting construction, completing construction, and starting production all in the same year, provided Tesla with broad development space, and also brought a ‘catfish effect', compelling Chinese automakers to accelerate innovation. China's new energy vehicle production ‘exceeding 10 million annually' has one important reason: facing fierce competition in an open environment and facing Tesla's ‘catfish effect', Chinese auto companies dared to confront challenges directly and actively adapted and sought change. Developing real capabilities through open competition, today's China has become the world's most active industrial center for new energy vehicle technological innovation. In 2023, China's automobile exports jumped to first place globally, among which new energy vehicle exports exceeded 1.2 million units, increasing by 77.6% year-on-year.- 20184，，--。3，，500，50。20191，，12。--，、、--，，--，. --，，，--，、。，。2023，，120，77.6%。 Share The article then makes the following points: Starting from November 1, the new version of the negative list for foreign investment access will be implemented. The number of restrictive measures will be reduced from 31 to 29. This means that China has the firm determination to promote a higher level of opening up, and is brave enough to enhance its openness in expanding international cooperation and win new advantages in international competition. 111，，3129。，，。 China's NEV sector's growth is a product of -integration of scientific and technological innovation and industrial innovation.- And they have -achieved a strong rise, transitioning from running alongside others to leading the way in terms of production and sales, core technologies, and levels of intelligence.- ，--。，、、. China's NEVs hitting the 10 million production volume is a -‘green milestone' for the global new energy industry.- Green and low-carbon development is a universal trend, which cannot be blocked by ‘small yards and high walls'. In the first three quarters of this year, China exported a total of 928,000 NEVs, a year-on-year increase of 12.5%. Faced with ‘additional tariffs' and other big sticks, global consumers have used their actions to express their love for quality products and their pursuit of green and low-carbon concepts.- 、，--。，92.8，12.5%。--，、. Leave a comment It then says: -Cooperation and mutual benefit are the right path and broad way, while isolation and exclusivity are dead ends. Only through cooperative win-win can things be accomplished, be done well, and be done on a grand scale. Leveraging advantages in technology and brand, and backed by China's super-large-scale consumer market, Tesla's substantial sales growth has driven rapid development of upstream and downstream industry and supply chains. Today, Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory has achieved a localization rate of parts exceeding 95%, and more than 60 suppliers have entered Tesla's global supply chain system. Relying on China's perfect supply chain system and first-class intelligent manufacturing capabilities, Tesla's Shanghai Super Factory has an average of one vehicle rolling off the assembly line every 30 seconds. In 2023, the output of Tesla's Chinese factory accounts for more than half of its global production capacity, of which 36% caters to the export market. Tesla's success in the Chinese market is a process of mutual and multi-win collaboration, aligning with the global division of labour in industrial and supply chains in the era of economic globalisation. It exemplifies the philosophy of cooperative win-win outcomes and harmonious coexistence.- Share Tracking People's Daily -Today, more and more multinational car companies are utilising the advantages of China's market, technology, and policy openness to achieve the transformation of ‘in China, for the world'. In Hungary, Spain, Myanmar, Malaysia, Brazil ... Chinese new energy vehicle companies are establishing overseas factories to promote green cooperation and facilitate the green, low-carbon transition in more countries and regions. On the evening of November 14, the Peruvian Chancay Port, a key BRI project jointly built by China and Peru, opened. As South America's first intelligent green port, its operation will create over 8,000 direct jobs annually for Peru, generate $4.5 billion in revenue, and mark the emergence of the new Asia-Latin America land-sea corridor in the new era. ‘From Chancay to Shanghai', from win-win to multi-win.

Based on the concept of win-win cooperation, we continue to provide new opportunities for world development with new achievements in Chinese-style modernization, and are willing to work with all parties to promote the realization of world modernization of peaceful development, mutually beneficial cooperation and common prosperity. Great opening up brings great development, and high-level opening up promotes high-quality development. In opening up, we have not only acquired real skills, but also greatly enhanced our confidence in development. Having faced countless risks and challenges, by steadfastly expanding openness and focusing on managing our own affairs well, we have ultimately turned dangers into safety and crises into opportunities. Using openness to drive reform and promote development, today's China is more resilient and steadfast than ever.

China-Peru Joint Statement - Celebrating NEV Output Landmark - Funding Basic Research - Yin Hejun Outlines Sci-Tech Tasks - Philippines Sends Supplies...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, November 15, 2024. Page 1: Let's start by covering Xi Jinping's visit to Peru. The paper is lagging behind on developments. Today, it has carried Xi's article published in Peruvian media (English report) outlet El Peruano. Xi called Peru a -‘neighbor' of China across the Pacific Ocean-. He wrote: -Peruvian thinker José Carlos Mariátegui once said, ‘Spiritually and materially, China is closer to us than Europe. The psychology of our people is more Asian than Western.' This is the ‘code of civilization' that explains the inseparable bond between immigrants of Chinese origin and the local people, forged through seamless integration and familial ties over the past 175 years.- -Peru is one of the first Latin American countries to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. For over 50 years, our bilateral relations have been progressing steadily. Especially since the elevation of our relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2013, our ties have grown stronger and our practical cooperation fruitful, bringing tangible benefits to our peoples. In fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, China sent a medical expert team to Peru. We also provided vaccines and other medical supplies to the best of our ability. We have proven through concrete actions that China is a trustworthy friend that Peru can rely on in crucial moments. Peru is the first Latin American country to sign a package FTA with China. It is also among the first in Latin America to participate in cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative. China has been Peru's largest trading partner and largest export market for 10 consecutive years. Last year, Peru's exports to China accounted for 36 percent of its total exports. Chinese businesses have an investment stock of about US$ 30 billion in Peru. The Las Bambas copper mine, a project with investment from Chinese enterprises, contributes to about 1 percent of Peru's GDP, creating tens of thousands of job opportunities. The Saúl Garrido Rosillo Hospital in Tumbes, a project undertaken by a Chinese enterprise, will serve over 100,000 local residents. The water project in the three districts of Lima will enable more than 400,000 people to access clean water and sanitation services.- The article talks about the inauguration ceremony of Chancay Port, which Xi has already participated in along with the Peruvian president Dina Boluarte. In the article, Xi wrote that: -This is not only an important project under Belt and Road cooperation, but also the first smart port in South America. The first phase of the project, when completed, will reduce the sea shipping time from Peru to China to 23 days, thus cutting logistics costs by at least 20 percent. It is expected to generate US$ 4.5 billion in yearly revenues for Peru and create over 8,000 direct jobs. The completion of Chancay Port will enable Peru to put in place a multi-dimensional, diverse and efficient network of connectivity spanning from coast to inland, from Peru to Latin America and further on to the Caribbean. It will also help build an Inca Trail of the New Era with Chancay Port as its starting point, thus boosting the overall development and integration of the region. The port's development plan also includes establishing animal rescue services to fulfill its social responsibility for the rescue and protection of penguins, seals, and birds and to improve the environment of wetlands, beaches, and habitats. It is thus very important that we work together to ensure the success of Chancay Port from construction through operation, so that the route from Chancay to Shanghai will lead China, Peru and Latin America to common development and prosperity.- Xi also promised that -China is also ready to launch in Peru more ‘small and beautiful' livelihood cooperation projects, open more Luban Workshops and centers for Chinese language learning, and strengthen cooperation on vocational education. We will encourage Chinese companies to create more jobs and fulfill their social responsibilities in Peru, making our paisano friendship more tangible and beneficial.- He added: -We should take more measures to facilitate personnel exchanges to garner greater public support for our relations. We should enhance cooperation under the framework of the Ancient Civilizations Forum. We should explore the establishment of a global network for dialogue and cooperation among civilizations, and support their exchanges and mutual learning.- And said: -China is ready to join Peru in embracing a broader vision and grasping the underlying trends of our times from a long historical perspective to champion true multilateralism, promote an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, jointly implement the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, and build together a community with a shared future for mankind.- Subscribe now Xi has already held talks with the Peruvian president. The detailed readout is awaited. But the joint statement following the talks is out. Key points: Both sides are satisfied with the fruitful results of the talks, which will deepen bilateral cooperation in strategic areas such as infrastructure, energy, and mining. Both sides emphasize that the ‘Joint Action Plan 2024-2029' has great significance for promoting the development of bilateral relations. Both sides commit to taking concrete actions to implement this plan. ，、。，《20242029》。. Both sides emphasized that China's development brings new cooperation opportunities for developing countries, including Peru. The Chinese side reiterated its support for Peru to follow an economic and social development path that suits its national conditions, and wished Peru success in achieving its related goals.75，。，。，. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and core interests of all countries. Peru reiterated its firm adherence to the one-China principle. 《》，、。. Both sides welcome the signing of the upgraded protocol of the China-Peru Free Trade Agreement during this visit. Both sides are willing to continue to promote trade and investment facilitation, strengthen customs inspection and quarantine cooperation, and increase trade in high value-added products. 。，，. Both sides emphasized the importance of bilateral mechanisms such as the China-Peru Strategic Dialogue on Economic Cooperation. The two sides held the fourth strategic dialogue on economic cooperation in October 2024, conducted effective dialogues in the field of investment, and exchanged experiences and practices on issues such as investment standardization and facilitation. 。202410，，、. The document talks about cooperation in large-scale infrastructure projects, and areas like circular economy, sustainable agriculture, industrial and supply chains, digital economy investment, and green development. Both sides welcomed Chinese airlines to establish air links between China and Peru through code sharing to cultivate the market for the opening of direct flights between the two countries. ，. — Just a note on this. Xi stopped over in Gran Canaria on his way to Peru. Both sides agreed to strengthen cooperation in digital economy, scientific and technological innovation, digital transformation, talent exchange, technology transfer, and digital security, promoting the development of emerging technologies like AI, robotics, IoT, blockchain, data analytics, nanotechnology, and telemedicine. 、、、、、，、、、、、、. The two sides -stressed that it is of great significance to strengthen cooperation in AI capacity building and enhance the digital competitiveness of all people, especially the vulnerable groups. During the life cycle of AI systems, special attention should be paid to respecting, protecting and promoting human rights, fundamental freedoms, human dignity, safeguarding personal privacy and data, and promoting diversity and inclusiveness.- ，、。，、、、，，. The document then talks about strengthening cultural, educational and tourism exchanges. China also committed to doing -small but beautiful cooperation projects in the field of people's livelihood- and -provide economic and technical assistance to Peru within its capacity.- Both sides are willing to strengthen fishery cooperation, promote sustainable development of fisheries, cooperate to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and agree to strengthen communication and exchanges between the law enforcement agencies of both sides. ，，、、，. The next bits talk about their -commitment to multilateralism, safeguarding the international system with the United Nations at its core and the international order based on international law…-; support for -the open, transparent and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core- and decision to -jointly safeguard multilateralism and oppose protectionism-; and -willingness to continue to promote the construction of high-quality cooperation mechanisms in key areas such as economy, trade, investment, minerals, infrastructure, industry, finance, industry, agriculture, fisheries, aquaculture, green development, blue economy, new infrastructure construction, renewable energy, digital economy and e-commerce.- This is under BRI. Peru welcomes China's willingness to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and reiterates that this agreement has expanded and enriched trade exchanges in the Asia-Pacific region. 《》，. Peru positively evaluates the Global Civilization Initiative proposed by China. And it reaffirmed support for GDI. Interestingly, there is no mention of GSI or the Global AI Governance Initiative by China. Anyway, -China appreciated Peru's joining the ‘Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative' and invited Peru to join the Global Development Promotion Center Network.- Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a Ren Ping article discussing that as of November 14, China's new energy vehicles output exceeded 10 million for the first time. The article says that -this is an important node for China to move from a large automobile country to a powerful automobile country, marking a new stage of high-quality development for China's new energy vehicle industry.- 1114，1000。，. The report adds that: Looking back. In 2012, the annual output was 13,000 vehicles. In 2018, the annual output reached 1 million. In 2024, the annual output is expected to reach 12 million vehicles. Looking at the world. In 2023, China's new energy vehicle production and sales accounted for more than 60% of the global total, and the production and sales volume ranked first in the world for 9 consecutive years. 。2012，1.3。2018，。2024，1200。。2023，60%，9. The article adds that: -the reason why the new energy vehicle industry has grown from small to large and from weak to strong is that technological innovation is the key variable. After the ‘Qilin' battery and ‘Shenxing' battery, CATL recently released the ‘Xiaoyao' super range-extended hybrid battery. This is the world's first range-extended hybrid battery with a pure electric range of over 400 km, featuring 4C ultra-fast charging capability. In recent years, China has made major breakthroughs in core technology paths such as plug-in hybrid, pure electric, and hydrogen fuel, and has a leading advantage in the three major technical fields of new energy vehicles, such as batteries, motors, and electronic controls. By driving industrial innovation with technological innovation and strategically arranging the industrial chain around the development of new-quality productive forces, China has significantly enhanced the resilience and security level of the supply and industrial chains. Over 1000 intelligent devices, over 3000 robots working intelligently in coordination, 100% automation of key processes ... Using intelligent production, Chongqing SERES super factory rolls off two new energy vehicles per minute. Behind China's transition from ‘Made in China' to ‘Intelligently Made in China' is the ‘qualitative change' brought by technological innovation. As of now, China has established 421 national-level intelligent manufacturing demonstration factories and built tens of thousands of provincial-level digital workshops and intelligent factories.- 、，。、，--。400，4C。，、、，、、。，，。1000，3000，100%……，。，--。，421，. The article adds: In order to promote Chinese-style modernization, technological innovation is the only way. The 2024 Global Innovation Index Report shows that China's global innovation ranking has jumped to 11th place, making it one of the fastest-growing economies in innovation in the past 10 years. In the first three quarters of this year, investment in high-tech industries increased by 10.0% year-on-year, 6.6 percentage points higher than total investment, maintaining double-digit growth for 7 consecutive months. The added value of high-tech manufacturing increased by 9.1%, 3.3 percentage points faster than all industries above designated size. We have sufficient strength and great potential to develop new quality productive forces by using disruptive and cutting-edge technologies to spawn new industries, new models, and new momentum. We will continue to do a good job in innovation, promote the accelerated integration of technological innovation and industrial innovation, and achieve high-level scientific and technological self-reliance. The scientific and technological support for Chinese-style modernization will be stronger. ，。《2024》，，10。，10.0%，6.6，7。9.1%，3.3。、、，，、。，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Later the article says: -Developing new energy vehicles is a strategic choice to conform to the trend of a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation and promote green and low-carbon development. Since the new era, with the new development concept as a strategic guide and the goal of meeting the diverse needs of the people through green and low-carbon smart products, new energy vehicles have strongly driven the real economy toward a path of green and low-carbon development. In the wave of green and low-carbon growth, new-quality productive forces and a broad range of consumers are ‘heading toward each other' — a 2022 market survey showed that users under 40 years old accounted for as much as 84% of new energy vehicle users in China, with people under 30 making up nearly half. A survey in the second quarter of this year showed that 53.6% of Chinese consumers chose new energy vehicles, noticeably higher than the 36.2% who preferred fuel-powered vehicles … In the wave of green and low-carbon growth, we are seizing the historical opportunity of electrification, intelligence and green transformation, taking the lead in switching to a new track, and establishing new advantages in international competition. In the first three quarters of this year, China's cumulative exports of new energy vehicles reached 928,000, an increase of 12.5% ​​year-on-year. This has not only met the needs of global consumers for high-quality products and services, but has also led the global transportation energy transformation and reform…Today, China's high-quality production capacity of electric vehicles, lithium batteries, photovoltaic products, etc., has provided important support for the world's green development. China's green production capacity has not only enriched global supply, but also effectively helped developing countries achieve carbon reduction targets and contributed to global response to climate change. ，、。，，，。，--——2022，4084%，30。，，53.6%，36.2%。，，，。，、、，，。，92.8，12.5%，，。，《》，-，-，-，-。，、、，。，，. Share In contrast, reporting from the US indicates that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is planning to kill the $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric-vehicle purchases as part of broader tax-reform legislation. Reuters' report adds that: -ending the tax credit could have grave implications for an already stalling U.S. EV transition. And yet representatives of Tesla - by far the nation's biggest EV maker - have told a Trump-transition committee they support ending the subsidy, said the two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, one of Trump's biggest backers and the world's richest person, said in July that killing the subsidy might slightly hurt Tesla sales but would be ‘devastating' to its U.S. EV competitors, which include legacy automakers such as General Motors…Repealing the subsidy, a signature measure of Democratic President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), is being discussed in meetings by an energy-policy transition team led by billionaire oilman Harold Hamm, founder of Continental Resources, and Republican North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, the two sources said…Trump campaigned on ending Biden's ‘EV mandate', without spelling out specific targeted policies. The energy-focused transition team has determined some of Biden's clean-energy policies will be tough to end because they are popular and already funneling money to Republican-dominated states, the sources said. The team views the consumer EV credit as an easy target, believing that eliminating it would get broad consensus in a Republican-controlled Congress. Trump could use the cost savings from killing the credit to help pay for the extension of trillions of dollars in tax cuts from his first term that are set to expire soon, the two sources said. Congressional Republicans plan to take up the broader tax bill as one of their first actions.- Another report, meanwhile, quotes CATL's Robin Zeng saying that the company would be open to invest in a plant in the US if Trump opens the door to Chinese investment in the electric-vehicle supply chain. The report adds: -Trump wants to prevent Chinese auto imports but has said he remains open to Chinese automakers building vehicles in the United States. Trump told Reuters in an August interview: ‘We're going to give incentives, and if China and other countries want to come here and sell the cars, they're going to build plants here, and they're going to hire our workers.' Such comments have kept Zeng interested in a US expansion for CATL. ‘I do hope that in the future they are open to investments,' he said.- Subscribe now Next, there's a report on Li Qiang signing a decree of the State Council, unveiling a set of revised regulations on the use of the national natural science fund. This will come into effect on January 1, 2025. The Regulations have 7 chapters and 45 articles.

First, Liu Dejun, spokesperson for the China Coast Guard, said that on November 14, with China's permission, the Philippines sent a civilian ship to deliver daily necessities to its warship that was illegally ‘grounded' on Ren'ai Reef (Second Thomas Shoal). The CCG questioned and confirmed the Philippine ship and supervised the entire process. It is hoped that the Philippines will honour its commitment, move in the same direction as China, and jointly manage the maritime situation. The China Coast Guard will continue to carry out rights protection and law enforcement activities in the Nansha Islands (Spratly Islands), including Ren'ai Reef, and its surrounding waters in accordance with the law. ，1114，，1--，。，，。. Second, CCG -conducted law enforcement patrols- on Thursday in the territorial waters and surrounding areas of Huangyan Dao (Scarborough Shoal) in the South China Sea. -This rights protection patrol was carried out by the CCG in accordance with the law-. Global Times reported: -The Chinese military on Wednesday conducted combat readiness patrols over the territorial waters and airspace of China's Huangyan Dao and surrounding areas. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) Southern Theater Command said the latest move, involving naval and air forces, was a lawful patrol activity. The patrols came after China released the baselines of the territorial sea adjacent to Huangyan Dao on Sunday. ‘The patrols by the China Coast Guard and Chinese military demonstrate China's position of sovereignty in the maritime area through concrete actions,' Chen Xiangmiao, director of the World Navy Research Center at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, told the Global Times on Thursday. These patrols were also intended to uphold maritime order in the region, Chen said, noting that they aimed to regulate the management of the waters surrounding Huangyan Dao, signaling to the Philippines and the US that China would take corresponding law enforcement actions. ‘Through maritime patrols, China can effectively demonstrate and exercise its rights, thereby upholding its legitimate interests in the relevant waters,' Chen said.- Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Ding met with Singapore President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong, and Senior Minister of State and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean. Ding's message to the Singaporean leaders was: -Next year, the two countries will celebrate the 35th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations.

China is willing to work with Singapore to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, strengthen high-level exchanges, consolidate political mutual trust, firmly support each other on issues involving each other's core interests and major concerns, and promote China-Singapore relations to a new level. Ding Xuexiang pointed out that both China and Singapore are on a new journey of national development, with similar development concepts, broad common interests and very broad prospects for cooperation. The two sides should more closely align their development strategies, strengthen overall planning, constantly tap new points of linkages in their interests and for growth in cooperation, continue to create high-quality cooperation benchmarks, and promote the upgrading of cooperation.

Wang said that: -Under the strong leadership of the two heads of state, China-Russia relations have withstood the test of international vicissitudes and have always maintained a healthy and stable development momentum. The two sides have adhered to the principles of lasting good-neighbourliness and friendship, comprehensive strategic coordination, and mutually beneficial cooperation, taken serving the fundamental interests of the two peoples as their own responsibility, firmly supported each other on issues of core concern to each other, continuously deepened political mutual trust, and solidly promoted pragmatic cooperation, creating a new paradigm for relations between neighbouring major countries, and made important contributions to promoting unity and cooperation among countries in the Global South. Wang Yi stressed that the China-Russia strategic security consultation mechanism should be based on the implementation of the consensus reached by the two heads of state, strengthen coordination on strategic and overall issues concerning the security and development interests of both sides, continuously enhance the level of strategic mutual trust, and enrich the connotation of strategic cooperation.

Share Tracking People's Daily The MoFA readout has some additional context. Wang Yi emphasized that the leadership of the heads of state is the greatest political advantage and fundamental guarantee for the high-quality development of China-Russia relations. The China-Russia strategic security consultation mechanism must take the implementation of the consensus between the two heads of state as its fundamental guideline, strengthening coordination on strategic and overarching issues that concern the security and development interests of both sides, continuously enhancing the level of strategic mutual trust, and enriching the substance of strategic cooperation. China-Russia relations possess an inevitable historical logic and strong internal driving force. The more complex the international situation and the more external challenges arise, the more both sides should firmly unite and cooperate to safeguard their common interests. We are willing to work together with Russia, keeping an eye on changes in the international situation, maintaining close communication and coordination, strengthening multilateral cooperation, providing strong guarantees for the sustained high-level development of China-Russia relations, and jointly safeguarding global strategic stability.- ，。，、，，。。，，，。，，，，，. As per this readout, Shoigu said that -Russia and China have consistently upheld mutual respect, treated each other as equals, refrained from interfering in each other's internal affairs, and firmly supported each other's core interests. The comprehensive strategic coordination between the two countries is at an unprecedented high level. Recently, President Xi Jinping attended the BRICS Leaders' Summit in Kazan, Russia, providing the strongest support for Russia as the chair country and making an important contribution to the summit's success and to strengthening global South-South cooperation. In the face of an unstable world, the importance of Russia and China maintaining communication and exchange has become even more evident.

Speaking to Wang in Beijing, Shoigu stressed the need for China and Russia to ‘counter the 'dual containment' policy directed against Russia and China by the United States and its satellites'. ‘The comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation [between China and Russia] represent a model of collaboration between two powers in today's world,' he told the Chinese foreign minister. ‘Although it is not a military-political alliance like those formed during the Cold War, the relations between our countries surpass this form of interstate relations,' Shoigu said, as quoted by Russian news agencies.- Subscribe now Another report on the page informs of Li Ganjie meeting with a visiting delegation of the Presidential Executive Office of Russia, led by Russian presidential aide Dmitry Mironov.

There has been a series of such meetings of late, where He has indicated openness to Western firms and capital. He told Schlossberg that -China is continuing to deepen the reform of the capital market, steadily expanding the institutional opening up of the financial sector, and striving to provide high-quality financial services for economic and social development. Companies from all countries, including Invesco, are welcome to continue deepening investment cooperation with China for mutual benefit and win-win results.- Subscribe now Finally, there's a report on the Global South Media and Think Tank Forum that was held in Sao Paulo. Instead of this, I want to point to the Xinhua Institute's report that was released during this forum. It is titled: -New Model for Human Advancement and Its Global Significance-. If there is any doubt that Beijing sees value in promoting its governance model, let me share the following for you to consider. The report talks about how China has created a -distinct path to modernization- under the CPC -and thereby created a new model for human advancement, which provides effective solutions to the problems facing the entire humanity-. It adds that -the emergence of the new model for human advancement has brought the Chinese civilization back to the frontier of human advancement.- -The emergence of the new model for human advancement has exerted enormous influence upon the whole world. It busted the myth that ‘modernization is Westernization', and created an effective path toward modernization for almost one fifth of the world population, thus offering a brand-new option for large numbers of developing countries seeking modernization.The new model for human advancement is a huge contribution that China has made to innovating both the theory and practice of the world's modernization efforts, as it contributes the Chinese wisdom to tackling global challenges, and points out the right way to further progress of human advancement. Highly inclusive, this new model for human advancement sticks to allowing cultural exchanges to transcend estrangement, mutual learning to transcend clashes, and coexistence to transcend feelings of superiority.This new form, constantly enriched and developed as it fuels the construction of a better world, will play a huge role in making the garden of the world civilizations more colorful and vibrant.- Later, the report discusses the constituents of the Chinese model. One of the aspects discussed is -Political Integrity-. This consists of the -Leadership Core of the CPC-, -Whole-Process People's Democracy-, and -Law-Based Governance on All Fronts-. The final chapter of the report seeks to draw lessons from the Chinese model for others. It says: -By combining the distinctiveness of Chinese civilization with the shared values of humanity, China has created a new model for human advancement. Such a new model presents a new landscape distinct from Western models of modernization. It achieves significant innovations in the theory and practice of global modernization, and offers a brand-new option for developing countries to pursue independent development. By combining the distinctiveness of Chinese civilization with the shared values of humanity, China has created a new model for human advancement. Such a new model presents a new landscape distinct from Western models of modernization. It achieves significant innovations in the theory and practice of global modernization, and offers a brand-new option for developing countries to pursue independent development.- It adds: -Western style modernization has never adequately tackled numerous human development challenges, and has instead exacerbated crises in some developing countries. The unique worldviews, values, and views on history, civilization, democracy, and ecology, and their remarkable application in Chinese modernization, have made vital innovative contributions to the theory and practice of global modernization. They also demonstrate to the world that the path to modernization is not unique to any one country, and human civilization still moves on and history's final chapter remains unwritten.- Then we get select points pitching the Chinese model: The new model for human advancement deriving from Chinese modernization reflects a disparate worldview that emphasizes the pursuit of common prosperity for all rather than zero-sum games. China holds the conviction that the development of all nations is closely intertwined, and humanity is a global community of shared future where all people rise and fall together. Only through concerted efforts, solidarity, and cooperation among all nations can humanity secure a brighter future. The new model for human advancement originating from Chinese modernization showcases distinctive values that prioritize the well-being of people over the accumulation of capital. In terms of value orientation, Chinese modernization, which conforms to the people-centered principle, is fundamentally different fromWestern-style modernization, which, on the contrary, worships capital. Chinese modernization insists on development for the people, by the people and to the benefit of the people. The new model for human advancement resulting from Chinese modernization embodies a unique historical perspective highlighting a broad view of history rather than the shallow-minded narrative of the ‘end of history'. China argues that the progression of human society is driven by fundamental social contradictions, and it is the universal laws governing the movement of these contradictions that shape the basic trajectory of humanity's historical development. In pursuing modernization, China emphasizes the importance of summarizing historical experiences, understanding historical laws, and initiating historical progress. By analyzing evolutionary mechanisms and exploring major historical patterns through the lens of historical context, current trends, and global dynamics, and proposing corresponding strategies, China has constantly sustained the vigor and vitality of Marxism, and showcased the profound historical depth of its civilization traversing over five millennia. The new model for human advancement emanating from Chinese modernization offers a different perspective on civilization that stresses exchanges and mutual learning rather than conflict and estrangement. The new model for human advancement stemming from Chinese modernization underlines whole-process people's democracy which stands out as a distinct concept compared to mere formal democracy. China claims that democracy is a treasure shared by all humankind rather than a patent of a few countries; whether a country is democratic or not is determined solely by its citizens; democracy is not an ornament or a façade, and the criterion for evaluating democracy should not solely center on its form, but rather on whether it truly allows its people to govern their own affairs and whether it can be employed to address people's concerns. People are entitled to the right to elect and vote, and moreover, to extensive participation; they can express their will freely and see it effectively fulfilled; better still, they can also do their part in promoting national development and share in its gains. Whole-process people's democracy embodies the will and voices of the people in every facet of national political and social life, transcending the formal democratic model of the West solely obsessed with ‘votes' and showcasing the edges of socialist democracy in governance efficiency. The new model for human advancement forged by Chinese modernization encompasses a distinct ecological outlook that advocates for creating a community of all life on Earth. Share Tracking People's Daily Later the report says: -China does not follow the old path of some countries in achieving modernization through war, colonization and plunder. On the contrary, it holds high the banner of peace, development, cooperation, and mutual benefit, seeking its own progress while resolutely safeguarding world peace and development. China's successful advancement towards modernization can be attributed to its adherence to the overall leadership of the CPC in propelling Chinese modernization, its commitment to people-centered development philosophy, its perseverance in pursuing an independent path, its effective employment of reform and opening-up, its insistence on innovation-driven development, and its systematic approach to support progress. These remarkable experiences and practices have set a good example for the vast array of developing countries to pursue modernization on their own, offered fresh options for nations who want to accelerate development while preserving their independence, and provided Chinese solutions for humankind's exploration of a better social system.- After this, the report talks about GDI, GSI and GCI. Some useful data points: Since the GDI's introduction, China has established over 30 cooperative platforms and initiated more than 1,100 projects in eight key areas including poverty alleviation, food security, COVID-19 response and vaccines, development financing, climate change and green development, industrialization, digital economy, and digital-age connectivity, which cover all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the Agenda. So far, China has invested and mobilized a range of development funds totaling nearly USD 20 billion and launched more than 600 projects from the GDI project database. Currently, the GSI has won support and applause from over 100 countries and international organizations as it represents China's solution to address global peace deficit and security challenges… Share Tracking People's Daily Page 4: There is a brief report on a seminar held in Shanghai to study Xi's thoughts on urban governance work. Propaganda chief Li Shulei and Shanghai Secretary Chen Jining spoke at this meeting. Page 9: There's an article by the National Defense University's Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era Research Center. My Note: This is an important article to read for people around the world, particularly those in India, who seem to assume that the logic of economic engagement with China can rest simply on the basis of economic principles. National security thinking is deeply embedded in Beijing's approach, and I would argue that it is understandable for Beijing to have these national security concerns. However, you should ignore this reality at your own peril. This does not mean that one must decouple or that decoupling is inevitable. In fact, decoupling is impractical and will have adverse economic and strategic consequences. But one needs to appreciate that security will have to be a key component of economic decisionmaking. Conceptually, this is self-evident now. The debate, therefore, needs to move away from this argument to focussing on modalities for estimating risk and vulnerability, sectoral and sub-sectoral actions, and putting in place processes that ensure that security concerns do not result in opacity and unpredictability in policymaking, which will adversely affect businesses. Share Tracking People's Daily Anyway, back to the article. The article begins by telling us that the Third Plenum Decision held that -national security provides a pivotal foundation for ensuring steady and sustained progress in Chinese modernization-. -This important conclusion profoundly demonstrates the foresight of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core in coordinating development and security, and provides scientific guidance to build a solid security guarantee for China's modernization-. The article says: Proactively addressing various risks and challenges serves the intrinsic requirement to support the undertaking of building a strong nation and achieving national rejuvenation. Using Chinese-style modernization to comprehensively advance the building of a strong nation and the great cause of national rejuvenation is not going to be a smooth, obstacle-free path but rather a long expedition that requires continuously breaking through barriers and seizing strategic positions. At present, China's development has entered a period where various risks and challenges are accumulating and even manifesting at once. The risks and tests faced on the path forward will only become more complex, and may even encounter unimaginable stormy seas. For an undertaking as immensely challenging yet magnificent as Chinese-style modernization, one cannot expect everything to go smoothly. It is essential to deeply understand that security has become a regular and crucial variable in China's economic and social development. While developing, we must solidly lay the security foundation and repeatedly strengthen the security base. Only by comprehensively strengthening the national security barrier, firmly grasping the strategic initiative in maintaining national security, and striving to either prevent major risks from appearing or being able to withstand and get through them when they do appear, can we truly achieve higher quality, more efficient, fairer, more sustainable and safer development, and ensure that a series of major development strategic goals of the Party and the country will be achieved as scheduled. ，、。、，，。，，，。，，，、。，，、，、、、、，. The next paragraph pats China on the back for achieving the -two miracles-. It then cautions: -Without national security, development miracles can only be ‘castles in the air', the dream of a good life can only be illusory, and already-achieved results could be destroyed in an instant. Therefore, to write a new chapter of the ‘two miracles' and effectively meet the people's growing need for a better life, it is essential to ensure that national security is guaranteed, continually resolving the risks and challenges along the path forward.- ，，--，--，。，--、，，. The steady and long-term development of Chinese-style modernization is inseparable from a peaceful international environment and a good neighbouring environment. At present, the profound once-in-a-century changes are accelerating in their evolution, traditional security and non-traditional security issues are complexly intertwined, the interconnected nature, transnational nature, and diversity of security issues are becoming more prominent, and the backflow effect, confluence effect, superposition effect, linkage effect, amplification effect, and inducement effect of various risks are becoming more pronounced. Only by upholding national sovereignty, security, and development interests with core national interests as the bottom line and leading the reform of the global governance system based on the principles of fairness and justice, both promoting our own development through maintaining world peace and contributing to world peace through our own development, resolutely opposing all forms of hegemonism and power politics, and firmly rejecting all practices that sacrifice other countries' security to gain absolute security for oneself, can we promote the building of a community with a shared future for humanity. In doing so, we can integrate safeguarding national security and promoting international security, making Chinese-style modernization progress more steadily and soundly. 、、，。、，。，。，，，、、，、、、、、。、、，，，，，，，，. The second section reiterates that as per the third plenum outcome national security is -a pivotal foundation for the steady and sustained development of Chinese-style modernization.- It adds: -This major conclusion examines national security from the perspective of the central tasks of the Party and the country in the new era and new journey, so that the theory and practice of national security are closely centered on Chinese-style modernization, and more theoretical innovations related to Chinese-style modernization will emerge in the field of national security.- ，，. It adds that -the issue of national security has a distinct political nature.- -Linking national security with central tasks for positioning and deployment fully demonstrates the political considerations of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, endows national security with a deeper political foundation, and enables us to implement the overall national security concept from a higher political position.- ，，，。 A country's development and security are like two wings of one body, two wheels of one drive. They complement each other and cannot be neglected. They coexist and share a common fate. Security without the support of development is unlikely to endure, and development without the safeguard of security cannot be sustainable. The ‘Decision' of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee regards national security as an important foundation for the steady and long-term development of Chinese-style modernization, enriching the contemporary connotation of the dialectics of coordinating development and security. On the new journey, whether it is promoting high-quality development or creating high-level security, it must be viewed and planned in the overall situation of Chinese-style modernization. Only in this way can we promote high-level security with high-quality development and ensure high-quality development with high-level security, and achieve mutual support and promotion between high-quality development and high-level security, truly building a position of permanent security and achieving the enterprise of long-term governance.- ，、，、，、。，；，。《》，。，，。，、，、，、. The third and final section talks about practical implications. It calls for the -modernization of the national security system and capacity-. It adds: In practice, we must effectively use systematic thinking to observe security situations, analyze security issues, plan security countermeasures; be good at observing big trends, planning big matters, strengthen forward-looking thinking, overall planning, strategic layout, and comprehensive advancement; promote the connection, coordination and unified advancement of national security work in all fields and aspects. For example, we must emphasize coordinating external security and internal security, territorial security and citizen security, traditional security and non-traditional security, self security and common security, coordinate the maintenance and shaping of national security, and effectively prevent various types of risk transmission and superposition. At the same time, we must take scientific coordination as an important principle and basic method of national security work, coordinate high-quality development and high-level security, emphasize the synergy between national security work and various economic and social development work, achieve planning together and deploying together, and integrate national security into all aspects and links of the overall work of the Party and the country.- ，、、，、，、、、，、。，、、、，，、。，，，，、，.

China 'Hawks' Set for Trump Cabinet Posts? - Beijing Targets European Brandy - China-Russia Talks - Lashing Out at 'Evil' Philippine Laws - 'Confidenc...	Before I get to today's edition, let's cover a couple of interesting stories from outside the paper. First, WSJ reports that -US President-elect Donald Trump is expected to nominate Senator Marco Rubio of Florida as secretary of state and has asked Representative Mike Waltz, a Green Beret veteran, to be his White House national security adviser, according to people familiar with his thinking. Trump could change his mind on the Rubio move, as he remains fond of others lobbying for the secretary of state role. But people familiar with the Rubio decision said that Trump feels good about going with him; Trump had considered him for the vice president slot before settling on Ohio Sen. JD Vance.- The report adds: -Rubio's expected rise to the nation's top diplomatic post, earlier reported by the New York Times, would put a more establishment figure into the highest echelons of the Trump administration. A hawk on China, Iran and Cuba, Rubio joined most of Washington in supporting Ukraine against Russia's invasion. But in recent months he started changing his message, advocating for the conflict to end as soon as possible, last week stating the U.S. was ‘funding a stalemate war' and that it would take ‘100 years' to rebuild Ukraine. Trump's pick comes just hours after he decided to name Waltz, a fellow tough-on-China lawmaker, as national security adviser. Earlier, Trump also chose another Floridian, co-campaign manager Susie Wiles, as his chief of staff. Waltz will step into his cabinet-level role amid prolonged conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and Trump is expected to try to prevent further escalation abroad by building deterrence against foreign rivals while favoring transactional policies with U.S. allies.- Second, some reporting on China-EU ties amid all this. SCMP reports: -The Chinese foreign ministry's deputy head in charge of European affairs Cao Lei said on Saturday that Trump's election victory may indicate ‘the turning point of [our] times- and urged Brussels and Beijing to fix rifts and improve ties.' No one wants to return to the law of the jungle, no one wants to go back to the era of confrontation and the Cold War, and no one wants to return to unilateral hegemony. This is the backdrop that China-EU relations are facing,' he said.Cao was speaking at the launch of Beijing Foreign Studies University's China Think-Tank Network on Europe, which aims to foster renewed understanding between the two sides.- WSJ's Lingling Wei and Kim Mackrael report that -Beijing is looking at ways to peel American allies away from Washington … Trump's campaign pledge to impose tariffs of up to 60% on imports from China threatens the very growth model promoted by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, one that centers on ramping up manufacturing and exporting the country's way out of a downturn.To offset the potential hit to the already wobbly Chinese economy, the Xi leadership is considering plans to shower American allies in Europe and Asia with tariff cuts, visa exemptions, Chinese investments and other incentives, according to people close to Beijing's decision-making. They say that while China is willing to engage in dialogue with Washington once the new Trump team is in place, it is also seizing on the opportunity to court America's traditional partners to buy itself time and leverage in its intensifying competition with the U.S.- The report adds: -In recent months, China has already removed visa requirements for travelers from some two dozen countries including Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Finland and South Korea—without requiring that the moves be immediately reciprocated. The strategy, labeled -unilateral opening- in China's policy circles, represents a tactical change for a leadership that has long favored quid-pro-quo economic and diplomatic deals. He Lifeng, Xi's economic czar, hinted in recent meetings with Western business leaders that Beijing is weighing -proactive- tariff cuts in various sectors to boost foreign investment and trade with Europe and other Asian countries, according to the people close to the decision-making. The people say the sectors in focus include electrical and telecommunications equipment, as well as seafood and other agricultural products, depending on the countries Beijing is targeting.- Meanwhile, Global Times reports: -China's Ministry of Commerce announced on Monday that Chinese investigating agencies decided to impose temporary anti-dumping measures against brandy imported from the EU. Starting from November 15, when importing the products under investigation, importers must submit deposits or letters of guarantee to China's customs authorities based on the dumping margins as specified in the announcement. Experts noted that in contrast with the EU's unilateral move of launching an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese electric vehicles (EVs), the MOFCOM's decision is in line with China's domestic laws and WTO rules, and the investigation is based on the demands of the related industry. They urged the bloc to respect and attach importance to the benefits brought by the interdependence of China-EU economic and trade relations.- Share Tracking People's Daily Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Tuesday, November 12, 2024. Page 1: Let's begin with two reports about Xi Jinping. First, there's a report on Xi's congratulatory message to the Global South Media and Think Tank Forum being held in Brazil. Xinhua reports: -Noting that at present, the Global South is growing with a strong momentum and playing an increasingly important role in the cause of human progress, Xi said China has always been a member of the Global South and will always belong to the developing world. China is willing to work alongside Global South countries to practice true multilateralism, advocate for an equal and orderly multipolar world and universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, in a joint effort to build a community with a shared future for mankind, he said. Xi emphasized that in the face of global changes of the century, pursuing modernization and working for a more just and equitable international order are the sacred historic missions of Global South countries and the common issues of the times for Global South media and think tanks. Xi expressed hope that the forum's participants will engage in in-depth discussions, build consensus, and jointly amplify the ‘voice of the Global South' while showcasing the ‘commitment of the Global South'. He also urged them to contribute wisdom toward empowering the Global South to become a stabilizing force for peace, a backbone of openness and development, a constructive force in global governance, and a driving force for mutual learning among civilizations.- Second, there's a report on Xi's response to -letters from friendly personages from all walks of life in Brazil-. Xinhua reports: -China is willing to work with Brazil to enrich the friendship between the two countries in the new era, make China-Brazil relations a good example of solidarity, coordination, common development and mutual benefit among major developing countries, and make greater contributions to the cause of peace and progress of mankind, Xi said. He said Brazilian friends are welcome to visit China more often and experience for themselves the myriad sights of Chinese modernization. He voiced hope that people from all walks of life in the two countries will play a positive role in promoting the continuous development of China-Brazil relations and making the China-Brazil friendship flow unceasingly like the Yangtze River and the Amazon River, Xi added.- Subscribe now Next, there's a Jin Sheping commentary, which argues that the leadership's -confidence in achieving the expected target of around 5% is increasing-. This was the assessment made during the Q3 economic data press conference by the NBS, as per the article. -5%。---，. The article later adds that -in general, ‘stability' and ‘progress' are still the main themes of China's economy. On the one hand, the foundation of stability is more solid. The four major macroeconomic indicators of growth, employment, inflation, and balance of payments show that the overall economic operation is stable and steady. ‘These provide a good foundation for China's macroeconomic resilience', said Fan Zhiyong, professor of the School of Economics at Renmin University of China. On the other hand, the momentum of progress is increasing. The growth rate of high-tech industry investment and high-tech manufacturing added value is significantly ahead of the overall level. The more high-tech, high-efficiency, and high-quality industries are, the better the development will be.- ，----。，。、、、、，-。-。，。。、、，。 Share Tracking People's Daily The rest of the article discusses certain policy changes that have been implemented, such as allowing borrowers to negotiate with banks independently and adjust mortgage interest rates dynamically, the pursuit of the ‘two-heavy/priorities' (implementation of major national strategies and capacity building for security in key areas) and ‘two new' (large-scale equipment upgrades and trade-in for new consumer goods), pursuit of enacting the private economy promotion law, and capital market opening, etc. It ends with a call for renewed confidence.

Finally, there's a piece with comments from Mohammed A. Al Ajlan, Chairman, Saudi-Chinese Business Council, looking ahead at the G20 summit in Brazil. He -believes that in recent years, the contribution of emerging market countries and developing countries, including Saudi Arabia and China, to world economic growth has been continuously rising, and they have become an important force driving global economic growth and promoting stable development. Developing countries continue to strengthen South-South cooperation, actively voicing the Global South perspective in global governance, and promoting solutions to global issues with Global South initiatives. ‘Through enhanced communication, increased mutual trust, and united cooperation, developing countries are becoming an important force in improving global governance'.- ，，、，、。，，。-、、，。-.

In Ajlan's view, China's economy is resilient, has great potential and is full of vitality. By continuously optimizing its industrial structure, China will bring more positive energy to the stable development of the world economy. ‘On the basis of mutual benefit and win-win results, China is conducting positive interactions with other countries.

The author calls the new laws -evil- and claims that this is because they: are a serious infringement on China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea are a violation of international law and the norms of international relations under the banner of implementing international law impact the freedom and safety of navigation in the South China Sea threaten regional peace and stability aggravate the complexity of the situation in the South China Sea ，，，，，. Subsequently, too, the article calls them -thoroughly evil laws- and argues that -China's adoption of necessary measures to protect its own sovereign rights and interests is reasonable and legal, and is a legitimate action to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea.-t，. The author argues that the laws attempt to -embed the illegal ruling of the South China Sea arbitration case in the form of domestic legislation.- -China has sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and their adjacent waters, and over the Zhongsha Islands including Huangyan Island and their adjacent waters, and has sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the relevant waters. China's above-mentioned territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests have sufficient historical and legal basis and are in line with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The territorial scope of the Philippines is determined by a series of international treaties and has never included China's Huangyan Island and any islands and reefs of the Nansha Islands. For a long time, the Philippines has illegally occupied many islands and reefs of China's Nansha Islands; it has arbitrarily exceeded its own territorial scope and established the so-called ‘Kalayaan Island Group', infringing on China's territorial sovereignty, which is illegal and invalid. The Philippines' insistence on promoting the legislation of the so-called ‘Philippine Maritime Zones Act' has once again exposed the Philippines' real purpose of attempting to steal its illegally obtained gains in the South China Sea by manipulating domestic law, reflecting its ambitions for expansion in the South China Sea.- --，。、，。，《》。，。，；，--，，、。--，，，. The violation of international law argument is that -the so-called ‘Philippine Maritime Zones Act' uses the illegal ruling of the South China Sea arbitration case as one basis for the Philippines to delineate its maritime boundaries. This is akin to using an utter lie to cover up a lie and a fallacy to cover up a fallacy.- --，，. Basically, the argument is that the arbitration was illegal so it cannot be used as a basis for anything. -The Philippines' endorsement of its provocative actions based on the illegal ruling of the South China Sea arbitration case cannot conceal its illegal claims and actions of ‘expanding authority' in the South China Sea.- ，--. The next bit says that: -The evil of these evil laws lies in their impact on the freedom and safety of navigation in the South China Sea, threatening regional peace and stability, and intensifying the complexity of the South China Sea situation. The Philippines' ‘Two Laws' violate the provisions of the ‘Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea' regarding ‘exercising self-restraint and not taking actions that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability', which not only does not help resolve disputes but will further intensify contradictions. The so-called ‘Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act' contains multiple points that contradict international law regulations and International Maritime Organization resolutions. For example, the designated sea lanes do not include all commonly used international passages within Philippine archipelagic waters. This is inconsistent with the provisions of the UNCLOS that ‘all normal channels used for international navigation or overflight through or over archipelago waters should be included'. Moreover, all designated sea lanes are adjacent to U.S. military bases in the Philippines, and it cannot be ruled out that the Philippines is colluding with external countries to monitor passing vessels and threaten the navigational safety of all countries. The Philippine side's use of domestic law to exceed the scope authorised by international law, illegally restricting other countries' legitimate rights, has no binding force on other countries, including China. China demands that the Philippine side effectively comply with international law and not harm the legitimate rights enjoyed by all parties under international law, including the UNCLOS. Chinese vessels will continue to navigate in relevant waters and sea lanes in accordance with international law.- ，，，。--《》-，、-，，。--。，，《》--，，，，。，，。，《》。. Towards the end, the article says that -Huangyan Island is China's inherent territory. The Chinese government's delimitation and announcement of the territorial sea baselines of Huangyan Island, based on international law including the UNCLOS and the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, is a normal measure taken by the Chinese government to strengthen maritime management according to law, which complies with international law and international practice, and demonstrates China's firm determination and will to protect its rights. Regarding maritime disputes, China has always maintained high restraint and advocates seeking mutually acceptable solutions in the spirit of good-neighbourliness and friendship, respecting historical and legal facts. However, goodwill must not be abused. China does not accept any attempt to impose maritime jurisdiction on China through unilateral actions, nor does it recognize any actions that harm China's maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea. 。《》《》，，，，。，，，，。，，. The article ends by calling on the Philippines to -immediately stop taking any unilateral actions that may lead to the escalation of disputes and the complication of the situation, return to the right track of properly resolving differences through negotiations and consultations as soon as possible…- There's also a report on MoFA's comment attacking the US on this issue. Li Jian said: -Over the years, for the sake of its geopolitical agenda, the US has been instigating the Philippines to engage in acts of infringement and provocations in the South China Sea, as if the area needed any more instability. This vicious intention is so clear for all to see. While urging other countries to abide by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the US refuses to join it, which fully reveals its hypocrisy and double standards. The South China Sea arbitration in itself violates UNCLOS and is a political farce through and through, and the so-called arbitral award is illegal, null and void.- Share Tracking People's Daily A couple of other questions from the MoFA presser: -Reuters: Over the weekend, a joint statement between China and Indonesia said both sides -reached important common understanding on joint development in areas of overlapping claims.- Indonesia's foreign ministry said today that the country does not recognize China's -nine-dash line- claims over the South China Sea despite striking a joint development deal with China. Does China view this -important common understanding- as an acknowledgement by Indonesia of China's claims to parts of Indonesia's Exclusive Economic Zone? Lin Jian: China's sovereignty and rights in the South China Sea are solidly grounded in history and the law. They were established in the long course of history and are consistent with international law and practices. As early as 1948, the Chinese government officially released the dotted line and reaffirmed its sovereignty and relevant rights in the South China Sea. China attaches great importance to signing the cooperation document on maritime joint development with Indonesia and stands ready to work with Indonesia to implement the important common understandings between the leaders of the two countries so that the cooperation results can benefit the two countries and two peoples as soon as possible. Reuters: Following the recent attacks on Chinese nationals in Pakistan, has the concern for the security of Chinese citizens increased in Pakistan? If so, what are the concerns? Is Beijing satisfied with the security protocols for its nationals and projects in Pakistan? Lin Jian: China reiterates that terrorism is a common enemy of humanity. It's the shared responsibility of the international community to fight terrorism and prevent tragedies from happening again. China will continue to support Pakistan in fighting terrorism. We are firm in our commitment to protecting the safety and security of Chinese nationals, projects and institutions overseas. China and Pakistan have the resolve and capability to foil any attempt to harm China-Pakistan relations and ensure that terrorists will pay the price. China and Pakistan are all-weather strategic cooperative partners. Our iron-clad friendship has taken deep roots among our peoples. Attempts to undermine the mutual trust and cooperation between the two countries will not succeed. China will continue to support Pakistan in developing its economy and society and improving people's life. We will firmly carry out cooperation with Pakistan in various fields for the benefit of the two peoples.- Share Tracking People's Daily Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

PLAAF's 75th Anniversary - Ren Ping Article on Economy: 'Pain of Transformation Cannot be Avoided or Circumvented' - China Delimits Scarborough Shoal	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, November 11, 2024. Page 1: The lead story today marks the 75th anniversary of the PLAAF. The article says that: -Under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on strengthening the military, the PLAAF has accelerated the pace of transformation and construction, firmly and consciously obeyed the Party's command, deepened training and preparation for war/combat-readiness, accelerated the construction of new combat forces, and written a new chapter in the journey of strengthening and rejuvenating the military.- ，，，，，. The piece talks about changes in combat training, the induction of new weapons systems, and the spirit of heroes. I am sharing one section below: -From radar stations on sea islands to ground air defence troops, tens of thousands of air force personnel maintain full-time combat readiness duties every day; for aerial rights protection and air defence identification zone control, just one aviation brigade conducts hundreds of combat takeoffs annually; the ‘sky net' woven by fighters, missiles, and radars continues to extend ... The People's Air Force marches toward war, striving to forge an air force that comes when called, fights when it comes, and wins when it fights. Chairman Xi has emphasized: ‘We must strengthen actual combat preparation, firmly establish the concept of training to prepare for war and leading troops to cultivate a mindset of preparing for war, firmly establish the mindset of being ready for war at any time, firmly establish the mindset of winning wars under existing conditions, strictly implement various combat readiness systems, maintain a constant and unremitting state of combat readiness, ensure that situations can be dealt with quickly and effectively, and resolutely complete various military struggle tasks shouldered by the air force. Since the 18th Party Congress, the Air Force Party Committee has resolutely implemented the important instructions and requirements of Chairman Xi, always insisted on preparing for war as the top priority, firmly established combat effectiveness as the only fundamental standard, and continuously expanded training content and innovated training methods, and the combat effectiveness of the troops ‘shifting gears and speeding up'. Adhere to the integration of combat to training in order to improve training levels. Continuously increase the proportion of adversarial air combat, far seas operations, long-range mobility and other subjects. Training in high-altitude regions, venturing into open seas, and flying along borders has become routine. Mass training competitions like ‘airborne elite' and ‘maintenance elite' becoming increasingly aligned with real combat scenarios. Adhere to scientific and technology-driven training to deepen capability generation. Accelerate weapons upgrading, shift toward new combat domains and new quality combat forces like special operations, electronic countermeasures, and unmanned systems, gradually building a future-oriented air force system. Seek nothing but victory in war, sparing nothing for winning. The broad masses of air force personnel are actively engaging in training and war preparation, patrolling the East China Sea, conducting combat patrols in the South China Sea, honing forces in the Taiwan Strait, advancing to the Western Pacific, circumnavigating islands, and conducting trans-oceanic manoeuvres, with the flight paths of fighter jets continuously extending.- ，；、，；、、--……，、、。：-，、，，，，，，。-，，，，、，--。——。、、，、、，----。——。，、、，。，。，、、、、、，。 Share Tracking People's Daily The final section of the article confirms that the J-35A stealth fighter will make an appearance at the 15th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition, which begins tomorrow. It also talks about PLAAF's role in diplomacy, providing humanitarian aid to Maldives and Nepal along with -70 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Oceania-. Global Times' article talks about the weapons that we can expect to see during the Zhuhai Airshow. These include the J-35A medium-sized stealth fighter, the HQ-19 surface-to-air missile weapon system and a new attack reconnaissance unmanned aerial vehicle. The report adds: -The PLA Air Force will bring 36 types of equipment for aerial flight demonstrations and ground static displays to showcase the development of its equipment in a comprehensive and close-up manner…- It quotes expert Fu Qianshao as saying that the HQ-19 -is comparable to the US-made THAAD weapon system. The THAAD weapon system can intercept hostile ballistic missiles outside the atmosphere, and intercept targets at the upper levels of the atmosphere. The US relies on the Patriot air defense weapon system at the lower levels. ‘The HQ-9B and HQ-19 have formed a similar system, capable of intercepting the middle and end of the missile in outer space, the upper atmosphere and the lower atmosphere. The official debut of the HQ-19 marked the construction of the PLA Air Force integrating air and space, both offensive and defensive, making significant achievements, and reaching a new level'.- Subscribe now Next, there's a Ren Ping commentary on the state of the economy. Brief note: I thought that this was really useful to read to get a sense of the argument that the central leadership is making for its agenda. There clearly is a deep sense of concern about the state of affairs, but also evident is the willingness to stay the course. It's a timely reminder that the goal remains high-quality development and focussing on transforming the development model, emphasising technology-driven growth. It is also worth noting that the external environment is listed as the first in the list of challenges that China's economy faces. Anyway, the piece begins by accepting that GDP data for the first three quarters has not been the greatest. It acknowledges that -the year-on-year economic growth rates of 5.3%, 4.7% and 4.6% have shown a downward trend. Looking at the third quarter alone, the growth rates of major economic indicators in July and August fell. As a result, there are doubts about the prospects for economic growth and the completion of annual goals and tasks.- ，5.3%、4.7%、4.6%，。，7、8。、. But it argues that -in the first three quarters, China's economy grew by 4.8% year-on-year, ranking among the top growth rates of major world economies. Although certain economies have relatively higher growth rates, their economic scale and increase are not in the same league as ours. More importantly, we have maintained reasonable growth in quantity on the premise of structural optimization, momentum transformation, and quality improvement. Looking around the world, ‘the scenery is still uniquely beautiful on this side'.- ，。，4.8%，；，。，、、。，--. Subscribe now The author then identifies four key problems facing the Chinese economy: First, the external environment has become more complex and severe. Global economic instability is rising, international political uncertainty is increasing, global trade protectionism is intensifying, and some countries are escalating containment and suppression efforts, increasing the pressure on China to stabilise foreign trade and investment. Second, domestic demand remains sluggish. Residents' capacity and willingness for consumption remain weak, there are challenges in investment stabilisation, and the vitality of private investment requires further stimulation. Third, some enterprises are facing operational difficulties, including weak sales, declining profitability, and weakening market expectations. Fourth, there are many risks and hidden dangers in some fields. Some regions have great difficulty in debt repayment, some local governments are facing fiscal challenges, some enterprises are laying off employees and cutting salaries, employment pressure for a younger demographic, such as college graduates, has increased, and the income growth rate of urban residents has slowed down. 。，，，，、。。，，。，、、。。，，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Yet, the author contends that -the difficulties we are facing now are problems in development and pains in transformation, which can be completely overcome through hard work.- ，、，. To support this argument, the author says that policy measures that have been announced this year are finally having an effect. -Since September, increasingly, there have been positive changes in economic operations in the fields of industry, consumption, investment, stock market, and real estate market. Market confidence has enhanced, social expectations have improved, and the growth rates of many economic indicators have rebounded. In general, we have withstood downward pressure, overcome difficulties and challenges, maintained the development trend of stable economic operation, structural adjustment and optimization, and continuous improvement of people's livelihood, and the trend of economic performance shifting from bottoming out to subsequently stabilising and then moving towards recovery is becoming more evident. With the continued effectiveness of existing policies, the accelerated implementation of new policies, and the combined effects of these policies being released, positive factors and favourable conditions will continue to increase. In the fourth quarter, the economy is highly likely to show an upward trend, and the annual economic growth target is expected to be achieved. 。9，、、、，，，。，、，、、，。，，，，，。 In the next section, the author calls for calm in the face of -normal fluctuations- and highlights the -structural adjustment- that is taking place. The article states that in the first three quarters of this year, the proportion of the service industry as part of GDP increased by 0.3 percentage points compared with the same period last year. Its contribution rate to economic growth reached 53.9% Investment in high-tech industries increased by 10.0% year-on-year, with the growth rate being 6.6 percentage points higher than that of total investment, maintaining double-digit growth for 7 consecutive months the growth rate of investment in equipment and tools was 13 percentage points higher than that of total investment investment in technological transformation of manufacturing industry increased by 9.5% the output and export of integrated circuits increased by 26% and 22% year-on-year, respectively the output and export of new energy vehicles increased by 31.7% and 12.5% ​​year-on-year, respectively ，。，GDP0.3，53.9%；10.0%，6.6，7，。，。，13，9.5%；、26%、22%；、31.7%、12.5%……，. The piece then argues that -the favourable conditions for China's economic development, such as a solid foundation, strong resilience and great potential, have not changed. China still enjoys advantages such as a super-large market, a complete industrial system, strong supporting capabilities and large growth space. At the same time, its economy is in a critical period of structural adjustment, transformation and upgrading. From the transformation of the development model to the optimization of industrial structure, the transformation of development quality and the transformation of development momentum, cyclical and structural challenges are intertwined. The pain of transformation cannot be avoided or circumvented.- 、、，，、、。，、，，、、，，、. Leave a comment It adds: -At times like this, we must be all the more determined to press forward despite difficulties and forge new achievements. We must unswervingly follow the path of high-quality development, and we must not abandon or retreat just because of challenges, nor fall back into the old habit of pursuing inefficient, extensive growth. Fundamentally speaking, the key to breaking the ‘bottleneck' that restricts China's economic development lies in scientific and technological innovation. The key to Chinese-style modernization lies in scientific and technological modernization. To achieve high-quality development, we must rely on scientific and technological innovation to cultivate new momentum. The ‘2024 Global Innovation Index Report' released recently shows that China is one of the economies with the fastest growth in innovation in the past 10 years, and innovative development is showing strong momentum and broad prospects. We must also recognize that China's technological development is at a critical stage—strong but not yet robust; it will regress if it does not advance. Some key core technologies are controlled by others, and there is a shortage of top scientific and technological talents. The process of moving from a large science and technology country to a strong science and technology country will inevitably encounter various obstacles and containment. Scientific and technological innovation cannot be achieved overnight; building it into a powerful force for development requires persistent, long-term effort. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasised: ‘We must further enhance our sense of urgency, intensify efforts in scientific and technological innovation, and seize the commanding heights of technological competition and future development'. He has encouraged researchers to embrace the spirit of ‘how many times can one truly fight in life' in order to innovate and create freely. The Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee proposed ‘building a comprehensive system and mechanism to support innovation.' Reforms that integrate the systems for education, science, technology, and talent are being implemented with urgency. Last year, China's R&amp;D investment exceeded 3.3 trillion yuan for the first time, ranking second in the world. Winning the battle of key and core technologies is neither something to rush nor something to delay. We must maintain strategic resolve and continue our efforts persistently. With time, we are certain to overcome ‘chokepoint' issues and firmly seize the initiative in development. ‘As long as the path is right, distance is not to be feared'.- ，、，，、，、。，--，。，。《2024》，10，。，、，，。，。，。，-，，-，-‘'，-。《》--，。R&amp;D3.3，。，，，，，，--，。-，.- Share Tracking People's Daily Page 3: Two brief reports to note.

China & Indonesia add Security Pillar to Ties - Breakdown of China's Foreign Trade Data - Understanding the 10 Trillion Debt Package - China-Philippin...	Hi folks, A lot has happened over the weekend in the China news space. So, I am doing a special newsletter today, covering key developments. Regards, Manoj Let's begin with Xi Jinping's meeting with visiting Indonesia President Prabowo Subianto in Beijing. Xinhua reports: -Xi noted that Prabowo visited China in his first overseas trip right after he was elected in March and chose China as the first country to visit after taking office, which speaks volumes about the great importance he attaches to developing relations with China and demonstrates the high level and strategic nature of China-Indonesia relations. Xi went on to point out that the adherence to strategic autonomy, mutual trust, mutual assistance, win-win cooperation, fairness and justice represents not only a summary of the experience in developing bilateral ties over the past decades, but also an important principle that should be followed for ensuring the sustained and stable development of bilateral relations in the future.

Share Tracking People's Daily Earlier, late on Friday, the NPCSC meeting ended with some important announcements. First, Xinhua reports that: Chinese lawmakers approved a State Council bill on raising the ceiling on local government debt by 6 trillion yuan (about 840 billion U.S. dollars) to replace existing hidden debts. Under the new arrangement, the debt ceiling for special local government debt will be increased to 35.52 trillion yuan from 29.52 trillion yuan by the end of 2024. Also starting from 2024, China will set aside 800 billion yuan from each year's new special-purpose bonds for local governments for five consecutive years, thereby providing debt relief to replace 4 trillion yuan of hidden debts, according to Minister of Finance Lan Fo'an. The new measures will add a combined 10 trillion yuan to China's debt relief resources. Meanwhile, the 2 trillion yuan of hidden debts resulting from housing improvement projects in run-down areas due by 2029 and beyond will be paid in accordance with the original contracts. As a result, the amount of hidden debts that China's local governments need to deal with by 2028 is expected to drop from 14.3 trillion yuan to 2.3 trillion yuan. Share Tracking People's Daily The explanation issued along with this decision states that: -As of the end of 2023, the balance of local government hidden debts nationwide was 14.3 trillion yuan. According to the preliminary calculation of GDP of 126.06 trillion yuan in 2023, the national government debt ratio (debt balance/GDP) after considering statutory government debts and hidden debts is 67.5%. Since 2024, affected by factors such as changes in the external environment and insufficient domestic demand, the contradiction between fiscal revenue and expenditure has become prominent, tax growth has fallen short of expectations, and land transfer income has dropped sharply, creating a gap from previous expectations in various regions regarding debt resolution resources, increasing the difficulty of addressing outstanding implicit debts. At present, local debt reduction work is at a critical stage. In order to ensure the completion of the goal of resolving the existing hidden debts of local governments, the State Council has proposed to increase the local government debt limit to replace the existing hidden debts. On September 25, the Politburo Standing Committee discussed and agreed in principle to the ‘Report on the Arrangements for Relating to Increasing the Local Government Debt Limit to Replace the Existing Hidden Debts' by the Party Group of the State Council.- 2023，14.3。2023（GDP）126.06，（/GDP）67.5%。2024，，，，，，。，，，。925，《》. The explanation then recommends increasing the local government debt limit by 6 trillion yuan to replace the existing hidden debt. It adds that this decision: Does not increase the overall burden of government debt and does not change the local debt repayment responsibility Considering the interest rate difference between implicit debt and statutory government debt, it is estimated that accumulated interest payment savings of about 400 billion yuan can be achieved Promote the solution of various local ‘triangle debt' problems, boost the confidence of business entities, and reduce the bad debt losses of financial institutions Support local governments in unloading burdens and move forward lightly, reverse the predicament of existing debt excessively occupying fiscal resources, free up more funds to solve grassroots ‘three guarantees' and economic development bottleneck problems, optimize government investment layout, and promote high-quality development. ，，；，4000；--，，；、，，--，，. Subscribe now In terms of implementation, the document makes three points: First, the State Council submitted a proposal to the NPCSC for approval to increase the local government debt limit by 6 trillion yuan, which will be implemented over three years. Second, the allocation will be completed in one go to stabilise policy expectations. Based on the scale of local government implicit debt, debt limits will be allocated according to a unified national proportion, reflecting policy fairness and forming stable debt reduction expectations. Third, arrange special debt limits and clarify the use of funds. To facilitate operation and realise policy effects as early as possible, the entire 6 trillion yuan will be arranged as special debt limits, allowing localities to use it for replacing various types of implicit debt within the monitoring scope. Under this arrangement, by the end of 2024, the local government special debt limit will increase from 29.518508 trillion yuan to 35.518508 trillion yuan. ，。6，。，。，，，，。，。、，6，。，2024295185.08355185.08.

They also adopted a decision on amending the Law on Supervision by the Standing Committees of the People's Congresses at All Levels, and a decision on removing Li Xiaopeng from the post of minister of transport and appointing Liu Wei to the position.

The meeting reviewed and approved the ‘Several Policy Measures on Promoting Stable Growth of Foreign Trade' and mulled measures on deepening the reform and development of elderly care services. Xinhua reports: The meeting called for -beefing up financial support, fully utilizing policy support loans for small- and micro-sized businesses, and optimizing cross-border trade settlement to help enterprises strengthen their capacity in managing exchange rate risks. It also encouraged efforts to promote the development of cross-border e-commerce, the establishment of overseas smart logistics platforms, green trade, trade activities in border regions, as well as repair services for overseas goods in comprehensive bonded zones, adding that negotiations with more countries on signing mutual visa-free treaties will be continued.- Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, China reacted rather strongly to the Philippines' new ‘Maritime Zones Act' and ‘Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act'. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Philippines ambassador to express its objection to the two new laws. issued a lengthy statement, saying: The Philippine Maritime Zones Act essentially -attempts to enshrine the illegal award of the South China Sea arbitration in the form of domestic legislation. China strongly condemns and firmly rejects this as the move gravely infringes upon China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea. China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea shall by no means be affected by the enactment of the Act.- -The Philippines' attempt to whitewash its illegal claims and actions in the South China Sea by adopting the Maritime Zones Act in the name of implementing UNCLOS is illegal and invalid. The Act seriously violates the DOC and will inevitably complicate the situation in the South China Sea. China will firmly respond to any infringement or provocative actions taken by the Philippine side in the South China Sea citing the Act as the ground.- -Many provisions contained in the Philippines' Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act are incompatible with international law and resolutions of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The Chinese side demands that the Philippine side earnestly abide by international law and refrain from undermining the legitimate rights of all parties under international law, including UNCLOS.- This paragraph, in particular, is remarkable. China is telling the Philippines how treaties signed by erstwhile colonial powers define its territories. -The territory of the Philippines is defined by a series of international treaties, including the 1898 Treaty of Peace Between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Spain (the Treaty of Paris), the 1900 Treaty Between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Spain for Cession of Outlying Islands of the Philippines (the Treaty of Washington), and the 1930 Convention Between His Majesty in Respect of the United Kingdom and the President of the United States Regarding the Boundary Between the State of North Borneo and the Philippine Archipelago. The Philippines' territory so defined has nothing to do with China's Huangyan Dao and Nansha Qundao. The Philippines has invaded and illegally occupied Mahuan Dao, Feixin Dao, Zhongye Dao, Nanyao Dao, Beizi Dao, Xiyue Dao, Shuanghuang Shazhou and Siling Jiao of China's Nansha Qundao, and by doing so has seriously violated international law, including the Charter of the United Nations. It broke its own promise and kept a warship illegally grounded at Ren'ai Jiao of China's Nansha Qundao for decades, thus infringing upon China's territorial sovereignty and violating the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), especially its Article 5 which asks the parties to refrain from action of inhabiting on the uninhabited islands and reefs. Once again China urges the Philippines to immediately withdraw all its personnel and facilities from the aforementioned islands and reefs and immediately tow away the warship illegally grounded at Ren'ai Jiao. The establishment of the so-called -Kalayaan Island Group- beyond its own territorial scope by the Philippines infringes upon China's territorial sovereignty, and is illegal and invalid.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Friday, November 08, 2024. Page 1: The lead story is about Xi Jinping's meeting with Prime Minister of Malaysia Anwar Ibrahim in Beijing. Xinhua reports: -Noting that China and Malaysia are good neighbors, good friends and good partners, Xi said the two countries have maintained close interactions and exchanges at all levels and advanced mutually beneficial cooperation with high quality on all fronts since Anwar's first China visit in March last year after taking office as prime minister, delivering tangible benefits to the two peoples. China and Malaysia are both at crucial stages of national development and rejuvenation, Xi said. ‘The two sides should take the celebration of the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties and the China-Malaysia Year of Friendship as an opportunity to work together for a more concrete China-Malaysia community with a shared future, to help each other achieve their development goals, and to make new and greater contributions to regional prosperity and stability,' said Xi.- PD has more details in the next few paragraphs: -Xi urged the two sides to develop a high-level strategic partnership, continue to maintain close high-level exchanges, deepen exchanges on experience of governance, enhance political mutual trust, and firmly support each other on issues of core interests and major concerns. China supports Malaysia's adherence to strategic autonomy and its choice of a development path suited to its own national conditions. Both sides should strengthen the alignment of development strategies, deepen all-round mutually beneficial cooperation, and continue advancing high-quality BRI cooperation. They should jointly implement flagship projects like the ‘Two Countries, Twin Parks', create new growth points in areas like the digital economy, artificial intelligence, and new energy, and explore mechanisms for poverty reduction cooperation.

China is willing to deepen exchanges and cooperation with Malaysia in higher education, culture, tourism, youth, and local interactions, tightening the bond of friendship between the two peoples.

Xi Jinping pointed out that the world today is intertwined with changes and turmoil, entering a new period of turbulent transformation.

China supports Malaysia's work as the rotating chair of ASEAN next year, supports ASEAN's central position and strategic autonomy, and maintains the mainstream of regional development cooperation. ，，。，，，，，、，，。，，. Anwar said that President Xi Jinping proposed important concepts, such as building a community with a shared future for mankind, advocated tolerance and mutual learning among different civilizations, and put forward high-level opinions and suggestions on leading and promoting the ‘BRICS+' cooperation, which reflected his deep feelings and wisdom for the progress of human civilization and the interests and well-being of the people, and represented the common aspirations and voices of the Global South. The Malaysian side expressed appreciation and support for President Xi Jinping's vision and initiatives. The Malaysian government is committed to further deepening its comprehensive strategic partnership with China and strengthening cooperation in information technology, digital economy, energy and other fields.

Li put forward four suggestions: First, we should adhere to open cooperation, jointly promote a higher level and larger scale of two-way opening, improve the open regional economic structure, and create a more efficient and dynamic super-large market. We should continue to build a high quality BRI, implement the RCEP with high quality, accelerate the signing and implementation of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area 3.0 Upgrade Protocol, and improve the level of trade and investment facilitation. Second, we should highlight the leading role of innovation, strengthen the coordination of innovation policies, promote the efficient flow of innovation factors, accelerate the transformation and application of innovation results, and support and ensure that innovation cooperation continues to grow in depth and in a more practical manner. We should actively promote the planning, construction and upgrading of regional power grids, deepen cooperation in new energy batteries, automobiles and photovoltaic industries, expand cooperation in emerging fields such as clean energy, intelligent manufacturing, big data, and smart cities, and cultivate and expand new momentum for regional development. Third, we should deepen the construction of integration, deepen the ‘hard connection' of infrastructure such as roads, railways, and ports, strengthen ‘soft connection' in policies, laws, supervision, rules, standards and other fields, strive to improve the convenience of cross-border payments and local currency settlement, actively create more cross-border cooperation demonstration zones, and accelerate the process of regional economic integration. China has decided to issue the ‘Lancang-Mekong Visa' to the five Mekong countries and issue five-year multiple-entry visas to China for eligible business personnel. Fourth, we should maintain close communication and cooperation, practise genuine multilateralism, vigorously promote the coordinated development of the Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation with the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation, the Three Rivers Mechanism, the Mekong River Commission and other mechanisms, and build a good atmosphere of inclusive and mutually reinforcing cooperation. Strengthen cooperation with the UN, the ADB, the AIIB and other institutions, mobilise all forces, and jointly implement the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. ，、，，、。--，《》，—3.0，。，，，，。，、，、、、，。，、、--，、、、、--，、，，。--，5。，，、、，。、、，，2030.

It is hoped that the two sides will uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, strengthen dialogue and communication, properly manage differences, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, and find a correct way for China and the United States to get along in a new era, benefiting both countries and the world. President Xi Jinping's congratulatory message reflects the stability and continuity of China's policy toward the United States. As one of the most important bilateral relations in the world, China-US relations should be considered and planned from a broad perspective to bring well-being to the people of the two countries and show responsibility for human progress. Regardless of the changes in the international situation, China consistently develops US-China relations with an attitude of responsibility to history, to the people, and to the world, adhering to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.- 117，。，、、。、、，，，，，，。，。，，，。，、、，、、. -History proves that while US-China relations have experienced ups and downs, they have always progressed forward through twists and turns. Since the ‘ice-breaking' of bilateral relations in 1971, China and the US have worked together to bring tangible benefits to both countries and the world. Mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation are experiences distilled from over 50 years of US-China relations and lessons learned from historical conflicts between major powers, and should be the direction of joint efforts between China and the US. Mutual respect is a basic courtesy in human interactions and the minimum standard for relations between the two countries. Peaceful coexistence is a basic principle of international relations and a bottom line that both major powers must maintain. Win-win cooperation is the trend of the times and should be the foundation of China-US relations.- ，，。1971--，，。、、，50，，。，。，。，. -Win-win cooperation between China and the US is in the fundamental interests of the two countries and their peoples and in line with the trend of the times. China's rapid development has benefited from its open cooperation with countries around the world. China's continuous growth has provided the world, including the US, with a driving force for sustained growth and huge market space. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, trade between China and the US has grown more than 200-fold, with bilateral trade accounting for about one-fifth of global trade. Today, China is the third-largest export market for U.S. goods, and the US is China's third-largest trading partner. Over 70,000 US companies invest and operate in China, and exports to China alone support 930,000 US jobs. Last year, 1,920 new US companies were established in China, and 80% of US companies in China plan to reinvest their profits this year. Facts have proved that China-US cooperation has brought tangible benefits to the people of both countries, and the success of China and the United States is an opportunity for each other.- ，。，。200，1/5。，，，7，93。，1920，。，，. -China and the US advancing mutually beneficial cooperation can create opportunities for both sides to better address their respective challenges and achieve development. Whether in traditional areas like economics, trade, and agriculture, or emerging fields like climate change and artificial intelligence, China and the US share extensive common interests. Under current circumstances, the common interests between the two countries haven't decreased but have increased. China is continuing to promote high-quality development, while the US is focusing on economic revitalization. The space for cooperation between both sides is infinitely vast, and they should be catalysts rather than obstacles to each other's development. China and the US should lengthen their list of cooperation and expand their pie of cooperation, achieving mutual success and win-win benefits. They should focus on the bigger picture and provide a good atmosphere and stable relationship for cooperation.- ，、。、，、，。，，。，，，，。、，、，，. -The international situation continues to be turbulent and volatile, and humanity faces many global challenges, and the world increasingly needs a stable China-US relationship. China and the US should demonstrate the pattern of major powers, take on major power responsibilities, and play the role of major powers. As permanent members of the UN Security Council and the world's two largest economies, China and the US should become a stable source of world peace and an engine of common development. Over the past year, China-US diplomatic, financial, law enforcement, climate change teams and both militaries have maintained communication, sending positive signals to the world. Currently, whether promoting world economic recovery or resolving international and regional hotspot issues, China-US coordination and cooperation are needed. The strengthening of coordination and cooperation between China and the US on international and regional issues, providing more public goods to the world, can contribute to addressing emerging global challenges.- ，，。，，。，。，、、、，。，，，。，，. (Note: I find this paragraph fascinating. It is incredibly telling of the anxiety in Beijing around what a Trump presidency could bring. It is sending a message to Washington that the stability that was achieved through different dialogue mechanisms under the Biden administration over the last year were positive outcomes and must be maintained. -China and the US will benefit from cooperation, while confrontation will harm both. Suppression and containment cannot solve the problems facing the US. Both sides should strengthen dialogue with mutual respect, manage differences with prudence, promote cooperation in a spirit of reciprocity, and strengthen international coordination with responsibility. China's foreign policy is open and transparent, and its strategic intention is aboveboard, maintaining a high degree of continuity and stability. China will continue to view and handle China-US relations in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation. At the same time, China has interests that must be maintained, principles that must be defended, and bottom lines that must be upheld. Only when both sides move towards each other can they find the correct way for two countries with different civilizations, systems, and paths to peacefully coexist and develop together on Earth in the new era, making their respective contributions to building a community with a shared future for mankind. The vast Earth is completely capable of accommodating both China and the US to develop individually and prosper together. Promoting US-China relations to stabilise, improve, and move forward is the correct choice that shows responsibility to history, to the people, and to the world.- ，。。，，，。，，。、、。，、、。，、、、，。、。、、，、、. Share Tracking People's Daily In addition to this, there's a Xinhua commentary on the issue. It says: -Getting the China-U.S. relationship right is not optional, but something the two sides must do and must do well. For China and the United States, turning their back on each other is not an option. It is unrealistic for one side to remodel the other, and conflict and confrontation has unbearable consequences for both sides. China and the United States have different histories and cultures, social systems and development paths. However, mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation are the lessons learned from over 50 years of China-U.S. relations and the exchanges between major countries in history, which should be the direction of joint efforts between the two countries. Specifically, mutual respect is the precondition, because interaction sustains only when differences in social and political systems are respected and acknowledged. Peaceful coexistence is the bottom line. That is because conflict and confrontation between two major countries like China and the United States have unimaginable consequences. Win-win cooperation is the goal. When working together, China and the United States can do great things conducive to the two countries and the world. China does not engage in the so-called ‘major-country competition', with clearly stated and transparent strategic intentions. The aim is to advance the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization, base its efforts on the goal of meeting people's aspirations for a better life, unswervingly pursue reform and opening-up, and promote the building of an open global economy. China's policy toward the United States remains highly consistent and stable. It has consistently perceived and envisioned the China-U.S. relationship in the broad context of the accelerating global transformations unseen in a century. The ultimate goal of maintaining good China-U.S. relations is to enhance the well-being of the people of the two countries and show the responsibility of a major country in promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. The two sides should form a correct perception of each other's domestic and foreign policies and strategic intentions. China-U.S. interactions should be defined by dialogue and win-win cooperation, not confrontation and zero-sum competition. China-U.S. relations should not be a zero-sum game where one side out-competes or thrives at the expense of the other. The successes of China and the United States are opportunities, not challenges, for each other. The world is big enough for the two countries to develop themselves and prosper together. Differences and contradictions are inevitable, but as long as the two sides can strengthen dialogue and communication, properly manage differences, and expand mutually beneficial cooperation, negative factors will be gradually reduced and positive factors accumulated. Thereby, the space for benign interactions in China-U.S. relations will become larger and larger.- Subscribe now Meanwhile, China's Commerce Ministry responded to a question about the possibility of new US tariffs on imports from China and/or actions targeting its tech sector. It said that China -is willing to strengthen communication, expand cooperation and resolve differences with the United States for stable, sound and sustainable development of bilateral economic and trade relations…Under the principle of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, China is willing to work with the United States and bring greater benefits to both countries and the rest of the world.- Do also note this SCMP report. It says that EU leaders are preparing for talks with Trump's transition team. It adds: -High on their wish list will be keeping the tap open for US funds to flow to Ukraine and avoiding scything tariffs on European goods. Brussels has already been told what Trump would expect in return: EU backing for his tough agenda on China. The China demand was made clear during preliminary talks with Republican interlocutors ahead of the election, according to people familiar with the talks, although it is likely to be just one item on a laundry list from a man who showed disdain for EU institutions during his first stint in the White House. For more than a year, the European Commission has been working to ‘Trump-proof' the bloc, which has sore memories of his last term in office, during which he initiated a trade dispute and repeatedly threatened to revoke the American security blanket Europe enjoys. Baskets of carrots and sticks have been prepared, including offers to buy more US energy goods to reduce the gaping trade deficit – and targeted retaliatory tariffs of more than 50 per cent if those offers fail. They have also tried to game out post-election scenarios, ranging from the expected – higher US tariffs on Chinese products – to the far-fetched, such as Trump switching US diplomatic recognition of China from Beijing to Taipei. The broad plans were discussed at a meeting of ambassadors from the EU's 27 member states on Wednesday.- Subscribe now Back to PD, a report informs that from November 5 to 7, a special training course for secretaries of the Party committees of central and state organs to study and implement the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping and promote high-quality development of Party building was held in Beijing. Another report informs that UFWD chief Shi Taifeng spoke at an event held in Beijing for representatives of the private sector to thoroughly study and implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee. The report says: -Shi Taifeng stated that the private economy is a vital force in advancing Chinese-style modernization, and also an important force in participating in and promoting reform. It is hoped that private entrepreneurs will deeply understand and grasp the spirit and major significance of the plenary session from the perspective of the ‘two overall situations', and align their thoughts and actions with the spirit of the plenary session. It is necessary to fully and accurately grasp the reform direction and clear policy orientation clarified by the plenary session, adhere to the ‘two unwaverings' and promote the ‘two healths', strengthen the confidence in reform, strengthen the responsibility for reform, and combine the development of enterprises with the prosperity of the country and the rejuvenation of the nation. It is necessary to firmly be the supporters and practitioners of further deepening reform and promoting Chinese-style modernization, carry forward the entrepreneurial spirit, actively fulfil social responsibilities, practise a close and clean relationship between government and business, and firmly support the ‘two establishments' and resolutely achieve the ‘two safeguards' with practical actions.- ，，、。--，。，--、--，、，、。、，，，，--、--.

Xi Calls Trump - Xi's Hubei Inspection - Xi's Thought on Social Work - 4th Round of Central Inspections Begin - Why does China Need to Improve Foreign...	Before I get to today's newspaper, Xinhua reports that Xi Jinping called US-president elect Donald Trump today, congratulating him on his electoral win. The report says: -Xi Jinping emphasised that history shows us that cooperation between China and the United States benefits both, while confrontation harms both. A stable, healthy, and sustainably developing China-US relationship aligns with the common interests of both countries and the expectations of the international community. He expressed hope that both sides would uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation, strengthen dialogue and communication, properly manage differences, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, and find a correct way for China and the United States to engage in this new era, benefiting both countries and the world.- ，，、。、、。、、，，，，，，. Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, November 07, 2024. Page 1: The big story on the page today is a wrap of Xi Jinping's visit to Hubei province. Xi was accompanied by Wang Menghui, Hubei Party Secretary, and Hubei Governor Wang Zhonglin. He visited Xiaogan, Xianning, and Wuhan. Xi's message was that -Hubei must thoroughly implement the spirit of the 20th Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee, adhere to the general principle of seeking progress while maintaining stability, firmly grasp its mission and tasks in constructing the new development pattern, fully utilize its own advantages, drum up motivation and strive forward with enterprise, persist in long-term efforts and achieve success through good work, strive to take the lead in high-quality development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt, speed up efforts to build itself into a strategic fulcrum for the rise of the country's central region, and write its own chapter in Chinese-style modernization.- 、、，，，，，、，、，，，. On the 4th, Xi visited an exhibition of ancient bamboo and wooden writing slips from the dynasties of Qin (221-207 BC) and Han (202 BC-AD 220) at a museum in Yunmeng County, the city of Xiaogan. The report talks about the Qin laws being on display, written on the slips, which demonstrate that as early as more than 2,200 years ago, China's ancient legal system was already established. -Xi Jinping listened in detail to explanations on the content of the bamboo slips, their historical and cultural value, and the status of their protection and research. He pointed out that archaeological research must continue to be strengthened, and the level of cultural relics protection should be improved, providing solid support for promoting excellent traditional Chinese culture and enhancing cultural confidence, so as to ensure that the treasures of Chinese civilization are preserved for posterity, benefiting future generations, and inspiring people to continuously strengthen their sense of national pride and confidence.- 、，，，、，、，. On the 5th, Xi visited Jiayu County, the city of Xianning, where he visited a vegetable farm. The key message that he delivered was that -to develop modern agriculture and build an agricultural strength, we must rely on scientific and technological progress, so that science and technology can give agricultural modernization wings to take off. He encouraged local cadres and the masses to take the road of science and technology, the road of quality, and the road of branding, and further improve the vegetable planting industry that enriches the people, enabling more people to increase their income and achieve prosperity.- ，，，。、、，，. Xinhua English summarises the next bit well: -He then traveled to a village in Jiayu to inspect local elderly care facilities and community services. He called for more targeted measures to address public concerns, with a focus on the needs of older people and children.- One of the messages he had was -it is necessary to continue to reduce the burden on the grassroots so that grassroots cadres can spend more time and energy to serve the masses.- Xi visited a villager's home and talked with the family about their livelihood and access to medical and elderly care services. As villagers bid him a fond farewell, Xi said that to advance Chinese modernization, efforts must be made to speed up rural revitalization. He encouraged the villagers to boost the economic returns of specialty industries and make their village more beautiful under the Party's leadership.- In the afternoon, Xi visited the Wuhan Institute of Industrial Innovation and Development. He said that -achieving high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-strengthening, and developing new quality productive forces, has posed more urgent demands for the integration of technological innovation and industrial innovation. The broad masses of scientific and technological workers and entrepreneurs should enhance their confidence, maintain lofty aspirations, work in coordination, and continuously make achievements in improving the overall effectiveness of the innovation system and building a modernised industrial system.- ，、，。、、，、. On the 6th, Xi heard work reports from the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government, affirmed the achievements made in Hubei, and put forward clear requirements for the next stage of work. He said: -Hubei has outstanding advantages in scientific and educational talents and strong scientific and technological innovation capabilities. It is necessary to forge ahead in promoting scientific and technological innovation and industrial innovation. Actively integrate into the national innovation chain, strive to build a highland of scientific and technological innovation with national influence, and better leverage the role of scientific and technological innovation source. Focusing on key industries, strengthen the integration of innovation chain, industrial chain, capital chain and talent chain, strengthen the research and development of key core technologies, build a collaborative innovation mechanism for large, medium and small enterprises, and improve the level of transformation of scientific and technological achievements. Adhere to the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries and the cultivation and expansion of emerging industries and future industries in parallel, develop new quality productive forces according to local conditions, and create more well-known brands. Put the restoration of the ecological environment of the Yangtze River in an overwhelming position, focus on building a safe and resilient modern water network, comprehensively promote the comprehensive management of the river basin, and firmly promote the ten-year fishing ban in the Yangtze River.- ，、，。，，。，，，。、，，。，，，. Xi Jinping stressed that Hubei should be bold in exploration when it comes to comprehensively deepening reform and expanding high-level opening up. Grasp the key areas and key links of reform, fully integrate into the construction of a unified national market, and build a fairer and more dynamic market environment. Adhere to and implement the ‘Two Unwaverings', and promote the mutual advancement and common development of various ownership economies. Adhere to the balance between domestic and international opening up, build an inland open highland, deepen regional cooperation, and optimise the industrial layout in an orderly manner. Deepen the reform of domestic and foreign trade integration, actively participate in the high-quality construction of BRI, and systematically enhance the function of an open hub. ，。，，、。--，、。、，，。，--，. He then called on Hubei to strive to deliver on the integrated development of its urban and rural areas, as well as comprehensive rural revitalization. With the metropolitan areas of Wuhan as the centre, he called on Hubei to advance the coordinated development of city clusters in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. He called on the province to shoulder the responsibility of grain production, ensure the stable production and supply of important agricultural products. Consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation and accelerate the revitalization and development of old revolutionary areas. Coordinate the construction of basic public service systems and grassroots governance, and do a solid job in various work to improve people's livelihood. Deepen the construction of urban and rural spiritual civilization and promote the transformation of customs. ，。，。，。，。，。，。，。，. He then called on Hubei to leverage its -profound historical and cultural heritage and rich red resources…systematically promote the protection, inheritance and revitalization of historical and cultural heritage, and strengthen the research and dissemination of the Yangtze River civilization.- Xi also talked about cultivating -cultural tourism into a pillar industry-. -Xi Jinping pointed out that it is necessary to focus on strengthening Party building around reform and development, boost the spirit of Party members and cadres to act and be entrepreneurial, encourage them to be both brave in pioneering innovation and persistent in implementation, dare to fight and dare to break through, and be good at unity and cooperation, and strive to create achievements that can stand the test of history, practice and the people. Strengthen the construction of grassroots Party organisations and build a strong fighting fortress. Promote the regularisation and long-term effectiveness of Party discipline learning and education, tirelessly rectify conduct, enforce discipline, and fight corruption, continuously consolidating and developing a clean and upright political ecology.- ，，，，，、。，。，，. Xi Jinping stressed that with less than two months left this year, all work, especially economic work, must be further accelerated and implemented to achieve the annual economic and social development goals. ，，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a report on Xi's instructions with regard to promoting high-quality development of social work in the new era. This was delivered by Cai Qi at the Central Social Work Conference, which was held on November 5 and 6. Xi said: Social work is an important part of the work of the Party and the state. It is related to the long-term governance of the Party and the long-term stability of the country, and is to social harmony and stability and the happiness and well-being of the people. Since the new era, the Party Central Committee has made a series of major decisions and arrangements to promote important achievements in social work. At present, China's social structure is undergoing profound changes, especially the rapid development of emerging fields, the emergence of a large number of new economic organisations and new social organisations, and the continuous expansion of the scale of new employment groups. Social work, therefore, faces new situations and new tasks, and must demonstrate new responsibilities and new actions. It is necessary to adhere to the guidance of the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, fully implement the spirit of the 20th Party Congress and the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the 20th Central Committee, adhere to the people-centred approach, practise the Party's mass line in the new era, unswervingly follow the path of socialist social governance with Chinese characteristics, improve the social work system and mechanism, focus on the Party building across new economic organisations, new social organisations, and new employment groups, and continuously enhance the Party's appeal, cohesion and influence in emerging fields; do well in Party building leading grassroots governance and grassroots political power construction; do well in cohesion and service to the masses, promoting high-quality development of social work in the new era. 、、，，，。，，。，，、，，，。，、，，，，，、、，；；，. Xi Jinping emphasised that doing social work well is the common responsibility of the entire Party. Party committees (Party groups) at all levels must shoulder political responsibility, strengthen organisational leadership and overall coordination, ensure that the Party Central Committee's decisions and arrangements regarding social work are implemented; all regions and relevant departments must take initiative and work in coordination, adhere to managing both industry and Party building, forming strong joint synergy for doing social work well; social work departments must strengthen their own construction, strengthen political responsibility, be brave in practice and exploration, solidly fulfil their duties and responsibilities, making new contributions to comprehensively advancing the building of a strong country through Chinese-style modernization and the great cause of national rejuvenation. ，。（），，；、，，；，，，，、. Share Tracking People's Daily In his remarks, Cai Qi stressed on the significance of Xi's thought. He called on everyone deeply comprehend the decisive significance of the Two Establishments, resolutely achieve the Two Safeguards, profoundly grasp the overall requirements for doing social work well in the new era, effectively enhance the sense of responsibility and mission, and strive to create a new situation for social work in the new era. He called to: Take strengthening Party building in emerging fields as the top priority, strengthen overall coordination, adhere to classified guidance, emphasise Party building work in new economic organisations, new social organisations, and new employment groups, advance the coverage of Party organisations and work, and promote the healthy development of emerging fields. Continue to do a good job in party building and reform and development of industry associations and chambers of commerce. Strengthen Party building leading grassroots governance and grassroots political power construction, solve the prominent problem of ‘small horses pulling big carts' ( people being given responsibilities that are way beyond their capacities) in grassroots governance, coordinate the promotion of empowering and reducing burdens for the grassroots. Do a solid job in gathering and serving the masses, adhere to and develop the Fengqiao Experience in the new era, promote the legalisation of petition work, do a good job in collecting people's suggestions, and develop volunteer service. Party committees at all levels should strengthen leadership over social work, implement political responsibilities, improve the work system, build a strong team of social workers, and promote high-quality development of social work with the spirit of reform and innovation. ，、，，--，--，，，。，，，、、，，。。，--，。，--，，，。，，，，. There's also a front page commentary on this issue. It reiterates the key points I have covered above. It also seemingly coins Xi Jinping Thought on Social Work. This is done by saying that when it comes to social work, Xi has emphasised: -the need to be good at transforming the Party's leadership and the advantages of China's socialist system into advantages in social governance; the need to adhere to social governance for the people the need to unswervingly follow the path of socialist social governance with Chinese characteristics the need to innovate the establishment and activities of Party organisations and expand the Party's appeal and cohesion in emerging fields the need to strengthen the Party building of social organisations and streamline the Party building management system of industry associations, societies and chambers of commerce the need to provide ideological guidance and cohesive services for new employment groups the need to vigorously promote Party building to lead grassroots governance the need to focus on the grassroots, strengthen the foundation and consolidate the basic work orientation the need to adhere to and develop the ‘Fengqiao Experience' in the new era the need to promote the legalisation of petition work the need to build a high-quality petition work team that is loyal to the Party, abides by the responsibility of serving the people and is good at mass work, gradually establish a team of professional community workers with excellent quality, and develop and strengthen the Lei Feng volunteer service team. General Secretary Xi Jinping's important expositions on social work are a profound summary of the vivid practice of social work in the new era, an important part of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and mark a new level of our Party's understanding of the laws governing social work.- ，，、，，、、，；；；，；，、、；；；、、；、--；；、、，，。，，，.

Page 7: There's a report on the establishment of the China Aerospace Information and Satellite Network Innovation Alliance. This is situated in the Xiong'an New Area. China Daily's report informs that this is -a national organization involving key players in telecom, aerospace and related research institutes. It was jointly initiated by members covering major State-owned telecom operators, including China Telecom, China Unicom, China Mobile and key central enterprises such as China Satellite Network Group.- Share Tracking People's Daily Finally, there's an interesting report in Xinhua, discussing why it is important to improve the foreign-related national security mechanism. This is not in the People's Daily today, but I thought it was interesting to cover. The report says: -Since the 18th Party Congress, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has made a series of major strategic decisions regarding national security from an overall and strategic height, constructing a new security pattern, fully preventing and addressing external risks and challenges affecting our country's national security, achieving comprehensive and historic major accomplishments. We have resolutely defended national interests and national dignity, continuously thwarted attempts by external forces to attack and smear us using issues related to Taiwan, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Tibet, epidemic, and human rights. The fight against infiltration, terrorism, and separatism has achieved remarkable results, firmly maintaining national political security, system security, and ideological security. We have forcefully counteracted external forces' interference in the Taiwan issue, establishing or re-establishing diplomatic relations with 11 countries on the basis of the One-China principle. We have firmly safeguarded national maritime rights and interests, steadily promoted the development of border areas and enriched the people, stabilized and consolidated borders, properly handled peripheral security risks, and defended national sovereignty and territorial integrity. We have accelerated the construction of overseas interest protection and risk warning and prevention systems, repeatedly implemented emergency protection and evacuation operations for overseas citizens, continuously strengthened security guarantees for jointly building BRI, protecting the safety of Chinese citizens, institutions, and projects overseas. We have maintained the security of food, energy and important resources supply, and the security and stability of the industrial chain and supply chain. We have actively participated in global security governance, strongly supported the important agenda of the United Nations in the field of peace and security, deeply participated in international security cooperation, put forward new concepts and propositions in the field of security, such as the Global Security Initiative, and significantly increased the influence, appeal and shaping power in global security affairs.- ，，，，、。，、、、、、，，、、。，11、。，、，，。，，--，、。、、。，，，，、、。，、、、，。，. Share Tracking People's Daily Then the article makes three points: First, improving foreign-related national security mechanisms requires coordinating external and internal security, responding to risk challenges brought about by the profound changes unseen in a century in the world situation. Currently, the world has entered a new period of turbulent transformation, with rising anti-globalization sentiment, significant increases in unilateralism and protectionism, weak global economic recovery, frequent regional conflicts and turmoil, worsening global problems. In this situation, China's external environment and security landscape have undergone major changes, and external suppression and containment can escalate at any time. History repeatedly proves that security exists when it is fought for, but perishes when sought through weakness and concession. We must develop a struggle spirit, establish and improve peripheral security work coordination mechanisms, improve mechanisms for counter-sanctions, counter-interference, and countering ‘long-arm jurisdiction', improve mechanisms for maintaining maritime rights and interests, firmly withstand and counter extreme external suppression and containment, strictly prevent and severely crack down on hostile forces' infiltration, sabotage, subversion, and separatist activities, fully maintain the Party's leadership and ruling position, maintain the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, and defend the core interests of the country. ，，，。，，，、，，，，，。，，。，，、、--，，，、、、，，，. Second, to improve the national security mechanism involving foreign countries, it is necessary to coordinate openness and security in order to serve high-level opening up and the new development pattern. Since reform and opening up, especially since the 18th Party Congress, China's relations with the world have undergone historic changes. China has become the main trading partner of more than 140 countries and regions, and the main source of investment for an increasing number of countries. Since 2017, China has maintained its position as the largest goods trading country for 7 consecutive years. In 2023, China's share of global exports reached 14.2%, remaining the largest for 15 consecutive years. China's total overseas assets are huge, and the number of people travelling, working, and studying abroad is huge. General Secretary Xi Jinping has emphasised that ‘the more open we are, the more we must pay attention to security.' It is necessary to strengthen the system and mechanism for early warning, prevention, and protection of overseas interests and investment risks, deepen international law enforcement cooperation in the field of security, promptly coordinate and deal with major security incidents involving Chinese citizens and institutions, improve the security guarantee system for jointly building BRI, safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens and legal persons overseas, and ensure the security of food, energy resources, and important industrial chain supply chains. ，，，。，。140，，20177，202314.2%，15。，、、。，--。、、，，，--，、，、、。 Third, to improve the national security mechanism involving foreign countries, we must coordinate our own security and common security and promote global security governance. To achieve national rejuvenation, we not only need a stable and united domestic environment, but also a peaceful and stable international environment. It is necessary to continue to advocate a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable global security concept, promote the implementation of GSI, actively participate in global security governance, promote the construction of a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture, seek the greatest common divisor of universal security, and promote the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind with universal security. ，，，。，。、、、，，，、、，，.

Xi Tells Airborne Corps to 'Strengthen the Awareness of Preparing for War' - Li Qiang's Openness Pitch at CIIE - Li Xi Visits Kenya - Huai Jinpeng on ...	Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Wednesday, November 06, 2024. Page 1: Xi Jinping is touring Hebei, where he inspected an airborne corps in the city of Xiaogan. He Weidong accompanied Xi for this. As per the report, Xi said that: The -airborne forces have a special and important role in our military force structure and combat system. It is necessary to thoroughly implement the thought on strengthening the military in the new era, implement the military strategic guidelines of the new era, implement the requirements for the transformation and construction of the air force, comprehensively strengthen military training and war preparedness, comprehensively improve airborne combat capabilities, and strive to build a powerful modern airborne force.- 、、4。，，，，，，，. After the group photo session, Xi Jinping inspected the airborne combat and support equipment, and carefully learned about the typical weapons and equipment, as well as their technical and tactical performance, and listened to the relevant information. Learning that the airborne forces have made positive progress in building their weapons and equipment system in recent years, Xi Jinping was very pleased. He emphasised the need to reinforce the traction of operational requirements (this essentially means using specific operational or combat requirements to be the key factor in the development, acquisition, and deployment of equipment), strengthen the standardisation, serialisation, and generalisation of airborne equipment development and its real combat application, and build a new-type airborne equipment system. ，，，。，。，，、、，. After this, Xi visited the military history museum of the airborne forces. Xi said that this -is a heroic unit with a profound history and outstanding achievements. It experienced a baptism by the smoke of war during the revolutionary war years, demonstrated the national prestige and military might in the Battle of Shangganling during the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and has outstandingly completed a series of major tasks during the period of peaceful construction, and has produced a large number of heroic collectives and model individuals. Xi Jinping carefully observed the exhibits and listened attentively to the explanation. He urged everyone to make good use of the advantages of red resources, educate and guide officers and soldiers to carry forward the glorious traditions, and strive to be the successors of heroes in the new era.- ，。、，，，，。，。，，，. Xi then delivered a speech. Xi -emphasised that it is necessary to firmly remember the duties and missions, strengthen the awareness of preparing for war/combat readiness, and grasp the military struggle preparations tightly and solidly. It is necessary to grasp the characteristics and laws of the use of airborne forces in modern warfare, update the thinking and concepts with regard to airborne operations, innovate combat styles and ways of using military forces, and give full play to the unique advantages of the airborne forces. It is necessary to do a good job in basic training and concentrate training efforts to specialise in key and difficult domains, based on complex and challenging conditions, strengthen all-element, system-based, and scenario-driven training, increase the intensity of joint training with other service branches, promote the deep integration of combat and training, and enhance joint command, joint action, and joint support capabilities.- ，。。，，，。，，，。，、、，，，、、. Xi Jinping pointed out that it is necessary to implement the concept of ​​system construction, coordinate and strengthen the construction of airborne combat forces, strengthen the development of cadres throughout the chain, solidly promote high-quality development, and build combat capabilities in a systematic manner. It is necessary to strengthen the practical exploration of the construction of new-quality combat effectiveness, use advanced scientific and technological achievements to empower and increase the efficiency of airborne forces, and guide the transformation of the combat effectiveness generation model. It is necessary to focus on achieving the PLA's centennial goal, focus on the core capabilities of airborne operations, implement the various tasks outlined in the 14th FYP, and ensure that the goals that have been set are achieved as scheduled. It is necessary to focus on the current situation and the long-term, strengthen the planning and design of airborne troops, and ensure that the target map, roadmap, and development map. (、、) are scientifically developed. ，，，，，。，，。，，--，。、，，、、. Xi Jinping stressed that we must implement the spirit of the CMC's political work conference, fully leverage the power of political work, and provide a strong political guarantee for the construction of the airborne troops. It is necessary to deepen political training, tighten and enforce political responsibilities for party governance, forge a strong party organisation that is politically steadfast and capable, seriously investigate and address corruption issues and misconduct among officers and soldiers, and ensure that the heroic troops remain pure and glorious at all times. It is necessary to adhere to higher standards and stricter requirements, vigorously strengthen the cultivation of fighting spirit, strengthen practical training and rigorous tempering, and cultivate the unique bravery and courage of airborne troops. It is necessary to implement the requirements of governing the military according to the law and strict military discipline, strictly manage education and training, maintain regular order, and ensure that the troops are highly concentrated/focussed, integrated/unified, and secure and stable. All levels must persist in shifting the focus downward, do a good job of grasping grassroots work and laying a solid foundation, address the difficulties faced by officers and soldiers with utmost enthusiasm, ignite the positive energy of the vast majority of officers and soldiers to unite and forge ahead, and work hard to create a new situation in the construction of the airborne troops. ，，，。，，、，，。、，，，。、，，，。，，，、，.

Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 49 years ago, the two countries have made substantial progress in their relations, improved the wellbeing of the two peoples and promoted peace, stability and development of the region and the world at large, he said.

Li said that hosting the CIIE is an important measure for China to expand opening up and cooperation, representing China's solemn commitment to the world. If the first CIIE was a one-way invitation from China to the world, then each subsequent edition has become a mutual commitment between China and the world, reflecting the shared aspiration for opening up and cooperation. In today's world, the profound changes unseen in a century are accelerating, the tide of anti-globalization is rising, unilateralism and protectionism are clearly on the rise, and the factors of instability and uncertainty facing the cause of global peace and development are increasing. The more the situation is like this, the more we must adhere to openness, expand openness, and enhance openness, to promote lasting peace, stability, development and prosperity. ，，。2018，，。，，。，，，、，、。，、、，、. Li then made three proposals: First, we should better build consensus on opening up while adhering to the principle of keeping our promises. All parties should jointly adhere to international economic and trade orders and rules and earnestly fulfil multilateral and bilateral economic and trade agreements. China will further expand institutional opening up and actively align with high-standard international economic and trade rules, Li said, pledging efforts to implement the strategy for upgrading pilot free trade zones. Second, we should better expand the space for opening up while adhering to mutual benefit and win-win results. All parties should maintain a mindset of achieving success together, create new development space through closer market and resource connections, and adopt methods that are more conducive to innovative cooperation. China is willing to open up its enormous market further, including implementing the unilateral opening up and offering zero-tariff treatment for all tariff lines from the least developed countries and continuously hosting exhibitions such as the CIIE and the Canton Fair, so as to truly turn China's large market into a great opportunity for the world. Third, we should better shoulder the mission of opening up while adhering to the common destiny. China firmly safeguards the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core and supports developing countries in sharing more benefits of globalisation. It is willing to continue to closely coordinate and cooperate with all parties in international economic organisations, take the lead in exploring the implementation of the WTO's ‘Investment Facilitation for Development Agreement' and other achievements, and work together to build an open world economy. The fundamentals of the Chinese economy remain sound, and the Chinese government is capable of promoting steady economic growth and contributing more to global development and the welfare of humanity. 。，。，，。。，，，。，，100%，、，。。，，，《》，。，，、.

Xin Chunying, head of the NPC's Constitution and Law Committee, discussed the revision to the Law on Protection of Cultural Relics. Wang Hongxiang, deputy director of the Constitution and Law Committee, talked about the draft revision to the Mineral Resources Law. Wang said that the changes -enrich the content of basic geological survey work; add content to promote international cooperation in the field of mineral resources; further improve the mining land system; strengthen the management of tailings ponds created due to mineral resource extraction work in order to prevent security risks; and further strengthens ecological restoration work in mining areas.- 。；；；，；。 Zhou Guangquan, Vice Chairman of the NPC's Constitution and Law Committee, talked about the draft energy law. Zhou said that -the third draft includes new provisions for the state to promote the establishment of a new standard system in the energy sector and actively promote market-based energy-saving services like contract energy management. It also stipulates that energy users should actively participate in ‘energy demand response' and includes additional provisions to guide energy users in promoting energy conservation and improving energy efficiency.- 。，；--，. Xinhua English's report has more details: -To ensure energy security and green and low-carbon transition, the latest version adds a provision that says the country shall establish and improve an energy standard system to ensure energy security and green and low-carbon transition, and promote the development of new energy technologies, industries and business forms… (the current draft stipulates that) China will accelerate building a new type of power system and improve the grid's ability to accept, allocate and regulate clean energy. Some lawmakers proposed that clean energy includes renewable energy and nuclear energy. Nuclear energy generation is more stable and different from renewable energy generation such as wind and solar energy. They proposed to modify ‘clean energy' to ‘renewable energy'. The latest version covers more detailed provisions on the responsibilities of energy enterprises to secure adequate supply and adds a provision that energy enterprises ‘shall not collect fees illegally'. It adds a provision that the energy regulatory authority of the State Council, together with other departments of the State Council, shall strengthen guidance and coordination on energy emergency work across provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities.- Huang Ming, deputy director of the NPC's Constitution and Law Committee, discussed the draft revision to the Anti-Money Laundering Law. Huang said that -the third draft further clarifies the conditions for financial institutions to adopt anti-money laundering risk management measures; adds provisions stating that sharing anti-money laundering information should comply with laws on information protection; and stipulates that if money laundering risk management measures involve basic and necessary financial services for customers, financial institutions should handle them in a timely manner.- 。；；、，.

He added that -the two sides should follow the consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, stick to the right direction of improving and developing bilateral relations, and build a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship that meets the requirements of the new era. Wang said the Japanese side should establish an objective and rational understanding of China, honor its political commitment on the Taiwan question and earnestly safeguard the political foundation of China-Japan relations, urging the Japanese side to take concrete actions to implement the important consensus of ‘being each other's cooperation partners rather than threats', and promote the steady and long-term development of bilateral ties.- The two sides reiterated that they will abide by the principles and consensus set out in the four political documents between China and Japan and commit to comprehensively advancing the strategic relationship of mutual benefit between the two sides, reaching agreement to maintain high-level intercourse, dialogue and exchanges in various fields, and send more positive signals to the outside world. The two sides believed that China and Japan, as two important neighbours with development closely linked to each other and highly complementary economies, should not and will not decouple, pledging to jointly promote the healthy development of economic and trade cooperation and the stable and smooth production and supply chain. The two sides discussed the issue of the discharge of Fukushima nuclear contaminated water into the sea and agreed to accelerate the follow-up and implementation of the bilateral political consensus. The two sides also exchanged views on international and regional issues of common concern. Wang Yi stressed that China is firmly committed to the path of peaceful development, pursues a national defence policy that is defensive in nature, and is a major country with the best record of peace and security.

It is hoped that all parties will jointly resist non-regional forces inciting confrontation in the area and take concrete actions to safeguard regional peace and stability. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, there's a combined report on Li Qiang's meetings with the Prime Ministers of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan at the sidelines of the CIIE. Xinhua's report on Li's meeting with Kazakh PM Olzhas Bektenov reports Li saying that: -China is ready to work with Kazakhstan to implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state, deepen political mutual trust, firmly support each other on issues concerning each other's core interests, continue to expand mutually beneficial cooperation and bring more benefits to the two peoples. Li pointed out that China is willing to strengthen the docking of development strategies with Kazakhstan, take high-quality Belt and Road cooperation as the guide, continue to expand bilateral trade, consolidate production capacity and investment cooperation, create highlights in energy and mineral cooperation, enhance the level of connectivity and push for more practical results. He called on the two countries to jointly work for the success of the Year of Chinese Tourism in Kazakhstan next year, strengthen cooperation in culture, education, sub-national and other fields, and enhance mutual understanding and amity between the two peoples. China stands ready to coordinate closely with Kazakhstan within multilateral frameworks such as the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and the China-Central Asia mechanism, actively implement the three global initiatives, practice genuine multilateralism, safeguard economic globalization and free trade, and promote the development of global governance toward a more just and equitable direction, Li said.- Xinhua's report on the meeting with Uzbek PM Abdulla Aripov says that: -China will work with Uzbekistan to transform those common understandings into concrete actions and cooperation results so as to bring more benefits to the people of the two countries, Li said. China and Uzbekistan should always view their relations from a strategic, long-term perspective, provide firm mutual support on issues concerning each other's core interests and major concerns, and be trustworthy friends and partners, Li said. The two countries should further align their development strategies, expand economic and trade cooperation, strengthen connectivity infrastructure construction, and build the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway into a flagship project of the Belt and Road cooperation, he said. Li also stressed tapping into cooperation potential in emerging industries such as new energy, the digital economy, artificial intelligence, cross-border e-commerce, 5G and green mining. China stands ready to strengthen cooperation with Uzbekistan in areas such as culture, education, tourism and poverty reduction, and to facilitate the people-to-people exchange, Li said. The two countries should continue to strengthen their coordination and cooperation within multilateral mechanisms such as the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and the China-Central Asia Mechanism, and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the two countries and all other developing countries, he added.- Subscribe now Page 3: There's a report on the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology holding an event to discuss the pilot program to expand opening-up in value-added telecom services in four designated areas in Beijing, Shanghai, Hainan and Shenzhen.

The report says that the direct selection and recruitment targets are mainly selected from among fresh science and engineering graduates engaged in ‘Double First-Class' universities and disciplines. For specialties urgently needed and in shortage, candidates can also be selected in appropriate numbers from non-‘Double First-Class' universities and disciplines, but must be from undergraduate programs that were admitted in the first batch of enrollment. At present, the goal is to have over 800 military (police) officer positions for open recruitment. Share Tracking People's Daily First, Xinhua reports that China on Monday appealed to the WTO against the EU's final ruling of countervailing measures on Chinese electric vehicles. China firmly opposes the final measures of the EU to impose high countervailing duties on Chinese-made EVs, despite a barrage of objections raised by relevant parties, including the governments of EU member states, the industry and the public, said the Ministry of Commerce. To safeguard the development interests of the EV industry and global cooperation on green transformation, China decided to make the appeal to the WTO dispute settlement mechanism. The complaint followed China's previous appeal to the organization against the EU's initial anti-subsidy measures for Chinese EVs, according to the ministry. China believes that the EU's ruling, lacking factual and legal basis while violating WTO rules, is an abuse of trade remedy measures and a practice of trade protectionism in the name of countervailing, the ministry's spokesperson noted. China has urged the EU to face up to its own mistakes, immediately correct its illegal practices, and jointly safeguard the stability of the global EV industrial chain and supply chain as well as the overall China-EU economic and trade cooperation, the spokesperson said. Meanwhile, the EU's incoming trade chief Maros Sefcovic believes that China is the bloc's -most challenging trade partner-. Second, SCMP reports that -a historical drama about Chinese President Xi Jinping's late father, Xi Zhongxun, will be shown on state television from Tuesday – the first time his story has been dramatised for TV. The first episode of Time in the Northwest will make its debut during prime time on CCTV's main channel, according to a trailer aired on Sunday. The series spans 25 years of Xi Zhongxun's life – from 1927 to 1952 – across 40 episodes as he rises from the son of poor farmers in rural Shaanxi province to lead the Communist Party revolution in China's northwest, news website The Paper reported on Sunday. It said the series highlighted Xi Zhongxun's efforts to mobilise support for a revolutionary base in Yanan, Shaanxi, to address ethnic and religious issues in the region, and to drive economic development. The series is set against the backdrop of the failed First United Front – an alliance between the party and the Kuomintang – and the building of the party's revolutionary bases in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.- Third, China's ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, delivered an interesting speech at the Merchants' Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry (MCCI) event in Kolkata recently. Some useful points from that are: Xu's summary of the Modi-Xi meeting: -The two sides reached a series of common understandings, including strengthening communication and cooperation, enhancing strategic mutual trust; holding talks between our foreign ministers and officials at various levels to bring the relationship back to sound and steady development at an early date; making good use of the Special Representatives mechanism on the China-India boundary question, ensure peace and tranquility in the border areas, and find a fair and reasonable settlement; strengthening communication and cooperation in multilateral fora to safeguard the common interests of developing countries.- -This year, the Chinese Embassy and Consulates in India have issued over two hundred and forty thousand visas (240,000 visas), 80% of which were business visas. This shows the vitality of economic and trade exchanges between the two countries.- -Chinese companies have made important contributions to local development and exports. Facts show that China-India commercial exchanges are inseparable. Indian media reported that some electronic, chemical, and renewable energy products still need to be imported from China. Imposing tariffs and restrictions on Chinese products is not conducive to the development of downstream industries and the interests of consumers in India. Indian companies need highly skilled workers from China to install equipment and carry out repairs. The Chief Economic Advisor of the Indian Government also called for more investment from China in the new ‘Economic Survey'.- -China is advancing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization. India has also put forward the vision of ‘Viksit Bharat 2047'. The two countries have the same development goals and broad prospects for cooperation. China wants to develop well for itself, and hopes India will develop well too. No country understands better than China what a great cause it is to enable more than 1.4 billion Indians to live a good life, and how much effort it requires. We would like to work with India to help each other succeed, achieve common development and revitalization, promote the unity and cooperation of the Global South, and join hands to build a community with a shared future for mankind.- -This September, I met with Chairmen of some of India's leading companies during my visit to Gujarat and Maharashtra. These entrepreneurs have studied the policies proposed by the Third Plenary Session, and are even familiar with important concepts such as ‘new quality productive forces'. I believe that these entrepreneurs pay close attention to the latest developments in China because they think that China's policies will bring new development opportunities to all countries, including India.- Xu then made three proposals: First, he called for closer commercial ties. -India's high-quality products will have broad business opportunities in China. In fact, in Fiscal Year 2024, some products that the Indian industry promoted, such as pepper, iron ore, and cotton yarn have achieved an increase of more than 17%, 160%, and 240% in exports to China. China welcomes more Indian companies to make full use of platforms such as the China International Import Expo to help more Indian high-quality products to be exported to China and share China's development dividends.- (Note: It is worth highlighting that there is no comment from Xu on non-tariff barriers that the Indian side has complained about for a while.) Second, he talked about FDI. -Actively attracting FDI and effectively protecting the rights and interests of foreign enterprises are the reasons behind China's rapid development…By maintaining the stability and continuity of FDI policies, China continues to consolidate the confidence of foreign companies in China. The Third Plenary Session proposed that all restrictions on foreign investment in the manufacturing industry be removed comprehensively, and foreign companies are encouraged to participate in the Chinese upstream and downstream supply chains. Indian companies can enhance ‘Make in India' by ‘investing in China'. At the same time, the industrial structures of China and India are highly complementary. India has a competitive edge in IT, software and biomedicine, while China is seeing rapid expansion in electronic manufacturing and emerging industries. India is in a major drive to improve infrastructure, an area where China has rich experience. Companies of both countries, if connected, will produce an effect of ‘1+1=11'. Such cooperation will help to sustain economic growth in both countries and inject new dynamism into the global economy. The business community hopes that India will lift its restrictions on investment and government procurement against neighboring countries, so as to promote common development of industries and benefit the people of the two nations.- (Note: This is a direct demand from the Chinese side for India to take back the investment scrutiny that began with Press Note 3 in April 2020.) Third, people-to-people engagement. Xu said that -as two large ancient civilizations with a population of over 1.4 billion, relaxing visa restrictions and restarting direct flights will have great significance. It will enhance people-to-people exchanges and bring the relationship between the two nations back to sound and steady development at an early date. In 2024, the number of Chinese outbound tourists is expected to reach one hundred and thirty million. India should not miss this opportunity. Furthermore, China and India can strengthen cooperation in the movie industry. During my visit to Mumbai last month, I passed many Bollywood filming locations such as Bandra Fort and ‘Queen's Necklace'. The well-developed film industry in India left a deep impression on me. Indian films, including ‘Dangal' or Wrestling Competition, and ‘Bajrangi Bhaijaan' are very popular in China. China and India can strengthen cooperation in the movie sector and promote mutual understanding between the two peoples.- (Note: I support this recommendation. Easing visas and restarting direct flights is a no-brainer to me. When it comes to movies and entertainment, I think this is for Beijing to act upon, and I hope Xu will make the case at home. China imposes artificial barriers to limit foreign entertainment content; a lot of this is protectionism in the garb of political control. I agree with Amb. Xu, Beijing must allow for Indian movies, television, music, etc, greater access to the Chinese market.) In the meantime, if you are interested in how the patrolling agreement is shaping up, Rajat Pandit reports for the Times of India that the Indian -Army ‘successfully' undertook a full-fledged patrol to one of the five patrolling points (PPs) in the Depsang Plains in eastern Ladakh on Monday, after conducting similar patrols in Demchok last week.- With the first one done, the Indian side will be sending patrols to the four other PPs in the area now. The report adds that the -Army now has ‘unrestricted access' to the five PPs in Depsang and and two in Demchok, which was earlier blocked by Chinese soldiers.- The report adds: -The PLA, too, is conducting similar patrols with advance information to India to prevent the possibility of any clash.- Thanks for reading Tracking People's Daily!

Combining Top-Level Design & Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones - Discussing the Future of China's AI Governance - Li Qiang Calls for Supporting...	Hi folks, I hope you've all had a good weekend. I took a bit of a break late last week, celebrating Diwali. There were lots of colourful lights and much-needed sleep to enjoy. The wonderful thing about living in a multicultural, multi-faith society is that you have so many new year's within one year that you can always re-start and renew resolutions that didn't work out. So, here's wishing everyone reading this newsletter a happy and prosperous year ahead. Warmly, Manoj Before we get to today's edition, I want to cover a piece from Saturday. This one deals with Xi's engagement with officials at the provincial and ministerial level. It makes some really interesting points about the principles and boundaries of reform: The combination of top-level design and ‘crossing the river by feeling the stones' is one of the distinctive characteristics of comprehensively deepening reform in the new era. On October 29, 100 days after the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, at the opening session of a special seminar for provincial and ministerial-level leaders to study and implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session, General Secretary Xi Jinping's remarks on ‘crossing the river by feeling the stones' were thought-provoking. ‘Some people say, at this point in time, we're still -crossing the river by feeling the stones-. Isn't that conservative and timid? ‘Reforms that follow familiar paths are like swimming in a pool, where lines mark shallow and deep ends clearly. But in a turbulent river, don't we need to feel for stones to cross? It's not that, after decades of reform and opening up, we've already figured out every issue. If everything were clear, why would there still be a need for reform?' These words sound familiar. During his first local inspection after the 18th Party Congress in Guangdong, the General Secretary made it clear: ‘We cannot say that feeling the stones to cross the river was necessary in the early stages of reform and opening up, but now we can no longer mention feeling the stones to cross the river'. There are both key approaches for overall planning. In the new era of comprehensively deepening reform, an important reform methodology, which is also a major theoretical achievement we have made, is ‘combining top-level design with crossing the river by feeling the stones.' The combination of the two reflects the important principle of governance of seeking progress while maintaining stability and has multiple practical implications.- ，。，1029，，--。-，，，、？--，，，、。，？，。？-。，：-，-。，。，，，--。，，。 Later the piece adds: -Top-level design emphasises systematic thinking and overall strategy, while ‘crossing the river by feeling the stones' emphasises daring to explore and experimentation at the grassroots level. ‘We must combine top-level design with crossing the river by feeling the stones' - this is an inherent requirement for further comprehensively deepening reform, and it is also an inevitable choice to enhance the systematic, holistic, and coordinated nature of reform, and to improve the cohesion, driving force, and implementation of reform.- 、，、。--，，、、，、、. The piece then stresses that during his remarks, Xi spoke about -- using both hands, adopting a dual strategy or doing two things in tandem. It adds: -The General Secretary profoundly pointed out: ‘For things we are confident about and have thought through carefully, we should implement top-level design; for things we are uncertain about and that are not yet mature, we should cross the river by feeling the stones - these two approaches should be used in tandem'. Reform is a journey of exploration full of unknowns. The coordination of ‘using both hands' contains the harmonisation of ‘knowing' and ‘doing'. For what is clearly understood, we must ‘commit to advancing resolutely'. For what is not so clearly understood yet still requires breakthroughs, we should neither stand still nor rush forward blindly. Over these years, a series of major reforms have formed replicable experiences through pilot exploration, which have then evolved into institutional achievements, and finally expanded to larger scales. Comprehensively deepening reform is thus about ‘accumulating small victories into big victories'.- Another phrase that the piece talks about is ‘establish first, then break' . Reform is a process of breaking the old and establishing the new. At this point in history, the prioritisation between breaking and establishing concerns not only the strategic planning of top-level design but also the orderly steps of crossing the river by feeling the stones. The General Secretary has a clear view: ‘To further comprehensively deepen reform, we must adhere to institutional building as the main line and emphasise the simultaneous approach of establishing and breaking, prioritising establishment before breaking. All reform measures must be fully demonstrated and carefully designed, with in-depth risk assessments, and proper control of timing, extent, and effectiveness. What needs to be established should be proactively established, and it must be established firmly, sustainably, feasibly, and effectively; what needs to be broken should be broken in a timely manner, decisively, and thoroughly on the basis of what has been established, achieving steady and swift reform progress through the unity of breaking and establishing'. ，。--。、、、，。：-、，；、，，‘'。-。--，----。，--。-、-？，。，，，。，--。--。。，，，。：-，，、。、，，。，、，、；、、，.- Subscribe now A couple of paragraphs towards the end are also interesting, since they set the boundaries for the reform agenda: -What should not be changed? The General Secretary pointed out: ‘Our fundamental political system, basic political system, and supporting systems are all very mature now. The People's Republic of China has been established for 75 years, the People's Congress for 70 years, and the Political Consultative Conference for 75 years - do they still need major reforms? Where would further reforms lead? We shouldn't reform just for the sake of reform, nor should we reform blindly'. What must not change? Take economic system reform for example. For example: on the issue of ‘letting the market play a decisive role in resource allocation while better leveraging the role of government', General Secretary Xi Jinping recalled the lengthy discussion process during the preparation for the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee, emphasising that ‘this important assertion is absolutely crucial.' Another example is the consistent adherence to and implementation of the ‘Two Unwaverings'. The General Secretary also responded to the concerns of those who try to distinguish the importance of the two: ‘There's no singling out, no one-sidedness; this has never wavered. We must be fair and just, maintain the balance, and not weigh one as more important than the other'. These things that cannot be casually changed or easily altered were also established through repeated experiences of exploration and were ultimately solidified through top-level design. The General Secretary made this assessment: ‘As the reform has progressed to this day, we already have a relatively clear big picture in terms of the top-level design of the reform'.- ？：-、。75，70、75，？？，。-？，，--，，，--。，--，。：-，，。，，。-、，，。：-，，.- Share Tracking People's Daily Here are the key reports and articles that I found noteworthy from the People's Daily's edition on Monday, November 04, 2024. Page 1: There isn't a lot useful on the front page today. There's a report (English report) on Li Qiang's visit to Shanghai, where he discussed vocational education and skilled talent training. Li visited the Shanghai Nanhu Vocational &amp; Technical College. He said there -it is necessary to deepen the integration of industry and education as well as the cooperation between colleges and enterprises, optimize the setting of college disciplines and majors based on the needs of the society and industries' actual development and strengthen hands-on skill practice, adding that more skilled teachers are needed to innovate the models and methods of teaching.- Li added: -It is necessary to grasp the trend of the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, aim at the forefront of science and technology and the world's first-class, cultivate more ‘high-tech, cutting-edge and scarce' skilled talents with strong theoretical foundations and practical capabilities to help achieve high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-strengthening.- ，，、--，. Noting that there are ever-growing demands for elderly care, childcare and medical care, Li urged efforts to strengthen the training of skilled workers in the related fields. In addition, while visiting the WorldSkills Museum, Li said that -governments at all levels should continue to refine support policies for the cultivation of skilled workers by strengthening institutional innovation and investment. Efforts should also be made to improve the systems of development planning and services for skilled workers with a view to broadening their development channels and enhancing their incomes-. Subscribe now Also on the page is a long article previewing the 7th China International Import Expo. The article calls it a -major economic and diplomatic- event. One key point in the piece is: -Opening up is the inevitable path to world prosperity and development. Looking back at history, openness and inclusiveness lead to progress, while isolation and narrowness lead to obstacles. After the Cold War, economic globalisation developed rapidly, greatly promoting the flow of goods and capital, providing strong momentum for world economic development. In today's world of ‘you are in me, and I am in you', opening up and cooperation is the only choice. China's hosting of the Import Expo is a major initiative to proactively open its market to the world, and a practical action to promote the building of an open world economy and advocate inclusive economic globalisation. Only by gathering the power of cooperation through openness can we achieve great things, accomplish good things, and sustain long-term success, bringing a bright future for global development. Opening up is a distinctive marker of Chinese-style modernization. Major trading partners with more than 150 countries and regions, ranking first in total goods trade for 7 consecutive years, outward direct investment flow ranking among world's top three for 12 consecutive years…Since reform and opening up, China has forged a path of seeking common development through openness. The Import Expo is a vivid example that ‘the more China develops, the more it opens up', witnessing China's door of opening up growing ever wider. Only an open China can become a modernised China…- ，。，，。，，，。-、-，。，，、。，、、，。，。150，7，12……，。-，-，。，. Subscribe now Page 2: There's a report discussing China's energy mix. Some key data points: -In the first eight months, the investment in key energy projects was about 1.7 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 16.2%. Among these, investment in energy network infrastructure has been steadily released. Investment in 5 under-construction ultra-high voltage DC transmission projects across provinces and regions is accelerating, LNG receiving terminal investments in Liaoning, Zhejiang, Guangxi, and Shandong are growing rapidly, and under-construction projects are quickly materializing into physical work progress. Non-fossil energy power generation investment is growing steadily. A batch of centralized wind power projects in Hebei, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Gansu, and Xinjiang are accelerating, while five newly approved nuclear power projects in Shandong Zhaoyuan, Jiangsu Xuwei, Zhejiang Sanao, Guangdong Lufeng, and Guangxi Bailong are gradually materializing into physical work progress. Investment in new energy business forms is expanding in multiple areas. In the first 8 months, completed investment in new energy storage increased by 21% year-on-year, while pumped storage completed investment increased by 45.5% year-on-year. A batch of multi-energy complementary clean energy base projects in Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang are progressing in an orderly manner, while Inner Mongolia's under-construction green hydrogen production projects and Henan's under-construction hydrogen facilities projects continue to form effective investment. The completed investment in key energy projects has maintained relatively rapid growth, further consolidating the foundation of energy supply security and injecting momentum into high-quality economic and social development. As of the end of September, the national total power generation installed capacity reached 3.16 billion kilowatts, a year-on-year increase of 14.1%. Coal, oil, and gas production capacity has steadily improved, with crude oil and natural gas production increasing by 2% and 6.6% year-on-year in the first three quarters of this year. ，。5，、、、，。。、、、、，、、、、5。。8，21%，45.5%。、、，、。，，。9，31.6，14.1%。、，，、2%、6.6%. -In the first three quarters, China's new installed capacity of renewable energy power generation was 210 million kilowatts, a year-on-year increase of 21%, accounting for 86% of the newly-installed capacity of electricity.

First, Liu Yanhong from the China University of Political Science and Law argues that the development of generative AI can be classified into three stages: the preparatory stage involving pre-training and algorithm upgrades aided by human annotation the operational stage where input data is processed by algorithms to produce generated outputs, and the generative stage where the outputs are applied in society. Liu says that -We must understand the operational mechanisms of generative AI in depth, grasp the characteristics of the formation and development of security risks at each stage, and use legal means to strengthen systematic governance, ensuring that the immense power contained in generative AI always operates within the framework of the rule of law.- ，，，。，，，. She then outlines the key risks for each stage. For the first stage, Liu argues that the risks are primarily related to data security. At this stage, it is important to ensure -appropriate classification of data and the establishment of usage patterns and protection methods for different types of data to properly address relevant data security risks, avoiding illegal use or improper disclosure of data, which could lead to infringement disputes.- 、、。，，，，. Liu adds: -Legal rules for generative AI's acquisition and use of government data should be clarified to both meet society's needs for utilizing government data and strongly support the development, training, and application of AI government service large models to improve public service and social governance intelligence levels, while also regulating its processing methods to avoid results derived from government data harming individual rights or disrupting social public order.- ，，、，；，、. On personal data collection, She argues that -generative AI tends to over-collect personal data to improve conclusion accuracy, such as analyzing medical health data to mine personal whereabouts and predict personal life trajectories. Therefore, collection must adhere to law, collecting personal data within the minimum scope needed for technology, and setting reasonable data processing depths to avoid excessive mining of potential information.- ，，，、。，，，，. For the second stage, Liu highlights the -inherent risk of algorithmic bias.- Liu says: -To prevent and resolve algorithm bias risks, targeted governance should be conducted according to the principles and domains of algorithm bias formation. Legal regulatory requirements should be deeply embedded into the algorithmic models of generative AI, promoting technology for good, eliminating algorithmic bias, and ensuring reasonable use of generative AI algorithms and allocation of computing resources. Based on the concept of combining technology and management, strengthen full-cycle safety supervision of algorithms, implementing legal regulatory requirements throughout the entire process of generative AI operation. When setting algorithms, it is essential to adhere to relevant legal rules and technical standards, implement the regulatory requirements of ‘machine learning + human annotation', review the algorithm modules with risks, and better discover the technical risks within the generative AI algorithm models; when congenital algorithmic biases are discovered, corrections should be made from within the algorithm based on legal requirements, ensuring that the modified algorithm can operate normally; if problems occur afterwards, conduct source-tracing governance of AI algorithms, achieve precise attribution of responsibility and make corrections, promote the improvement of regulatory standards for generative AI algorithms, fill gaps in preliminary preventive review, and use both technical and legal means in parallel to equally emphasise development and management.- ，。，，，。，，。，-+-，，；，，；，，，，，. For the third stage, Liu writes that there are many risks from the risk of abuse to IPR risks, exacerbating information asymmetry, widening the digital divide, and damaging the interests of digitally disadvantaged groups. In terms of IPR risks, Liu argues that -substantial analyses of the technical models and principles of generative AI should be conducted according to the standards of intellectual property law. If human intervention is necessary to ensure that the generated outputs possess originality and innovation, intellectual property rights should be granted and ownership clearly defined, reinforcing the systematic protection of intellectual property rights in the field of generative AI. At the same time, it is necessary to reasonably determine the scope of protection for the intellectual property rights of generated outputs to avoid an unlimited expansion of the protection scope, which could hinder the promotion and application of generative AI and technological development.- ，、，，，，；，，. Share Tracking People's Daily Next, Gu Liping from the School of Journalism and Communication at Nanjing Normal University discusses the importance of strengthening privacy protection in the era of artificial intelligence and ensuring personal information security. Gu argues that -the right to privacy faces severe challenges in the era of AI.- Gu elaborates the types of harms and challenges in the first bit before saying that: In terms of solutions, Gu stresses the -principle of informed consent-. He adds: -The principle of informed consent includes two aspects: knowledge and consent. Consent must be based on knowledge. Without sufficient knowledge and understanding, there can be no real consent. Information, understanding and voluntariness are the three elements of the principle of informed consent. On the basis of comprehensive ‘information', individuals can independently express their ‘consent'. This requires that when users use artificial intelligence, easy-to-understand and clear prompts and instructions should be made to obtain users' consent to the collection and use of personal information. If personal information will flow between different platforms, users need to be informed of the scope, target and use boundaries of the flow. For a good and smooth user experience, users can also be given the option of one-time or phased authorization. Users should be informed about the scope, methods, and purposes of personal information collection, as well as who their personal information will be shared with, and they should have the option to withdraw at any time. When conducting personal information analysis, users should be alerted via pop-ups or other forms and provide real-time authorization. Establishing a data lifecycle and timely deletion of personal information is also an effective way to protect the security of personal information.- ，，，。、，。--，--。，，。，、、。，。、，。，。、. The author also calls for -protect privacy rights and personal information security by improving database security, core data encryption, personal data anonymization and other technologies-. ，，、、，. Subscribe now The third and final write-up is by Professor Zhang Xin from the School of Law at the University of International Business and Economics. Zhang argues that for a variety of reasons, AI entities can cause -complex, dynamic and unforeseen risks.- Therefore, she calls for a -modular governance framework- for AI. -Such a framework must cover the entire industrial chain and various levels of endpoints, starting from key nodes such as data modules, algorithm modules, and model architectures, to design corresponding governance modules.- ，，、、，. Zhang later adds that -AI entities are deeply interactive, highly interconnected, and dynamically adaptable. Correspondingly, the governance approach should go beyond traditional individual-centered governance and promote the formation of a governance ecosystem characterized by extensive interconnectivity, multi-party participation, and multi-level collaboration. In this context, technical communities such as developers and operations and maintenance personnel will play a crucial ‘whistleblower' role in the governance of artificial intelligence entities. We should better leverage the supervisory advantages of technical communities and establish effective constraint mechanisms within artificial intelligence companies. Additionally, we should actively enhance the digital literacy of a wide range of users, raising their awareness of the lawful, safe, and responsible use of artificial intelligence entities, achieving positive interactions with these entities, and fostering an upward and virtuous operational state.- 、。，，、、。，、--。，。，、、，，.
