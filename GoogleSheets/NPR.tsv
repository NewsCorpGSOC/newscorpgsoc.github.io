How the scratch off lottery changed America	Americans spend more on scratch lottery tickets per year than on pizza. More than all Coca-Cola products.

Adults there now spend – on average – $1,037 every year on lottery tickets – mostly scratch tickets. On today's episode, a collaboration with GBH's podcast Scratch & Win, we hear the story of... the scratch-off lottery ticket!This episode was hosted by Ian Coss and Kenny Malone....	https://www.npr.org/2025/02/07/1229744816/scratch-off-wgbh-massachusetts-lottery	2025-02-05T00:00:59-08:00
