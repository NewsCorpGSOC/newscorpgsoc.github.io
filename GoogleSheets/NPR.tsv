And that's fueled a lot of unhappiness, and a political comeback for President-elect Donald Trump. Trump will soon take the reins of an economy that's bounced back strongly during the four years he was out of office. For many families, though, that rebound was overshadowed by soaring prices for food, housing, and other necessities.Will his policies br...	https://www.npr.org/2024/12/23/1221439455/the-numbers-were-good-but-feelings-were-bad-the-us-economy-in-2024	2024-12-23T11:21:25-08:00
