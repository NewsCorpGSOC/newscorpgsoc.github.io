The political power of the pope	Unlike any other religious leader around the world, the leader of the world's one billion Catholics is also the leader of a sovereign nation.

Much of the world has spent the last two weeks focused on Pope Francis' health. And the reason why has as much to do with the fact that he's a powerful geopolitical force as it does with the fact he's a key religious figure.
