River Stour sculpture commemorates 16th century drowning that inspired Shakespeare	Figure of woman on her back underwater draws inspiration from Hamlet’s Ophelia and death of senior Tudor judge Almost 500 years ago, a wealthy and well-connected judge named Sir James Hales walked into the river Stour near Canterbury in order to take his own life. Hales had risen to favour under King Henry VIII, but had refused to convert to Catholicism under the repressive regime of his daughter Mary, and was imprisoned in the Tower of London. Battling with his mental health after his release in 1554, he drowned himself. But as suicide was a crime at the time, his widow was denied the right to inherit his property and so took the matter to law, in a case that became so famous in the 16th century that it inspired Shakespeare’s portrayal of the suicide by drowning of Hamlet’s Ophelia.	https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/sep/15/river-stour-sculpture-commemorates-16th-century-drowning-that-inspired-shakespeare	2024-09-15T07:45:04-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8f50514b9bd91dbcbd79e5aa0dfaf2a4346826a/0_158_7373_4426/master/7373.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=92af2a800c1f6335f6b616ef3c5d78b6

Saudi Arabia calls for more pressure on Iran as Houthi threat grows	Diplomat says ‘pinprick bombings’ by west insufficient to constrain supply of weapons to group in Yemen The claimed acquisition by Yemen’s Houthi rebels of hypersonic missiles capable of penetrating Israeli air defences threatens to further heighten Middle East tensions, as Saudi Arabia calls for more than -pinprick bombings- to constrain the supply of weapons to the group. Saudi Arabia, which supports the Yemen government opposing the Houthis, believes Iran has been arming the group, including with the weapons used in the attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Those attacks have led to a halving of the traffic on the Red Sea route, pushing up the costs of maritime transport and damaging the Egyptian economy through disruption to the Suez canal.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/15/saudi-arabia-iran-houthi-threat-yemen-israel-red-sea	2024-09-15T07:13:57-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b33177f72767bc6f9e40a11bc3c38cdcfb80c01/0_226_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5f31c7cb371923ac420085b9b4cba6c2

Yimby stands for -yes in my back yard- – a play on the traditional nimbys, who have been a dominant force in British politics where planning has been one of the thorniest battlefields.

Kyiv’s botanical garden staring at disaster as Russia targets Ukraine’s energy sector	Destruction of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure puts botanical garden’s rare and exotic species in danger Zhanna Yaroslavska showed off a barrel-shaped stove in the middle of a tropical greenhouse. Nearby was a large pile of logs. -It’s a pretty neanderthal arrangement,- she explained. -When the power shuts off we feed the stove with wood. In winter we do this round the clock. Our plants require constant temperatures. They don’t like cold and hot.- Inside the glass nursery were dozens of rare specimens. All were bromeliads native to the Americas.

Middle East crisis live: UN worker killed by Israeli sniper in West Bank; Israel reports missile from Yemen	Sufyan Jaber Abed Jawwad was the first Unrwa employee killed in the West Bank in more than a decade; missile hit unpopulated area, Israel military says Welcome back to our live coverage on the Israel-Gaza war and the wider Middle East crisis. I’m Tom Ambrose. The UN says a sniper killed one of its employees on the roof of his home in the northern West Bank. Sufyan Jaber Abed Jawwad, a sanitation worker with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, was the first Unrwa employee killed in the West Bank in more than a decade. Mourners gathered in the Aegean town of Didim, south-west Turkey, on Saturday for the funeral of a US-Turkish activist, who was shot dead while protesting Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. The killing last week of 26-year-old Aysenur Ezgi Eygi has sparked international condemnation and angered Turkey, further escalating tensions over the war in Gaza. A large crowd gathered during the prayers including Eygi’s family, members of president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Islamic-rooted AKP party, and activists advocating the Palestinian cause. Erdoğan has vowed to ensure -that Aysenur Ezgi’s death does not go unpunished-. The Israeli military has said it was likely Eygi was hit -unintentionally- by forces while they were responding to a -violent riot-, and said it is looking into the case. Israeli airstrikes hit central and southern Gaza overnight into Saturday, killing at least 14 people, Gaza’s civil defence agency said.-We have recovered the bodies of 11 martyrs, including four children and three women, after an Israeli airstrike hit the house of the Bustan family in eastern Gaza City,- agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told Agence France-Presse (AFP). The strike took place near the Shujaiya school in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, he said. The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the strike. Bassal said Israeli forces carried out similar strikes in some other parts of the territory overnight, killing at least 10 people. Five people were killed in northwestern Gaza City when an airstrike hit a group of people near Dar Al-Arqam school, he said. Three others were killed in a strike in the al-Mawasi area of the southern Khan Younis governorate, where tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge, Bassal added. At least 41,182 Palestinians have been killed and 95,280 others injured in Israel’s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October, Gaza’s health ministry said on Saturday. The toll includes 64 deaths in the previous 48 hours, according to the ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and militants in its count. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) disaster risk management teams, in cooperation with the Palestine Ministry of Social Development, distributed food parcels to 11,000 families in Gaza and North Gaza governantes, the humanitarian organisation shared on X. Richard Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) representative in Gaza and the West Bank, said in a statement on Saturday that he is -hopeful these pauses will hold- as the UN agency prepare for the next round of polio vaccinations in Gaza in four week’s time. About 559,000 children under the age of 10 have recovered from their first dose, the WHO said, as part of a campaign to inoculate children in Gaza. The second doses are expected to begin later this month as part of an effort in which the WHO said parties had already agreed to. A new attempt has begun to try to salvage an oil tanker burning in the Red Sea after attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, an EU naval mission said on Saturday. The EU’s Operation Aspides published images dated Saturday of its vessels escorting ships heading to the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/15/middle-east-crisis-live-un-worker-killed-by-israeli-sniper-in-west-bank-israel-reports-missile-from-yemen	2024-09-15T00:15:47-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45436a8677cd84d954db47f1a6f43c6c9e70a116/0_118_5088_3053/master/5088.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0f626ea192c4bcc5d3a0228da83d94bf

Thousands attend funeral of runner Rebecca Cheptegei who was set on fire by partner	Mourners in Uganda pay respects to Olympic athlete whose death prompted renewed calls for more protection for women in sport Thousands of mourners in Uganda paid their respects on Saturday to Rebecca Cheptegei, the Olympic athlete who died last week in Kenya after her partner set her on fire. The military funeral took place in a remote town near the Kenyan border. Military officers played a prominent role in the funeral because Cheptegei held the rank of sergeant in Uganda’s army, said military spokesperson Brig Felix Kulayigye, adding that she deserved a -gun salute that befits her rank-.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/14/thousands-attend-funeral-of-runner-rebecca-cheptegei-set-on-fire-by-partner	2024-09-14T11:43:22-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b439e76dd664d0242db3cf4ea995a50d0b7dbf0e/0_304_4581_2749/master/4581.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a2d34c6f70c41d65162f735a7127cebd

Nurseries in England say new rules have reduced care to ‘crowd control’	The first study into Tory shake-up of childcare shows staff are overwhelmed The first major study into the Conservatives’ controversial shake-up of childcare has revealed that nursery staff are often doing more -crowd control- than education, because of the increased number of children they are looking after. Since September last year, nurseries in England have been allowed to increase child-to-staff ratios, so one adult now looks after five two-year-olds rather than four. The change was intended to help deliver the party’s pledge of 15 hours’ free childcare a week from this month for working parents of children aged from nine months to three years.	https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/sep/14/nurseries-in-england-say-new-rules-have-reduced-care-to-crowd-control	2024-09-14T11:11:56-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b096a01c1ebad798f4ff3952cb48754167f8399/0_214_3700_2221/master/3700.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fcf3210014a70150a88ae9e3ed4e126f

Fury in Turkey as animal lovers and politicians attack ‘massacre law’ to deal with 4m stray dogs	A new bill forcing local authorities to remove homeless animals from city streets has led to a furious backlash Next to the network of the highways that crisscross Turkey, among the lush forests or mountain peaks that dot the country, large stray dogs are a common sight. Most are pale white Akbaş dogs or Kangal shepherds, with their distinctive dark muzzle, pale golden coat and large bodies designed to herd livestock, although on the streets of Istanbul they are more commonly found lazing outside coffee shops, rotund and docile from a lifetime of treats. In cities at least, the stray dogs are popular enough to be seen as part of the architecture. One particularly large and sleepy example that dozes outside an ice-cream shop on Istanbul’s main shopping street has become a local celebrity nicknamed -The Boulder-, complete with a string of rave reviews left by delighted tourists. The dog is marked as an Istanbul tourist attraction on Google Maps, which features a recommendation to avoid petting him.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/14/fury-in-turkey-animal-lovers-politicians-attack-massacre-law-to-deal-with-4m-stray-dogs	2024-09-14T08:00:31-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38d67fa50e9df4e5e2b4fbd01bb4644038009687/0_88_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=93ff0b0427e49fbd74a2657123d7d68e

His works make headlines when they sell, from the record-breaking moment his Irises went for £27m at Sotheby’s in 1987, right up to this month’s predicted hoopla in Hong Kong, where Christie’s are to auction his riverside scene, Moored Boats, painted two years earlier, for an estimated $30-50m – likely to set a record for works from his later, Parisian period. The Dutch artist’s dramatic renderings of simple things – plants, trees, furniture and faces – are international emblems of the way we value art. So much so that London’s National Gallery’s renowned 1888 sunflower painting was deliberately targeted last year by Just Stop Oil climate activists, who lobbed the contents of a soup tin at it.	https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/sep/14/vincent-van-gogh-national-gallery-show-dispel-tortured-genius-label	2024-09-14T06:00:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f696fe64aa50dfd8f4e48f4130f4c658220aafd3/0_74_2480_1487/master/2480.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=53a3b543e189a9482e2f3f9bcab49394

Harris is on a -New Way Forward- tour of pivotal areas this weekend to exploit the momentum from her humiliation of Trump.

A day in Elon Musk’s mind: 145 tweets with election conspiracies and emojis	A controversial tweet may make it to the news, but reading every post from the world’s richest man shows how frenzied and extreme he really is It’s just after midnight mountain standard time in the US on 13 August when Elon Musk makes his first post of the day on X, the platform he bought for $44bn when it was known as Twitter. Musk has been tweeting for hours about his interview with Donald Trump, and he will continue into the night before taking a few hours’ break – presumably to sleep – and then logging back on to tweet dozens more times. Over the next 24 hours, Musk will post over 145 times about a range of obsessions, projects and grievances to his 195 million followers. He will share anti-immigrant content, election conspiracies and attacks against the media. He will exchange tweets with far-right politicians, conservative media influencers and sycophantic admirers. He will send a litany of one-word replies that say -yeah-, -interesting- or simply feature a cry-laughing emoji.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/14/elon-musk-tweets-trump-conspiracy	2024-09-14T00:30:20-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4cc96605ac8d669a0007d1274ea61ef93ee02d5/0_159_4554_2732/master/4554.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=db3abf10479f4204ce3a1f992508ec77
Russia-Ukraine war live: Nato chief says group could have done more to prevent war	Nato should have done more to arm Ukraine before the war, the alliance’s outgoing head Jens Stoltenberg said Nato could have done more to arm Ukraine to try to prevent Russia’s invasion in 2022, the outgoing head of the western military alliance said in an interview released on Saturday. -Now we provide military stuff to a war – then we could have provided military stuff to prevent the war,- Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg told German weekly newspaper FAS. Keir Starmer and Joe Biden have discussed letting Ukraine fire long-range, western-supplied missiles into Russia, while stopping short of any formal announcement. Vladimir Putin has threatened it would amount to Nato joining the war. The UK prime minister told reporters at the White House that he had a -wide-ranging discussion about strategy- with the US president but that it was not just a meeting about -a particular capability-. Biden dismissed Vladimir Putin’s sabre-rattling threats, saying he did not accept that Ukraine using Storm Shadows missiles against Russia proper would amount to Nato going to war with Moscow, reports Dan Sabbagh in Washington. -I do not think much about Vladimir Putin,- Biden said. Moscow’s ambassador to the UN told the security council on Friday that loosening the missile strike restrictions would mark an escalation to -direct war- between Moscow and Nato. Washington officials accused Putin of trying to scare Nato countries away from supporting Ukraine, reports Andrew Roth. In Europe, leaders played down Putin’s threats. The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said: -I would not attach excessive importance to the latest statements from President Putin. They rather show the difficult situation the Russians have on the front.- Zelenskiy said the Ukrainian incursion into Russia’s border region of Kursk had produced the desired result of slowing Moscow’s advance on another front in Ukraine’s east. The Ukrainian president said in Kyiv on Friday that Russia’s counterattack in Kursk produced no major successes – contradicting Vladimir Putin’s accounts of Russian advances on both fronts. Zelenskiy said Russia had about 40,000 troops on the Kursk front. -So far we have seen no serious [Russian] success.- Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday its troops had taken back 10 villages out of 100 that Kyiv had occupied. The battlefield reports of either side were not able to be independently verified. The Ukrainian general staff said on Friday that Russian forces had focused their assaults near the town of Kurakhove, about 33km (20 miles) south of the key logistics hub of Pokrovsk in Ukraine’s Donetsk region. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had captured Dolynivka, positioned between Pokrovsk and Kurakhove, the latest in a series of localities Moscow says it has seized. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said 49 Ukrainian prisoners of war had been returned from Russia, with Agence France-Presse witnessing the group being greeted at the border with Belarus. The Ukrainian president did not clarify whether it was part of an exchange with Russia, as is usually the case, but AFP journalists had earlier seen Russian prisoners of war being loaded on to a bus near the border. Romania started training its first group of Ukrainian F-16 pilots this week, the Nato country’s defence ministry said. The first four pilots had started their -theoretical training-, a ministry spokesperson told AFP, with practical training to follow -towards the end of the year-. Drone fragments fell on a municipal building in Kyiv’s Obolon district north of the city centre early on Saturday, said the mayor. Writing on Telegram, Vitali Klitschko said no fire broke out and emergency services were sent. He earlier said air defence units had been in action. A Reuters witness said explosions were heard. The head of Kyiv’s military administration, Serhiy Popko, urged people to remain in shelters as drones still posed a threat. The air raid alert was later lifted for the city but remained in effect for several regions of central Ukraine.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-nato-putin-zelenskiy	2024-09-14T00:15:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c90b934ace43b3316bbab25cf76ffc271c8d7cea/0_399_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3006091132510ef6b51eb7d30c3502fe

Israel’s prime target: the hunt for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar	Motivated pursuers using advanced technology and brute force have yet to pin down their cautious quarry. Would his death or capture stop the war? A group of Israel hostages were huddled in a tunnel in Gaza a few days after they had been dragged from their homes on 7 October, when the man who had plotted their abduction appeared out of the subterranean gloom. His hair and beard were grey and his dark-ringed eyes stared out from under thick black brows. It was a face familiar to them from a thousand broadcasts and newspaper stories: Yahya Sinwar. The Hamas leader in Gaza was the most feared man in Israel, even before he ordered the October raid in which 1,200 people – two-thirds of them civilians – were killed and 250 taken hostage.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/14/hunt-for-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-israel-prime-target	2024-09-13T21:00:16-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43f1a111810d2f9ce6986d5e0ca8e3d0c8bd0ded/0_138_6236_3743/master/6236.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f39091bea004e9d4eb90879ac8067b1e

He said the gathering in Brighton, beginning on Saturday, would be framed by -two emotions – we’re very excited and happy, obviously, but there’s a sense of responsibility too-.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/13/punch-and-judy-tories-ed-davey-lib-dems-party-conference	2024-09-13T07:00:03-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b4b8df52873b2caedf06916b1207cfca94eff43/0_139_7864_4722/master/7864.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ec0cb20d3e6efcd57f20f35d8a366921

US election live updates: Harris pushes for second debate with Trump: ‘We owe it to voters’	Harris campaign releases memo blasting Trump for ‘toxic positions’ he took during this week’s debate, saying he should respond to them Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump may have put the kibosh on another debate against Kamala Harris yesterday, but the vice-president isn’t letting the matter rest. Yesterday, Harris told a crowd in North Carolina that -I believe we owe it to the voters to have another debate-, and this morning, her campaign released a memo blasting Trump for the -toxic positions- he took during their encounter, and saying he should respond to them – implicitly in the form of another debate against the vice-president. The Harris campaign has said it would be happy to participate in such an event next month, but that would require Trump to reverse his position. Expect the former president to elaborate on the subject around 12pm ET, when he holds a press conference in Los Angeles. Here’s what else is going on today: Harris campaigns at 6.35pm ET in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, the swing state that some believe will be the most important in deciding the outcome of this election. Tim Walz, Harris’s running mate, is campaigning in the two other Great Lake swing states, Michigan and Wisconsin. Joe Biden welcomes the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, to the White House at 4.30pm, for his first visit since taking office in July.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/13/trump-harris-us-election	2024-09-13T06:10:45-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2ad08bfb384702048bcccf88ce005984d88f328/0_0_4917_2950/master/4917.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0be61d3a6e1a4ffca12fb6402feca151

Fears mount that election deniers could disrupt vote count in US swing states	At least 239 election deniers have signed up to Trump’s ‘election integrity’ conspiracy theories, survey finds Fears are rising that the vote count in November’s presidential election could be disrupted as a result of the proliferation of Donald Trump’s lies about stolen elections and rampant voter fraud in the key swing states where the race for the White House will be decided. A new survey of eight vital swing states reveals that at least 239 election deniers who have signed up to Trump’s -election integrity- conspiracy theories – including the false claim that the 2020 election was rigged against him – are actively engaged in electoral battles this year. The deniers are standing for congressional or state seats, holding Republican leadership positions, and overseeing elections on state and county election boards.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/13/swing-states-election-deniers-vote-count	2024-09-13T04:00:56-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3a07ef3b8e8d4246dee8525780989d1c38c5487/150_323_2222_1332/master/2222.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=709472ea9eb0dd54060c8491233fcca8

First Thing: Putin warns Nato over Ukraine missiles	First Thing: Putin’s warning follows suggestions US may lift restrictions on Ukraine using long-range weapons. Plus, Bernardine Evaristo on the books of her life Good morning. Vladimir Putin has said that a western move to let Kyiv use long-range weapons against targets inside Russia would mean Nato would be -at war- with Moscow. How do the US and UK see things? Blinken and the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, say Russia is escalating the war by accepting weapons from Iran. -The escalator here is Putin. Putin has escalated with the shipment of missiles from Iran. We see a new axis of Russia, Iran and North Korea,- Lammy said. What’s the latest in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine? Russian troops have recaptured a swathe of villages in the Kursk region, dealing a significant blow to Ukraine’s military incursion into Russia. What do the UN’s aid figures say? In July, an average of 100 trucks entered each day, largely through the southern Kerem Shalom crossing. This number halved in August, while just 147 trucks have entered so far in September, although the UN added that there may be gaps in the reporting because of the dangers of staff monitoring aid entry at crossing points. How many aid workers have been killed in Israel’s offensive? An estimated 280 humanitarian workers, most employed by Unrwa, have been killed in Gaza, according to the UN’s office of humanitarian affairs.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/13/first-thing-putin-warns-lifting-ukraine-missile-restrictions-put-nato-at-war-with-russia	2024-09-13T02:58:17-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12650a2e2c1ed98298764871750cd41f74958188/0_254_3811_2287/master/3811.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c4c03338c59cd27bbfae5710ad6c48bd

The Minnesota secretary of state’s office began getting requests for fact-checks of these posts, which were flat-out wrong – ballot deadlines had not passed, giving Kamala Harris plenty of time to have her name added to ballots.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/12/twitter-ai-bot-grok-election-misinformation	2024-09-12T03:00:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2682391b20d5d85f592b0d865fe1a5d035186e99/0_51_4893_2936/master/4893.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=85cc3edf172a643591d187c2a11468f7

Russia-Ukraine war live: Russian counter-offensive reported in Kursk	Moscow said it had defeated Ukrainian units in a number of villages but there was no independent confirmation or immediate comment from Ukraine Russian forces have begun a significant counter-offensive against Ukrainian troops in Russia’s Kursk region, according to pro-Moscow war bloggers and a senior Russian commander. Pro-Ukrainian observers also reported heavy fighting in part of the occupied area and the possible Russian recapture of villages. Ukraine’s air force said on Thursday it had shot down 44 out of 64 drones launched by Russia overnight. Russian forces also used five missiles, the air force added in a statement posted on the Telegram messaging app. The Institute for the Study of War said on Thursday morning that it would be -premature to draw conclusions- about the counterattacks at this stage. The thinktank reported: -Russian forces began counterattacks along the western edge of the Ukrainian salient in Kursk oblast and reportedly seized several settlements north-east and south of Korenevo on September 10 and 11.- The ISW continued: -The size, scale, and potential prospects of the September 11 Russian counterattacks in Kursk oblast are unclear and the situation remains fluid as of this report … Ukrainian forces reportedly began new attacks against the Russian counterattack west of Snagost and throughout the Ukrainian salient in Kursk oblast.- Maj Gen Apti Alaudinov, who commands Chechnya’s Akhmat special forces fighting in Kursk, said Russian troops had gone on the offensive and taken back control of about 10 settlements in Kursk. The UK’s foreign secretary, David Lammy, and his US counterpart Antony Blinken have returned to Poland after their visit to Ukraine. The pair took the overnight train from Kyiv and crossed into eastern Poland at 6.30am local time. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, gave his strongest hint yet that the White House is about to lift its restrictions on Ukraine using long-range weapons supplied by the west on key military targets inside Russia. A decision is understood to have already been made in private. Blinken and the British foreign secretary, David Lammy, met with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, in Kyiv on Wednesday. British government sources indicated that a decision had already been made to allow Ukraine to use Storm Shadow cruise missiles on targets inside Russia, although it is not expected to be publicly announced on Friday when Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, meets Joe Biden in Washington DC.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/12/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-counter-offensive-latest-news	2024-09-12T00:45:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b50bf117583c507368285b54be5163a749ce0333/289_0_1973_1184/master/1973.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=abfd9b8a2087c6dd64c9dcab0f10e7f0
Starmer to deliver damning verdict on how Tories left NHS and set out reform vision – UK politics live	The prime minister will deliver a speech this morning after Lord Darzi’s damning report on the NHS Good morning. Keir Starmer has been in office for just over two months, and for much of that time the government has focused on trying to explain to the public just how bad was the legacy the left by the Tories. There has been extensive focus on the economy, and on prisons. Today Starmer is focusing on the NHS. And, arguably, this is the most important issue at all. According to polling by More in Common, at the next election the single issue most likely to determine whether Labour has succeeded or not is whether NHS waiting lists have fallen. The state of the NHS isn’t an accident. The health service was hit by three big shocks. The 2010s saw the biggest slowdown in funding since it was founded in 1948. The next big shock was the top-down reorganisation of the NHS, which threw it into chaos for years. Then came the shock of the Covid pandemic, which hit the NHS harder than other similar countries – largely because of the other two shocks. People have every right to be angry. It’s not just because the NHS is so personal to all of us - it’s because some of these failings are life and death. Take the waiting times in A&amp;E. That’s not just a source of fear and anxiety - it’s leading to avoidable deaths. This government is working at pace to build a 10-year plan. Something so different from anything that has come before. Instead of the top-down approach of the past, this plan is going to have the fingerprints of NHS staff and patients all over it.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/12/keir-starmer-nhs-darzi-report-labour-tories-uk-politics	2024-09-12T00:44:44-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db6d795e2fe283253e125ebe262be8da0f3c8592/0_61_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=70c8d1657a063a83853383ff505f650a

Israel-Gaza war live: UN chief condemns ‘violations’ of humanitarian law after six Unrwa staff killed in Israeli airstrike	António Guterres calls Israeli strike on Gaza school sheltering displaced people ‘unacceptable’, after local authorities report 18 killed in attack Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war. UN chief António Guterres has condemned an Israeli airstrike on a central Gaza school being used as a shelter for displaced Palestinians that killed 18 people, according to the Hamas-run territory’s civil defence agency. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of Unrwa, has said that the staff who died in Wednesday’s attack had been providing support to families who had sought refuge in the school, and that at least 220 of his agency’s staff had been killed in Gaza since the start of the war. Elsewhere on Wednesday, a strike hit a home near the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, killing 11 people, including six brothers and sisters ranging from 21 months to 21 years old, according to the European hospital, which received the casualties. Hamas said on Wednesday that its negotiators had reiterated their readiness to implement an -immediate- ceasefire with Israel in Gaza based on a previous US proposal without new conditions from any party. The group said in a statement that their negotiation team, led by senior official Khalil al-Hayya, had met mediators in Doha to discuss the latest developments in Gaza. CIA director William Burns, who is also the chief US negotiator on Gaza, said on Saturday that a more detailed ceasefire proposal would be made in the next several days. The previous proposal put forward by president Joe Biden in June laid out a three-phase ceasefire in return for the release of Israeli hostages. However lingering issues, including control of the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow stretch of land on Gaza’s border with Egypt, remain. Joe Biden has described the Israel Defense Force’s fatal shooting of the Turkish American protester Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi as -totally unacceptable- in his first extensive comments on her death. In a statement on Wednesday, Biden said that Israel had -acknowledged responsibility- for Eygi’s death, but he stopped short of backing the demands put out by Eygi’s family and other human rights advocates for an independent inquiry into the fatal shooting of the American activist at a protest in the West Bank town of Beita last week.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/12/israel-gaza-war-unrwa-middle-east-hamas-latest-news	2024-09-11T23:17:46-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a381f3fc35c00b987cbc4cd429e55064e4822ac/0_164_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0baa61c40137efac4c38b79dea355f3b

Thursday briefing: How the long-awaited renters’ reform bill could transform housing as we know it	In today’s newsletter: Labour’s new plans aim to shut the door on unscrupulous landlords. But what will change for the millions of people renting? • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. In 2019, Theresa May’s Conservative party pledged to end no-fault evictions (that is, where landlords oust tenants without giving a reason), and introduced the first iteration of the renters’ reform bill. But pressure from lobbyists, interest groups and Tory backbenchers who were themselves landlords led to countless delays and the eventual watering down of the proposals. Charities and advocacy groups expressed concern about the sloth-like progress of the bill, but that did little to hurry the previous government. US election 2024 | Donald Trump’s campaign was in damage control mode on Wednesday amid widespread dismay among supporters over a presidential debate performance that saw Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, repeatedly goad him into going wildly off-message and missing apparent opportunities to tackle her on policy.

Harris was strongest at debate when talking about abortion while Trump relied on tired old lies	Harris spoke passionately about women’s personal experiences post-Roe, as Trump repeated his usual extreme rhetoric Throughout his 2024 campaign for president, Donald Trump has avoided giving straight, consistent or accurate answers to questions about abortion – and in his first debate appearance against Kamala Harris, Trump kept up that streak. Moderators introduced abortion, one of the biggest issues in the election, by asking about the most recent example of Trump’s incoherence on the topic: his position on a Florida ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights into the state’s constitution. Over the last few weeks, Trump initially suggested that he would vote in favor of the measure – which would restore abortion rights in a state that has banned the procedure past six weeks of pregnancy – before quickly backtracking amid outrage from his anti-abortion base.

Europe watches Harris-Trump debate for clues on direction US may take	Diplomats most struck by Republican’s refusal to say whether he wanted Ukraine to defeat Vladimir Putin The TV debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump was as keenly watched by European diplomats and politicians as US voters, eager to see who may be next in the White House and – crucially – the direction a vital ally may next take. One diplomat said they empathised when Harris adopted a series of poses that ranged from pity, bemusement and genuine curiosity about what craziness would emerge from Trump’s mouth next as she listened to his conspiracy-laden theories. However, the diplomat said they still did not underestimate Trump and the hold he had over one part of a divided America, adding: -Never write him off.-	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/11/harris-trump-debate-europe-diplomats-us-ukraine-putin	2024-09-11T04:49:00-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/218ce4917cc917b68492f3a6847a51ae91aada40/0_142_5740_3446/master/5740.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0e2605d7198adcbde795362c3b8c1791

Harris comes out swinging in presidential debate | First Thing	Kamala Harris kept Donald Trump on the defensive as he devolved into bizarre and false tangents about crowd sizes, abortion and immigration. Plus: how to get a better night’s sleep Good morning. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump faced off in a presidential debate in Philadelphia on Tuesday, with Harris landing a number of blows as Trump spouted bizarre falsehoods about abortion and immigration. What were the most memorable moments? After Harris wrapped one remark with a jab about Trump’s crowd sizes, Trump began to ramble – about immigrants eating people’s pets. -In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats,- said Trump. -They’re eating the pets of the people that live there.- ABC moderators interjected to say that the city manager of Springfield, Ohio, told the network there were no credible reports of specific claims of pets being harmed by individuals within the immigrant community. How did the moderators do? ABC’s moderators David Muir and Linsey Daviswere largely praised for factchecking Trump’s falsehoods and rerouting discussions back to the questions. When Trump falsely accused Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, of calling for abortion in the ninth month and -execution after birth-, Davis responded: -There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it’s born.- Another boost for Harris: After the debate concluded, superstar Taylor Swift endorsed Harris on Instagram, signing the post as -childless cat lady- in a jab at misogynistic comments made by the Republican vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/11/first-thing-kamla-harris-comes-out-swinging-in-presidential-debate-donald-trump	2024-09-11T03:12:58-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/084f25597fc1fa122c698721c495516ba33240c2/0_286_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=422b71d618418c4d2094199d10ff04af

Keir Starmer to face PMQs as latest figures show economy stalling over summer – UK politics live	Prime minister faces Rishi Sunak after figures show growth is flatlining Good morning. Keir Starmer faces PMQs later today. It is only his third as prime minister, but there is not much novelty factor left, perhaps because his non-performative, serious, ‘government of service’ focus has been evident for some years. This afternoon he is likely to face more questions about the decision to means-test the winter fuel payment. But growth figures out this morning are also important – not because they reflect badly on the government (Labour was not even in office at the start of July), but because they illustrate the size of the challenge it faces. Starmer and Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, say boosting growth is their top priority. But this morning’s figures show that, in July, there was no growth at all. It was the second month in a row where the economy flatlined. Larry Elliott has the details here.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/11/pmqs-keir-starmer-labour-rishi-sunak-conservatives-latest-uk-politics-live-updates	2024-09-11T00:57:41-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0590d7f31115ef151cf95443f0932d32471b24ba/0_109_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=46b71b86be2f5d042a82202cb2f622e4

The vice-president of the United States walked across the stage at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, stretched out her hand and introduced herself-: -Kamala Harris.- It was, incredibly, the first time Harris had ever met Donald Trump, whose election to the White House in 2016 coincided with her election to the Senate. Since then, they have circled each other, Harris carving out a reputation in the Senate for grilling Trump administration officials. Four years later, she helped defeat Trump as Joe Biden’s running mate.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/11/trump-harris-debate-analysis	2024-09-11T00:00:03-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a36ee4f831fa7704e5383b783f3a08c6a72a71f/0_58_3508_2105/master/3508.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=366c77e8bdee435e00b5df0a22bb193c

Wednesday briefing: Trump takes the bait on night that could transform the presidential race	In today’s newsletter: His advisors wanted him to tie Harris to the Biden administration – but instead he lost his temper. Here are the key moments • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. If you had a sinking feeling on June 28 when you woke up to the news that Joe Biden had turned in an utterly incoherent debate performance, you will probably have a bit more appetite for your boiled egg this time. A few hours ago, the only scheduled debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris came to an end – and even Fox News said Harris won. Democrats’ moods can only have been improved by the news, a few minutes after it ended, that Taylor Swift had endorsed Harris, and signed her post -childless cat lady-. And CNN’s snap poll suggested that voters thought Harris won by a margin of 63% to 37% – nearly as big a margin as Trump achieved over Biden last time around. Key to Harris’ success was baiting her opponent into rants on marginal topics, instead of talking about the issues that voters are interested in. Winter fuel allowance | MPs have voted to remove the winter fuel allowance from all but the poorest pensioners in England and Wales. Just one Labour MP, Jon Trickett, voted for the opposition motion but 52 abstained – at the higher end of predictions.

Trump reels off falsehoods on abortion and immigration in debate with Harris	Presidential candidates meet for first time in fiery face-off as moderators fact-check Trump’s statements Kamala Harris and Donald Trump sparred on Tuesday in a contentious presidential debate that repeatedly went off the rails, as Trump pursued bizarre and often falsehood-ridden tangents about crowd sizes, immigration policy and abortion access.

Harris crossed over to Trump’s podium to shake his hand and introduce herself, an acknowledgement that the two presidential nominees had never met face to face before Tuesday night.

Europeans can opt out, but Australians cannot	Meta’s director of privacy policy declines to say whether such an option would be offered to Australians in the future Meta is using the public Facebook and Instagram photos and posts of its users to train artificial intelligence and, while European users have been allowed to opt out of the mass-scraping of their content, Australian users do not have that option, a parliamentary committee has heard. The parent company of Facebook and Instagram paused the launch of its AI product in Europe in July due to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy rules, and as a result of GDPR law. Meta was ordered to stop training its large language model on data from European users on privacy concerns, and Meta has given European users an opt-out option.

The cost of replacing missiles, artillery and other munitions also significantly exceeds their £171.5m value on the government’s books, because the Ministry of Defence wants to replace the old weapons supplied at current prices.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/sep/11/uk-arms-donated-to-ukraine-would-cost-271bn-to-replace-says-watchdog	2024-09-10T16:00:54-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60dd72361bf2067e051bc32575332be8add50aee/0_116_8070_4842/master/8070.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0676454f96437ff6306d25d6895971b4
Trump-Harris debate live: presidential nominees to face off in high-stakes showdown	Harris and Trump expected to go on attack when debate kicks off at 9pm ET, as polls show one of tightest US election races ever Good evening, US politics blog readers, and thanks for joining us as we cover tonight’s debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, which we expect to be a milestone in what has already been a historically tumultuous presidential race. The two contenders are set to square off for 90 minutes at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, with ABC News hosting and their anchors, David Muir and Linsey Davis, moderating. The Democratic and Republican candidates are meeting as polls indicate a neck-in-neck race between them, particularly in the seven swing states expected to decide the winner. This will be Harris’s first debate against Trump since she became the Democratic standard bearer. Joe Biden and Trump faced off in June, but the president put in such a poor showing that it sparked a plunge in his poll numbers and a Democratic pressure campaign that contributed to his decision to end his bid for a second term. Though Harris has been vice-president since 2021, she has done only one formal interview since launching her presidential campaign, and polls have indicated that voters are looking to find out more about her plans, if elected. This debate could present her with the opportunity to do that – while, for Trump, he’ll be given the chance to make the case for his return to the White House. Will either candidate deliver a knockout blow to the other? Biden certainly received one when he encountered Trump just over two months ago, though he was far from the only candidate to emerge from a debate with their campaign hanging by a thread. Will Trump say something insensitive about Harris’s racial identity? Just days after she launched her campaign, the former president claimed that the vice-president was not really Black, sparking outrage. What will Harris say about her policies? She inherited a campaign from Biden, but has slowly deviated from some of his proposals. Look out for anything she has to say about US support to Israel, and her previous stances toward immigration – a subject Trump is sure to bring up.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/10/harris-trump-presidential-debate-updates	2024-09-10T15:44:31-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dee6de38a9282a6105cc4a04617a2016276d0d3e/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b35e7fbf64d30a0fe9ba02a62582d59b

‘We’ll get the blame’: tensions simmer within Labour over winter fuel cut	While Commons rebellion was small-scale, behind the scenes, anger over handling of the policy is said to run high In the end, the vote to cut the winter fuel allowance passed easily. Hundreds of loyalist Labour MPs tramped through the lobbies to back the government’s controversial plan. No 10 will hope the heat has gone out of the issue.

Family of Ethel Rosenberg say US document proves she was no Soviet spy	Sons whose mother was executed with her husband Julius in 1953 say newly released document proves innocence The family of Ethel Rosenberg, who was sent to the electric chair along with her husband, Julius, in 1953 after being convicted of spying for the Soviets at the height of the Red Scare, have called on Joe Biden to formally exonerate her after a newly released document appeared to show that the US government knew she was not a spy. The couple maintained their innocence until the end and the case of the Rosenbergs has long been seen as a possible miscarriage of justice. Though most historians see Julius Rosenberg as a real Soviet spy, questions about Ethel Rosenberg’s role have lingered and their sons, Robert and Michael Meeropol, have long campaigned in their family’s cause.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/10/ethel-rosenberg-soviet-spy-new-evidence	2024-09-10T11:54:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/feff2c823c1ff9388af862e2dd64f2f92fe7ff5f/0_384_2008_1204/master/2008.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03f0cda00c2c53121770d8bb94c1ba64

Spanish judge shelves landmark case of Franco-era torture victim	Julio Pacheco says he will appeal against the ‘devastating’ decision to abandon the first such investigation in Spain Hopes of securing justice for people tortured under the four-decade Franco dictatorship in Spain have suffered a major setback after a judge in Madrid shelved a landmark investigation into a teenager tortured by police three months before the dictator’s death.

Georgia governor Brian Kemp weighs options on state election board problem	Georgia’s election board has more drama than Kemp would like. Attorney general’s advice isn’t giving him an easy out As Georgia governor Brian Kemp’s wrestles with what to do with a seemingly wayward state board of elections that is drawing national criticism for last-hour changes to the state’s election practices borne of stop-the-steal election activism, the state attorney general declined to make his job any easier. Kemp asked Republican attorney general Chris Carr to render a legal opinion about the governor’s legal obligation to hold a hearing and potentially remove board members, in light of two ethics complaints filed against the board since a raucous hearing in July raised questions about the legality of the board’s actions.

The jobless rate (which fell from 4.2% to 4.1%), the number of people in work, the level of vacancies and the days lost through strikes all convey important information about the state of the economy.	https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/sep/10/uk-wages-figures-state-pension-interest-rates-rachel-reeves	2024-09-10T00:19:41-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb749882a41c28aa74a5cc0101d16bf694cb9045/22_10_5708_3425/master/5708.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=36c8d0a1e0c23e9dfb058b08ff44d02f

On Sunday, the start of the working week, traffic choked the city centre for the first time in nearly two weeks after roads were repaired; street vendors sold peaches and the first of the season’s pomegranates as the city slowly came back to life. But in some places, sewage still flowed through streets dug up by military bulldozers. Many burnt-out buildings showed signs of fierce fighting, the upper floors now peppered with bullet holes and broken windows. Water and electricity infrastructure was severely damaged, and it is not clear when these services will be restored.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/10/jenin-west-bank-normality-idf-israel-deadly-raids	2024-09-09T21:00:38-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5248d890eb52522c284331a36c4bce089aea6e93/0_550_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=230386181c3f9f91148258fa49a29798

DoJ warns states over voter purges – as it happened	Pew report says 49% of voters would choose Harris, with the same number planning to vote for Trump; justice officials remind states about voting laws The statement of support for Kamala Harris by a group of retired top military officials comes a day before the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, and the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, will host a congressional gold medal ceremony honoring the 13 service members killed in the chaotic 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal. Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans have tried to blame Harris for the Afghanistan pullout, including in a report by House GOP lawmakers today. Our investigation reveals the Biden-Harris administration had the information and opportunity to take necessary steps to plan for the inevitable collapse of the Afghan government. At each step of the way, however, the administration picked optics over security. Without involving the Afghan government, he and his administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban that freed 5,000 Taliban fighters and allowed them to return to the battlefield. This chaotic approach severely hindered the Biden-Harris administration’s ability to execute the most orderly withdrawal possible and put our service members and our allies at risk.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/09/trump-harris-presidential-debate-election-latest-updates	2024-09-09T15:59:56-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b37b1f5c23d472eae975f0b6381b9599ea3ae4a7/0_104_4639_2783/master/4639.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=37a29180bf181d8f6a97df5c0f5510b0

Former head of Lebanese central bank in court on embezzlement charges	Protesters who lost savings in financial crisis demonstrated outside court as Riad Salameh pleaded not guilty The former head of Lebanon’s central bank, Riad Salameh, appeared in court on Monday for the first time since he was arrested last week on charges of embezzling up to $42m (£32m) of public funds. Monday’s hearing is the latest in the long saga of Salameh, once vaunted as a financial wizard who earned Lebanon its reputation as the -Switzerland of the Middle East- during his 30-year tenure. He has since fallen into disrepute and is suspected of engineering a country-wide Ponzi scheme that caused Lebanon’s 2019 financial meltdown and its five-year-long economic crisis.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/lebanon-central-bank-riad-salameh-embezzlement-charges	2024-09-09T07:19:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87f3d427bd91edc2619b228673e94d55dd93d03d/0_158_3405_2043/master/3405.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4b1659d1b1ba7ca48a2b0a0f2548093a

Middle East crisis: Israeli strikes on Syria kill at least 25 people, war monitor says – as it happened	Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the dead include civilians as well as soldiers and ‘Syrians working with pro-Iran groups’ The UN human rights chief has said that ending the war in Gaza is a priority and asked countries to act on what he called Israel’s -blatant disregard- for international law in the occupied Palestinian territories. -States must not – cannot – accept blatant disregard for international law, including binding decisions of the (UN) security council and orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), neither in this nor any other situation,- the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Turk, said in a speech at the opening of the UN human rights council in Geneva. The court considers that the violations by Israel of the prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force and of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination have a direct impact on the legality of the continued presence of Israel, as an occupying power, in the occupied Palestinian territory. The sustained abuse by Israel of its position as an occupying power, through annexation and an assertion of permanent control over the occupied Palestinian territory and continued frustration of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, violates fundamental principles of international law and renders Israel’s presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful. Forcible evictions, extensive house demolitions and restrictions on residence and movement. The transfer by Israel of settlers to the West Bank and East Jerusalem and maintenance of their presence. Its failure to prevent or to punish attacks by settlers. Restricting the access of the Palestinian population to water. Israel’s use of the natural resources in the occupied Palestinian territory. The extension of Israel’s law to the West Bank and East Jerusalem.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/09/middle-east-crisis-seven-killed-in-israeli-airstrike-on-iran-linked-military-site-in-syria-says-war-monitor	2024-09-09T07:01:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd28d950d57c091f8974d93ab34a4a7908bbbac9/0_460_7265_4359/master/7265.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=169e54cfaa6f5ef5fce0d1b5f067b3c6

Weather tracker: Francine looking likely to be next Atlantic hurricane	An area of low pressure in the Gulf of Mexico is moving landward, and is expected to bring intense rainfall Francine could soon be the next to be ticked off the list of Atlantic hurricane storm names this week. On Friday, a broad area of low pressure emerged in the Gulf of Mexico, designated as Invest 91L. An -invest- – a shorthand for -investigative area- – refers to a region of atmospheric disturbance, characterised by low pressure and thunderstorms, and is closely monitored for its potential to evolve into a tropical cyclone. Invest 91L is anticipated to encounter more favourable environmental conditions as it progresses northward over the coming days, meandering along the eastern coasts of Mexico and Texas. The National Hurricane Center has now labelled this as a potential tropical cyclone, and it is expected to reach hurricane status before reaching the Gulf coast of the US. It advises that hurricane and storm surge watches will probably be issued on Monday for coastal parts of Texas and Louisiana, with the impacts expected to be felt from Tuesday night.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/weather-tracker-francine-likely-atlantic-hurricane	2024-09-09T01:29:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24cc1827e84491c0c221ac628bc03071cdb1fd63/0_52_3168_1900/master/3168.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1a9b1687edb0a93e205a820382e25175
