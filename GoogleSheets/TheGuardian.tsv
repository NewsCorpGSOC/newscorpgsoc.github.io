Elon Musk’s ‘election integrity community’ on X is full of baseless claims	Feed is rife with posts of individuals deemed suspicious and calls for doxxing with little evidence provided of fault While Elon Musk faces his own election integrity questions offline, the X owner has deputized his followers to spot and report any -potential instances of voter fraud and irregularities-. The community he spawned is rife with unfounded claims passed off as evidence of voter fraud. Musk opted not to show up to a required court appearance Thursday in Philadelphia to respond to a lawsuit challenging his political action committee’s daily $1m voter giveaway. Meanwhile, online, he has started a dedicated community space on X, formerly Twitter, where he’s asked users to share any issues they see while voting. Users posting on the self-contained feed, the -election integrity community-, quickly began pointing out what they deemed as evidence of fraud and election interference. Tweets showing everything from ballots that arrived ripped, an ABC news system test, a postal worker doing his job and dropping off mail-in ballots were all presented as evidence that the upcoming presidential election had been compromised. Some users posted videos of individuals they deemed suspicious, despite providing little or no proof of suspicious activity and asked others in the community to help identify them.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/31/elon-musk-election-integrity-community-misinformation-disinformation	2024-10-31T14:40:02-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0effe181ba26d6ce70eeafbabea59db65d07f965/110_575_5709_3426/master/5709.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f9f3af8ed4a5f125fd135ebd87407729

Harris hails first-time and gen Z voters at Wisconsin rally | First Thing	Artists including Remi Wolf, Gracie Abrams and Mumford &amp; Sons join VP. Plus, new era for erotic lit Good morning. Kamala Harris said time was running out at a get-out-the-vote event yesterday in Madison, Wisconsin, where she was joined by a lineup of folk and pop musicians including Remi Wolf, Gracie Abrams and Mumford &amp; Sons. -We have six days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime,- the vice-president and Democratic nominee told the crowd. Harris responds to protesters. In two different sections of the crowd, protesters drew attention to Israel’s war in Gaza, shouting -free Palestine- and unfurling banners. Harris said: -We all want the war in Gaza to end and get the hostages out as soon as possible, and I will do everything in my power to make it heard and known.- Harris’s slow-mo breakup with president. The delicate dance by Harris’s campaign, simultaneously showing deference to Joe Biden while separating herself from his presidency and thwarting his ambition to campaign for her, has reached a critical juncture. What do legal experts say about the giveaway? Those interviewed by Reuters last week were divided on whether it violated federal laws that make it a crime to pay, or offer to pay, a person to register to vote.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/31/first-thing-harris-hails-first-time-and-gen-z-voters-at-wisconsin-rally	2024-10-31T05:47:28-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57b59cc7b104dcd973c81d6a57b0d73b4a63df2e/0_396_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=30e6cd68ef53d67b74412789a6f72d1d
Sweden abolishes tax on plastic bags despite warnings usage could rise	Levy that reduced usage by more than three-quarters in four years fell victim to rightwing culture wars, say critics A tax that has reduced plastic bag consumption in Sweden by more than three-quarters in four years is being abolished on Friday, despite warnings that the move could lead to usage rising back towards previous levels. Since the introduction of the 3 kroner (£0.21) tax in May 2020, plastic bag usage in the country has slumped. In 2019, before the levy was introduced, people in Sweden used an average of 74 plastic bags (15-50 micrometres thick) per person each year each. In 2023 that number had dropped to 17.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/31/sweden-abolishes-tax-on-plastic-bags-warnings-usage-could-rise	2024-10-31T05:01:47-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6786171c5a57acf224123d93cd9deb3c84f56e1/0_0_6402_3844/master/6402.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40d81f739c088fff55fd75a573218fa4

Business leaders keep quiet on Trump – what are they saying in private?	Experts say top chief executives are treading a fine line to avoid any backlash in the event of a Trump victory After the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, America’s business leaders came out strongly in their criticism of Donald Trump. Now – as the Harris campaign brands Trump a -fascist- and Trump threatens retribution against -the enemy within- – there appears to be a conspiracy of silence. In fact, as the nation heads to the polls in an election that is too close to call, some of America’s most powerful chief executive appear to be cozying up to Trump again.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/31/business-leaders-trump-election	2024-10-31T04:00:16-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f0d030cefd009ab55262db0d05566641ed21dbe/0_34_4465_2679/master/4465.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d373609087801ac4845e7c815fd42930
US election live updates: Trump and Harris head west with six days to go	Data shows almost 60 million Americans have already voted in the election Good morning. It is less than a week before polls close at the 2024 U.S. election and more than 57.5 million Americans have already checked their ballots, according to the Election Lab at the University of Florida. Presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are still hot on the campaign trail in a fiercely contested race that is too close to call. Harris spoke in Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania state capital, one of few counties that voted for Joe Biden in 2020. Polls show a tied race in Pennsylvania. Arnold Schwarzenegger has announced that he is backing Harris in next week’s election. Schwarzenegger, 77, said that while he doesn’t -really do endorsements-, he felt compelled to formally endorse Harris and her pick for vice-president, Tim Walz. Trump refused to apologise for the comments made about Puerto Rico at his Madison Square Garden rally. -He’s a comedian, what can I tell you? I know nothing about him. I don’t know why he’s there.- A Pennsylvania judge on Wednesday sided with Trump’s campaign and agreed to extend an in-person voting option in suburban Philadelphia, where long lines on the final day led to complaints voters were being disfranchised by an unprepared election office. A majority of voters in swing states do not believe Trump will accept defeat if he loses next week’s presidential election and fear that his supporters will turn to violence in an attempt to install him in power, a new poll suggests.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/31/donald-trump-kamala-harris-us-election-latest-updates-live	2024-10-31T03:40:01-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b7b2ee4205458f88898432c673e29191a78d591/0_193_5725_3436/master/5725.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0e39cd51be229b718a71cccedfbd9925

Rachel Reeves accepts budget tax rises may impact wage increases – UK politics live	Chancellor has been appearing on TV and radio defending her budget Good morning. The day after budget day is normally when the most thorough and considered budget analysis starts to emerge, and rarely has there been more to chew over than there was in Rachel Reeves’s first budget as chancellor – a mamoth, £40bn-tax-raising fiscal reset with huge consequences for Britain for the rest of the decade. Reeves and her Tory shadow, Jeremy Hunt, are doing full media rounds this morning, and the leading budget thinktanks are publishing full studies of what was announced yesterday. In an interview with BBC Breakfast, Reeves accepted that people would get lower pay rises as a result of her decision to increase employers’ national insurance. She said: I said that [the national insurance increase] will have consequences. It will mean that businesses will have to absorb some of this through profits and it is likely to mean that wage increases might be slightly less than they otherwise would have been.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/31/rachel-reeves-autumn-budget-labour-tax-rises-uk-politics-latest	2024-10-31T01:09:23-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f56e0bb82e68b5fabd08840adb8c294c8cf1d2d8/0_94_2786_1671/master/2786.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4b0f0af4e19441432bbd07e2031f574b

Thursday briefing: What you need to know about Rachel Reeves’s plans for the economy	In today’s newsletter: They spent weeks bracing the country for ‘tough decisions’, but in Labour’s first budget in 14 years, the chancellor adopted a slightly more optimistic tone • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. It was Labour’s first budget in 14 years; it was the first budget ever to be delivered by a female chancellor; and, as a share of GDP, it takes taxes to their highest level since comparable records began. As heavily trailed as Rachel Reeves’s appearance at the dispatch box yesterday was, it was still a monumental political moment, and one that is likely to set the course of the country for many years to come. After weeks of paving the way for a rough budget by blaming her Conservative predecessors for the economic legacy she inherited, Reeves largely struck a more optimistic tone in her delivery. And, by some measures, she has successfully charted a course that will increase growth and balance the books without increasing the burden on those endlessly-discussed -working people- as heavily as had been expected. UK news | Keir Starmer has warned Tory leadership contenders Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch against undermining the police investigation into the Southport attack. Jenrick said information about the attack was -concealed-, while Badenoch said that the government and police -have questions to answer-.

Peter Dutton’s office asked Gina Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting for flight on private jet	Opposition leader, who says Anthony Albanese is ‘obfuscating’ in his answers on Qantas upgrades, says he never personally asked mining magnate Peter Dutton has admitted his office asked the mining billionaire Gina Rinehart’s company for a lift on a Hancock Prospecting jet to a Bali bombing memorial service, days after he said he had never personally asked Australia’s richest person for help with flights around Australia. The opposition leader said his office’s request to Hancock came after he claimed the government would not help him get a flight on a special purpose flight, that commercial options were not available, and that a chartered jet would be too expensive. The admission came as Dutton again ridiculed Anthony Albanese for his explanations over the widening Qantas upgrades scandal, accusing the prime minister of being -dishonest-.

Australia news live: Greens offer unlimited mental health sessions on Medicare; report finds schools too close to main roads	Under proposal, Greens would remove cap of 10 subsidised mental health sessions a year after it was halved from 20 in late 2022. Follow the day’s news live Up to 55% of schools and childcare centres are unsafely close to main roads in some Australian suburbs, exposing children to deadly car pollution, according to a new report. A Climate Council report, released today, finds that about one in six schools and childcare centres across our capital cities are located within 100 metres of a busy road. That equates to more than 2,300 childcare centres and 827 schools. Let’s give more people in our cities better travel options, so it’s easier for more people to use shared and active means of getting around our cities - like walking, riding a bike, or taking public transport - more often.

The decision to freeze fuel duty and keep the 5p cut made by the Conservatives in 2022 is attracting some fury, not least because the tax relief is estimated to have raised UK greenhouse gas emissions by 7% since 2010.

Spain’s deadly floods and severe droughts are two faces of the climate change coin	Scientists say violent weather battering the Mediterranean is a harbinger of what the rest of Europe can soon expect Residents of Chiva, a small town on the outskirts of Valencia, can expect a grim future of worsening drought as the planet heats up and the country dries out.

The torrential rains that flooded southern and eastern Spain last night, ripping away bridges and tearing through towns, have killed 64 people and counting.

First Thing: Kamala Harris calls for a ‘new generation of leadership’	VP delivers speech from site of Trump’s speech before deadly January 6 attack. Plus, a lost Maya city is found Good morning. With the White House illuminated behind her, Kamala Harris asked the vanishing slice of undecided Americans to elect a -new generation of leadership-, likening Donald Trump to a -petty tyrant- who had stood in the very same spot nearly four years ago and, in a last-gasp effort to cling to power, helped incite the mob that stormed the US Capitol. What was the focus of Harris’s speech? The Democratic nominee’s big speech mentioned Trump by name 24 times and Joe Biden only once. It confirmed that, even when Trump is not commander-in-chief, he still commands the American psyche. Sorry, who did you mean to condemn? Responding to the Trump rally opener calling Puerto Rico an -island of garbage-, Joe Biden got into hot water himself: -The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters’ … his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.- The president later clarified that he was condemning the demonization of Latinos, not calling Trump supporters garbage. The Trump rally on Sunday in New York opened with a series of racist remarks about Puerto Rico, Latinos, Jews and Palestinians. Why did South Carolina pause executions for 13 years?

Push for black and Asian soldiers’ input in world wars to be taught in UK schools	Exclusive: Awareness of contribution of black and Asian soldiers could help tackle racism, say leading minority ethnic voices Politicians and community leaders are calling for the history of black and Asian soldiers who fought for Britain in the world wars to be taught more widely in schools to help tackle ignorance, racism and anti-Muslim prejudice. Speaking on the 110th anniversary of the first Muslim to be awarded the Victoria Cross, leading minority ethnic voices have said that raising awareness of black and Asian service men and women could help tackle racism and anti-Muslim prejudice after this summer’s riots.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/push-black-asian-soldiers-input-world-wars-taught-uk-schools	2024-10-30T04:38:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9985fcdc9415f0b6508bf1056f80ffbcb1806bad/0_991_2423_1452/master/2423.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8aef5ad5a1e50164ac00dc9ea197a5d3
‘Frightening to consider’: fears grow over Trump’s threats to political foes	Critics alarmed by talk of revenge against Democrats and say second Trump term would pose unprecedented danger Donald Trump’s extremist attacks on top Democrats as -the enemy from within- and talk of deploying the military against political foes if he wins the election are stark signs Trump will endanger the rule of law in America, say former US justice department officials and scholars. Trump’s threats – singling out ex-speaker Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff and others as -the enemy from within- and -more dangerous than China [and] Russia- – jibe with his earlier incendiary talk of using a return to the White House to seek -revenge- against political foes led by Joe Biden. He also suggested the military could be used to quell violence at the polls from -radical left lunatics-. Don’t miss important US election coverage.

Trump’s mass deportation plan would be ‘economic disaster’ for US	Loss of migrant workers would trigger productivity losses and a new round of inflationary pricing pressure If elected, Donald Trump plans to carry out -the largest deportation operation in American history-. After pushback on Joe Biden’s border policies, Kamala Harris has embraced border restrictions and the need to maintain limits on asylum seekers. But neither candidate captures the realities of US immigration. US consumers are accustomed to cheap goods and services, and the economic rationale for large-scale immigration has been largely avoided. In a country that relies on a mobile, low-cost workforce, the loss of migrant workers would trigger productivity losses and a new round of inflationary pricing pressure.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/30/trump-deportation-plan-economic-disaster	2024-10-30T04:00:07-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/317d97f04b9bac3d630dd0deaacb0b74634a0161/0_213_7197_4318/master/7197.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6fe23bc5f38e32788d74c3aaa9cd3d7a

Autumn budget live: major tax rises expected as Rachel Reeves prepares to set out first Labour budget in 15 years	The chancellor will deliver the budget at around 12.30pm GMT, just after PMQs Good morning. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, will today seek to reset the trajectory of public spending and taxation for the rest of this parliament – perhaps for a decade, based on Labour’s pre-election rhetoric – with what is set to be the biggest tax-raising budget in history, at least in cash terms. Larry Elliott and Pippa Crerar preview it here, in our overnight story. In recent years budgets have become two-week news events, with many of the main measures being covertly, or overtly, announced in advanced by the Treasury, instead of being unbundled as a surprise in the hour-long Commons statements. This year that has been happening even more than usual, to the extent that government insiders are saying that there will be no surprises in speech this afternoon. That means that she won’t use her last two minutes to unveil an out-of-the-blue tax cut or spending bonanza destined to grab the news headlines; it doesn’t mean that there won’t be plenty of interesting news in the budget, and things we did not know. With most of the big announcements, we have a broad indication of what’s coming, but not the detail. My belief in Britain burns brighter than ever. And the prize on offer to today is immense. More pounds in people’s pockets. An NHS that is there when you need it. An economy that is growing, creating wealth and opportunity for all. Because that is the only way to improve living standards. [Reeves] will make clear that this budget rejects austerity, instead prioritising economic stability, investment and reform. The budget will ensure funding to cut hospital waiting lists, unlock affordable homes and new investment to rebuild schools. Meanwhile, working people won’t face higher taxes in their payslips in line with the manifesto commitment not to increase taxes on income tax, VAT or employee national insurance. The chancellor will reflect on the tough decisions she has had to make to restore economic stability, on spending and welfare by cracking down on fraud, tax avoidance and waste, and making sure every penny of taxpayer money is spent wisely.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/30/autumn-budget-2024-tax-rachel-reeves-labour	2024-10-30T01:34:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a90fa952722012b5f887c3b1e68bc9754de9e40/134_180_771_463/master/771.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cc91b48d8c820da24daa903fca3c6473

Middle East crisis live: Israeli airstrikes and tank advances reported in Lebanon	Israel hits towns of Sarafand and Haret Saida, says Lebanese health ministry; ‘large number’ of tanks cross Israeli border, local media reports Israeli tanks entered the outskirts of the Lebanese village of Khiam in their deepest incursion yet into southern Lebanon in their ground operation, Lebanese media reported, while the health ministry said at least 14 people were killed in Israeli strikes on the south. The official National News Agency on Tuesday reported the entry of a -large number- of Israeli tanks into the eastern outskirts of the town of Khiam, about 6km from the border with Israel. At least 93 Palestinians were killed or missing and dozens injured in an Israeli strike on a crowded block of flats in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya, the Gaza health ministry said on Tuesday. The US state department called the incident -horrifying-. Medics said at least 20 children were among the dead. -A number of victims are still under the rubble and on the roads, and ambulance and civil defence crews cannot reach them,- the health ministry said. Israel is not addressing the -catastrophic humanitarian crisis- in Gaza, the US envoy to the United Nations told the UN security council. Linda Thomas-Greenfield’s remarks on Tuesday came as a Washington-imposed deadline looms for Israel to improve the situation on the ground in Gaza or face potential restrictions on US military aid. Four Israeli soldiers were killed in combat in northern Gaza, with one officer severely injured, the Israeli military said. Separately, the military said another soldier died from wounds sustained in battle in southern Lebanon, bringing the total number of Israeli soldiers killed since October last year to 777. The UN said that if Israel put in place new laws cutting ties with the UN Palestinian relief agency Unrwa, the Israeli government would have to meet their needs under international law. Secretary general António Guterres said Unrwa would be prevented from doing work mandated by the UN general assembly if Israel implemented the laws, and called on it -to act consistently with its obligations-. He wrote in a letter to Benjamin Netanyahu about the -devastating impact- on Palestinians in the occupied territories if the legislation was implemented, the UN chief’s spokesperson said. The World Health Organization head, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the Israeli parliament’s decision was -intolerable- and would have -devastating consequences-. Norway said it would seek clarification from the international court of justice over Israel’s aid obligations after the Israeli vote on Unrwa. The Israeli UN ambassador said Israel would facilitate humanitarian aid in Gaza but asserted that -Unrwa has failed in its mandate and is no longer the right agency for this job-. Two senior advisers to the US president, Joe Biden, will arrive in Israel on Thursday to try to close a deal that would end the war in Lebanon, Axios reported on Tuesday, citing three unidentified sources. The US news website quoted Israeli and US officials as saying the deal to end Israel-Hezbollah fighting could be achieved within a few weeks. At least 43,061 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and 101,223 injured in Israeli airstrikes since last October, according to the latest figures from the territory’s health ministry on Tuesday. The UN’s World Food Programme called for immediate action to avert famine in northern Gaza. It said north Gaza -continues to deteriorate, the likelihood of a larger group being impacted by famine will surely increase-. In Gaza’s two northern governorates, where about 300,000 people remain trapped, famine was expected to arrive between now and May.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/30/middle-east-israel-gaza-lebanon-hamas-hezbollah	2024-10-30T00:31:36-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec41fe72f48e71a79f02e3bc3ce85c3093bf8c1e/0_50_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eead8b49bdbe6c95e5d492a59538b40a

Wednesday briefing: Five key messages that will define the budget	In today’s newsletter: Labour has told two stories about Rachel Reeves’ budget. Will it be an end to austerity – or an acceptance of -the harsh light of fiscal reality-? • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. There will be no triumphalism, no big giveaways and certainly no rabbits out of hats: this, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have been at pains to tell us, is going to be a very grownup budget. And even though Reeves will promise today that -the prize on offer is immense-, we might also therefore expect it to be a painful one. Since the entire thing appears to have been briefed out in advance over the last few weeks, nobody can say they haven’t been warned. In a way, it feels like two budgets: the optimism and ambition of a minimum wage rise, a major boost for the NHS, and significant new investment in infrastructure; and a bleaker story about misleading pledges, limited ambitions, and the biggest set of tax increases in budget history. UK news | The suspect charged with the murder of three girls in Southport is to be separately prosecuted on suspicion of possessing terrorist material and producing ricin, a powerful poison, police have said. Axel Rudakubana is due to appear in court on Wednesday. US election | Kamala Harris urged American voters to elect a -new generation of leadership- in a speech at the same place Donald Trump spoke on January 6 almost four years ago. Likening her opponent to a -petty tyrant-, Harris told the crowd: -Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list … I will walk in with a to-do list.- Middle East | Israel is not addressing the -catastrophic humanitarian crisis- in Gaza, the US envoy to the UN has said, ahead of a deadline for the Israelis to improve the situation or face potential restrictions on US military aid. The warning came as Gaza’s civil defence agency said 93 people had been killed in an airstrike on a crowded block of flats. Conservatives | Britain’s former colonies should be thankful for the legacy of empire, Conservative leadership candidate Robert Jenrick has said. Jenrick’s comments, which follow an agreement among Commonwealth leaders that -the time has come- to discuss reparations, were condemned as -an obnoxious distortion of history-. Mexico | A team of researchers have stumbled on a lost Maya city of temple pyramids, enclosed plazas and a reservoir, all hidden for centuries by the Mexican jungle. The discovery was made possible by the use of laser mapping techniques in an area previously ignored by archaeologists.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/30/wednesday-briefing-five-key-messages-that-will-define-the-budget	2024-10-29T23:52:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a90fa952722012b5f887c3b1e68bc9754de9e40/0_46_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=300f7cf7d413225d4079658a8d5cd135

Mystery artist leaves neo-Nazi tiki torch ‘tribute’ to Trump near White House	Unknown artist who made bronze piece of feces to ‘honor’ January 6 rioters appears to be behind new statue The unknown artist or artists who fashioned a swirled bronze piece of feces on a replica of former US house speaker Nancy Pelosi’s desk – and placed it on the National Mall recently – appear to have struck again. This time, the artistic-political commentary is focused not on the January 6 2021 US Capitol attack carried out by Donald Trump supporters, when a participant did indeed defecate on Pelosi’s desk. Instead, the display satirically evokes the notorious white nationalist Unite the Right Tiki torch parade through Charlottesville’s University of Virginia campus in August 2017, with some marchers chanting -Jews will not replace us-.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/29/neo-nazi-tiki-torch-statue	2024-10-29T10:16:36-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b64749552f4d6baee13ce47442351d081268ebf/0_82_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ae05506c8ec1f41fe4aba5703a44fc3c

Nine days of horror as Israel steps up offensive on exhausted northern Gaza	With families too worn out to flee yet again, the death toll in recent strikes is nearing 300 Israel’s recent offensive in northern Gaza has claimed more than 700 lives in a little over three weeks, with nearly 300 deaths, mainly in the north, in the past nine days alone. While it has attempted to justify its renewed focus on the north by claiming it is targeting regrouped Hamas fighters, the intensity of the fighting has caused heavy losses on the 100,000 civilians still living there. Many of them are families, exhausted by Israel’s multiple forced displacement orders, who have chosen to stay in the north. The Israeli military has repeatedly struck shelters for displaced people across Gaza, saying it is carrying out precise strikes targeting Palestinian militants and has tried to avoid harming civilians. The strikes have often killed women and children.

Private schools can mitigate VAT on fees ‘if they’re the good charities they say they are’, minister says – UK politics live	Wes Streeting says private schools have hiked fees above inflation for over a decade and can prevent pupils leaving if they really are charitable Health secretary Wes Streeting has claimed that the government is already -ramping up- a promised additional 40,000 weekly NHS appointments in England, though he said due to data lag he could not provide precise figures. Speaking on LBC radio, Streeting said it would be a hard winter ahead for the NHS, but that tomorrow’s budget was putting a level of funding in place to arrest a decline in the health service. I will come back on your programme to mark one year of a Labour government and tell you how many more appointments have been delivered in the first year of a Labour government compared to the previous year of Conservative government. And therefore I will be able to confidently tell you that we will have honoured our promise to deliver 40,000 more appointments a week well within the first year of a Labour government. That was the promise we made. It is a promise we will keep. I can’t pretend that there’s a magic wand that I can wave so that no one will be waiting on a trolley in the corridor this winter. And nor am I going to say that is any more acceptable under a Labour government than it was under a Conservative government. I would just say to independent schools, you have hiked your fees up with inflation-busting increases year after year after year since 2010 and now you’re pleading poverty. If you are worried about whether children in your schools will continue to access your schools, you’ll have to cut your cloth in the way that state schools have had to. They have hiked up their fees with inflation-busting increases for well over a decade, and they can, I’m sure, take steps to mitigate against children being forced to drop out if if they’re the good charities they say they are.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/29/autumn-budget-labour-conservatives-keir-starmer-rachel-reeves	2024-10-29T02:03:26-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66df3442af71d38a0a7aefd5f581b8f5cb4bba1e/0_317_7177_4306/master/7177.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=36abfe9baed8fbf05980a384d0b8ccb4
Kamala Harris to urge voters to ‘turn the page’ on era of Trump	Vice-president to strike hopeful tone in remarks delivered from site of Trump’s speech before deadly January 6 attack With the presidential race deadlocked a week before election day, Kamala Harris will call on voters to -turn the page- on the Trump era, in remarks delivered from a park near the White House where the former president spoke before a mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol in a last effort to overturn his 2020 loss. The Harris campaign has described the remarks as a major address that will underline the vice-president’s closing message, in a location she hopes will remind voters precisely why the electorate denied Trump a second term four years ago. She is expected to cast Trump as a divisive figure who will spend his term consumed by vengeance, leveraging the power of the presidency against his political enemies rather than in service of the American people.

If Trump wins the election, Nato can expect more turbulence ahead	Past threats former president – and present Russian ones – have spurred Europe to invest in self-defence, but as conflicts rise the alliance still looks vital Politeness and convention dictate that European leaders try to sound noncommittal when asked whether a Donald Trump presidency would hurt Nato. But despite the rhetoric about -Trump-proofing-, Nato cohesion will be at risk from a hostile or isolationist Republican president, who has previously threatened to leave the alliance if European defence spending did not increase. -The truth is that the US is Nato and Nato is the US; the dependence on America is essentially as big as ever,- said Jamie Shea, a former Nato official who teaches at the University of Exeter. -Take the new Nato command centre to coordinate assistance for Ukraine in Wiesbaden, Germany.

Tuesday briefing: Some Democrats are grimly convinced that Trump is going to win. What does the evidence show?	In today’s newsletter: The polls are neck and neck. So why are some Kamala Harris supporters convinced the Republicans have the election in the bag? • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. With a week to go until America votes, the polls consistently show Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in a statistical dead heat. The nerds who simulate the race hundreds of times to model the likelihood of each result are consistently finding extraordinarily even chances between the two. And nothing that happens – not assassination attempts, Kamalamentum, convention speeches, running mate selections, celebrity endorsements, multi-million-dollar political ads, the debate, erratic rally performances, or plausible accusations of fascist tendencies – seems to change anything for more than a minute. The election, in summary, looks too close to call. Budget | The government is expected to announce an increase of about 4% to NHS funding, an increase that could translate to about £7bn for the health budget in England. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said that the money would deliver more surgical hubs and radiotherapy machines in a drive to add 40,000 appointments each week. Middle East | Israel’s parliament has voted to ban the UN relief and works agency (Unrwa) from the country within 90 days. Alongside a decision to declare Unrwa a terror group, the move is expected to lead to the closure of Unrwa’s East Jerusalem headquarters and would effectively block the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza via Rafah. Crime | The far-right activist Tommy Robinson has been jailed for 18 months for contempt of court for repeating false allegations against a Syrian refugee, in breach of an injunction. Robinson had repeated his false claim that Jamal Hijazi, who had been filmed being attacked at a school in West Yorkshire, -violently attacks young English girls- despite losing a libel case. Justice | Prisoners serving controversial indeterminate sentences were given minimum terms of less than six months but have remained in jail for at least 16 years, newly released data shows. Wildlife | Hedgehogs are now listed as -near threatened- on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s red list, after a decline in numbers of at least 30% over the past decade across much of their range.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/tuesday-briefing-some-democrats-are-grimly-convinced-that-trump-is-going-to-win-what-does-the-evidence-show	2024-10-28T23:51:49-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/768255fc6bbd8f3c926798ee13d11e155138a043/0_341_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2ea226dfe4ba9953f183a4126a05120f

It stressed tough pandemic response measures like lockdowns and movement restrictions are unlikely to be accepted by Australians again.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/29/covid-inquiry-albanese-government-report-findings	2024-10-28T20:00:54-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbcc3caf1ae823cdebd48356350b0666f011ceea/0_310_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=36032b64cb00f04bd1afd2c878ebfae5

Therapy-speak and 80s hairstyles: will Harris’s Brené Brown sit-down swing white female voters?	The Democrat’s cozy chat with the vulnerability expert was largely apolitical – which could play well with a key demographic In the quest to win over white female voters – 53% of whom showed up for Donald Trump in 2020 – Kamala Harris made her case on a podcast hosted by one of their beloved avatars, the vulnerability researcher Brené Brown. The episode, released on Monday, was a mostly fluffy discussion about leadership, trauma and the notion of voting as agency in an uncontrollable news cycle. Brown, a University of Houston professor and bestselling author who has spent two decades studying social sciences, became an overnight celebrity after giving a 2010 Ted Talk called -the power of vulnerability-. One could argue the talk, which birthed Brown’s Oprah-approved speaking empire, also spawned our culture’s current obsession with therapy-speak.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/28/kamala-harris-brene-brown-interview	2024-10-28T12:48:16-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c6b881abca741c6a410b4c046d0bf6f175d1a06/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=10a3e4e0f41f9b871fb6b2e8dc87396c

Starmer to set out ‘harsh’ reality of fiscal situation in speech – UK politics live	Prime minister will say government will ignore ‘populist chorus of easy answers’ as it is set to raise taxes and rewrite fiscal rules in this week’s budget Cabinet minister Pat McFadden has said there are -real reasons- to have optimism as the country approaches the first Labour budget for 14 years later this week. He stated that the government had -inherited a plan to decline, to reduce, investment- from Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government, and that the measures Labour were taking in the budget were -tough decisions- but the start of a turnaround. I think people should look for three things in the budget. Will it stabilize the country’s public finances and do so in a way that keeps our promises? It will Will it also start to turn around the public services and the NHS in particular. We will start that road with a combination of both investment and reform. This is not 1997, when the economy was decent but public services were on their knees. And it’s not 2010, where public services were strong, but the public finances were weak. These are unprecedented circumstances. And that’s before we even get to the long-term challenges ignored for 14 years: an economy riddled with weakness on productivity and investment, a state that needs urgent modernisation to face down the challenge of a volatile world. The Conservatives have raised the tax burden to a 70-year high. We will ensure taxes on working people are kept as low as possible. Labour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of income Tax, or VAT.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/28/keir-starmer-budget-harsh-light-fiscal-reality-uk-politics-live	2024-10-28T02:01:33-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71ec316594f542bce47db67efad8890907accb41/1138_0_1932_1159/master/1932.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a0b2f2f17585e73ff7cd41fe493bfc16

Middle East crisis live: Iranian military chief warns Israel of ‘bitter consequences’ over weekend’s airstrikes	Comments from commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps come as country mulls response to attacks Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing coverage of the Middle East crisis amid Israel’s ongoing wars on Lebanon and Gaza. The top commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has warned Israel it would face -bitter consequences- after its attack on Iranian military sites early on Saturday, according to local media reports. Israel’s parliament – the Knesset – is expected to vote on Monday on a pair of bills that, if passed, will make it impossible for the UN relief and works agency for Palestinians (Unrwa) to operate in Gaza and the West Bank. One of the bills seeks to ban Unrwa from operating within Israel’s sovereign territory, stating that the agency -shall not establish any representation, provide any services or conduct any activities within the territory of Israel-. This would lead to closure of the Unrwa headquarters in East Jerusalem and end visas for Unrwa staff. The measures look to have a cross-party majority of about 100 of the 120 members, despite widespread opposition from other countries, including most of Israel’s allies. At least three people were killed and two others injured by Israeli attacks on the Raml neighbourhood in the Lebanese city of Tyre, according to the country’s national news agency.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/28/israel-iran-gaza-lebanon-unrwa-middle-east-crisis-news	2024-10-28T00:47:30-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65650d9fef0c612592bb8d519482cd75fba18d3b/0_211_3185_1912/master/3185.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9aac3362c72b72728b3830a25183bcbc

Washington Post stirs up fury in liberal America over neutral election stance	Failure to endorse any US presidential candidate for first time in decades ‘undermines’ paper’s independence, say critics Widespread fury and shock ripped through liberal America over the weekend after news that the Washington Post, home of the Watergate scandal exposé, the paper that ran the Pentagon Papers, will not now endorse Kamala Harris for president. But angry responses were quickly replaced by two pressing questions: how did it happen, and how could readers best protest?

Rachel Reeves has promised not to raise taxes, so how can she fill budget coffers?	Chancellor said to be planning measures including raising employer NI contributions and capital gains tax rates. We consider the likelihood of each and the potential for a row During the general election campaign, Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal studies repeatedly accused both main parties of indulging in a -conspiracy of silence- over their economic policies. Neither Labour nor the Tories would admit, he complained, that if they won they would have to announce huge tax rises or spending cuts to restore the public finances to anything resembling good health. On Wednesday, 118 days after Labour won the election, Rachel Reeves will prove Johnson right. In her first budget she will spell out plans to raise an eye-watering sum of about £40bn from tax rises and spending reductions to wipe the slate clean and to pump funds into public services. She will also confirm changes to debt rules that will release up to £50bn more to borrow for long-term investment in new national infrastructure.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/26/rachel-reeves-has-promised-not-to-raise-taxes-so-how-can-she-fill-budget-coffers	2024-10-26T11:06:01-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80b33b2ba8c5c52d788e0cedcd34a6f37e31fbfe/268_259_1454_872/master/1454.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cc58632d237536dc1b97524632e53312

Iran-Israel’s shadow war is out in the open and will only escalate unless causes addressed	Now face-to-face military confrontation on each other’s soil has been normalised For years, Israel and Iran have waged a -shadow war-, attacking each other indirectly using proxy forces, assassinations, informants, spies and hybrid, non-military covert means. Now this undeclared, largely silent war is undisguisedly out in the open. It’s become a shooting war, it’s noisy, it’s escalating, and there’s no end in sight. This is not to say Israel’s large-scale, three-wave air assault on Tehran and other targets inside Iran early on Saturday morning means the two enemies are now engaged in all-out conflict. This is not yet the full-scale, region-wide conflagration so many in the Middle East fear.

Trump, Vance to travel to Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia; Harris to appear with Michelle Obama in Michigan – live	Candidates take their pitch to road as election looms, with celebrity endorsements and appearances Good morning, with just over a week left before election day, the race is nail-bitingly close. We’ll be bringing you the latest headlines and analysis today as the campaigns continue. This morning, we’re expecting Donald Trump to deliver remarks at a rally in Novi, Michigan, before traveling to State College, Pennsylvania. His running mate, JD Vance, will similarly speak in Atlanta, Georgia, before heading to Erie, Pennsylvania. In her first event of the campaign, Michelle Obama will hold a get-out-the-vote rally alongside Kamala Harris in Kalamazoo, Michigan. In Houston yesterday, Kamala Harris was joined on stage by superstar singer Beyoncé, congressman Colin Allred, musician Willie Nelson, actor Jessica Alba, several Texas-based OB-GYNs and families affected by the state’s abortion ban in what her campaign is calling their largest rally to date. Harris focused her remarks on the state’s abortion ban, which sparked a slew of abortion restrictions nationwide. Donald Trump’s rally in Traverse City, Michigan, was delayed several hours last night after the ex-president’s interview with podcast host Joe Rogan lasted three hours. Harris and Trump are tied at 48% each for the popular vote for the US presidential election, according to the final New York Times/Siena College national poll published on today. The Washington Post declined to endorse a presidential candidate for the first time since the 1980s. Some staffers and reporters have said the decision was allegedly made by the Post’s owner, billionaire Jeff Bezos.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/26/kamala-harris-donald-trump-us-elections-politics	2024-10-26T08:09:06-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77c55c980fa29051c69f6afdcf7fe2cb0d79be26/0_371_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c7468e7bd44a1df1531d61b35be792c

From Grenfell to Bloody Sunday, the UK government’s formal apologies	UK has resisted calls to apologise over slave trade or colonialism but has said sorry for other historical wrongs As leaders gathered at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) in the Pacific nation of Samoa this week, they hoped that the UK government and King Charles might use the summit as an opportunity to issue an apology for Britain’s colonial past and discuss reparatory justice. While their concerns were acknowledged, the UK stressed it would not pay reparations, and while Keir Starmer called the slave trade -abhorrent-, the government is yet to make a formal apology. King Charles acknowledged -painful aspects- of Britain’s past but stopped short of saying sorry.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/from-grenfell-to-bloody-sunday-government-formal-apologies-slavery-colonialism-reparations	2024-10-26T07:31:08-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a06eff770eff61688bf3ceacaef07a93485ad8bf/0_58_4448_2670/master/4448.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bab1689328c15090f78b5d6e4e70e41e

Burgers, avocados, cucumbers: why chefs can’t stop smashing their food	From peas to parsnips, food just tastes better after a pounding. Top cooks explain the year’s tastiest trend It started with meat – burgers, to be precise. But now the moment for -smashed- food has come for everything from brussels sprouts to cucumbers, tacos and toasties. In restaurants and kitchens across the UK, the sound of pounding can be heard as chefs and home cooks take rolling pins to their ingredients. The smash burger – flatter and more crispy than the non-smashed – has been growing in popularity. Last year, experts declared smashed peas on toast the new avocado on toast. On TikTok, smashed cucumber recipes racked up millions of views this summer. -It’s the word of the moment,- says Sami Harvey, executive chef at The Laundry in south London, where smashed roast squash is on the menu.	https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/oct/26/burgers-avocados-cucumbers-why-chefs-cant-stop-smashing-their-food	2024-10-26T06:09:52-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d2cd3b4fbb28bbf561f8a7db5a984b3e19daca8/0_1925_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a13440773c0670d37b8b8d86a3325600

The internal Iranian debate on how to respond to the long-awaited Israeli attack turns on whether to treat Israel’s breach of Iranian national sovereignty as too grave to be ignored, or instead to heed the advice coming from the region and from the US to acknowledge the relatively limited nature of the attack and to step back from the brink by not launching reprisals.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/iran-mocks-israel-attacks-weak-hardliners-reprisal	2024-10-26T05:30:11-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bcf1228ed5553452e1f8cf6e219d244d1d4256e/42_0_5603_3363/master/5603.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5e7ae89c98a7299eb5d1ed902f89a9d9

Democrats panicking for no reason, pollsters say – US race nail-bitingly close	Polls suggest Harris and Trump still neck-and-neck, but Democrats pessimistic and Republicans confident Less than a fortnight before polling day, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are locked in a nail-bitingly close US presidential election race, triggering pessimism among Democrats and confidence among Republicans – even though polls suggest both candidates have a near equal chance of entering the White House. The Guardian’s 10-day polling tracking average shows Harris, the Democratic nominee and US vice-president, maintaining the single-point advantage over her Republican rival she had a week earlier, 47% to 46%.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/presidential-election-polls-close	2024-10-26T03:00:30-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d47c21e988452ec903c7bf2af132bd5afe0ca166/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bf12b7c2582f4978a4f7aa7f9e15c15c

IDF strikes military sites in Iran: what we know so far	The IDF says it hit military targets in Iran in response to ‘continuous’ attacks on Israel. Here is everything we know so far Israel has struck military targets inside Iran in retaliatory attack that a senior US official described as -extensive but precise-. Iran said three sites were hit, and that -limited damage- was caused. Here is everything we know so far: Israel struck military sites in Iran early on Saturday, saying it was in response to -months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the state of Israel-. The move was widely expected after Tehran’s strikes on Israel earlier this month. Kan, the Israeli public broadcaster, said dozens of fighter jets were involved. The Israeli military said on Saturday morning it hit missile manufacturing sites and aerial defences in several areas inside Iran and had completed its -targeted- air attacks, and that its planes had safely returned home. Israel’s public broadcaster said three waves of strikes had been completed. The Israeli military said after its airstrikes: -If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond.- Two soldiers were killed in Saturday morning’s Israeli airstrikes on Iran, the official Iranian news agency IRNA reported. At least seven explosions were reported in the skies over the capital, Tehran, and nearby Karaj as well as the eastern city of Mashhad just after 2.30am local time on Saturday, as Israeli jets struck military targets in the country. Iran said its air defence system successfully countered Israel’s attacks on military targets in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam, with -limited damage- to some locations. A semi-official Iranian news agency vowed a -proportional reaction- to Israeli moves against Tehran. A senior Biden official said the strikes were -extensive-, -precise- and against military targets across Iran in order to deter future aggression. The official stressed that the US considered the operation to be an -end to the exchange of fire between Israel and Iran- and that the US had no involvement in the Israeli military operation. The US news outlet Axios reported on Saturday that US and Israeli officials assess that Iran will respond militarily but in a limited fashion. Iran and Iraq briefly suspended all flights after the Israeli strikes. Iran’s civil aviation authority later resumed flights from 9am (05.30 GMT) on Saturday. Iranian media initially appeared to downplay the airstrikes, noting that Tehran’s airport was operating normally. State TV reported several strong explosions heard around the capital, while the state news agency, IRNA, said there had been no casualties. There was no immediate official comment about the source of explosions, which Iranian news outlets reported were under investigation. Air defence systems were activated around the country. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) took the rare step of acknowledging the attack on Iran, in a statement that confirmed a decades-old shadow war between the enemy states has now firmly moved into the open. The IDF posted on X: -In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the state of Israel – right now the Israel Defense Forces is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran.- The attacks were widely expected as a retaliation to a missile barrage launched by Iran on 1 October that saw an estimated 180 ballistic missiles fired towards Tel Aviv and military bases, in an unprecedented direct altercation between the two regional enemy states.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-strikes-military-sites-in-iran-what-we-know-so-far	2024-10-25T23:31:58-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e4ca363c414e6a63cf28ca6ace0d8b6b1a07ca5/64_55_1454_873/master/1454.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=71447b9c6088abf77ffc414a46f5e4a8

Middle East crisis live: Israel launches airstrikes on military targets in Iran	IDF spokesman says strikes are a response to ‘months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran’, as explosions are heard around Tehran and nearby city of Karaj Welcome to our continuing live coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. Here’s a snapshot of the latest news. Israel has launched direct airstrikes against Iran in a high-stakes retaliatory attack that could bring the Middle East closer to a regional war, drawing in the US. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had begun to launch -precise strikes on military targets in Iran- in response to -months of continuous attacks- from Iran against Israel. Iranian state TV reported several strong explosions heard around Tehran. There were no casualties, the state news agency IRNA said. There was no immediate official Iranian comment about the source of explosions, which Iranian news outlets reported were under investigation. A US official confirmed that Israel notified Washington before carrying out the strikes, and that the US had no involvement in Israel’s military operation. The White House said it understood Israel was conducting the strikes -as an exercise of self-defence-. Some of the blasts reportedly occurred near Imam Khomeni international airport. Iran’s Tasnim news agency said civilian flights were operating normally as of Friday morning. In Gaza, Israeli military strikes across the territory have killed at least 72 Palestinians since Thursday night, including strikes on residential areas in southern Gaza that killed 38 people, including 13 children from the same extended family, Palestinian health officials said. Gaza’s health ministry reported that dozens of people were wounded as Israeli airstrikes and shelling pounded the southern city of Khan Younis. Palestinians said the neighbourhood was hit with no warning. Israeli strikes on three houses in Beit Lahiya killed 25 people and wounded dozens more, medics said. Later on Friday, an Israeli airstrike killed nine people in Shati camp in Gaza City, medics said. The UN rights chief, Volker Türk, described Israel’s renewed assault on northern Gaza as the -darkest moment- of the year-long war on the territory so far. -We are facing what could amount to atrocity crimes, including potentially extending to crimes against humanity,- Türk said in a statement on Friday. Three journalists from the Hezbollah-affiliated TV stations Al Mayadeen and Al-Manar were killed and several others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on their press station in Hasbaya, southern Lebanon, early on Friday morning. The strikes hit a group of small chalets that 18 journalists from at least seven different media outlets – including Al Jazeera, Sky News Arabia and TRT – were staying in while covering the Israel-Hezbollah war in south Lebanon. Several cars with -Press- signs on them were parked in front of the site. Lebanon’s prime minister, Najib Mikati, said the attack was -deliberate- and -aims to terrorise the media to cover up crimes and destruction-. UN peacekeepers withdrew from a observation post in Zahajra town in south Lebanon on Tuesday after Israeli forces fired at it, the force said on Friday. Unifil added that the Israeli military has repeatedly demanded that its peacekeepers vacate its positions along the Blue Line and deliberately damaged camera, lighting and communications equipment at some of these positions. Two people were killed in a strike on Majd al-Krum in northern Israel, Israeli media said on Friday, following a statement from Hezbollah saying that it targeted the northern Israeli town of Karmiel with a large missile salvo. Lebanon’s transport minister, Ali Hamieh, said Israeli bombing put a second border crossing between the country and Syria out of service, leaving one official passage between the two nations operational. The UN refugee agency (Unhcr) warned that Israel’s overnight airstrike on the Jousieh crossing in Lebanon’s northern Bekaa area jeopardised the main escape route for people fleeing the conflict in Lebanon in search of refuge in Syria. More than half a million people, mostly Syrians, had crossed into Syrian territory since Israel began heavily striking Lebanon late last month, according to figures by the Lebanese authorities on Friday.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/26/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-airstrikes-iran-lebanon-gaza-hamas-hezbollah-latest-updates	2024-10-25T19:39:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b3fedf835a460ca610bbec9979490678aadfdce/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d26de4a579a3d819424f029f067e6210

Tiny house with erotic frescoes uncovered in Pompeii	Paintings include one depicting a scantily clad Phaedra, mythological queen of Athens, and her stepson Hippolytus A tiny house featuring erotic frescoes is the latest discovery in the ruins of the ancient Roman city of Pompeii. Experts say the exquisitely decorated abode, called the House of Phaedra after the mythological queen of Athens, sheds light on the changing architectural styles in the first century AD but is also further proof that the residents of Pompeii had an appetite for sensual art. The vividly coloured wall paintings include one depicting a sexual encounter between a satyr and a nymph on a bed and one of a scantily clad Phaedra and her stepson Hippolytus whom, according to Greek legend, she accused of rape after he spurned her advances.

So, surely everyone knows what -working people- are – don’t we? Perhaps not.

Stacey Williams says Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein ‘coordinated’ groping incident	Former model said of incident at Trump Tower in 1993: ‘I was rolled in there like a piece of meat in some kind of twisted game’ Former model Stacey Williams said she thought Donald Trump groped her to show off to her then boyfriend, the late financier and sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein, when the couple dropped by to visit him in Trump Tower in New York in 1993. In her first detailed, on-camera interview since discussing assault allegations with the Guardian, Williams late on Thursday told CNN that she recalled the former president and Epstein smiled at each other as the property mogul was feeling her up, which gave her the impression the entire incident was a -coordinated- game between the two men.

Digested week: Obama fan-boys Eminem, American Airlines gets tough on ‘gate lice’	Plus: Trump alleges foreign interference in the election while an Aussie hiker gives us all something to smile about Friends in New York with non-American accents are careful not to go canvassing in swing states (or anywhere else). Stuffing envelopes is one thing. But the assumption among those in the US with non-American backgrounds is that, to a person in Pennsylvania or Arizona, the single thing more annoying than having a canvasser at your door, is having a canvasser with a British, Australian or Canadian accent telling you who they think you should vote for.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/25/digested-week-obama-fan-boys-eminem-american-airlines-gets-tough-on-gate-lice	2024-10-25T03:22:36-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80d1aeb00cff0b64fdd46f8675752f0327171163/0_75_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cf0e993b6b0a1ffd9c84d0199cbef97d
Kamala Harris and Barack Obama share stage for first time | First Thing	Democratic nominee spoke to primarily Black voters, including Spike Lee, Tyler Perry and Samuel L Jackson, at a star-studded rally in Atlanta. Plus, Ohio judge rules the state’s abortion ban is unconstitutional Good morning. Vice-president Kamala Harris appeared with Barack Obama for the first time on the campaign trail in Atlanta, where she told the rally that she was leading -a fight for the future- and underlined her support for abortion rights. What did Obama say? He warned that just because Trump’s behavior is -goofy- doesn’t mean he isn’t dangerous. Who else was there? It was a star-studded event, including Samuel L Jackson, Spike Lee, Tyler Perry and Bruce Springsteen, who said Trump was running to be -an American tyrant-. Where else has he campaigned? Trump was in Georgia the day before, where Tucker Carlson compared him to an angry father spanking his daughter in a bizarre speech that led the audience to chant: -Daddy Don- and -Daddy’s home-.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/25/first-thing-ours-is-a-fight-for-the-future-harris-and-obama-share-stage-for-first-time	2024-10-25T03:06:04-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98899da950403c2912361fe8da74bb3abeefef5d/0_127_3712_2228/master/3712.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f357c90730a9ee87e688d71d5c9257b5
Harris holds rally with Obama while Trump calls US a ‘garbage can’ – US election live	Campaigning for presidential candidates continues with election less than two weeks away Good morning and welcome to the US election live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest from the campaign trail over the next couple of hours. We start with news that vice-president Kamala Harris appeared with Barack Obama for the first time, offering closing arguments targeting Black voters in Atlanta’s eastern suburbs, a vibrant, symbolic part of Georgia. The family of Amber Nicole Thurman, a Black 28-year-old mother who died just weeks after Georgia’s abortion ban went into effect, was in attendance at the Harris rally. Harris is expected to make another high profile appearance today, this time alongside Beyoncé in Houston, where the vice-president hopes to rally support for Senate candidate Colin Allred. Donald Trump rallied supporters in Tempe, Arizona, where he spoke alongside Senate candidate Kari Lake. Earlier in the day, Trump made news when he vowed that, if elected, he would immediately fire Jack Smith, the justice department special counsel who is prosecuting him for allegedly plotting to overturn the 2020 election and hide classified documents. Trump called the country a -garbage can- because of immigration policies under the Biden administration. -We’re like a garbage can, you know, it’s the first time I’ve ever said that,- Trump said in Tempe, the home of Arizona State University. -And every time I come up and talk about what they’ve done to our country, I get angry. First time I’ve ever said garbage can, but you know what, it’s a very accurate description.- Phoenix police arrested a man suspected of setting fire to a mailbox there, damaging mail-in ballots. The news comes just days after Tempe police arrested another man in connection with three shootings at Democratic party campaign offices in Tempe. An Arizona prosecutor said the second man had more than 120 guns and more than 250,000 rounds of ammunition in his home, leading law enforcement to believe he may have been planning a mass casualty event. Harris picked up the endorsement of two Republicans, one a former congressman from Michigan, the other a mayor in a pivotal county in Wisconsin. Joe Biden announced he will issue an apology for the US government’s role in forcing thousands of Indigenous American children to attend Indian boarding schools – a policy which has been widely recognized as an element of genocide. The news comes as Harris is trailing in the polls in Arizona, a state that Biden famously won in 2020, largely due to the support of Indigenous American voters. More than 29 million people have voted already in the 2024 election, at least partly driven by Republicans embracing early voting at Donald Trump’s direction. So far, Republicans have cast 32% of ballots, up from 27% at this point in 2020. Whereas Democrats have cast 42% of the votes, down from 47% at this point in the last presidential election.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/25/kamala-harris-donald-trump-us-election-politics-barack-obama	2024-10-25T02:38:05-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce815812c1d46e85c839f9dfb5ad05d437f0defa/0_232_6942_4164/master/6942.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3c03c48590bdb5c4a72e0279e59aef22

Bernardine Evaristo offers her Kent cottage to writers for free retreats	Low-income writers and those without space to work will be prioritised under the RSL’s new Scriptorium awards, with 10 people a year allowed to stay for up to a month On the wall of a Ramsgate house owned by Booker winner Bernardine Evaristo hangs a large-scale cover of Virginia Woolf’s A Room of One’s Own. It might just as well read -A Cottage of One’s Own-, as that is precisely what the Royal Society of Literature (RSL) president is offering: writers will be able to stay in the property for free. -I bought this cottage as my pension, and I decided that I could put it to use as a writer’s retreat,- Evaristo says. The choice was in part motivated by her own experience – -for many years I didn’t have my own home, I led a very peripatetic lifestyle, and I didn’t earn much money from my writing.-	https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/25/bernardine-evaristo-offers-her-kent-cottage-to-writers-for-free-retreats	2024-10-25T01:00:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb168e74b4e32d6d44143658b3565fdf4cfe8de2/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f6907056eae7670bde691e47c3547f36

Middle East crisis live: media workers reportedly killed in Israeli airstrike; Blinken to meet Lebanese PM	Three people who worked for pro-Iran Al Mayadeen and Hezbollah-owned Al Manar, were directly targeted, according to Lebanese media Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Israel’s wars on Gaza and Lebanon. An Israeli airstrike early on Friday morning killed at least three media staff staying at a guesthouse where several other reporters were staying, Lebanese media reported. At least 17 people, nearly all women and children, have been killed in Israeli bombing of a school turned shelter in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip, medics in the territory have said. Another 42 people were injured in the strike in the overcrowded camp, according to nearby al-Awda hospital. Among the dead were 13 children under the age of 18 and three women, it said. The strike marked the latest Israeli bombing of a school sheltering displaced people across Gaza. Israel’s military said the school was being used as a Hamas command and control centre. As it braces for an expected retaliatory strike from Israel, Iran has ordered the armed forces to be prepared for war but also to try to avoid it, having witnessed the decimation of its allies in Lebanon and Gaza, the New York Times is reporting. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has ordered the military to devise multiple military plans for responding to an Israeli attack, the report says, citing four unnamed Iranian officials. The scope of any Iranian retaliation, they said, will largely depend on the severity of Israel’s attacks. Several Israeli strikes hit Beirut’s southern suburbs on Thursday, about half an hour after Israel issued evacuation warnings for the Hezbollah bastion after intense strikes the night before. In Beirut’s southern Choueifat Al-Amrousieh area, Israeli warplanes -destroyed two buildings and ignited a large fire, and black smoke covered the area,- according to the official national news agency. -The raid that targeted the Saint Therese area also caused the collapse of two buildings near the constitutional council.- Israel had earlier issued evacuation warnings for the Hezbollah bastion following intense assaults the night before. Israel’s military said it had killed a Hamas commander who took part in the 7 October 2023 assault on southern Israel and worked for the UN aid agency in the Gaza Strip. Unrwa confirmed the man, Mohammad Abu Itiwi, was a staff member and was killed on Wednesday. Unrwa said Itiwi’s name was included in a letter received from Israel in July that included a list of 100 staff members who were also allegedly members of armed groups, including Hamas, but that Israeli authorities had not provided more information supporting those allegations. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, warned Benjamin Netanyahu that -civilisation is not best defended by sowing barbarism ourselves-. Macron also vowed to help train 6,000 extra Lebanese official forces, and called for a ceasefire and an end to Israeli attacks on UN peacekeepers, as a conference in Paris raised $200m (£154m) for Lebanon’s official military and $800m in humanitarian aid for the country. Gaza’s civil defence agency said on Thursday that more than 770 Palestinians have been killed in the north of the territory since Israel launched a new offensive in northern Gaza on 6 October. The agency also said it had been forced to suspend operations in northern Gaza after what it called threats from the Israeli military to -bomb and kill- rescue crews working in Jabalia camp. Gaza’s health ministry said on Thursday that 42,847 Palestinians have been killed and 100,544 injured since Israel launched its war last year. An Israeli airstrike struck the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza on Thursday night, with Gaza’s civil defence agency estimating that 150 people – including women and children – were killed or injured, the Palestinian news agency, Wafa reported.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/25/israel-lebanon-gaza-hamas-hezbollah-middle-east-latest	2024-10-24T23:37:17-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d42d31766648a60a6352a2bc7488055657353b6a/0_14_5085_3051/master/5085.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72747df98a7b6ea60cdec7d7c24d919c

Man held over Democratic office shootings may have planned ‘act of mass casualty’	Authorities say Jeffrey Michael Kelly had more than 120 guns and over 250,000 rounds of ammunition in his home The man arrested for shooting at a Democratic National Committee office in suburban Phoenix on three separate occasions had more than 120 guns and more than 250,000 rounds of ammunition in his home, prosecutors said, leading law enforcement to believe he may have been planning a mass shooting. Jeffrey Michael Kelly, 60, has been detained on terrorism charges in connection with the shootings at the Democratic party’s campaign office in Tempe, a city just east of Phoenix, on 16 and 23 September. After the third shooting, on 6 October, the Arizona Democratic party was forced to close its office.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/24/man-jeffrey-michael-kelly-held-over-democratic-office-shootings-may-have-planned-act-of-mass-casualty	2024-10-24T04:12:18-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a8de5345feaa7f68b3b3d824c08acb04b06628b/0_623_1916_1149/master/1916.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8726453d2e876b577b203dcebfd4be87
The University of Michigan wanted to crack down on Gaza protesters. Regents recruited the state attorney general	Revealed: in a highly unusual move, regents bypassed local prosecutors, believing Dana Nessel would be tougher on the student protesters When the University of Michigan governing board this year asked the state’s attorney general to bring charges against campus Gaza protesters, they tapped a political ally with whom some board members have extensive personal, financial or political connections, a Guardian investigation finds. Frustrated by local prosecutors’ unwillingness to crack down on most of the students arrested at the height of the pro-Palestinian encampments last spring, the regents executed a highly unusual move in recruiting Michigan attorney general Dana Nessel because she was more likely to file charges, three people with direct knowledge of the decision tell the Guardian.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/24/michigan-attorney-general-dana-nessel-campus-gaza-protests	2024-10-24T04:00:50-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fcc4eeca41d7b0da88066def7510d40fa3e531b/0_56_4528_2717/master/4528.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=52f11271b4399f855f1fa26232bfa167

The Legal Defense Fund (LDF), an organization that fights for racial justice, recently released the most in-depth legal analysis of Project 2025’s impact on Black communities.

Macron opens conference aimed at finding to path to ceasefire in Lebanon	French president is hoping to rise about £300m in funds to address humanitarian crisis caused by Israeli bombing Emmanuel Macron has opened a conference in Paris in support of Lebanon, with the twin aims of raising about £300m in funds to address the mounting humanitarian crisis caused by Israeli bombing and finding a way to fill the security vacuum created by the chronic weakness of the Lebanese state. Most observers say Macron, the president of France, which has historical ties to Lebanon, is likely to have success with his first task, partly owing to donations expected to come from Sunni-majority Gulf states. France hopes this will reflect a revived interest in Lebanon that these states had largely neglected, leaving space open for the expansion of the Shia group Hezbollah in recent years.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/24/macron-opens-conference-ceasefire-lebanon-israel	2024-10-24T02:02:35-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e49f5b8574c8e6f18dcbe92b64ad2212979d647/0_193_4791_2875/master/4791.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fa91738560ef074c2cc7d99958612ce0

Starmer calms business fears over budget as Reeves prepares to announce debt rule change - UK politics live	PM tries to reassure businesses and investors in UK, while chancellor is in New York for IMF meeting Good morning. Officially Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, will unveil Labour’s first budget (and probably most important for the whole parliament) on Wednesday next week. But in practice budget announcements are now two-week news events, because the Treasury knows that it is bad idea to spook the markets with lots of surprises on the day and so this government, like past governments, has been engaged in elaborate pitch-rolling, ensuring that there are plenty of reports in advance giving a broad idea of what is coming. Not all the stories you might read this week about what will be in the budget will be accurate, or Treasury-sanctioned, but quite a lot of them are. One of the measures subject to a lot of pitch-rolling is the proposal to change the official definition of debt used in the government’s fiscal rules. Reeves has been hinting for a while that she will change this and today, at a meeting of the IMF in Washington, she will confirm this. This yardstick – which will replace public sector net debt – will take into account all the government’s financial assets and liabilities, including student loans and equity stakes in private companies, as well as funded pension schemes. This would give the chancellor room to increase borrowing for investment in long-term infrastructure … The chancellor has made clear, both in her conference speech and consequently about her desire to see more investment in the economy. It’s a matter of record that investors in the UK have previously said that UK investment levels are too low both in terms of public infrastructure and in terms of business investment more generally. Investors shouldn’t be worried about this budget. This government is prioritising growth. It’s unashamedly pro-business. You’ll have seen from the significant vote of confidence in the UK economy at the international investment summit that it is already the case that investors are responding positively to the government’s plans.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/24/labour-budget-keir-starmer-rachel-reeves-imf-uk-politics	2024-10-24T01:01:36-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acbf3cf5124d6ee5426f218535b250356225c7b2/1023_976_2520_1512/master/2520.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a299c3840fba512c1320c095db917cf9

Thursday briefing: How the state is failing children with special needs – and what it costs	In today’s newsletter: Despite a 58% increase in funding over a decade, there has been no improvement in outcomes, a new report reveals • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. The annual budget for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) in England now stands at £10.7bn, an increase of 58% in a decade. Despite that, there has been no improvement in outcomes, and many parents say that their children are being sold short. The need for services is so great against the backdrop of years of council cuts that two in five local authorities are at risk of effectively declaring bankruptcy by 2026. In other words: the system is somehow underfunded and financially ruinous at the same time, and failing the children it is supposed to support. That is the grim diagnosis contained in a report by the National Audit Office (NAO) published this morning, which warns that system-wide reforms are needed to keep councils afloat. And there is no doubt that the figures it contains are eye-watering. Budget | Rachel Reeves will announce at the International Monetary Fund a plan to change Britain’s debt rules that will open the door to more borrowing for long-term capital investment. After weeks of speculation, the change could release up to £50bn extra for infrastructure projects. France | Gisèle Pelicot, the French woman who has become a feminist hero for insisting that the rape trial of her ex-husband and 50 other men should be held in public, has told a court in southern France she was driven by her desire to change society and expose rape culture. She said: -I wanted all woman victims of rape … to say: Mrs Pelicot did it, we can do it too.- Police | The identities of armed police officers charged after opening fire at suspects are likely to stay secret in future unless they are convicted, the home secretary has announced. Yvette Cooper’s statement came after the acquittal of the Metropolitan police sergeant Martyn Blake for shooting dead Chris Kaba.

What does Elon Musk want from all this politicking?	The billionaire is pledging to give away $1m a day and campaigning hard – is deregulation the driving motivation? Over the weekend, Elon Musk pledged to give away $1m a day to registered voters in battleground states in the US who sign a petition by his America Pac in support of the first and second amendments. He awarded the first prize, a novelty check the size of a kitchen island, at a Pennsylvania rally on Saturday and the second on Sunday in Pittsburgh. He says he’ll keep doing it until the election on 5 November. The stunt is potentially illegal, experts say. After endorsing Donald Trump in July, Musk quickly founded America Pac and funded it with $75m. For the past several weeks, he’s been making multiple in-person campaign appearances per day, focusing especially on Pennsylvania, a swing state. These constant fights with the full alphabet of regulatory agencies has coincided with Musk making numerous public statements in favor of deregulation, as well as calling for a full-scale audit of the federal government. That idea has found purchase with Trump, who announced in September that he would launch a Musk-led government efficiency commission that would audit federal agencies for places to cut. Musk wants to call it the Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, invoking one of his favorite memes, an expressive shiba inu. Although the plan is vague on details and fails to address the obvious conflict of interest in Musk auditing the regulators that oversee his companies, both Trump and Musk have repeatedly brought up the idea of Musk holding some role in a potential Trump administration. During an appearance on Fox News earlier this week, Trump said that he would create a new position called ‘secretary of cost-cutting’ and appoint Musk. ‘He’s dying to do this,’ Trump said.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/23/what-does-elon-musk-want-us-elections	2024-10-23T00:00:03-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a008ee15efeca203901374fb954755061463d8f/0_365_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=26ed4c6e6e831452b8da44ac6138ac7f
Selfies, hugs and protests: King Charles’s new approach in spotlight during ‘fast and furious’ royal tour of Australia	Issue of Aboriginal sovereignty front and centre during head of state’s whirlwind first visit King Charles and Queen Camilla have left Australia after more than 30 official engagements – and a fair share of controversy – packed into just four full days on the ground.

Middle East crisis live: Israel says it killed Hezbollah’s presumed next leader	Israeli military says strikes in Beirut earlier this month killed Hashem Safieddine Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the Middle East conflict. Israel said on Tuesday a strike it carried out in Beirut three weeks ago killed Hashem Safieddine, the presumed successor to late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was also killed in an Israeli attack last month. Israel is weighing the use of private security contractors – possibly involving UK special forces veterans – to deliver aid to Gaza, as conditions in the north of the strip worsen dramatically, the Guardian has learned. At least three Israeli strikes targeted Beirut’s southern suburbs Tuesday evening, according to Lebanon’s official ANI news agency. Two of the strikes hit the Laylake district, near a stadium. The strikes came shortly after Israel’s military issued new evacuation warnings for residents in specific buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Lebanon’s health ministry on Tuesday revised upward the casualty toll from the Israeli strike near Beirut’s main government hospital on Monday to at least 18 people killed, including four children, and 60 wounded. Israeli jets hit a Hezbollah target close to the Rafik Hariri university hospital in Beirut but did not target the hospital and it was not affected by the strike, the Israeli military said on Tuesday. At least 63 people were killed in Israeli strikes on Lebanon over the past 24 hours, bringing the total death toll to 2,530, the Lebanese government said on Tuesday. It also said that more than 11,800 people had been wounded by Israeli strikes on Lebanon since October 2023. Seven Palestinian civilians were killed during Israeli artillery bombardment of a school sheltering displaced people in northern Gaza on Tuesday, Wafa, the Palestinian news agency reported, citing local sources. Separately, at least three Palestinians were killed and several wounded by an Israeli drone strike targeting a group of people in western Gaza City, the Anadolu news agency said. Palestinians under an Israeli siege in northern Gaza -are rapidly exhausting all available means for their survival-, the UN’s humanitarian office has warned. The UN’s office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (OCHA) accused Israel of denying its requests to deliver life-saving aid to northern Gaza, as well as of denying requests to help rescue dozens of people trapped under their collapsed homes in the Falouja area of the Jabalia refugee camp in the north. Lebanon will need $250m a month to help more than a million people displaced by Israeli attacks, its minister in charge of responding to the crisis said on Tuesday. Nasser Yassin told Reuters the government response, helped by local initiatives and international aid, only covered 20% of the needs of 1.3 million people. Keir Starmer has accused Vladimir Putin of disrupting food supplies to Gaza after British intelligence suggested Russia had stepped up its attacks on Ukrainian ports. Starmer said it was clear the Russian president was -willing to gamble on global food security- after several grain ships en route to developing countries were damaged by Russian strikes, and are believed to have delayed a vessel carrying vegetable oil destined for the World Food Programme in Palestine. The FBI is investigating the leak of a pair of highly classified intelligence documents describing Israel’s preparations for a retaliatory strike on Iran, the Washington Post reported. -The FBI is investigating the alleged leak of classified documents and working closely with our partners in the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community,- the FBI said in a statement.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/23/middle-east-israel-gaza-war-hamas-hezbollah-lebanon-hashem-safieddine	2024-10-22T23:30:04-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/247c6c01ba3ac010c267a31f8f972e654527847a/0_352_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5f0b21f57b2dd335e1e2865cca77dec6
Wednesday briefing: What reforms could actually solve the prison capacity crisis?	In today’s newsletter: With a sentencing review ordered and the crisis in the criminal justice system deepening, the government is tasked with finding solutions to what seems like an intractable problem • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. If the answer is -prison works-, it now seems that the most likely question is: what is a good example of a demonstrable policy failure where successive governments have nonetheless decided to stick with the status quo? England and Wales lock up more people than any other country in western Europe, with Scotland close behind; thanks largely to longer sentences, the prison population has doubled since 1993. But while crime has dropped considerably over that period, the same effect has been seen in countries that don’t lock up nearly so many people – and about 44% of freed prisoners are convicted again within a year. UK news | Police chiefs have asked the government to make it harder to prosecute officers after a sergeant was acquitted of the murder of Chris Kaba, in a move that drew immediate criticism from campaigners as a grant of -effective immunity-. It meanwhile emerged that Kaba had shot a man a few days before he was killed and was allegedly a core member of a south London gang. Middle East | Israel has confirmed the killing of the presumed next leader of Hezbollah in an airstrike on southern Beirut earlier in October. In a statement on Tuesday evening, the Israeli military said strikes in the suburb of Dahiyeh had killed Hashem Safieddine three weeks ago. Hezbollah has not yet commented. Water | Water companies in England could be banned from making a profit under plans for a complete overhaul of the system. The idea is one of several under consideration by a new commission amid public fury over sewage in rivers and mismanagement. US elections | Donald Trump has filed an extraordinary complaint against the UK’s Labour party, claiming that volunteers joining the Kamala Harris campaign are guilty of -blatant foreign interference-. Keir Starmer insisted he could maintain a good relationship with Trump despite the claim. Culture | Abba’s Björn Ulvaeus, actor Julianne Moore and Radiohead singer Thom Yorke are among 10,500 signatories of a statement from the creative industries warning artificial intelligence companies that unlicensed use of their work is a -major, unjust threat- to artists’ livelihoods.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/23/first-edition-prison-sentencing-crisis	2024-10-22T22:59:13-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5c663ac46903ad709fb6ddf64108020934cd1c7/312_134_5491_3295/master/5491.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a3e50209c00cbe1bf18949742ba59f1a

Police chiefs ask government to make it harder to prosecute officers after Chris Kaba shooting	Exclusive: Campaigners say calls to redraw rules are cynical attempt to secure ‘effective immunity’ for officers Police chiefs have formally asked the government to make it harder to investigate and prosecute officers after the fatal shooting of Chris Kaba led to a Scotland Yard sergeant being acquitted of murder, the Guardian has learned. Campaigners have criticised the move, saying calls to redraw the rules were a cynical attempt by police leaders to secure -effective immunity- for their officers. Making it harder for the Crown Prosecution Service to charge officers, with police chiefs proposing prosecutors would have to prove training or approved professional practice was not being followed before taking action. Changing the standard of proof required for a verdict of unlawful killing ahead of the inquest into Kaba expected as early as next year. Currently the ruling is made on a balance of probabilities, the civil standard. Police chiefs want it to be the criminal standard, which is beyond reasonable doubt. Making it harder to disprove a claim of self-defence in misconduct inquiries, by changing the standard to the higher criminal test, rather than the current civil test.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/22/police-chiefs-government-make-harder-prosecute-officers-after-chris-kaba-shooting	2024-10-22T12:11:22-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d730bf6e7be4a9221083ca13fa13c535245c83f8/0_190_4501_2700/master/4501.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=205d3bc02b89f5c105c837469813d4cc

First Thing: people killed and dozens injured in Israeli airstrike near Beirut hospital	Antony Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv for talks. Plus, Liz Cheney backs Kamala Harris on abortion Good morning. At least 13 people were killed and 57 injured in an Israeli airstrike on Monday near Hariri hospital, Beirut’s main government hospital, the health ministry said, revising upwards its initial death toll of four. What has the impact been on Lebanese civilians? Israel’s invasion of Lebanon, launched 1 October, has displaced more than 1.2 million people multiple times, according to Lebanese authorities. At least 2,483 people have been killed, according to the health ministry. What is the US doing? Secretary of state Antony Blinken has arrived in Tel Aviv, where he will meet Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Blinken is expected to stress the need for Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza and to discuss securing the release of the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza. As Israel’s most powerful ally and weapons supplier, the US has sent more than 10,000 highly destructive 2,000lb bombs and thousands of Hellfire missiles since the start of its war on Gaza. What did Cheney say? -I’m pro-life and I have been very troubled, deeply troubled by what I have watched happen in so many states since Dobbs … I have been troubled by the extent to which you have women who – as the vice-president said, in some cases have died – who can’t get medical treatment that they need because providers are worried about criminal liability.- What are the polls saying? The election is essentially deadlocked. Harris has small polling leads in Pennsylvania and Nevada, while Trump has small polling leads in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, but all are well within the margin of error and all the races in the all-important battleground states remain too close to call.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/22/first-thing-people-killed-and-dozens-injured-in-israeli-airstrike-near-beirut-hospital	2024-10-22T03:58:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2280bfe6bdd09577aa6b2b45edc8262e63fb4fd1/0_171_3656_2194/master/3656.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ab5be1f7e59fd9f2c17c0b640984a551

Donald Trump urges Christian voters to participate in 2024 election – US politics live	Republican candidate claims that Kamala Harris administration would restrict religious freedoms during event in North Carolina Good morning and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest from the campaign trail, with polling day now just two weeks away. We start with the news that Donald Trump has urged Christian voters on Monday to participate in the 2024 election, claiming that a Kamala Harris administration would restrict religious freedoms and casting himself as a protector of Christians. Liz Cheney, former Republican congresswoman and longtime opponent of abortion rights, condemned Republican bans on the procedure and urged conservatives on Monday to support Kamala Harris. Jill Biden acknowledged on Monday that her husband made -the right call- by stepping down from his run for re-election. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, said Elon Musk’s plan to give away $1m a day in support of Donald Trump is a reflection of a ticket with -no plan-. The Central Park Five sued Trump for defamation after he falsely said during the presidential debate that they had pleaded guilty to a brutal rape 35 years ago, despite the fact that they had their convictions overturned. A Republican county supervisor in Arizona who refused to certify the 2022 midterm election has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. The politics writer Olivia Nuzzi and New York magazine have parted ways after she was placed on leave following the disclosure that she had engaged in a -personal- relationship with Robert F Kennedy Jr. Key rightwing legal groups tied to Trump and his allies have banked millions of dollars from conservative foundations and filed multiple lawsuits challenging voting rules in swing states. Trump doubled down on false claims about the federal government’s hurricane recovery efforts and promoted baseless conspiracy theories about immigration.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/22/donald-trump-christian-voters-kamala-harris-election-us-politics-latest-updates	2024-10-22T02:29:09-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e02c7179b7055cae5a0dab1afb6867195593e00/0_124_5125_3075/master/5125.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=339dbc5dac51515c37dee95c48240e02
David Gauke calls for end to ‘bidding war’ between parties as he is appointed to sentencing review – UK politics live	Former Conservative justice sectary to carry out review by Ministry of Justice considering alternatives to sending people to jail Paul Brand from ITV says, if the government thinks that, by getting David Gauke to carry out the sentencing review, they will get the Conservatives support for it, they will probably be disappointed. He has posted this on social media. Govt hopes by appointing Gauke - a former Tory Justice Sec (tho admittedly a centrist in today’s party) - they can get cross-party agreement on sentencing reform. But it’s likely Tory leadership candidates will say Labour being soft on criminals, and on the political debate goes. Prison works. It ensures that we are protected from murderers, muggers and rapists - and it makes many who are tempted to commit crime think twice ... This may mean that more people will go to prison. I do not flinch from that.

Middle East crisis live: Air raid sirens sound in Tel Aviv after Hezbollah claims to have targeted Israeli city	Israeli military said about 20 rockets were fired with many intercepted; US secretary of state Antony Blinken due to land in Israel for talks Air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv on Tuesday after Hezbollah said it bombed the Nirit area in the city’s suburbs with missiles. The Israeli military said about 20 rockets were fired in the latest barrage from Lebanon – five toward central Israel and 15 toward the north, and that attempts were made to intercept them. The IDF said there were no immediate reports of injuries. Israel said late Monday it planned to carry out more strikes in Lebanon against a Hezbollah-run financial institution that it targeted the night before and which it says uses customers’ deposits to finance attacks against Israel. At least 15 branches of Al-Qard Al-Hasan were hit late Sunday in the southern neighbourhoods of Beirut, across southern Lebanon and in the eastern Bekaa valley, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. One strike flattened a nine-story building in Beirut with a branch inside it. There were reports that dozens of Palestinians, including children, were killed in attacks carried out by Israeli soldiers in the northern Gaza Strip. Among the casualties were at least 10 people killed in an Israeli attack on Jabalia Preparatory School in Al-Fawqa area, which was functioning as an Unrwa shelter for displaced people, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. Joe Biden’s administration remains -deeply concerned- about the leak of a pair of highly classified intelligence documents describing Israel’s preparations for a retaliatory strike on Iran, the White House has said. There is no indication that additional documents have been compromised and US officials have been in communication with Israeli counterparts about the leak, a spokesperson said. Iran warned the US would bear -full responsibility- in case of a retaliatory attack by Israel on the Islamic Republic, after US president Joe Biden indicated he was aware of Israeli plans to do so. Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, called Biden’s remarks -profoundly alarming and provocative-. The UN warned Monday that almost no aid is entering the besieged Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, where a two-week Israeli military campaign has killed hundreds of people and left thousands trapped. The heads of the United Nations World Food Programme and UN children’s agency Unicef, Catherine Russell and Cindy McCain, have privately appealed to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for help -alleviating the suffering of countless civilians- in Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon, according to a new letter. Up to 1,000 women and children needing medical care will shortly be evacuated from Gaza to Europe, the head of the World Health Organization’s Europe branch said. Israel, which is besieging the war-devastated Palestinian territory, -is committed to 1,000 more medical evacuations within the next months to the European Union,- Hans Kluge said. The US military has rushed its advanced anti-missile system to Israel and it is now -in place-, defence secretary Lloyd Austin said. THAAD, or the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, is a critical part of the US military’s layered air defence systems and adds to Israel’s already formidable anti-missile defences.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/22/middle-east-crisis-live-blog-news-updates-israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-palestine-hamas-hezbollah-war	2024-10-21T22:46:43-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b57afaa3d426bef6f42da1ae0cfd5409c2c2eb7a/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3b78b6a9c225ebd88b482eea3627bce1

The Sahel hospital in Dahiyeh was evacuated shortly afterwards, and Fadi Alame, its director, told Reuters that the allegations were untrue.

Honest Bob Jenrick won’t sleep until everyone sees he’s the maddest person in the room | John Crace	The Tory leadership hopeful believes that if he shouts the same things a bit louder, everyone will eventually come round to his way of thinking You can only conclude that some politicians are simply untreatable. Their egotism and self-delusion so deeply engrained that reality never gets a look in. I give you Robert Jenrick. Exhibit A. He is a worthy successor to Liz Truss as one of the dimmest solipsists you could hope to meet. After trailing in a distant second in last week’s televised Q&amp;A, you’d have thought Honest Bob might have taken a day or two to regroup. After all, if the most Tory-friendly audience imaginable at GB News doesn’t much like you then most people would reasonably conclude they had a problem. If you can’t connect with the few remaining diehard Tory members, then your chances of appealing to the rest of the country are vanishingly small.

Jacinta Allan’s pitch to young voters on housing affordability snags Liberal Nimbys ‘hook, line and sinker’	In pitting millennials against boomers, the Victorian premier is setting the stage for a 2026 election fought on housing It’s no coincidence Jacinta Allan chose Brighton – a bayside suburb of Melbourne with a median property price of $3.3m – to unveil her most significant policy to date. With a reputation as a wealthy, predominately white enclave, and as the centre of a safe Liberal electorate of the same name, it is unlikely the Labor premier had many fans in the area on Sunday, even before she announced her bold plan to seize planning controls around Middle Brighton and North Brighton train stations.

With her protest before the king, Lidia Thorpe bursts the warm bubble of nostalgia around the royal visit | Karen Middleton	Charles and Camilla entered the Great Hall from a door behind the stage – not from the foyer, down the centre aisle, and past Thorpe.

Monday briefing: The Trump acolytes planning to interfere with November’s election	In today’s newsletter: From stacking election boards to purging voter rolls, we look at the tactics that could sway key states • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. With two weeks to go until the US presidential election, the race could hardly be closer. But when you’re next frantically obsessing over the odds, keep in mind: it may not be as simple as who most voters want to see in the Oval Office. If the attempt to subvert the 2020 election was an anti-democratic horror show, its impact was somewhat mitigated by the fact that Donald Trump seemed to be making it up as he went along. This time around, Republicans are a lot more organised in their efforts to influence the outcome – and as the Maga takeover of the GOP has rolled on over the past four years, election denialism has moved from the fringes to become a central tenet of the party.

Bob Woodward’s new book War is a sober but alarming must-read	Watergate reporter says Trump is far worse than Nixon and ‘most reckless and impulsive president in American history’ The Middle East and Ukraine are ablaze, the US mired in turmoil. An octogenarian president recedes from view. The threat of a second Trump term hangs like the sword of Damocles. Fifty years ago, with Carl Bernstein, Bob Woodward captured Watergate and the downfall of Richard Nixon. Now, the US sits at an inflection point once again. Woodward’s fourth book at least in part about Donald Trump is a sober but alarming must-read. War depicts an administration under Joe Biden that is often behind the curve, at times captive to its own wishful thinking. The withdrawal from Afghanistan haunts. Trump mesmerizes. Yet as Woodward tells it, Biden and his team did clearly see the menace Russia posed. Unlike George W Bush, Biden did not need to gaze into Vladimir Putin’s blighted soul. Unlike Trump, he did not feel compelled to fluff his ego like a besotted fanboy.

As Silicon Valley eyes US election, beware Elon Musk and the tech bros with political nous | John Naughton	The owner of X is just one of many who may prefer Donald Trump to greater regulation under the Democrats Way back in the 1960s -the personal is political- was a powerful slogan capturing the reality of power dynamics within marriages. Today, an equally meaningful slogan might be that -the technological is political-, to reflect the way that a small number of global corporations have acquired political clout within liberal democracies. If anyone doubted that, then the recent appearance of Elon Musk alongside Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania provided useful confirmation of how technology has moved centre-stage in American politics. Musk may be a manchild with a bad tweeting habit, but he also owns the company that is providing internet connectivity to Ukrainian troops on the battlefield; and his rocket has been chosen by Nasa to be the vehicle to land the next Americans on the moon. There was a time when the tech industry wasn’t much interested in politics. It didn’t need to be because politics at the time wasn’t interested in it. Accordingly, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple grew to their gargantuan proportions in a remarkably permissive political environment. When democratic governments were not being dazzled by the technology, they were asleep at the wheel; and antitrust regulators had been captured by the legalistic doctrine peddled by Robert Bork and his enablers in the University of Chicago Law School – the doctrine that there was little wrong with corporate dominance unless it was harming consumers. The test for harm was price-gouging, and since Google’s and Facebook’s services were -free-, where was the harm, exactly? And though Amazon’s products weren’t free, the company was ruthlessly undercutting competitors’ prices and pandering to customers’ need for next-day delivery. Again: where was the harm in that?	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/20/as-silicon-valley-eyes-us-election-elon-musk-is-not-the-only-tech-bro-to-worry-about	2024-10-20T01:00:39-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09c3f9308b486f377d732d10df725dd895414885/0_82_2682_1609/master/2682.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=640012f560f9864d863482cefea207d8
Middle East crisis live: Israeli strike on Gaza residential building kills at least 73 people, officials say	Israel says number of dead exaggerated after strike on town of Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Israel’s wars on Gaza and Lebanon. In northern Gaza, an Israeli airstrike hit several houses and a multi-storey residential building in the town of Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza on Saturday night, killing at least 73 people, officials said. The US government is investigating an alleged leak about classified US intelligence on Israel’s strikes against Iran, CNN reports. CNN reports that the documents which date from 15 and 16 October started circulating on Friday on Telegram through an account called the Middle East Spectator. The investigation is also examining how the documents were obtained – including whether it was an intentional leak by a member of the US intelligence community or obtained by another method, like a hack – and whether any other intelligence information was compromised, the Associated Press reports. Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in the seaside town of Caesarea was hit by a drone on Saturday, causing superficial damage and no casualties. Neither Netanyahu nor his wife, Sara, were home at the time. -The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake,- Netanyahu said in a statement, vowing that Iran and its proxies would -pay a heavy price-. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, spoke to Benjamin Netanyahu after reports of an attempted drone attack on the Israeli prime minister’s holiday home in Saturday. According to a Downing Street spokesperson, Starmer told Netanyahu that he was alarmed to hear about what Netanyahu called an -assassination attempt- on his life. G7 defence ministers expressed their concern over Israel’s latest attacks on Unifil in Lebanon. The group, which has been meeting in Naples, Italy, said: -We are concerned by the latest events in Lebanon and the risk of further escalation. We express concern over all threats to Unifil’s security.- The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, spoke to his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, on Saturday, reviewing US forces’ -posture adjustments-. Those include the recent deployment of an anti-missile system to reinforce Israel’s defences against regional threats, the Pentagon said in a statement. The US would like to see Israel scale back some of its strikes in and around the Lebanese capital of Beirut, Austin said. -The number of civilian casualties have been far too high,- Austin told reporters at a G7 defence gathering in Naples. Two Israeli airstrikes targeted south Beirut early on Sunday, Lebanese state media reports. -Enemy (Israeli) airplanes carried out two strikes this morning on Beirut’s southern suburbs, one of them hitting a residential building in Haret Hreik- near a mosque and a hospital, the National news agency reported. There were no immediate details of casualties or property damage. The Israeli army ordered civilians located near buildings it claimed were -affiliated with Hezbollah- in two neighbourhoods in south Beirut to immediately evacuate early this morning.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/20/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-gaza-lebanon-hamas-netanyahu-latest-live-news	2024-10-20T00:29:09-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b246cf6581f8499c451f973d3456e1fb20d1cf9/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=613cba02debc4e5f1a60d3df3d10b555

Allegations suggest India is now part of the assassination club | Hannah Ellis-Petersen	Canada’s PM, Justin Trudeau, claims Indian diplomats are implicated in murders on Canadian soil A gruelling week for Indian diplomacy began with an explosive Canadian press conference on Monday. Senior Canadian police officials accused Indian diplomats of being involved in -criminal- activities on Canadian soil, ranging from homicide and targeted assassinations to extortion, intimidation and coercion against members of the Canadian Sikh community. They alleged that Indian diplomats – including the high commissioner himself – were implicated not only in the high profile killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh activist who was gunned down outside a gurdwara in a suburb of Vancouver last June, but also linked to other murders on Canadian soil. The diplomats had even worked with a gang run by India’s most notorious mob boss to get their dirty work done, they alleged.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/20/allegations-suggest-india-is-now-part-of-the-assassination-club	2024-10-19T22:00:37-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fb5fa7bd6db8392801321bfbfda4e3d9c1a5f32/0_167_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d4b7e576e858a906e4463df0c6f7c604

Kamala Harris joined by Lizzo at campaign event; Donald Trump rallies in Pennsylvania – live	Vice-president is hosting a get-out-the-vote event in Detroit for the city’s first day of early voting, alongside Michigan-born rapper Lizzo Lizzo and Usher are just some of the prominent celibrities backing Harris against her rival Donald Trump. Earlier this week, Lizzo revealed that she voted early for Harris, and Usher said last month that he was endorsing Harris. This week, the campaign announced a fundraising sweepstakes to win tickets to an upcoming get-out-the-vote concert featuring -superstar musicians.- Harris questions whether Trump is -fit to do the job- of president again. She used a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Friday to seize on reports that Donald Trump had been canceling media interviews to question whether he has the stamina for a second presidency if voters choose him over her in November’s election. In the past week, Trump has gone further than ever in branding his political opponents -the enemy within- and talking about deploying the military against them. The latest polling figures seem to mirror such sharply polarised rhetoric, with the seven crucial swing states almost split down the middle in allegiance. Harris announced this week that if elected president, she would fully legalize adult recreational cannabis on the federal level – the first time a presidential nominee has taken such an unambiguous stance on ending cannabis prohibition.

Walking with breaks might use more energy, but dogs can’t stand it	A new study finds that breaking up your exercise is more effective, but Tim Dowling remains to be convinced Let me start by saying that I am not looking for ways to be more tired. I’m tired enough. However, a new study suggesting that exercise punctuated by frequent breaks requires more energy than -steady-state- exertion has a certain counterintuitive attraction: I can exercise better by resting more. The results of the study, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, are striking. Volunteers on treadmills and stair climbers used 20-60% more oxygen when walking in bursts of 10-30 seconds than they did covering the same distance without stopping. This apparently has something to do with the sheer inefficiency of stop-start activity. -We found that when starting from rest, a significant amount of oxygen is consumed to start walking,- said the study’s author, Francesco Luciano. -We incur this cost regardless of whether we then walk for 10 or 30 seconds, so it proportionally weighs more for shorter rather than longer bouts.- Would this strategy, I wondered, work for me?	https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/18/walking-with-breaks-more-energy-exercise-dogs-tim-dowling	2024-10-18T06:38:19-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2154b83e148c53c640b06865626b9cb2a7c92e89/0_166_7918_4750/master/7918.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=60cd059363c40c58bfcf1b40860f46e9

The £15 bottles of sauce, consisting of two flavours, Hot Habanero and Sweet Jalapeño, and labels adorned with kissing cherubim are more akin to a luxury perfume brand. The 25-year-old’s sauces come hot on the heels of the singer Ed Sheeran who has an offering called Tingly Ted’s.

Labour will reform benefits system to save £3bn, says minister – UK politics live	‘We will not go ahead with the Tory plan,’ Alison McGovern says, adding: ‘We will bring forward our own reforms’ Rachel Reeves will seek to make about £3bn of cuts to welfare over the next four years by restricting access to sickness benefits, it is understood, according to the PA news agency. The chancellor is expected to commit to the previous Tory government’s plans to save the sum by reforming work capability rules, as first reported by the Telegraph. We have always said that the work capability assessment is not working and needs to be reformed or replaced alongside a proper plan to support disabled people to work. We will deliver savings through our own reforms, including genuine support to help disabled people into work.- Like all departments, the Department for Work and Pensions has to make savings because we are in a terrible financial situation. To be clear, on that point we will bring forward our own reforms because the last 14 years have been a complete failure when it comes to employment.- We will not go ahead with the Tory plan because that was theirs. We will need to make savings like all departments, but we will bring forward our own reforms.- British foreign secretary David Lammy will meet his counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing on Friday to -challenge- China on sensitive issues like Russia’s war in Ukraine, as the two nations seek to rebuild frayed ties. Lammy is the first British cabinet minister to visit China since Labour prime minister Keir Starmer took office in July. Rachel Reeves is considering raising the tax on vaping products in her budget this month as figures show that a quarter of 11 to 15-year-olds in England have used e-cigarettes. The chancellor is looking at increasing the tax after a consultation carried out by the last Conservative government. The chancellor is taking action to ensure her budget plan for a multibillion-pound increase in government borrowing to fund infrastructure projects avoids a Liz Truss-style meltdown in financial markets. Ahead of her tax and spending event on 30 October, Reeves is convening on Friday the first meeting of a taskforce of leading City figures to advise on infrastructure projects. Kemi Badenoch has criticised a Conservative MP’s suggestion she could not head the Tories because she was too -preoccupied- with her children, saying -it isn’t always women who have parental responsibilities-. Stephen Flynn, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, has written to the prime minister urging him to intervene and stop the cuts in this year’s budget. He said, in a letter seen by the PA news agency, that Starmer must -listen to voters and your own cabinet colleagues: intervene now, overrule the chancellor and stop the cuts, or people in Scotland will never forgive the Labour party-. The Home Office has recruited 200 staff to clear a backlog of 23,300 modern slavery cases left by the last government, a minister has told the Guardian. Jess Phillips, the safeguarding minister, said the department planned to end prolonged uncertainty and anguish for survivors by finalising the cases within two years.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/18/uk-politics-latest-news-labour-conservatives	2024-10-18T01:18:55-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5087de52d1d25403701e18c813c860683a61739/0_256_8192_4915/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=346af33192ae9f08574c4030e72bcc8d

Small and lethal: adapted drones carrying explosives ‘hunt’ civilians in Kherson	Ukrainians face new airborne threat that has killed 24 civilians and injured hundreds more since July Sasha Ustenko has survived three attacks by the Russian drones that stalk the streets of Kherson carrying fragmentation grenades to drop on anything that moves. The first, in late July, targeted a parked police car in central Kherson just as Ustenko walked past, throwing him to the ground. The second, in mid-August, hit a drinking water tanker as he queued for supplies, killing the driver. Ustenko was concussed, and came round to see a man lying in a pool of blood. The third time, in late September, he heard the drone buzzing above and sprinted for shelter under the branches of a cherry tree. He hoped its leaves would hide him but the grenade tumbled through the canopy and landed barely a metre away.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/drones-carrying-explosives-stalk-streets-of-kherson-ukraine-russia	2024-10-17T22:00:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e618ab5f4ec88fb13da30e78b93d77a316b98f12/0_364_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5100da98ce3cf05675de7bf2a5f000c3
