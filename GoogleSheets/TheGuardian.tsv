‘Paid actors’ appear to be behind some antisemitic attacks, Albanese says	Prime minister says recent incidents don’t appear to be motivated by ideology as Coalition demands more information Anthony Albanese says it appears some of the perpetrators behind a spate of antisemitic attacks in New South Wales and Victoria were paid actors rather than ideologically motivated offenders, seemingly confirming the target of police investigations. But the prime minister resisted the Coalition’s demands to disclose further details about the Australian Federal Police probe, suggesting it could compromise efforts to track down the alleged criminals.

Keir Starmer to give statement on Southport attack inquiry – UK politics live	Prime minister is addressing cameras from Downing Street this morning Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, has been giving interviews this morning, where he was restated Tory suggestions that ministers wrongly withheld information from the public about the Southport attacker, Axel Rudakubana, last summer. This is what Philp told Times Radio. I think it’s just important the inquiry looks at all of this, gets to the truth both about what happened beforehand, but critically also the government’s response afterwards, and what they knew when and whether they should have put more information into the public domain. It appears they withheld information about the perpetrator, potentially, on CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] advice.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/21/keir-starmer-southport-attack-labour-uk-politics-latest-news-updates	2025-01-21T00:21:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9154b4f97662079de3231fec085aa206026cab2a/2694_724_2768_1661/master/2768.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b5b3c0a3308fa68cb973870899b753f9

Trump inauguration live: president pardons January 6 rioters and exits Paris climate agreement in slew of executive orders	On his first day on office the US president sought to undo much of Joe Biden’s legacy, also vowing to ‘unleash’ oil and gas drilling and revoking birthright citizenship Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Donald Trump’s inauguration and first day in office. Immediately after his swearing-in ceremony on Monday the new US president set into motion a slew of executive orders seeking to make good on his campaign promises and undo the legacy of his predecessor Joe Biden, including the pardoning of January 6 defendant and a crackdown on immigration to the US. Trump pardoned about 1,500 January 6 defendants facing prosecution for their role in the 2021 storming of the US capitol. Among those pardoned is Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the Proud Boys, who was sentenced to 22 years in prison on seditious conspiracy charges. Trump also commuted the sentence of Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the Oath Keepers militia, who had been sentenced to 18 years in prison on sedition charges. He also signed an executive order seeking to revoke birthright citizenship – automatic citizenship for people born in the US – for the children of undocumented immigrants. Birthright citizenship is protected by the 14th amendment and the order will almost certainly be challenged in court. One order declared a -national emergency- at the southern border, paving the way to send US troops to the area and another that designated drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. He signed an executive order to, for a second time, withdraw the US from the Paris climate accords. He also declared a national energy emergency as part of a barrage of pro-fossil fuel actions and efforts to -unleash- already booming US energy production. Another order will remove the US from the World Health Organization (WHO). -World Health ripped us off, everybody rips off the United States. It’s not going to happen any more,- Trump said at the signing. The withdrawal of the US would dramatically cut funding from the global public health organization. He issued an executive order requiring federal agencies revoke the use of -gender- and -gender identity- and instead use a binary definition of -sex- in implementing policy – including in issuing passports, a move that LGBTQ+ rights groups have vowed to challenge in court. Another order reclassified thousands of federal employees as political hires, making it much easier for them to be fired. Key aides to Trump have called for mass government firings. Project 2025 made attacks on the deep or administrative state a core part of Trump’s second term. One order renamed the 617,800 sq mile Gulf of Mexico and Alaska’s 20,000ft Denali. The Gulf of Mexico will be renamed the Gulf of America, and Denali, the highest mountain in North America, will revert to Mount McKinley, which it was called before Barack Obama changed the name in 2015. The order will have no bearing on what names are used internationally. Trump also signed an executive order temporarily delaying the enforcement of a federal ban on TikTok for at least 75 days. -I guess I have a warm spot for TikTok that I didn’t have originally,- Trump said at the White House.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/21/donald-trump-inauguration-presidency-executive-orders-pardons-day-two-live-blog	2025-01-20T21:06:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cda7d9b277d8c23917d91e7d6e219ba656aa0705/0_34_4637_2783/master/4637.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c586e722261b4b85725e5119914c76b6

Why is TikTok working again in the US as Trump takes office?	App has resumed operations after saying it received assurance over de facto ban, but its future remains uncertain TikTok is restoring its service in the US after Donald Trump said he would issue an executive order when president to allow the app to continue operating.

Millions across US brace for dangerously low temperatures and winter storms	Much of the eastern US will endure some of the coldest temperatures this winter, and other regions will also see chillier than normal weather Residents across the United States from the northern plains to the tip of Maine are bracing for dangerously low temperatures as tens of millions of residents along the east coast contend with a thick blanket of snow – and more snowfall in the forecast. Winter storm warnings issued by the National Weather Service were in effect for parts of the mid-Atlantic through Monday morning, and warnings began in New England on Sunday afternoon. Heavy lake-effect snow was expected in western New York state Monday through Wednesday morning, with two to three feet (about 60 to 90cm) possible in some areas including Oswego along Lake Ontario.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/millions-brace-dangerously-low-temperatures	2025-01-20T05:29:01-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd97beab87bc047b36226d671134c1504d49d1a3/0_0_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b0c8e057ae7ce7238ac9de652ca8ca81
Freezing rain dampens mood in Washington ahead of Trump’s inauguration – photo essay	Photographer Jordan Gale documents preparations for 60th presidential inauguration, showing a US poised and polarised between hope and fear Washington is a city on edge. Concrete barriers, unscalable steel fencing and security checkpoints dot the map. In a climate of simmering political violence, and after a divisive election campaign in which he survived two assassination attempts, Donald Trump is returning to an anxious capital where more than nine in 10 voters broke for his opponent, Kamala Harris. A city of tradition and ritual will seek to accommodate the most unconventional of presidents, bringing thousands of Trump’s supporters into direct contact with the residents who feel a sense of foreboding and dread. Trump will take the oath of office under the magnificent dome of the Capitol Rotunda on Monday due to forecasts of intense cold weather, upending months of meticulous planning for a massive outdoor event with crowds sprawling down the National Mall. The swearing-in was last moved indoors in 1985, when Ronald Reagan began his second term. The rotunda was one of the areas breached during the 6 January 2021 insurrection by supporters of Trump trying to block the certification of his 2020 defeat to Joe Biden.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/cold-washington-trump-inauguration-in-pictures	2025-01-20T05:03:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9928208a042f5de7f3ed7ba0563d3a00841f7ab5/0_372_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d80232f594721b29215a210e05e7f7ee

Has South Korea just witnessed its own January 6 moment?	Protesters who stormed a Seoul court at the weekend may not have worn animal skins, but the similarities are striking They arrived intent on causing mayhem. The political figurehead they supported had, they said, been the victim of a grave injustice at the hands of the establishment. The ringleaders had soon broken through security cordons, armed with fire extinguishers, steel pipes and police shields, smashing windows and gaining entry to a government building, leaving destruction worth an estimated £400,000 in their wake. The scene of the riot was not the US Capitol building on 6 January 2021, and the mobs attempting to overturn the rule of law had swapped animal skins and bald eagle masks for hooded down jackets and face masks. But the similarities between Maga ideologues’ attempts to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election, and the far-right protesters who stormed the Seoul Western district court building this weekend in support of the impeached South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, are hard to ignore.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/20/has-south-korea-just-witnessed-its-own-january-6-moment	2025-01-20T04:42:41-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2a6e7cce0737b6f9e49c28e95f364b84edfb5b1/0_398_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=011161c3ec07022572ec05c53efd8714

Donald Trump takes power as US braces for vengeful second term | First Thing	Incoming president has promised retaliation against his opponents. Plus, billionaire wealth grew $2tn in 2024 Good morning. The United States braces for a new era of disruption and division on Monday with Donald Trump scheduled to be sworn in as its 47th president, promising a blitz of executive orders and radical shake-up of the global order. What did Trump promise yesterday? -We’re going to stop the invasion of our borders … We’re going to unlock the liquid gold that’s right under our feet … We’re going to bring back law and order to our cities … We’re going to get radical woke ideology the hell out of our military.- How are some assessing the Biden administration?

Internationally, Biden -was assuming a world that no longer existed- – with calamitous results – but domestically, Biden -consolidated the break- with -failed market fundamentalism-. What is the status of the three Israelis? On Sunday, three women held hostage by Hamas in tunnels beneath Gaza – Emily Damari, 28, Romi Gonen, 24 and Doron Steinbrecher, 31 – were released and reunited with their mothers. Videos showed them in apparently reasonable health. Were there any obstacles? Yes, a three-hour delay to the start of the truce, during which Israeli warplanes and artillery pounded the Gaza Strip. The delay meant a further 13 people were killed, Palestinian health authorities said. At least two missiles hit a family travelling on a donkey cart as they tried to return home, Al Jazeera reported.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/first-thing-donald-trump-takes-power-as-us-braces-for-vengeful-second-term	2025-01-20T04:00:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42d5306728c12f3c84eccde3f020ffd772890eb5/0_0_4535_2722/master/4535.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=81aa44a433400cc2e3c0f4c74c27fba8
Alaska to resume ‘barbaric’ shooting of bears and wolves from helicopters	Renewed program would allow hunters to eliminate up to 80% of the animals on 20,000 acres of state land Alaska is set to resume the aerial gunning of bears and wolves as a population control measure aimed at boosting caribou and moose herd numbers, even as the state’s own evaluation of the practice cast doubt on its effectiveness. The renewed program would allow hunters to eliminate up to 80% of the animals on 20,000 acres of state land. Environmental groups opposed to what they label a -barbaric- practice of shooting wildlife from helicopters is more about sport than scientific practice in part because hunters want caribou populations to increase because they are trophy animals.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/alaska-aerial-gunning-bears-wolves	2025-01-20T04:00:01-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b54e773f36d682e29ee03ac6542d2ae3a33cb44d/109_715_2142_1285/master/2142.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1c0d86a4fb6dd411a622a0875b80e6b8

CNN defamation case foreshadows Trump media crackdown, experts say	Contractor Zachary Young wins damages over Afghanistan story in trial notable for prosecution’s aggressive stance A combative defamation trial in Florida, involving CNN and a former US security contractor in Afghanistan, is providing a roadmap for a crackdown on media independence during the second Trump administration, experts believe. The case was already unusual because CNN chose to defend itself and risk millions in damages, while other media giants such as ABC News and the Washington Post have opted to back down in the face of threats of persecution from the incoming president. Ultimately, after 18 hours of deliberation, the jury found that CNN defamed the contractor and awarded Zachary Young $4m in lost business and $1m in personal damages.	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jan/20/cnn-defamation-trial	2025-01-20T03:00:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b773cd83540a325b05e2522361377a6ab8a21d11/0_48_3754_2253/master/3754.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=080bd0d5a48c0a1e998188ba7afd6d02
US will want Chagos Islands deal reversed, Trump’s ex-national security adviser suggests – UK politics live	Westminster is preparing for Donald Trump’s second term ahead of the US president’s inauguration in Washington Good morning. Donald Trump becomes president of the United States for the second time today and in Westminster, as across the rest of the word, supporters are giddy with excitement, while opponents feel this is a moment for epoch-defining dread. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader and Britain’s leading Trump evangelist, has got so carried away that he has told an interviewer he thinks there is a 20/25% chance that he could be prime minister by the time Trump leaves office (January 2029). It’s not impossible; but few other people would put his chances as high as one in four. Most people in Labour politics, privately at least, regard Trump with horror, but the government has to work with him and Keir Starmer, who has invested a lot of effort in trying to establish a decent personal relationship with the new president, has issued a statement sending Trump his -warmest congratulations- on his inauguration. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, was on the Today programme this morning and, when asked if he he had changed his mind about Trump since the days when he used to denounce him in the strongest possible terms, he said his approach to foreign policy was grounded in -progressive realism-, taking the world as it is. He went on to praise the Trump he met when he and Starmer had dinner with him in New York in September last year. The Donald Trump I met … had incredible grace, generosity, very keen to be a good host, very funny, very, very, very friendly, very warm, I have to say, about the UK, our royal family, Scotland, his relationship with Scotland, his mother. That was the Donald Trump I found. There was a survey this week – 70% of the world welcomed Donald Trump coming to power, 70% of the world, much of that worried about authoritarian actors, actually quite like the fact that Donald Trump keeps them guessing. I think surrendering the Chagos Islands, or putting the Chagos Islands in a situation where they can easily be coerced, by the Chinese Communist Party for example, I hope it’s a position that we see reversed here by Donald Trump, and by the UK government. The Pentagon, the State Department and the White House under the last administration pored through this deal. There was an interagency process, [they] said it was a good deal. It’s right and proper that the new administration is able to consider it. But having gone through the deal in detail, it’s the right deal to keep the global community safe, and I emphasize the importance of that military base and those assets on Diego Garcia that we’ve been working together with with the United States now for all of my lifetime.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/20/us-chagos-islands-deal-david-lammy-uk-politics-live-news-updates	2025-01-20T01:35:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a4433649573bce788cf9c32bd2b31c3554b67db/423_483_5895_3537/master/5895.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ba4684d22839eb21aa9a5cad6a952472

‘A vicious circle’: how the roof blew off Spain’s housing crisis	Rents spiral and neighbourhoods lose charm as cities report tourist flat boom and surge in housing speculation Ciutat Vella, the old city of Barcelona, was once quirky and mysterious. Now it has become a parody of itself, a place from which the local population has been exiled in the interests of tourism and maturing investments. Doorways have sprouted combination key safes, a telltale sign of an apartment given over to tourist lets. A 100-year-old apothecary and shirtmaker that stood on La Rambla for two centuries have been replaced by shops selling flamenco dolls and ceramic bulls.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/20/a-vicious-circle-how-the-roof-blew-off-spains-housing-crisis	2025-01-19T23:00:17-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2afe60207dd03a0e08e213897e0a2a8997e0a0a9/0_42_5085_3050/master/5085.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4f2bc5a6da16900b3defd8023154558b
South Australia proposes law for bigger garages to stop street parking being ‘overrun’ with SUVs	Plan sparks debate about use of urban space, housing costs and investment in public transport amid climate crisis South Australia is proposing laws that will force developers to build bigger garages in new homes, in an effort to stop cars too big for standard off-street parking from crowding suburban streets. Under the plan, which is still in the consultation process, residential car park sizes will have to be half a metre wider and 60cm longer to accommodate big cars and dual-cab utes. The size of a single car park, under the proposed changes, would be 3.5m wide and 6m long.

Ninety Palestinians released by Israel as Gaza ceasefire enters second day – live	Palestinian detainees greeted with joy in West Bank after earlier release of three Israeli hostages on Sunday Hello and welcome to our live coverage of major developments in the Israel-Gaza war after a long-awaited ceasefire in Gaza came into effect on Sunday. In the hours since, hostage and prisoner exchanges have been carried out on both sides. Ninety Palestinian prisoners were released early on Monday as part of the ceasefire deal. Those freed from Israeli prisons included 69 women and 21 teenage boys from the West Bank and Jerusalem, according to Hamas. The prisoners, most of whom were freed from Ofer prison in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, were welcomed by thousands of people celebrating. It followed the release of three Israeli women held hostage by Hamas in tunnels beneath Gaza, ending a protracted ordeal that began with their violent abduction by Hamas on 7 October 2023. Among those released was joint British national Emily Damari, 28, who was freed alongside Romi Gonen, 24 and Doron Steinbrecher, 31. The women have been reunited with their mothers after being handed over by International Committee for the Red Cross. The three are in a -stable condition- and will be monitored for a few days, according to a news conference at Sheba Medical Center in Tel Aviv. A member of the hospital staff, Professor Itai Pessach, said: -I’m happy to report that they are in stable condition. That allows us and them to focus on what is the most important thing for now – reuniting with the families.- As the fighting ceased, hundreds of aid trucks queued to enter Gaza to deliver supplies to its 2.3 million residents, 90% of whom have been displaced by the conflict, many multiple times. The World Health Organization says it is ready to pour much-needed aid into Gaza during the Israel-Hamas truce, but that it would need -systematic access- across the territory to do so. Much of the Gaza Strip’s health infrastructure has been destroyed by the more than year-long war. The first phase of the truce took effect after a three-hour delay during which Israeli warplanes and artillery pounded the Gaza Strip. The last-minute blitz killed 13 people, Palestinian health authorities said. Israel claimed it had struck terrorists although Al Jazeera reported that at least two missiles hit a family travelling on a donkey cart as they tried to return home. Thousands of displaced Palestinians have started to return home, many to destroyed buildings and homes in ruins. There is no detailed plan in place to govern Gaza after the war, much less rebuild it. Nine in 10 homes have been destroyed as well as schools, hospitals, shops, mosques and cemeteries. Under the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which is to last 42 days, the militant group has agreed to release 33 hostages including children, women (including female soldiers) and men aged over 50, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli jails. In the second phase, the remaining living hostages are due to be sent back and a corresponding ratio of Palestinian prisoners will be freed, and Israel will completely withdraw from the territory. The specifics are subject to further negotiations, which are due to start 16 days into the first phase. The third phase will address the exchange of bodies of deceased hostages and Hamas members, and a reconstruction plan for Gaza will be launched. Arrangements for future governance of the strip remain hazy.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/20/israel-gaza-ceasefire-live-blog-updates-hostages-palestinian-detainees-released	2025-01-19T21:27:29-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e198aaf878d9a84788c00737a1f113e58142c15c/0_0_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5fad60e65bf5ad363352bf7980fe0284

In a social media post on Sunday the president-elect promised he would sign an executive order after taking office on Monday.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/19/trump-tiktok-ban-executive-order	2025-01-19T09:17:21-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bf47e3305ab2f1b2e24d0b0e8164c226f892cdb/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=92384ae1ee39eda3bb0bd4c024f05f05

Gaza ceasefire has come into effect but will the Israel-Hamas agreement hold?	Three-phase deal requires new negotiations to advance and is highly vulnerable amid little trust between the sides The hours-long delay in implementing the Gaza ceasefire agreement is not a good omen for a deal that many fear could be doomed to failure as it moves through its challenging three phases.

Biden posthumously pardons civil rights leader Marcus Garvey	Activist who was convicted of mail fraud in the 1920s influenced Malcolm X and other leader leaders President Joe Biden on Sunday posthumously pardoned Black nationalist Marcus Garvey, who influenced Malcolm X and other civil rights leaders and was convicted of mail fraud in the 1920s. Also receiving pardons were a top Virginia lawmaker and advocates for immigrant rights, criminal justice reform and gun violence prevention. Congressional leaders had pushed for Biden to pardon Garvey, with supporters arguing that Garvey’s conviction was politically motivated and an effort to silence the increasingly popular leader who spoke of racial pride. After Garvey was convicted, he was deported to Jamaica, where he was born. He died in 1940.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/19/biden-pardons-marcus-garvey	2025-01-19T07:33:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e29364b501988f63a968a94ad768bc869f198400/17_111_4140_2485/master/4140.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bf4a13e80a54feed69b669bf58818b91

Who banned TikTok? Politicians toss culpability like a football	Claiming a threat from a ‘foreign adversary’, the US has yet to prove China shared propaganda or collected US user data The United States of America deleted TikTok early on the morning of 19 January. A government formed -by the people, for the people-, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, has made scant evidence available to those people as to why. As those in power at the 11th hour realize how unpopular such a paternalistic move might be, each is doing their best to lay blame with the others. Why did the US ban an app used and beloved by some 170 million Americans? For fear of China’s propaganda and data collection. It’s a far-reaching, unprecedented move. The text of the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, passed in April and signed by Joe Biden, reads: -This bill prohibits distributing, maintaining, or providing internet hosting services for a foreign adversary controlled application (eg, TikTok).- Both a federal appeals court and the US supreme court have affirmed that rationale as sufficient.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/19/tiktok-ban-culpability	2025-01-19T06:00:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ad177ca3552e3e3900ce789545ac74332ffd578/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d732af4b390fef33c89ad2b89733777a

‘This is about witnesses speaking their truth’: Prince Harry gets his day in court against Murdoch’s newspapers	The Duke of Sussex and the former Labour deputy leader Tom Watson are the last two claimants still suing An extraordinary personal legal battle which has been years in preparation is to pit one of the most famous members of the British royal family against the world’s best-known media baron this week. On Tuesday Prince Harry’s lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper group, owners of the Sun and the now defunct News of the World, will officially begin at the High Court in London. Fifth in line to the throne, King Charles’s younger son lives in self-imposed exile in California, but is due to appear in court in person once the case gets fully under way next month.

He sees himself as the last man standing in a struggle to get the newspapers to take legal responsibility for the crimes he and others have alleged. Another surviving case brought by Lord Watson, the former Labour deputy leader, will be heard alongside the Prince’s.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/19/this-is-about-witnesses-speaking-their-truth-prince-harry-gets-his-day-in-court-against-murdochs-newspapers	2025-01-19T04:00:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/310121fdb5ba29dac6a9525243a53a35ba7868e3/0_231_6930_4157/master/6930.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3815485c515fa2b6ae10e2914cb9abe2

‘Everything, everywhere, all at once’: what will Trump 2.0 unleash?	On Monday the 47th president will be sworn in – and critics say Trump’s second term will be more radical than his first Come 12pm on Monday, on what is expected to be a bone-chillingly cold day, it will be done. Donald Trump, a convicted criminal described as a fascist by some who worked for him, will placed his hand on a Bible and and again be sworn in as president of the United States. The 45th and 47th president will then deliver an inaugural address that sets out his agenda for the next four years. His speech eight years ago became synonymous with the phrase -American carnage-. This time he may promise a new -golden age- of America. But the content and tone of his remarks will be dissected for clues to what Trump 2.0 has in store for America and the world.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/jan/19/trump-white-house-presidency	2025-01-19T03:00:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/478a0b866c8c529ce7ddddcaddf1595adaa5c43c/0_183_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f85661bf59abbc2153a23c1bb4f6391d

‘Animals can feel good and evil’: film puts new perspective on Ukraine war	Collection of seven shorts due out in 2025 tells story of conflict from perspective of animals The occupying Russian soldiers paid little attention to the elderly woman shuffling through the farmland surrounding the villages outside Kyiv, taking her goat to pasture. But she was focused closely on them. After locating their positions, she headed back home with the goat, and later called her grandson, a soldier in the Ukrainian army, to give the coordinates. The story is one of seven episodes, based on real events from the first year of Russia’s full-scale invasion but lightly fictionalised, that make up a feature film about the war in Ukraine, due out later this year. All seven of the shorts have one thing in common: they tell the story of the conflict from the perspective of animals.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/19/animals-can-feel-good-and-evil-film-puts-new-perspective-on-ukraine-war	2025-01-19T00:00:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02ab8134f621d8d5ac387f2b118ba00b41ba7a55/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=52e84069efb205d4ba2a07eb88f161a4
From GDP to trade, how well equipped is China’s economy for Trump 2.0? | Amy Hawkins	Beijing has prepared for increased tariffs but its actions will not be enough to offset falling demand from the US When Donald Trump enters the White House for the second time on 20 January, the view from the Oval Office will look very different to the one he encountered in 2017. A pandemic, the war in Ukraine and a trade war with China have caused ripples through the global economy that are still being felt midway through the decade. Beijing will be watching closely. Trump has promised to impose tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese imports, partly in retaliation for the flow of fentanyl from China to the US.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/19/gdp-trade-china-economy-trump	2025-01-18T23:00:49-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb72f3ab55755589695f00c36a1efefc1dd61c86/0_114_3419_2052/master/3419.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=824bda971dad7c54e0c92e7fccdede02

Frankenstein inspired by suicide of Mary Shelley’s half-sister, book reveals	New collection of author’s diary entries provides tragic insight Frankenstein’s monster, as horror fans know, did not really spark into life with a bolt of lightning, but was born inside the mind of Mary Shelley during a dreary holiday on a ­mountainside above Geneva. The inspiration came as volcanic ash clouds unexpectedly blocked out the sun that summer of 1816 and she and her friends, including the ­infamous, -bad boy- poets Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley, ­competed to tell scary stories. But a new collection of the young author’s personal diary entries, out in March, provides strong evidence that, although the stay in the Alps set the grim mood of her novel, her imagination was ignited by something ­personal and much closer to home.	https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/19/frankenstein-inspired-by-suicide-of-mary-shelley-half-sister-fanny-imlay-book-reveals	2025-01-18T22:00:49-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d46104c1c19661d008087a3342872c982ce4521b/0_274_2747_1649/master/2747.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ec3651043c859062bfd14495c3d1ae17

Israel-Gaza war live: Israeli forces reportedly withdrawing from parts of Rafah ahead of ceasefire	Reports say Israeli troops start moving from southern Gaza city to Philadelphi corridor on border with Egypt before truce set to begin at 8.30am local time Welcome to our live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war. It’s 7.22am in Tel Aviv and Gaza City and we are under 90 minutes away from the ceasefire and hostage release agreement between Israel and Hamas being scheduled to come into effect at 8.30am local time (6.30am GMT) on Sunday. Here’s a recap of the latest news. Israeli forces have started withdrawing from areas in Gaza’s Rafah to the Philadelphi corridor along the border between Egypt and Gaza, Reuters has cited pro-Hamas media as reporting early on Sunday. Benjamin Netanyahu said the first stage of the deal was temporary, adding: -If we must return to fighting, we will do that in new, forceful ways.- The prime minister added that both Donald Trump and Joe Biden back Israel’s -right to resume fighting if the second stage is fruitless-. Netanyahu also said Israel would not go ahead with the ceasefire deal until it received a list of the 33 hostages kidnapped by Hamas in the deal’s first phase. -Israel will not tolerate violations of the agreement. The sole responsibility lies with Hamas.- Hamas said on Saturday that the mechanism of the release of Israeli hostages it held in Gaza would depend on the number of detained Palestinians Israel would free. Hamas also said Israel had -failed to achieve its aggressive goals- in Gaza. Under the ceasefire agreement, the three-stage truce starts with an initial six-week phase when hostages held by the militant group will be exchanged for Palestinians detained in jails across Israel. Israeli forces have killed at least 46,899 Palestinians and injured 110,725 since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in an update on Saturday. It said 23 Palestinians were killed and 83 were injured over the past 24 hours. Yemen’s Houthis claimed an attack on a US aircraft carrier on Sunday and warned of -consequences- for any retaliation during the coming Gaza ceasefire. The Israeli military said it intercepted two missiles fired from Yemen on Saturday. The military activated air raid sirens in Jerusalem and in parts of central and southern Israel ahead of the interceptions.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/19/israel-gaza-ceasefire-live-news-updates	2025-01-18T21:22:46-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/225cf25bf2144ee5963867d1674c0945cbdba435/0_84_7500_4500/master/7500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c529f7eff3834b80bdd2e84d0ffb78ca

Rebranded and reorganized, the protest was given a new name by organizers, the People’s March, as a means to broaden support, especially during a difficult and introspective time for progressive organizing after Donald Trump’s decisive win in November.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/18/womens-march-peoples-march	2025-01-18T11:24:16-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c05884250bb3402093f80fbfd7f3a4659781ef9/0_171_5122_3074/master/5122.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=87860a48d4ee502f506299561527836f
Mined diamonds are a waste of money, an expert says. Here’s why	Lab-grown diamonds sell for one-quarter of the price of traditional ones and an Australian wholesale broker says he can’t tell the difference When Steve Richards, a gemologist trained to identify grades of precious jewels, was considering a Christmas present for his wife, he settled on a pair of diamond earrings. These diamonds, however, were not formed deep in the Earth over millions, or billions, of years, and brought to the surface through volcanic eruptions. They were grown in a lab over a matter of weeks, and bought for a fraction of the price.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/19/mined-and-lab-grown-diamonds-difference-can-you-tell-prices	2025-01-18T11:00:35-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08fe5ea1c23caef5b38602e10b77672296c64402/462_478_7369_4421/master/7369.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=28df5328e4c73e968ece9aae3f44ea69
Fema’s message to LA wildfire victims: ‘carefully consider’ GoFundMe appeals	Having a GoFundMe does not disqualify someone from aid – but it might affect their eligibility to cover specific needs After the house that she grew up in burned down in the Eaton fire in Altadena, California, last week, Steven Celiceo’s wife Kiri suggested that the couple visit the local library.

The couple had heard some concerning claims on social media and wanted to sort fact from fiction. Like hundreds of other Angelenos, Celiceo had launched a GoFundMe for his in-laws – but rumors were floating around that its existence could prevent the family from receiving badly needed funds.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/18/los-angeles-wildfires-fema-gofundme	2025-01-18T11:00:34-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4bd75ae7c29f86f043689c26a8b32ea4cae2ae7/0_149_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ebc4fc367a848f34abfa68838cb2eb51

‘It’s an absolute travesty’: fears for border wildlife as Trump takes office	Environmentalists are braced for new construction on the president’s signature border wall – and the damage that would wreak During Donald Trump’s first presidential term, he began an ambitious and costly border militarization program, including the construction of over 450 miles of wall that severed wildlife corridors and fragmented ecosystems in some of the country’s most remote and biodiverse regions.

Home Office accused of ‘blocking’ people stuck in war zones from joining family in UK	FoI figures show Home Office apparently refusing to use biometrics waiver for people who have no way to submit them The UK government’s family reunification policy has been criticised by charities and MPs after new data revealed how Home Office bureaucracy was making it impossible for people stranded in war zones, such as Gaza and Sudan, to reunite with family members in the UK. Existing policy is supposed to allow those in need of resettlement the opportunity to join relatives in the UK. In order to apply for family reunion visas, applicants must submit biometrics – usually a fingerprint and a photograph – at appointments at a visa application centre (VAC) in their country of residence.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/18/home-office-accused-of-blocking-people-stuck-in-war-zones-from-joining-family-in-uk	2025-01-18T04:38:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87f3b8af33c594aa3359f183f0aeadad5d6a0ba3/0_44_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b33ba8c0a5f4c5423f5c1144e56fc5fb
‘You can’t be pro-billionaire and pro-working class’: Biden’s labor chief on return of Trump	Julie Su, acting labor secretary, fears many of Biden’s pro-worker policies will be undone by the new administration Even as Donald Trump says he will battle for America’s workers, the acting secretary of labor, Julie Su, is voicing fears that Trump will undo many of Joe Biden’s pro-worker policies, which include protecting workers from extreme heat and extending overtime pay to millions more workers. In an interview with the Guardian, Su said that Trump might fall far short on delivering for workers considering the first Trump administration’s many anti-worker policies and in light of his having Elon Musk and other billionaires advising him. -It’s one thing to say you’re pro-worker, and it’s quite another thing to do it,- Su said. -You can’t be pro-billionaire and pro-working class.

‘All hands on deck’: Bird flu in US poultry puts state cooperation to the test	Unusually late migration season means poultry operations may continue to see H5N1 outbreaks, officials say Maryland has detected bird flu among three different commercial poultry flocks in the past week, marking the state’s first outbreak in more than a year. The discoveries come shortly after the establishment of a joint command with Delaware following the latter state’s detection of H5N1 in two other poultry operations. Although the deadly bird flu has circulated in North America since 2022, the past few months have been especially brutal for the poultry industry. More than 20 million egg-laying hens died in the fall, the worst rates since the outbreak began, and egg prices have risen as a result.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/18/bird-flu-poultry-delaware-maryland	2025-01-18T03:00:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/995865c771e8300d85d42acccf17054071140cf5/0_98_5388_3232/master/5388.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0bf8786951ad3d4bd45743e8ebc86b9f

The slickness and professionalism of Trump’s 2024 operation, with its sharp messaging making inroads with black and Hispanic voters, seemed a far cry from his shambolic 2016 campaign.

Middle East crisis live: Israel says 737 prisoners to initially be freed after cabinet approves Gaza ceasefire	Israeli justice ministry says the Palestinian prisoners and detainees will be released as part of truce’s first phase, under which Hamas is to free 33 hostages Welcome to our live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war. It’s approaching 8am in in Tel Aviv and Gaza City – here’s a snapshot of the latest news. Israel’s cabinet approved a deal with Palestinian militant group Hamas for a ceasefire and release of hostages in the Gaza Strip, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said on Saturday, a day ahead of the agreement’s scheduled start. Lead US negotiator Brett McGurk said after the Israeli cabinet approval that the plan was moving forward on track. The White House expected the ceasefire to start on Sunday morning, with three female hostages to be released to Israel on Sunday afternoon through the Red Cross. Under the deal, the three-stage ceasefire starts with an initial six-week phase when hostages held by Hamas will be exchanged for prisoners detained by Israel. Thirty-three of the 98 remaining Israeli hostages, including women, children, and men over 50, were due to be freed in this phase. Israel will release all Palestinian women and children under 19 in Israeli jails by the end of the first phase. The ceasefire deal was bitterly opposed by some hardliners in the Israeli cabinet, with media reports saying 24 ministers in Netanyahu’s coalition government voted in favour of the deal while eight opposed it. National security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir threatened to resign if it was approved but said he would not bring down the government. His fellow hardliner Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, also threatened to quit the government if it did not go back to war to defeat Hamas after the first six-week phase of the ceasefire. The Israeli high court is still scheduled to hear petitions against elements of the ceasefire deal but it is widely expected not to intervene. Negotiators from Egypt, Qatar, the US and Israel had agreed on -all necessary arrangements to implement- the Gaza ceasefire deal, Egyptian media reported. During Friday’s talks, which reportedly ended -on a positive note-, negotiators agreed to form a joint operations room in Cairo to -ensure effective coordination- and compliance with the truce terms, it said. Under the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which is to last 42 days and take effect from Sunday, Hamas has agreed to release 33 hostages including children, women – including female soldiers – and those aged over 50. In exchange, Israel will release 50 Palestinian prisoners for every female Israeli soldier released by Hamas, and 30 for other female hostages. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said French-Israeli citizens Ofer Kalderon and Ohad Yahalomi were in the first group of hostages to be freed by Hamas. Israel’s justice ministry released a list of 95 Palestinians held in Israeli prisoners to be freed in the first exchange, including 25 male prisoners, all under the age of 21, and 70 female prisoners. One of the most well-known individuals on the list is Palestinian parliament member and feminist lawmaker Khalida Jarrar. At least 115 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the ceasefire deal was announced on Wednesday, the Palestinian health ministry said on Friday, while medics said another five were killed in an Israeli airstrike early on Saturday in the Mawasi area west of Khan Younis. Gaza’s health ministry said at least 46,876 people have been killed and 110,642 injured in more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/18/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-says-737-prisoners-to-initially-be-freed-after-cabinet-approves-gaza-ceasefire	2025-01-17T22:04:58-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/895eeb20d77aefa7e1b2c6d5957825e3e99c5cc6/0_265_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=82e1a7c1951c9292243a41301921bbd9

A vote on final passage was scheduled for early next week, making it potentially one of the first pieces of legislation he signs as president.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/17/laken-riley-act-democrats-undocumented-immigrants	2025-01-17T11:49:40-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23826e5e3bb09d492a7b49dd425fa9a4fb607d32/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4e5bcfe79490040cb2e6af60c30964fb

How have the California wildfires affected Hollywood?	The ongoing devastation has impacted this year’s awards season, raising questions over the Oscars and Grammys The California wildfires have to date killed at least 25 people, destroyed or damaged more than 12,000 structures and put about 300,000 people on evacuation orders. It has also had a major impact on business, most notably that of Hollywood.

Supreme court to release opinions as TikTok decision looms – live	US supreme court to release opinions at 10am ET as a challenge to a law that will ban TikTok on Sunday awaits a decision Good morning, US politics blog readers. The supreme court has announced it will release opinions at 10am ET today, as a challenge to a law that will ban TikTok on Sunday unless its China-based owner sells its US business awaits the justices’ decision. As usual, the court did not say how many opinions will be released or on which cases, and thus we will just have to wait an hour or so to find out. Should they decide the TikTok case, we do have some hints on how the justices may rule – in oral arguments last week, they seemed inclined to uphold the law. Meanwhile, we are in the final days of Joe Biden’s administration, and the Democratic president is making some last-minute moves ahead of Donald Trump’s arrival on Monday. This morning, he announced clemency for about 2,500 people convicted of non-violent drug offenses, as well as 15 more prescription drugs that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for. Biden still could have more executive actions planned before he leaves office, including preemptive pardons to Trump’s enemies. We’ll let you know if he announces anything else today. If the TikTok ban is allowed to stand, the Biden administration does not plan to enforce it, NBC News reports. Kristi Noem, the South Dakota governor who Trump picked for homeland security chief, has her Senate confirmation hearing at 9am today. Israel’s cabinet just approved the Gaza ceasefire deal.

‘Everyone thought it would cause gridlock’: the highway that Seoul turned into a stream	Cheonggyecheon stream in the South Korean capital has become an attraction – and helps with flood management, fighting air pollution and cooling the city On a crisp December morning, office workers and tourists stroll along a tree-lined stream in central Seoul, pausing on stepping stones that cross its flowing waters. It’s difficult to imagine that just over 20 years ago, this was a vast elevated highway carrying 168,000 cars daily through the heart of South Korea’s capital. Cheonggyecheon, a stream that runs for about 3.5 miles (nearly 6km) through Seoul, was one of the earliest experiments in an increasing trend in cities globally: turning spaces where there was once car or rail infrastructure into spaces for pedestrians and cyclists. It’s a powerful example of the way that these spaces can become loved and popular, along with projects such as the High Line in New York, where an old railway track has been turned into a raised park, or the city moat in Utrecht, where a multi-lane road (nicknamed the -motorway from nothing to nowhere-) was converted back into a canal, in part of a huge continuing push to allow pedestrians and cyclists to dominate the city’s centre.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/17/seoul-cheonggyecheon-motorway-turned-into-a-stream	2025-01-16T22:00:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc1f4407598278f21fb2bb022431678444304ed6/0_216_6480_3888/master/6480.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7621aeec72978d8563d9dbdc053a2ea9

Punitive measures were imposed, diplomatic visits cancelled and Belgium even suggested the EU could do without the Alpine country. That was when the far-right party was only a junior coalition partner. This time, the FPÖ – nativist, anti-immigration and fiercely critical of the EU – is in the driving seat. Its leader, Herbert Kickl, is in pole position to be Austria’s next chancellor.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/17/austria-is-set-for-a-far-right-chancellor-for-the-eu-its-the-new-normal	2025-01-16T21:00:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e8cb4b407979395a893ebd7dbbcac3c5100715d/0_22_7771_4663/master/7771.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=448e25c64ee81b59853372f60ce6f85b

Gaza ceasefire-hostage deal reached, Israel PM’s office says – live	Benjamin Netanyahu’s office says in statement that security cabinet will meet on Friday following earlier delays in talks to release hostages in return for ceasefire Welcome to our live coverage of the Middle East crisis. Here’s a snapshot of the latest news. Senior US officials insisted the hard-won ceasefire would go into effect on Sunday as planned despite the unexpected delay. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he was -very confident- that the ceasefire would go forward and he -fully expects that implementation will begin, as we said, on Sunday-. He confirmed that there had been a -loose end- between the sides in the complex negotiations. US representatives are still believed to be actively involved with talks in Doha on the final details needed to get the deal over the line. A vote is now expected to take place on Friday morning, Israeli media reported. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s hardline national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, announced on Thursday evening that he would quit the government if it ratifies the ceasefire deal, calling it -irresponsible- and -reckless-. Ben-Gvir’s departure would not bring down Netanyahu’s government. Opposition leader Yair Lapid pledged his support for Netanyahu, saying that the deal was -more important than any disagreement we’ve ever had.- Fighting has continued in Gaza despite expectations of a ceasefire, with at least 80 Palestinians killed and hundreds more injured by Israeli airstrikes since the ceasefire announcement, according to the civil defence agency. The Israeli military said that it had conducted strikes on -approximately 50 terror targets- across Gaza since late Wednesday. A civil defence spokesperson said its teams had recovered the bodies of five children after a strike on the northern city of Jabalia. More than 46,788 Palestinians have been killed and a further 110,453 wounded by Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, according to the latest figures by the territory’s health ministry on Thursday. They include 81 killed and 188 injured in the past 24 hours. Among them was Fatin Shaqoura-Salha, the chief of nursing staff at Al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat, ActionAid said. The ceasefire agreement, announced on Wednesday, was due to come into effect on Sunday. In the first phase, to last 42 days, Hamas agreed to release 33 hostages and in exchange, Israel would release 50 Palestinian prisoners for every female Israeli soldier released by Hamas, and 30 for other hostages. Palestinians displaced from their homes would be allowed to move freely around Gaza, wounded people would be vacuated for treatment abroad, and aid to the territory should increase to 600 trucks a day. A second phase would include Israel completely withdrawing from Gaza. The leader of Yemen’s Houthis, Abdul-Malik Badr al-Din al-Houthi, said the Iran-aligned group would suspend their attacks on Red Sea targets but continue if Israel backtracks on the ceasefire. The Houthi attacks have damaged as many as 30 ships and caused a diversion of commercial shipping to South Africa and the Cape of Good Hope. Reprisals by the US, Israel and the UK have damaged key Yemen ports and led to multiple deaths. Arab states are urging Israel and the incoming Trump administration to allow the Palestinian Authority (PA), in conjunction with the UN Palestinian relief agency Unrwa, to oversee Gaza’s recovery. The future governance of Gaza is due to be discussed at the start of negotiations on the second stage of the deal 16 days after a ceasefire begins.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/17/israel-hamas-ceasefire-deal-gaza-live-blog-updates-netanyahu-hostages	2025-01-16T18:53:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91ac90403a4de17a5a6eb34b2044f4a159c48269/0_306_4590_2754/master/4590.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e262ed8740934321113eb600735870c6

‘Rort has gone on for too long’: RBA should ban all debit surcharges, Labor MPs say	Calls for central bank to reduce ‘unfair’ costs for consumers and stop businesses ‘being gouged’ Six Labor MPs are urging the Reserve Bank to ban all surcharges for every debit transaction and dramatically reduce merchant fees for businesses, asking the central bank to go further than the government’s pledge to stop surcharges only on card payments. Jerome Laxale, the member for Bennelong, called the extra fees people pay to use their own money a -rort-, and said the RBA needed to step up. He led a submission, with five Labor colleagues, to the RBA’s review of card payment surcharging, saying the system needed major updates beyond those the government had already committed to.

‘A flood of disinformation’: rumors and lies abound amid ongoing LA wildfires	Disasters have long led to misinformation as people grasp for control, but the consequences can be life and death The Hollywood sign was not on fire. Firefighters weren’t using women’s purses to put out fires. A fish is not responsible for the blazes. The Los Angeles fire department didn’t see big budget cuts. The fires were not started deliberately as some kind of mass plot related to high-speed rail or the 2028 Olympics. Firefighting efforts did not include spraying a mood stabilizer into the air to put locals into a trance. Diversity measures are not to blame. Fires are still burning in Los Angeles, and with them has come a near-constant stream of rumors, half-truths, conspiracy theories and outright lies. Natural disasters have long led to the spread of misinformation as people try to make sense of destruction and grasp for control when the world around them is destroyed. In the aftermath of the disaster, a lot is still unknown: what caused it, what could have prevented it, who could be to blame.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/16/disinformation-los-angeles-wildfires	2025-01-16T06:00:19-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45fbcc8e41481899fb95029ead029aed6d456d9b/0_371_7451_4473/master/7451.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=44c6ffe223b8652560b594544504a018
Melbourne woman’s fight to keep NDIS support raises legal questions about agency’s ‘troubling’ processes	Tribunal decision for 54-year-old Veronica Stephan-Miller suggests onus of proof should be on NDIA, not recipient, before revoking benefits A tribunal has questioned whether it is lawful for the National Disability Insurance Agency to require that participants provide renewed evidence of their eligibility before revoking their access, describing the approach as -troubling-. The Administrative Review Tribunal on Wednesday granted a 54-year-old Melbourne woman with disability, Veronica Stephan-Miller, the right to continue accessing the National Disability Insurance Scheme while she appealed against the agency’s decision last year to remove her from it.

NSW government asks private sector to take public hospital patients as hundreds of psychiatrists set to resign	Exclusive: Guardian Australia has seen an email from the director of Australia’s largest private mental health provider about the contract The NSW government is considering moving public psychiatry patients into private hospitals in preparation for the mass resignation of the state’s psychiatrists next week, but doctors warn the panicked response will not help the -droves of people with significant illness and crises-. At least 205 psychiatrists will resign on Tuesday after 16 months of negotiations over the workforce crisis, with the government not agreeing to the psychiatrist’s proposed solution – a special levy increasing their pay by 25%, similar to that which emergency doctors received in 2015.

Syrians in Germany ask to be allowed to visit home and keep protected status	Refugee organisations say many want to ‘go and have a look’ after fall of Assad regime but fear losing asylum rights Syrians in Germany have called on the government to allow them to travel to their home country for short visits without risking their protection status, as questions mount over how the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime will affect the millions of Syrians who live in Europe. More than a month after a lightning advance by rebels toppled the Assad family’s 54-year rule, the residency status of many Syrians across Europe remains in limbo. A dozen or so countries across the bloc responded to the regime’s ousting by suspending the processing of asylum application from Syrians, with Austria going one step further to say it was preparing a -repatriation and deportation- programme.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/16/syrians-germany-ask-allowed-visit-home-keep-protected-status	2025-01-16T05:27:57-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aa8641110e24911ca5d5e690ea70450e8bba8ed/0_272_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a350b1143eba3ed84096b836860f7352

Russia-Ukraine war live: Keir Starmer in Kyiv to sign ‘100-year deal’	UK prime minister in Ukrainian capital to sign security and trade pact in first official visit Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. The UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, has arrived in Kyiv to sign a security and trade pact with Ukraine, in a public show of support for Volodymyr Zelenskyy before the much anticipated return of Donald Trump to the White House on Monday. The Ukrainian military said on Thursday that its forces had captured more than two dozen troops in the western Russian region of Kursk, where Russian troops have been trying to eject Ukrainian forces for the past five months. -Ukrainian paratroopers together with adjacent units captured 27 enemy servicemen in the Kursk region,- a military statement said, adding that the Russian troops had surrendered. Ukraine downed 34 out of 55 drones launched by Russia across 11 of the country’s regions in an overnight attack, the Ukrainian air force said, with a further 18 failing to reach their targets. Russia launched missiles and drones at Ukrainian energy facilities on Wednesday, one day after Kyiv said it had carried out its largest aerial attack of the war on Russian army factories and energy hubs hundreds of kilometres from the frontline. The mayor of the southern city of Kherson said there were power cuts as a result of the barrage. After the attack, Zelenskyy called on the west to use around US$250bn of unallocated frozen Russian assets to buy Kyiv weapons.

The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, has issued a statement calling the news of a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal -long overdue- and urging a -huge surge- in humanitarian aid to the Palestinian territory. -After months of devastating bloodshed and countless lives lost, this is the long-overdue news that the Israeli and Palestinian people have desperately been waiting for,- he said. The Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal, which is set to be begin on Sunday and will last 42 days, will see the exchange of hostages detained by Hamas and Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons. Other aspects of the deal include the return of Palestinians, who have been forcibly displaced by Israeli forces, to their homes across the Gaza Strip. The deal will also see the facilitation of travel of people wounded by Israeli attacks and sick people in order to receive treatment, as well as the positioning of Israeli forces across the Gaza border. Biden confirmed that Americans will be part of the hostage release. -This deal will halt the fighting in Gaza, surge much needed-humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians, and reunite the hostages with their families after more than 15 months in captivity,- Biden said. Egypt is -preparing to bring in the largest possible amount of aid to the Gaza Strip,- according to state media reports.

Trump’s attorney general pick Pam Bondi to face senators as key Republican says she’ll back Hegseth for Pentagon – US politics live	Bondi faces confirmation hearings alongside nominees Kristi Noem, Marco Rubio and CIA pick John Ratcliffe; Joni Ernst signals support for Pentagon pick Good morning, US politics blog readers. A battery of Donald Trump’s nominees for cabinet are going before senators today, including South Dakota governor Kristi Noem to lead the homeland security department, senator Marco Rubio for secretary of state and former congressman and intelligence official John Ratcliffe as director of the CIA. But the marquee event of the day will be former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi’s confirmation hearing to lead the justice department, a role in which she could make good on Trump’s promises to retaliate against his political enemies. Bondi voiced support for Trump’s baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election, and you can expect Democratic senators to demand answers about whether she would bring election denialism into the justice department, if confirmed. Meanwhile, it appears that Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News host who Trump nominated to serve as his defense secretary, won over a key Republican senator in his tense confirmation hearing yesterday. Iowa’s Joni Ernst has announced that she will support Hegseth, after expressing hesitation over comments he had made opposing women serving in combat roles. Hegseth has been dogged by a sexual assault allegation and reports of excessive drinking and financial mismanagement, but Ernst’s endorsement is seen as a major step to winning over other Republicans wary of installing him at the Pentagon. Joe Biden will deliver his farewell address to the nation from the Oval Office at 8pm. Inflation, the politically damaging economic trend Trump vowed to reverse, came in slightly higher than expected in December, according to just-released consumer price data from the labor department. Dangerous winds are expected to strike fire-ravaged parts of Southern California again, threatening new blazes.

Treasury minister warns of ‘tough decisions’ on spending amid high borrowing costs - UK politics live	Chief secretary to the treasury Darren Jones says there will be a spring statement on 26 March Good morning. Keir Starmer faces PMQs today. As he prepares, two issues seem very likely to come up. First, the economy. There is some modest good news this morning, and Rachel Reeves easily fought off a Tory attempted hit job on her in the Commons yesterday, but the underlying fundamentals are still pretty grim. Here are the key developments this morning. UK inflation unexpectedly fell in December, handing some breathing space to the chancellor, figures out this morning showed. The consumer prices index eased to 2.5%, below a reading of 2.6% in November, meaning prices rose at a slower rate. Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government would have to take -tough decisions- to meet its fiscal rules. The rise in government borrowing costs means further spending cuts are likely if the government is to meet its fiscal rules and Jones acknowledged that as he gave interviews this morning. He told BBC Breakfast: People at home know you can’t just keep borrowing every month to pay the bills. And where we do borrow to invest in the country’s infrastructure, the debt has to be falling as a size of the economy over the next five years. Jones said the government will not water down its plans to extend workers’ rights in the employment rights bill. In an interview on the Today programme Jones was asked about an interview on Monday where Rupert Soames, the CBI president, said the proposed changes could lead to firms laying off workers. Asked if the government would rethink the plans, Jones said: -No is the short answer.- He said giving workers more protection would be good for the economy. Jones has rejected claims the Siddiq affair raises questions about Starmer’s judgment. In an interview with Times Radio, the Treasury minister said: I don’t think there’s a question about the prime minister’s judgment. The independent process has been followed. It concluded, and Tulip took the decision to step down from government. Siddiq has been urged to -seek forgiveness from the people of Bangladesh-. As Sky News reports, responding to Siddiq’s resignation, a spokesperson for a Prof Muhammad Yunus, the interim leader of Bangladesh, said the former minister -may not have entirely understood the source of the money and property that she was enjoying in London-. The spokesperson added: She knows now and should seek forgiveness from the people of Bangladesh … We remain committed to accountability and justice and will be working with partners around the world to return the stolen funds to the people of Bangladesh.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/15/pmqs-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-labour-conservatives-uk-politics-live	2025-01-15T01:17:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/218761a797e8d612a7b7ba694728411a2a52a1d1/321_200_4792_2877/master/4792.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e1df1cd5cb5b85eaa9d27e8fa8835e5a

Health | Doctors are proposing a -radical overhaul- of how obesity is diagnosed worldwide amid concerns that a reliance on body mass index may be causing millions of people to be misdiagnosed.

On Monday, Bloomberg reported that the incoming US administration is weighing hiking tariffs by 2%-5% a month to avoid spiking inflation.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/14/canada-trump-tariffs	2025-01-14T11:16:39-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c166bb3a857fabe71fe5e9b63541adb4b4638c9/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=98ffe31825a685a09f63f776b09edce1

Stride’s Hamlet gag saves Reeves from slings and arrows of economic fortune | John Crace	Instead of evaluating chancellor’s performance, her shadow apes rightwing press and calls for her sacking You can only conclude that Conservative MPs are just too trusting for their own good. Either that or they are catatonically dim. The rest of us know enough to not always believe what we read on the front page of the rightwing papers, but Tory MPs seem to take everything at face value. If it’s in the paper, it must be true. It’s almost touching. Tuesday’s front pages of the Mail and the Telegraph insisted Rachel Reeves’s time was up. Going to China while the international bond markets crept upwards was the last straw. The chancellor should resign. What’s more, the prime minister had expressed his -full confidence- in Reeves, which could only mean that he was about to sack her. Let’s just say that Monday had been a slow news day in Westminster and some hacks had decided to make mischief.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/14/strides-hamlet-gag-saves-reeves-from-slings-and-arrows-of-economic-fortune	2025-01-14T10:19:59-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71e7fcb812b69e1059045495c89bfd1ee8b9b59d/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7724509257eb96ec7be49811824d3860
Could Keir Starmer’s AI dream derail his own green energy promise?	As PM pins hopes on AI, what effect will building energy-hungry datacentres have on Labour’s clean power pledge? Keir Starmer this week launched a plan to bring a 20-fold increase in the amount of artificial intelligence (AI) computing power under public control by 2030. But the race to build more electricity hungry AI datacentres over the next five years appears to work against another government target: to plug in enough low-carbon electricity projects to create a clean power system by the same date.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/14/keir-starmer-ai-labour-green-energy-promise	2025-01-14T10:09:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8abfc6d733094f9c745a271b041f13c30f8947c0/0_54_1792_1075/master/1792.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0ae29537f164f0e33ce88dfbff0a149e

Thought UnitedHealthcare couldn’t get more awful? They’ve gone villain mode | Arwa Mahdawi	Killing people with paperwork instead of a gun doesn’t make you any less of a murderer At this very moment Luigi Mangione, who is accused of shooting UnitedHealthcare’s CEO last month, is sitting in a federal jail cell in Brooklyn. He’s got a barrage of court appearances scheduled and, once he has wound his way through the criminal justice system, he could be behind bars for the rest of his life. Which, of course, is as it should be. While there are a lot of reasons that many people find the 26-year-old alleged assassin sympathetic, you can’t just gun a CEO down outside a hotel in Manhattan and face no consequences for it. And Mangione, who is, by all accounts, an extremely smart guy with an Ivy League education, should really have known better. He should have known that if he wanted to murder someone – and get away with it – there were far more socially acceptable ways of doing so.

Special counsel says Trump would have been convicted over 2020 election | First Thing	Report says evidence ‘was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction’ had Trump not been re-elected. Plus, dangerous winds return to LA Good morning. Donald Trump would have been convicted of crimes over his failed attempt to cling to power in 2020 if he hadn’t won the presidential election in November: that’s the finding of Jack Smith, the special counsel who investigated him. Why didn’t the case go ahead? Smith acknowledged the justice department’s policy prohibiting the prosecution of a sitting president, a factor that ultimately led to the dropping of charges against Trump after his 2024 victory. The report also references a supreme court ruling expanding presidential immunity, which complicated the case, and Trump’s repeated legal attacks, which took up time and resources to fight. How did Trump respond? In a social media post, Trump called the special counsel a -lamebrain prosecutor-. What do we know about the terms of the potential deal? Reuters reports that negotiations are advanced over releasing 33 of 98 hostages still in Gaza in the first stage of the deal, citing an Israeli official. In return, Israel will free 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, according to the Palestinian source close to the talks, who said the first phase would last for 60 days. While negotiators meet, is the war still raging? Yes. Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 18 people overnight, including six women and four children, health officials said, and Gaza’s civil defence agency reported that a wave of Israeli airstrikes killed more than 50 people in the Palestinian territory’s main city on Monday.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/14/first-thing-special-counsel-jack-smith-trump-convicted-2020-election	2025-01-14T02:52:05-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90d54c23d0e29b77c4957032c2727c8e0c47e140/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fc8ffc19667653282a6a6812caafa9fc
LA fires live: Southern California braced for ‘extremely critical fire conditions’ as life threatening winds pick up pace	With fire weather expected to continue until at least Wednesday, officials have pre-deployed firefighters across surrounding counties Additional water tankers and scores of firefighters have arrived at the Los Angeles area ahead of fierce winds that were forecast to return and threaten the progress made so far on two massive infernos that have destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 24 people. Three wildfires are currently burning in Los Angeles county. They are: The Palisades fire, at 23,713 acres and 14% containment. The Eaton fire, at 14,117 acres and 33% containment. The Hurst fire, at 799 acres and 97% containment. At least 24 people have died, and relatives have begun identifying their loved ones as they return to their homes or are notified by local officials. The fires have destroyed more than 12,000 structures and may be the costliest disaster in US history, according to initial estimates of damage and economic losses exceeding $250bn from AccuWeather. With fire weather expected to continue in the Los Angeles area through Wednesday, state and city officials have pre-deployed firefighters across LA and surrounding counties. House speaker Mike Johnson said he believes there should be conditions on disaster aid to California, citing -state and local leaders [who] were derelict in their duties-. Donald Trump is in talks to visit Los Angeles to survey the damage wrought by wildfires over the past week, CNN reported. The visit could occur as early as next week, but no details have been finalized. Altadena residents have filed three lawsuits against Southern California Edison, alleging that the utility is responsible for the Eaton fire. The lawsuits cite evidence that the fire began under a transmission tower and reference the utility’s role in other wildfires. However, no official cause for the fire has yet been determined. California governor Gavin Newsom has called on the state’s legislature to approve $2.5bn in additional funding to aid -response and initial recovery efforts for Los Angeles-. To do so, the governor expanded the special legislative session he’d called for the state in November, designed to prepare for Donald Trump’s inauguration. The firefighting plane that was grounded after sustaining damage from a drone has been repaired and will return to firefighting duty Tuesday, pending FAA approval, said LA county fire chief Anthony Marrone.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/14/la-california-fires-los-angeles-live-wildfire-map-warning-evacuation-latest-news	2025-01-14T02:38:17-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27e1ea77b9bc95d4b07c39817e39422a6dd5eff8/0_388_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=56379e328f0c0881fac3c2b397bc428d
Man in Brazil wrongly charged for 62 crimes after police use flawed photo ID	Police relied on showing photo of Paulo Alberto da Silva Costa, wrongly jailed for years, to victims to identify him as an alleged perpetrator Paulo Alberto da Silva Costa was having a regular day at work as a doorman in Rio de Janeiro when he was arrested in 2020. It was only then that he learned he was a suspect in 62 crimes: almost all were thefts, but there were also two homicide charges. Costa spent three years behind bars before Brazil’s supreme court recognised that it had all been a mistake. There was one common element: every case relied solely on the fact that a witness or victim had been shown a photograph of Costa, and identified him as the alleged perpetrator.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/14/brazil-man-wrongly-charged-photo-identification	2025-01-14T02:00:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2c45bfaab30a46b1fe15064df1c557c4ecbad95/0_0_2999_1800/master/2999.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9beb40f8bbbf32797ede7c3c3bbbda54

Rachel Reeves told it would be ‘politically suicidal’ to impose further cuts as economy falters – UK politics live	John McDonnell says more cuts would be ‘a disaster for the country’ and steer voters towards Reform Good morning. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is back from her trip to China and, according to Politico, she will make a statement in the Commons. This will allow her to address the criticism she has been facing about the rise in government borrowing costs, and what this means for her spending plans. Reading some of the Tory papers this morning you would think she is on the point of being sacked. This is more partisan wishful-thinking than objective truth-telling, but Reeves is is definitely in some difficulty, because she promised growth and events are not going as planned. As Pippa Crerar and Jessica Elgot report, with the rise in borrowing costs putting the government at risk of breaking its fiscal rules, the Treasury is looking at potential cuts to balance the books. There is obviously a problem. There’s turbulence in the international markets, and we’ve just got to see those through. And the way you do that is – you don’t turn to cuts, certainly, because not only will that … be politically suicidal, that would undermine the political support upon which Labour got elected. There are two groups of people who make judgments on an incoming government. One is the international markets, the money markets, of course. But actually the most important people are the electorate and I think what has to happen here is the electorate have to be protected. You should tax the grotesque inequality that we have within our society – 16 million living in poverty, and yet at the same time,we’ve now created in our society 165 billionaires. And on the last calculation I saw, in the two years from 2020 to 2022, they made an additional £15onbn of wealth. I think you have to look at redistribution.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/14/keir-starmer-rachel-reeves-labour-kemi-badenoch-david-lammy-latest-politics-live-news	2025-01-14T01:24:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f1b704e3d0273aad54ab9f2035079aa98d888f8/0_88_3872_2323/master/3872.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5e635f2e576678347e80c699428d74c4

Israel-Gaza war live: Hopes rise for ceasefire and hostage release deal despite Israeli strikes in Gaza	Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip killed at least 18 people overnight as Israel and Hamas appeared to be coming closer to a ceasefire deal Welcome to our live coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. It is nearly 10.30am in Gaza City and Jerusalem. Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip killed at least 18 people overnight, including six women and four children, health officials said, as Israel and Hamas appeared to be coming closer to a ceasefire deal to end the 15-month war and release dozens of hostages. Gaza’s civil defence agency reported that a wave of Israeli airstrikes killed more than 50 people in the Palestinian territory’s main city on Monday. Agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said the strikes pounded Gaza City throughout the day, hitting -schools, homes and even gatherings of people-. -There is no room in hospitals to receive the wounded,- Bassal told AFP. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not immediately comment on the claims. The IDF said five soldiers had been killed in fighting in northern Gaza, bringing to nine the number of its troops killed since Saturday. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels meanwhile fired a missile at central Israel, setting off sirens and sending people fleeing to shelters without causing any casualties. Police said Tuesday several homes were damaged outside Jerusalem and released a photo of a missile casing that had crashed into a roof. An Israeli lawyer has filed submissions to the international criminal court (ICC) alleging incitement to genocide against Palestinians by eight Israeli officials, including President Isaac Herzog and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, said at least five people were killed in the bombing of the Salah al-Din school in Gaza City, which was housing displaced Palestinian people. At least 46,584 Palestinian people have been killed and 109,731 injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in its latest update. At least 19 Palestinians were killed in the last 24 hours, the ministry said.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/14/israel-gaza-war-live-ceasefire-hostage-deal-latest-live-news-updates	2025-01-14T00:24:58-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d95b7c250fb151469bc54715d1051828979f69c8/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1a394d1875c18250eba409fa6b607c18

Tuesday briefing: What Ukraine might gain from two North Korean captives	In today’s newsletter: Kyiv’s interrogation footage of captured North Korean soldiers leads to questions about what it might do with the soldiers – and what the PoWs might do for them Good morning. In a grinding war where significant changes at the front are hard to discern, a video released by Ukraine on Sunday is a rare point of focus: it featured two North Korean soldiers, answering questions from their Ukrainian captors, and weighing the circumstances of their presence in a conflict thousands of miles from home. The video is, perhaps, not militarily significant. But it is a unique insight into one of the more extraordinary aspects of a conflict that has drawn in actors from all over the world, and is a crucible in which every participant is learning how modern wars are fought.

[It is] unclear if North Korea will even claim the two captured soldiers as their own, given Moscow and Pyongyang’s refusal to officially admit that North Korean forces have been deployed to Russia. At the same time, Russia could claim them as their own and hand them over to North Korea after they are traded with Ukrainian PoWs.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/14/tuesday-briefing-what-ukraine-might-gain-from-its-north-korean-captives	2025-01-13T22:48:28-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25743ee3fc336db21bb5bff536ac2d46018d534e/519_516_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=12580eb72feec06e1129248d06681ecd

The president defended his record on Ukraine, Gaza and Afghanistan but foreign policy successes have been few On paper, few US presidents could boast the foreign policy bona fides of Joe Biden, a veteran statesman with nearly a half-century of experience before he even stepped into office. But as his term comes to an end, critics have said that the president will leave a legacy of cautious and underpowered diplomacy, as even allies have conceded that the administration is still grasping for a cornerstone foreign policy success.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/13/biden-us-foreign-policy-winning	2025-01-13T15:19:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbb34bdbee9e3fb7f91f66940534d9bd910ced1c/0_211_7345_4407/master/7345.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d7b82c51fd81d03694ea0adf357b2979

Where there’s fire, there’s smoke: Los Angeles blazes raise fears of ‘super toxic’ lung damage	Concerns that dangerous fine particle pollution can become embedded in bloodstream and lungs The Los Angeles wildfires have claimed the lives of at least 24 people and have burned more than 100,000 structures. While the focus is understandably on avoiding the flames, another immediate danger lurks across the county and beyond, one more difficult to escape: smoke. The most dangerous component of wildfire smoke is fine particle pollution, also known as PM2.5 or soot. These tiny particles, smaller than one 20th the width of a human hair, can, if inhaled, become embedded in the bloodstream and lungs. It is estimated that about one-third of all particulate matter pollution in the US now comes from wildfire smoke.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/13/los-angeles-wildfires-smoke-exposures	2025-01-13T14:16:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e11173d30a3a548e43b7610a6084197d35f19692/0_122_6443_3866/master/6443.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40daa767f2bc6d83707a67daf5b8ce4b

JD Vance walks back Trump’s pledge to pardon January 6 protesters on day one – US politics live	Incoming vice-president says people who ‘committed violence’ shouldn’t be pardoned as surveys suggest blanket pardons would be unpopular with Americans Good morning, US politics blog readers. We’re one week out from Donald Trump’s inauguration as president, a day on which he has vowed to act like a dictator, and among the long list of things he has promised to do one his first day in office is pardon people convicted or accused of crimes over the January 6 insurrection. The few surveys done of the issue have indicated that a blanket pardon would be unpopular with Americans, and in an interview on Sunday, JD Vance seemed to walk back his boss’s pledge. -If you protested peacefully on January 6th … you should be pardoned-, the incoming vice-president told Fox News. -If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn’t be pardoned, and there’s a little bit of a gray area there, but we’re very much committed to seeing the equal administration of law.- For all the norms he has shattered, Trump would be far from the first American president to make big promises on the campaign trail then find reason not to keep them once he gets the job. We’ll find out what his supporters think of Vance’s comments as the day goes on. Confirmation hearings begin this week for Trump’s cabinet nominees, with the first scheduled for Tuesday. Some nominees, such as senator Marco Rubio to lead the state department, are expected to be approved with little tension. But others, think Pete Hegseth as defense secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr as secretary of health and human services and Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, will spark fights with Democrats. Joe Biden is looking to make the most of his final week as president, beginning with a speech today at 2pm ET from the state department about his foreign policy legacy. Los Angeles firefighters continue to combat blazes in and around the city, amid fears that another bout of gusty and hot weather could fuel more outbreaks.

‘Particularly dangerous’ wildfire weather returns to California and could linger for months, say experts	Forecasters say there won’t be winds as strong as last week’s record-setting gusts, but LA’s dry season will get worse When it comes to forecasting the conditions for catastrophic California wildfires, there are two main ingredients: fuels (think grasses, shrubs, trees – basically anything that’s available for fires to burn) and winds. When analyzing fuels, forecasters look mainly at the levels of drought, along with any recent rains that may help diminish the effect of longer-term drought. With winds, in southern California at least, it’s all about anticipating the Santa Anas – the fierce winds that blow offshore, from the deserts to the coast, bringing loads of dry air with them.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/13/california-wildfire-weather-conditions-forecast	2025-01-13T03:00:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83ce2e71dae054ed77a312a6fc6657edb6c39592/61_0_4881_2929/master/4881.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7852bfe309b81e20b047e966a9d3ef5a

Starmer claims AI could led to ‘golden age of public service reform’, even making services ‘feel more human’ – UK politics live	Government to publish AI opportunities action plan amid backdrop of economic difficulties in UK Good morning. Today the government wants to talk about AI (artificial intelligence). It is due to publish its AI opportunities action plan this morning, Keir Starmer is giving a speech on the topic, and Peter Kyle, the science secretary, is giving a statement to MPs later. The main elements have already been well trailed. Here is the Department for Science’s overnight news release, and here is a story by Robert Booth summing it all up. As usual, though, what the government wants to talk about and what it will end up being forced to talk about are not the same. The macro story that matters most in UK politics at the moment is the rise in UK government borrowing costs (largely driven by global economic developments, and the prospect of what Donald Trump will do when he becomes US president next week), and whether this will lead to fresh spending cuts in the spring. On the business live blog, Julia Kollewe says UK bond yields (borrowing costs) are marginally up again this morning.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/13/keir-starmer-labour-ai-yvette-cooper-tulip-siddiq-latest-politics-news-live	2025-01-13T01:23:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/840d45084eef6a8324b9d6fe2f3351625b814b0b/0_67_3214_1930/master/3214.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=daa6e8378b14630937da06728fc6946f

Tory police cuts are only part of the ongoing crisis affecting victims of crime	Austerity affected courts, prisons and public services while rates of poverty surged, creating the conditions for more crime The period in which clear-up rates for the most serious crimes collapsed coincided with big cuts to police budgets, and the subsequent fall in police officer numbers of about 20,000. The last Conservative government, responsible for the cuts after 2010 in the name of austerity, spent its time denying they would have any damaging effect on crime fighting in England and Wales. Then, in its final years, it started to reverse the cuts, and pretended -wokery- among law enforcement had diverted officers’ attention.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/13/slashed-police-budgets-crisis-uk-criminal-justice	2025-01-12T22:00:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49e1cf6e1349077f709d642e98f760cc3f56e535/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7facd143edaeaa2a98cd8e49018ecbda

Tories back Badenoch’s ‘risky’ call for grooming gangs inquiry	Keir Starmer accuses opposition leader of spending ‘a lot of time on social media over Christmas’ When Kemi Badenoch used prime minister’s questions this week to echo Elon Musk’s demands for a new inquiry into sexual grooming gangs, the MPs behind her were trying to interpret the intentions of their fledgling leader.

UK can be ‘AI sweet spot’: Starmer’s tech minister on regulation, Musk, and free speech	Technology secretary Peter Kyle has the task of making Britain a leading player in the AI revolution, but says economic growth will not come at the cost of online safety With the NHS still struggling, a prisons crisis still teetering and Britain’s borrowing costs soaring, there are few easy jobs going in Keir Starmer’s cabinet at present. But even in such difficult times, the task of convincing Silicon Valley’s finest to help make Britain a leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution – all while one leading tech boss uses the Labour government as a regular punching bag and others ostentatiously move closer to Donald Trump – is among the most challenging.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/11/uk-can-be-ai-sweet-spot-starmers-tech-minister-on-regulation-musk-and-free-speech	2025-01-11T10:59:39-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab50db8c2b0e3db9e611233289da0b93e765091/0_164_4927_2957/master/4927.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e05cc22b47952e3c1787001b90ac1cf0

Silicon Valley’s tycoons are bending the knee to Trump | Blake Montgomery	In 2017, Silicon Valley rebuked Trump’s travel ban. Today, it has reversed course and is bending over backwards with displays of deference to Trump On 28 January 2017, I rushed to the San Francisco international airport (SFO). Like elsewhere in the US that night, demonstrations were growing against a travel ban Donald Trump had issued against visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries. The night was chillier than normal, and I had not brought an adequate jacket. Luckily, the train to the airport was warm, full to the brim with jittery, talkative protesters. The airport itself was a rowdy scene: cabs and Ubers stalled as angry protesters blocked the roads, meters still running; demonstrators in hijabs prayed on their protest signs in baggage claim as others shouted at any arriving flyer coming for their luggage. Trump was the most outrageous man in America then, his election a shock to a wide swath of the world. After a few hours, whispers of a $150bn face floated through the crowd: Sergey Brin, creator and co-founder of Google, was there. At the time, he was the president of Google’s parent company Alphabet, which also owns YouTube. The effect was thrilling: one of the richest and most powerful men in the world was registering his discontent with Trump by bodily joining a protest against him. Brin, a native of Moscow who arrived in the US at the age of six, said he came to SFO that night -because I’m a refugee-. It was a personal rebuke of Trump, the consummate nativist.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/11/trump-silicon-valley	2025-01-11T05:00:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad0153854745673e2dce46a20cefa32880506b81/0_203_3071_1844/master/3071.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=95226bc01dd29236a9c07c20d61c0535

California fires live: progress made against some LA blazes but thickening smoke prompts ‘health emergency’	Palisades and Eaton fires start coming under control as fierce winds ease but forecasters predict another red flag warning for Monday Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the California wildfires that have devastated six neighborhoods of Los Angeles county, killed at least 11 people and damaged or destroyed more than 12,000 structures. Firefighters finally started gaining control over two major wildfires on the eastern and western flanks of Los Angeles on Friday as fierce winds that supercharged the fires for days eased. The Palisades fire, at 21,317 acres and 8% containment The Eaton fire, at 13,690 acres and 3% containment The Kenneth fire, at 1,052 acres and 50% containment The Hurst fire, at 771 acres and 37% containment The Lidia fire, at 395 acres and 98% containment The Archer fire, at 19 acres and 0% containment Six deaths have been confirmed in the Eaton fire and five in the Palisades. As family members have been alerted to the loss of their loved ones, six of the victims have been publicly identified. Law enforcement officials expect the death toll to rise once weather and fire conditions allow cadaver dogs and detectives into the burn zones. Conditions in the Los Angeles area were forecast to improve through the weekend, with sustained winds slowing to about 20mph (32km/h), gusting between 35-50mph, according to the National Weather Service, a respite from recent wind gusts of 80mph. -It’s not as gusty, so that should help firefighters,- NWS meteorologist Allison Santorelli said, adding that conditions were still critical with low humidity and dry vegetation. Forecasters predicted another red flag warning would be issued for Monday. Fire chief Kristin Crowley criticised city officials over water supply issues and budget cuts that she says hindered her department’s ability to fight the Palisades fire. The water supply has become a focal point, with California governor Gavin Newsom calling for an investigation into the shortage. Newsom has invited Donald Trump to visit the state and tour the the LA wildfires’ devastation. Trump visited the state six years ago in the wake of the Camp fire, the most destructive fire in California history, which hit the town of Paradise. The state of California issued a one-year moratorium preventing insurance companies from canceling or refusing to renew home policies in zip codes impacted by the Palisades and Eaton fires. Fire agencies are investigating whether Southern California Edison’s utility infrastructure sparked a brush fire that is still burning in a Los Angeles suburb, SCE said on Friday, adding no determination has been made. SCE, a unit of US utility Edison International, said in a filing to its regulators that a downed conductor was discovered at a tower associated with its Eagle Rock – Sylmar 220 kV circuit. -SCE does not know whether the damage observed occurred before or after the start of the fire,- it said.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/11/california-fires-la-fires-live-updates-latest-news	2025-01-10T23:16:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80c17a89ee8f6bb37c80659a71ead40b9cf18c8b/0_274_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bcc8f27f6817807d5c7e350012d223d7

Los Angeles officials expect the death toll from the wildfires in the county to continue to rise, as workers comb through incinerated neighborhoods with cadaver dogs. How big are the fires? The Palisades fire is 8,085 hectares and just 6% contained; Eaton is 5,540 hectares and not contained at all; Kenneth is 405 hectares and 35% contained; Hurst, 312 hectares and 37%; Lidia, 141 hectares and 60%.

Kenya court rules that criminalising attempted suicide is unconstitutional	The judgment has been welcomed as an important shift in perceptions by human rights and mental health groups A Kenyan judge has declared as unconstitutional sections of the country’s laws that criminalise attempted suicide. In a landmark ruling on Thursday, Judge Lawrence Mugambi of the country’s high court stated that section 226 of the penal code contradicts the constitution by punishing those with mental health issues over which they may have little or no control. While the constitution says in article 43 that a person has the right to the -highest attainable standard of health-, criminal law states that -any person who attempts to kill himself is guilty of a misdemeanour and is subject to imprisonment of up to two years, a fine, or both-, with the minimum age of prosecution for the offence set at eight years old.	https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jan/10/kenya-court-rules-that-criminalising-attempted-suicide-is-unconstitutional	2025-01-10T03:32:46-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f151e2de9768b827721edcfc8cbc805ae4abde5/0_0_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=30da1b56d6237d0798bcd1bfb92d5e2d

She said: We inherited an economy where it was hard to see who had confidence, both to invest, and particularly for consumers to be able to feel that they could spend, given the huge fluctuations that we’d seen, particularly after the Liz Truss/Kwasi Kwarteng mini-budget. The chancellor has been absolutely clear that we are not going back to those bad old days. We have had two interest rate cuts since she became chancellor, and we have worked very hard to restore economic credibility. We are not only confident that we’re on track, but the OECD is confident that we’re on track to become the fastest growing economy in Europe.

It’s the latest battle in the long war over whether to ban the tremendously popular social media app in the US – and will force the justices to weigh the importance of national security with the freedom of speech. TikTok and its parent company, Chinese-based ByteDance, asked the supreme court to review the case after a lower court ruled last month to uphold a law to ban the app in the US. That ban is scheduled to go into effect on 19 January, unless ByteDance sells TikTok’s assets to a non-Chinese company.

LA fires live updates: at least seven deaths as California wildfires rage and crews battle new fire	Palisades, Kenneth, Eaton fires remain uncontrolled as Los Angeles officials say ‘historic winds’ and extensive droughts have created the ‘perfect storm’ Hello, and welcome to our live coverage of the wildfires in California, where some of the worst blazes in the region’s history have ravaged homes and reduced entire neighbourhoods to ash. I’m Petra Stock. It’s approaching 8pm in Los Angeles and here is a recap of what you need to know. The Palisades fire, at 19,978 acres and 6% containment The Eaton fire, at 13,690 acres and 0% containment The Kenneth fire, at 960 acres and 0% containment The Hurst fire, at 671 acres and 10% containment The Lidia fire, at 348 acres and 60% containment Seven people have died, and more than 10,000 structures have burned, in the Palisades and Eaton fires. Five deaths have been confirmed in the Eaton fire and two in the Palisades. The Palisades fire, which had remained 0% contained since it broke out Tuesday, was 6% contained by 6pm Thursday. A new fire, now called the Kenneth fire, sparked around 3:34pm and quickly ballooned to 960 acres. President Joe Biden has announced that the federal government would pay for 100% of the firefighting needs for the next 180 days. Law enforcement officials are working to issue a curfew for affected burn zones in Los Angeles, in order to combat looting, though it is unclear when it will go into effect. Vice-president Kamala Harris canceled a trip to Singapore, Bahrain and Germany shortly after President Biden canceled a trip to Italy in order to more closely monitor the fires. The California prison system has now deployed nearly 800 incarcerated firefighters to fight the devastating blazes.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/10/la-fires-live-updates-california-los-angeles-wildfires-fire-map-latest-news	2025-01-09T19:36:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91a838607c4536aa6b71519444bdc53cae9d3f72/0_3_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=50d72be040640e281f7eb9279c77eb4b

He implemented a travel ban that caused chaos at airports, leaving families, students and scholars stranded. He also attempted to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program, which shields hundreds of thousands of people brought to the country as children from deportation and imposed a -zero-tolerance- at the US-Mexico border that led to the separation of thousands of families.

David Lammy says Trump’s rhetoric can be ‘destabilising’ but threat to invade Greenland won’t happen – UK politics live	Foreign secretary says Trump’s comments should be understood as reflection of his concerns about Arctic security Good morning. For the first time in six months, David Lammy, the foreign secretary, was put up by No 10 to do the morning broadcast interview round – ahead of a speech he is giving later. At PMQs yesterday, perhaps surprisingly, Keir Starmer was not asked about Donald Trump’s suggestion that he might invade Greenland, an autonomous territory that belongs to Denmark. The French and German governments have both condemned Trump’s comments. But, in an interview with the Today programme, Lammy was rather more diplomatic. Lammy said that, although Trump’s language could be -destabilising-, he did not always do what he threatened. Asked about Trump’s comments, Lammy said: I think that we know from Donald Trump’s first term that the intensity of his rhetoric, and the unpredictability sometimes of what he says, can be destabilising. He did it with Nato. But in fact, in practice, he sent more troops to Europe under his administration. He sent the first Javelins [anti-tank weapons] and weapons to Ukraine under his administration. Lammy said that Trump would not use military force to seize Greenland – despite suggesting he might. Asked if the UK should be following France and Germany in saying this would be unacceptable, Lammy replied: Let’s be serious … It’s not going to happen because no Nato allies have gone to war since the birth of Nato which Ernest Bevin, my great predecessor, was part of. Lammy said Trump’s comments should be understood as reflection of his concerns about Arctic security. He explained: Here, I suspect on Greenland, what he’s targeting is his concerns about Russia and China in the Arctic, his concerns about national economic security. He recognises, I’m sure, that in the end, Greenland today is a Kingdom of Denmark. There is a debate in Greenland about their own self determination. But behind it, I think, are his concerns about the Arctic. Of course, the US has troops and a base on Greenland. So it has got a stake in that Arctic region.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/09/uk-politics-labour-conservatives-david-lammy-trump-greenland-latest-updates	2025-01-09T01:13:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22c61051e995e1dc39b88c1bf75d8429f40446ab/98_492_4419_2652/master/4419.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=23e73b51fa9dbc1a4a372ae644056b11

UK weather: warnings remain in force across country as temperatures to fall as low as -20C	Snow, ice and fog yellow weather warnings remain in force across the UK as snow and sleet cause disruption to transport On Wednesday, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) extended its cold weather health alert for all of England until Sunday. Amber alerts have been extended and will now run until 12 January, meaning a rise in deaths is likely, the agency said. Dr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at the UKHSA, said: We are extending the duration of our cold health alert, since the Met Office are forecasting that the low temperatures we are seeing will continue further into this week, with snow and icy conditions likely to persist. This weather can have a serious impact on the health of some people, including those aged 65 and over and those with pre-existing health conditions, and it is therefore vital that we continue to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are most vulnerable.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2025/jan/09/uk-weather-warnings-snow-ice-sleet-temperatures-fall-transport	2025-01-09T00:40:17-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/108791f99685f0633a60fa0980490f310618e416/0_259_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2c93450e81ae58897127a8551b264b02

California fires live: Los Angeles fighting largest blaze in its history amid water and firefighting shortages	Palisades fire grows to more than 15,000 acres as Eaton and Hurst fires also gain in size; Biden directs DoD to deploy extra firefighters to tackle flames About 1.5 million residents are without power in southern California, with nearly a million of them in Los Angeles County, according to PowerOutage.us, as wildfires continue to rage across the region. The Palisades fire, which is the most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles’ history, has increased in size yet again – now encompassing 15,832 acres. At least two people were killed in the Eaton fire, north of Pasadena which has grown to 10,600 acres and has destroyed more than 100 structures. There have also been -a number of significant injuries-, fire officials said, and -tens of thousands of homes- are affected. About 32,500 residents were under evacuation orders, a drop from the more than 50,000 residents evacuated overnight. The Palisades fire, west of Los Angeles, has grown to 11,802 acres and destroyed more than 1,000 structures, making it the most destructive fire in the city’s history. About 37,000 residents are under evacuation orders. The Hurst fire, in the San Fernando Valley, is close to 500 acres after erupting on Tuesday night. More than 3,000 residents have been ordered to evacuate the area in Sylmar. All Los Angeles fire department air operations in the Palisades have resumed after being grounded due to extreme weather conditions. LAFD helicopters are back to dropping water and hundreds of firefighters continue to be on the scene to help respond to the Palisades fire and Hurst fire, said LA’s mayor, Karen Bass. More than 400,000 power customers were without power, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us. Another 440,000 customers could face similar shutoffs depending on weather conditions. Officials are urging residents across the region to conserve water so there is enough for firefighters to use. Demand was so high that three tanks emptied by Wednesday morning, causing some fire hydrants to dry out. California governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on Tuesday. President Joe Biden warned the recovery -is going to take time- as he attended a briefing with Newsom at a Santa Monica fire station. President-elect Donald Trump blamed Newsom’s environmental policies for the fires.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/08/california-los-angeles-fires-live-updates	2025-01-08T13:58:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea29802fba69f1cf43c2ff2d7beae28d6d1dff47/0_368_5561_3339/master/5561.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d9f68d22674127ce7c46e1ba3c13387b
