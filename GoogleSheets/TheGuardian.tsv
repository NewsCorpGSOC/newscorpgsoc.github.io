He has always brushed off suggestions of a career in politics but championed the cause of fellow farmers at protests this week Steve Berry, a presenter on the BBC’s Top Gear for six years, can remember the moment he first rubbed up against Jeremy Clarkson’s ego and ambition. It was the mid-1990s and Berry had a new agent who suggested he should push to be the main presenter on the show. -And I thought, ‘Yeah, OK, why not?- recalled Berry, 60. -I just was constantly bombarding them with ideas and I got taken on one side by one of the directors, and he said, ‘You know Jeremy sits there and times how much time he has on the programme’. I said, ‘You what?’ ‘He sits there with a stopwatch’. I have no idea if this is true but he says, ‘He’s worked out that in this season you have had this amount of screen time and if it were a title race you are only a few points off where he is’. So the guy says, ‘So watch yourself’. Next thing I know, I was dragged into [executive producer] Jon Bentley’s office. He said, ‘Sit down. You are never going to be the next Jeremy Clarkson, you know’.

But as he starts to assemble his cabinet and White House staff, it seems likely he’ll get to know the people involved very well soon.

‘I’ll be making my own’: UK’s most expensive mince pie divides opinion	In the picturesque village of Orford, an ‘incredibly luxurious’ festive treat is thought to have set a record price Orford, a picturesque pocket of the Suffolk coast has a storied and rather bizarre history. It is home to an impeccably preserved medieval castle built by Henry II to see off dissenting barons and, for much of the 20th century, the rugged seafront was sealed off and used as a top-secret military testing site, prompting rumours about death rays and UFO sightings. Now, the area may have another claim to fame: the home of the UK’s most expensive mince pie.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/22/ill-be-making-my-own-uks-most-expensive-mince-pie-divides-opinion	2024-11-22T04:29:57-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c522aa17925f5b8c77ced9b974f6146fdbb38ff2/0_229_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fdfa27a6cdbb234d2723c59769ae96cf

First Thing: ICC seeks Netanyahu’s arrest over allegations of ‘war crimes and crimes against humanity’	The international criminal court also issued arrest warrants for Israel’s Yoav Gallant and Hamas’s Mohammed Deif. Plus, Trump picks Bondi for attorney general after Gaetz withdraws Good morning. The international criminal court has issued arrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the country’s former defense minister Yoav Gallant and the Hamas military leader Mohammed Deif – over allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity. What did the chamber say? There are -reasonable grounds to believe that both individuals intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival, including food, water, and medicine and medical supplies, as well as fuel and electricity-. What does it mean? The court has no police force, so we’re unlikely to see them standing trial anytime soon, but the ruling holds strong moral weight. Netanyahu and Gallant are at risk of arrest if they travel to any of the 124 countries that signed the Rome statute establishing the court. What was the reaction? The move was broadly welcomed by human rights groups. But Joe Biden said it was -outrageous- and Netanyahu’s office called it -antisemitic-. Why has Trump picked Bondi? It is likely to be because of loyalty. She became a fierce defender of his candidacy in 2016, helped with Trump’s legal defense during his first impeachment trial, parroted claims that the 2020 election was stolen, and continued working as a surrogate through the 2024 campaign when she attended Trump’s criminal trial in New York.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/22/first-thing-icc-seeks-netanyahu-arrest-over-allegations-of-war-crimes-and-crimes-against-humanity	2024-11-22T03:28:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4add4f8dc13b7472d9c4fd7eddefeb3ec963e7a3/107_82_3699_2220/master/3699.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4b9ac694b081574800d9826ce9d9c28c

Russia-Ukraine war live: Nato says Moscow’s strike with new ballistic missile won’t alter course of war	Alliance accuses Russia of seeking to intimidate Kyiv’s allies while Volodymyr Zelenskyy calls attack a ‘severe escalation’ Russia fired an -experimental- ballistic missile at the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Thursday in what the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called -a clear and severe escalation- of the 33-month-old war. Vladimir Putin said the strike was -a response to US plans to produce and deploy intermediate and short-range missiles-. The Russian president also threatened further attacks, saying Moscow -had the right- to strike western countries that provided Kyiv with weapons used against Russian targets. The new ballistic missile was part of a wider salvo of nine missiles fired from the Astrakhan region of Russia in the early hours of Thursday. Six of the missiles were intercepted by Ukraine’s air force but the new ballistic missile was not stopped. The missile was said to have hit -without consequences-, Ukraine’s air force said, though it added that complete information about victims had yet to be received. Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for strong worldwide condemnation on the strike, describing it as a major step-up in the -scale and brutality- of the war. The Ukrainian president said the attack was -yet more proof that Russia has no interest in peace-, adding that a -response is needed. Pressure is needed. Russia must be forced into real peace, which can only be achieved through strength-. US and UK sources indicated they believed the missile was an experimental, nuclear-capable, intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), which has a theoretical range of below 3,420 miles (5,500km). That is enough to reach Europe from where it was fired in south-western Russia, but not the US. UN secretary general António Guterres’s spokesperson said Russia’s use of the new ballistic missile was -yet another concerning and worrying development. -All of this [is] going in the wrong direction,- Stéphane Dujarric said as he called on all parties to de-escalate the conflict and -to protect civilians, not hit civilian targets or critical civilian infrastructure-. Russian strikes killed at least two people in the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Sumy, the acting mayor said on Friday. -Several massive explosions occurred in Sumy,- Artem Kobzar said on Telegram. He said air defences were still working as of just before 6am local time and warned residents to stay away from windows. The Sumy regional military administration said a residential neighbourhood had been struck by a Russian drone, adding that rescue operations were under way. It confirmed the two deaths and said 12 people had been injured. Russia’s defence ministry said on Thursday that its forces had captured the eastern Ukrainian village of Dalne in the Donetsk region, a focal point of their advance. Ukraine’s general staff made no acknowledgment of Dalne being in Russian hands. The Ukrainian military’s late report mentioned the village as one of seven in an area where Russian forces had tried to pierce Ukrainian defences 26 times over the previous 24 hours. It said 10 of 16 armed clashes in the area continued. Ukraine’s parliament postponed a sitting due to have taken place on Friday out of security concerns, public broadcaster Suspilne reported, quoting sources. It said the order told members to keep their families out of Kyiv’s government district and quoted parliamentarians as saying that, for the moment, the next sitting was not scheduled until December.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-nato-says-moscows-strike-with-new-ballistic-missile-wont-alter-course-of-war	2024-11-21T23:14:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ef13efa7069f9e9b00c0da95bea9d10016df5dd/0_343_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cbe5f3b6484782c8d56edba2ce8726e5

Putin’s Ukraine missile a warning to west before second age of Trump	The current escalations will set a new status quo for life under Trump – what does the US president have planned? Like Chekhov’s gun coming off the wall in Act V, it was probably only a matter of time before Vladimir Putin launched an experimental, nuclear-capable ballistic missile into Ukraine. It is hardly a coincidence that his decision comes as the war approaches a likely endgame, with both sides jockeying for position ahead of negotiations in the shadow of Donald Trump. Neither Ukraine nor Russia quite knows what Trump will do when he takes office in January. But the escalations taking place now will set a new status quo for the day he becomes president, at which point Trump’s options range from hard-nosed horse-trading to simply throwing Ukraine under the bus.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/22/russia-ukraine-war-ballistic-missile-warning	2024-11-21T23:00:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c67d0e8f7c62dfd56a8250326c690ea2797bab8a/0_0_4264_2559/master/4264.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fb6c21a99ef4b6de9ad8352e52543686

Why Trump’s racism isn’t an issue – or enough of one – for some voters of color	Experts warn assuming minority groups will reject a racist candidate ignores nuance, particularly on the economy Since Donald Trump won the 2024 US presidential election, many have publicly speculated why people of color – with whom Trump made some gains – would vote for a racist candidate. Throughout his campaign, Trump and his supporters spouted a series of racist remarks aimed at Black and Latino people, immigrants at large, and other marginalized groups. He also promised to utilize the military to carry out mass deportations, ban sanctuary cities, and escalate attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts at the federal level. Swaths of non-white voters still supported Trump at the ballot box. And though this sort of data can vary in reliability, experts agree that Trump made inroads among some minorities despite his bigoted comments.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/21/trump-racism-people-of-color-voters	2024-11-21T04:00:46-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/448e72ad6327532d6ac267545e4bb6a3aab5f10a/0_239_7151_4293/master/7151.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fce34a53ca683eeab5fe35f0bb3cd99a

Captain Tom’s family personally benefited from charity they founded, report finds	Watchdog’s highly critical inquiry finds Hannah and Colin Ingram-Moore culpable of ‘serious and repeated’ misconduct The family of the NHS charities fundraiser Captain Sir Tom Moore personally benefited from the charity set up in his name through a series of lucrative deals worth more than £1m, the charities watchdog has ruled in a highly critical report. A Charity Commission inquiry concluded the late Captain Tom’s daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore and her husband, Colin Ingram-Moore, were culpable of -serious and repeated- instances of misconduct, mismanagement and failures of integrity. Hannah Ingram-Moore -initiated the process to secure her appointment as chief executive- of the charity, suggesting she should be paid a salary of £150,000. The charity proposed paying her £100,000 but this was blocked by the commission and she was eventually hired on £85,000. Hannah Ingram-Moore received £18,000 from Virgin Media in September 2021 to judge its Local Legends awards when she was chief executive of the foundation. This was unauthorised and a conflict of interest, and there was no evidence it was undertaken, as she claimed, in a personal capacity. The Ingram-Moores used the charity’s name inappropriately and for their private benefit in a planning application to build a private spa pool in the grounds of their family home. The building was subsequently demolished.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/21/captain-tom-family-personally-benefited-from-charity-they-founded-report-finds	2024-11-20T16:01:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a199706325dfe0f3cdeb507f9f1139a0feeee087/331_321_5436_3260/master/5436.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=215abd0735ed73f3a3dd8faa1720dbfb

US embassy in Kyiv closes over threat of ‘significant attack’ | First Thing	It comes as the Kremlin rules out a ‘freeze’ in the conflict. Plus, 204 industrial farming lobbyists attend Cop29 Good morning. The US embassy in Kyiv closed on Wednesday because of a potential significant air attack. -Out of an abundance of caution, the embassy will be closed, and embassy employees are being instructed to shelter in place,- the consular service said. Why has Biden approved missiles and landmines now? The US feels these measures are necessary for Ukraine to keep fighting, and commensurate with Russia’s deployment of North Korean troops. About 10,900 North Korean soldiers in Kursk have been fighting in elite Russian airborne and marine units, according to a lawmaker on the intelligence committee of the South Korean parliament. Biden is also acting before Donald Trump returns to the White House and potentially seeks negotiations. How many aid trucks is Israel letting cross the border? So far in November, Israel says it has allowed in an average of 88 trucks a day, a fraction of the 600 a day that aid agencies say are necessary to meet basic needs. In the northern third of Gaza, where Israeli forces are waging a weeks-long offensive that has killed hundreds of people and displaced tens of thousands, famine conditions may have already set in, experts say. How have food prices changed? The market fluctuates, but before the war a sack of flour cost 40 shekels ($10.68) and milk powder cost 30 shekels. Now, in the center and south of the strip, where most of the population has fled, prices have reached 375 shekels ($100.17) and 300 shekels respectively – if supplies can be found.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/20/first-thing-us-embassy-in-kyiv-closes-over-threat-of-significant-attack	2024-11-20T04:57:19-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb67648d8d32f17acd8b81f4c2fb201e3748b272/0_0_5280_3168/master/5280.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=713dbbde9e13a850a279747fdc96a528

Tories attack BBC for questioning farming lobby’s inheritance tax claims – UK politics live	Row over issue continues with questions likely at PMQs as Angela Rayner faces shadow minister Alex Burghart Good morning. Keir Starmer is travelling back from the G20 summit in Brazil, but he won’t be in the Commons in time for PMQs, and so Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, will be taking questions on his behalf. In line with recent practice, Kemi Badenoch, the new Conservative leader, won’t go up against a deputy, and she will miss the session too. The Tories don’t have a deputy leader, but Badenoch is getting Alex Burghart, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, to stand in for her. The PM might not be answering, but that does not mean the questions get any easier. The situation in Ukraine is looking increasingly perilous, inflation is going up, and figures out yesterday have reignited the row about the government’s decision to cut the winter fuel payment. But the Conservatives may also want to ask about farmers, and the plan to extend inheritance tax to some farms. Traditonally the Tories have liked to think of themselves as a pro-countryside, pro-farming party, and they will have been reassured by the fact that, when they lined up alongside farmers at yesterday’s rally, they did not just have Jeremy Clarkson with them; the Liberal Democrats, the Green party, Greenpeace and even Just Stop Oil were on the farmers’ side too. The job of BBC Verify is to do exactly that but they’ve failed on their own terms. The government is refusing to say how many family farms are subject to their tax raid, only offering partial and out of date statistics which fail to account for the full scale of their reforms.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/20/farming-inheritance-tax-keir-starmer-angela-rayner-uk-politics-live	2024-11-20T01:44:02-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0774110c90ff048eeab77dffc60468e91ca2bf9/0_196_5336_3202/master/5336.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0970ed2bb8d59fca26e47cfbc887fd36

Russia-Ukraine war live: Biden to provide antipersonnel landmines for Ukraine – reports	Move comes as Putin lowers threshold for use of nuclear weapons; North Korean troops have participated in battle, South Korea says The US embassy in Kyiv has received -specific information- of a potential significant air attack on Wednesday and will be closed, the US Department of State Consular Affairs said in a post on X. It recommended US citizens to be prepared to immediately shelter in the event an air alert is announced. The US called on Russia -to stop this bellicose and the irresponsible rhetoric-, but said it has not seen any reason to adjust its nuclear posture. US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said he was -not surprised- by comments by the Kremlin over the revised nuclear doctrine. The UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, also accused Russia of being guilty of making -irresponsible rhetoric-. In a direct message to the Russian president, Starmer added: -On day 1,000 of Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine, I say again: ‘End the war. Get out of Ukraine’.- Ukraine fired US-made long-range missiles into Russia for the first time since the Biden administration lifted restrictions on their use. The target appeared to be an ammunition warehouse. Ukraine’s general staff said it hit a military arsenal of the 1046th logistics centre outside the city of Karachev without confirming the use of the missiles. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine launched six US-made Atacms missiles targeting the south-western Bryansk region overnight. It claimed that five of the missiles were shot down and another was damaged. It said debris from the rockets caused a fire at an unnamed military facility. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, did not directly confirm the missile attack targeting Bryansk but said: -We now have Atacms, Ukrainian long-range capabilities, and we will use them.- The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, appeared to suggest that Russia might respond with nuclear weapons if Ukraine used western-supplied missiles to strike targets inside Russia. The Kremlin said the purpose of its updated nuclear doctrine was to make potential enemies understand the inevitability of retaliation for an attack on Russia or its allies. Russia’s revised nuclear doctrine declares that a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on his country. The doctrine also states that an attack using conventional missiles, drones or other aircraft could be seen as justification for a nuclear response.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/20/russia-ukraine-war-live-biden-us-weapons-missiles-putin-nuclear	2024-11-19T22:16:21-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5f69662b776355f056921942e54ff299fd26d61/0_197_5913_3548/master/5913.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7d92872526fd346a6f1b7b7925a84eb2

Prado show aims to highlight true colours of polychrome sculpture	Madrid Exhibition intends to rescue the technique – coloured paint applied to statues – from centuries of indifference In a darkened corner of the Prado, not far from an outsized crucifixion and a sculpture of a dead, recumbent Christ with eyes of glass, teeth of ivory and fingernails of horn, is another depiction of Jesus that is remarkable in its poignancy, its humanity and its history. The tiny, painted terracotta scene, titled Los primeros pasos de Jesús (Jesus’s First Steps), is domestic rather than divine and shows a chubby, beaming infant ambling towards his equally beaming father. Its creator was the Spanish baroque artist Luisa Roldán who, despite becoming the first female sculptor to the royal court in 1692, is only now making her debut in the hallowed Madrid museum.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/20/prado-show-highlight-true-colours-polychrome-sculpture	2024-11-19T21:00:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cec5ede6b22ba9e62b36360f5c201c5593911ded/0_713_3689_2213/master/3689.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=136b12ef68f1f670175e65455bba0724

Though far from a new coinage – as an adjective meaning -clear- or -obvious-, the word dates back in English to at least the 1300s – the dictionary’s decision rests on its newest meaning as a verb, which attests to the power of visualisation and positive thinking in making fervently held dreams come to pass.	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/nov/20/celebrities-make-manifest-appear-as-2024-word-of-the-year	2024-11-19T21:00:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34efb969fb1cb45eebc0696c4983248971a535d8/0_175_5235_3141/master/5235.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9cb7f0b0cfa90350770715559b639f49

Norway to ask ICJ for advisory opinion condemning Israel’s stance on Unrwa	Draft resolution for UN general assembly seeks to protect the aid agency and allow it to keep functioning in Gaza Norway is to seek an international court of justice (ICJ) advisory opinion condemning the Israeli government for ending cooperation with the UN Palestinian relief agency Unrwa. The Israeli Knesset passed two bills last month banning Unrwa from Israeli territory and prohibiting Israeli state contact with the agency, moves that would prevent it from delivering aid to Gaza, after allegations by Israel that members of Unrwa staff in Gaza were involved in the 7 October attacks by Hamas.

AI cloning of celebrity voices outpacing the law, experts warn	David Attenborough among famous people whose voices have been exploited by fraudsters It’s the new badge of celebrity status that nobody wants. Jennifer Aniston, Oprah Winfrey and Kylie Jenner have all had their voices cloned by fraudsters. Online blaggers used artificial intelligence to fake the Tiggerish tones of Martin Lewis, the TV financial adviser. And this weekend David Attenborough described himself as -profoundly disturbed- to have discovered that his cloned voice had been used to deliver partisan US news bulletins. Now experts have warned that voice-cloning is outpacing the law as technologists hone previously clunky voice generators into models capable of emulating the subtlest pauses and breathing of human intonation.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/19/ai-cloning-of-celebrity-voices-outpacing-the-law-experts-warn	2024-11-18T23:00:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b61e0553886769be00b841cd315ca2a3cd84554/0_230_5507_3304/master/5507.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e4b9cd554cb354802e1343ffafc508b7

Tuesday briefing: Will a shift in Biden’s missile policy change the war in Ukraine?	In today’s newsletter: Ukraine can now fire US-made long-range missiles into Russian territory – but it may be too little, too late for Volodymyr Zelenskyy • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. The US president, Joe Biden, has lifted the longstanding ban on Ukraine using American-made long-range missiles to fire into Russian territory. The Biden administration secretly first sent the army tactical missile systems, or Atacms, to Ukraine earlier this year under the stipulation that Ukraine would not use it inside Russia. That has now changed, and the US has given Kyiv the green light after reports emerged that 10,000 North Korean troops were in Ukraine. Hong Kong | 47 of Hong Kong’s most prominent pro-democracy figures have been jailed – one for 10 years – in the territory’s largest national security trial, following a prosecution that has been widely criticised as politically motivated and controlled by China’s Communist party government. Poverty | More than one in three children and a quarter of adults are living in poverty in the UK as deprivation levels rise to the highest in the 21st century, according to a landmark report. Cop29 | Raising money needed to tackle the climate crisis need not be a burden on overstretched government budgets, leading economists have said. The sums needed – approximately $1tn a year by 2030 – are achievable without disruption to the global economy, and would help to generate greener economic growth for the future. Labour | A government policy to create 100,000 new nursery places using spare capacity in English primary schools is -unlikely to work- because of a geographical mismatch between capacity and demand, according to research by Frontier Economics, one of the largest economic consultancies in Europe. Environment | More than 51 million chickens are being industrially farmed in the river valleys of the Severn and Wye – the equivalent of 79 chickens for every person in the region, according to new figures. The exponential rise in large intensive poultry units (IPUs) in the valleys is a key driver of river pollution. Chicken dropping contains more phosphates – which starve fish and river plants of oxygen – than any other animal manure.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/tuesday-briefing-first-edition-joe-biden-long-range-missiles-policy-war-in-ukraine	2024-11-18T22:42:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48c23c03fc4a3b3c4e5e86d9d3d9746b2c5ae043/0_153_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dfac9d2745a4e4566024c72639fc93c5

Letting Ukraine fire missiles into Russia unlikely to have decisive effect	Military and political consequences of allowing Kyiv to use Atacms missiles remain uncertain It has taken an election defeat in the US and the arrival of 10,000 North Koreans in Ukraine for Joe Biden to finally relent. After two years of asking, Ukraine’s army has been given permission to use US long-range Atacms missiles to strike against targets inside Russia. The military and political consequences remain uncertain. Russia has been able to bomb targets across all of Ukraine throughout the war. On Sunday it attacked key sites across the country’s power network, forcing Kyiv to implement national electricity rationing as a result of the damage caused. Some missiles were aimed as far west as Lviv and at sites near the border with Moldova, and an energy crisis is closer as a result.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/18/letting-ukraine-fire-missiles-into-russia-unlikely-to-have-decisive-effect	2024-11-18T10:21:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd70bce555bcf92acd402e05f78a520932ed2b4e/0_128_5310_3186/master/5310.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c376feba019f4e2a3b7910eb20465759

‘Israel is trying to terrorise people’: Lebanon’s civil defence reels after deadly strike	After 20 people including 15 first responders killed in Douris, rescuers ask why state service was targeted All the corpses had been recovered but still the rescuers sifted through the rubble. A paramedic carried a sack with him, filled with the charred remains of his colleagues. Every few feet he stopped and knelt down, assessing. In the twisted mess left behind by the Israeli airstrike, it was hard to distinguish between flesh, earth and the life-saving equipment that had melted in the heat of the blast. The night before, on Thursday, an Israeli jet had dropped a bomb on the salon of the Douris civil defence centre on the outskirts of the ancient Lebanese town of Baalbek, killing 20 people, including 15 first responders. Five were rendered unrecognisable by the force of the explosion. On Friday afternoon, emergency workers were still collecting bodily remains to be taken for DNA analysis.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/18/lebanon-civil-defence-reels-after-deadly-israeli-strike	2024-11-18T05:03:05-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83de65dd9864be288a39d0a9050ae859f45e1bdd/0_0_5149_3090/master/5149.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=410f2b7438b37c0ac65baa242934ecf2

First Thing: Biden lifts ban on Ukraine firing US weapons deeper into Russia	Ukraine will be permitted to fire US missiles in Kursk region. Plus, attorneys would be unable to stop Trump’s potential Capitol rioters pardon Good morning. Joe Biden has lifted the ban on Ukraine using long-range missiles to fire into Russian territory by permitting them to be used against Russian and North Korean forces in the Kursk region. How did Russia react? So far, Vladimir Putin has not said anything. But Vladimir Dzhabarov, the first deputy head of the Russian upper house’s international affairs committee, said: -This is a very big step towards the start of world war three.- How could this change the war? Ukraine has recently been losing ground on the frontline, and the deployment of thousands of North Korean troops threatened to tilt the war further in Russia’s favor. As Trump signals his desire to wind up the war with ceasefire negotiations – which critics say will mean, in effect, a Russian land grab – the use of long-range missiles gives Ukraine an opportunity to hang on to its territorial gains in Russia’s Kursk region. It could become a key bargaining chip. But it’s also likely to escalate the conflict. What could be the impact of RFK Jr’s nomination? Dr Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said even if public policies remained unchanged, authorities from the federal government speaking out against vaccines -discourages people who might otherwise be vaccinated, and at that point that’s as bad as not having a vaccine at all-.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/18/first-thing-biden-lifts-ban-on-ukraine-firing-us-weapons-deeper-into-russia	2024-11-18T03:07:58-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e4e470b0137700f1d8be3dcb53f27002dca57d5/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=18942e7e3afecdf3a23acdf9b9f40e46

The Daily Mail is splashing on criticism of the meeting from some Tories. When David Cameron was PM, he cultivated Xi with an eagerness and enthusiasm that makes Starmer look quite hostile towards China by comparison, but over the past decade Tory thinking about China has changed considerably, and the Mail story quotes Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former leader, saying -those suffering genocide and slave labour under the brutal hands of Xi will feel betrayed.-	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/18/keir-starmer-china-xi-jinping-g20-ukraine-latest-live-news	2024-11-18T01:04:40-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb080dbd3c5d86b6b7f880202346ff9e06472276/0_70_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=36abacd21d2ea1137d5c7576a766261e

Russia’s latest attack on Ukraine shows maximalist war aims remain unchanged	As President-Elect Trump talks up negotiations, Putin has made clear his position hasn’t changed since launching invasion in 2022 Millions of Ukrainians woke up early on Sunday morning to a massive Russian missile and drone attack on their country’s infrastructure, the biggest assault from Moscow since the end of August and the first large-scale attack since the US election. Donald Trump once promised to settle the Ukraine war in -24 hours- but the 120 missiles and 90 drones aimed at the nation’s utilities is a reminder that Moscow’s maximalist aspirations to cow and subjugate its neighbour remains unchanged.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/17/russias-latest-attack-on-ukraine-shows-maximalist-war-aims-remain-unchanged	2024-11-17T10:04:24-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c71effb55619847d02396a12fdb1779c3131bbf/0_133_2000_1201/master/2000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c0347d63d012751e9cab1a6d0730eaee

For many observers it is unclear who might be more relieved by that decision: Melania, who famously did not love her life in DC the first time around, or the White House itself, where Trump’s wife once expressed her discontent by filling the halls with blood-red Christmas trees and destroying the historically beloved Rose Garden.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/17/melania-trump-white-house	2024-11-17T07:00:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c63d363ccdd2678b6e33cf056ac7780c84968100/52_0_5542_3326/master/5542.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c90eb314fd71ef04a498a1181c1387b9

After decades, tiny 500-year-old royal portrait is identified as Mary Tudor	Art historian says miniature is of Henry VIII’s daughter – not his sixth wife Katherine Parr It’s Mary Tudor – by a nose. Not in a horse race, but from a comparison of portraits of Mary, Henry VIII’s elder daughter who became the first crowned queen of England, and Katherine Parr, his sixth wife. For decades, experts, including the noted historian and museum director Sir Roy Strong, have thought that a near 500-year-old miniature was of Parr. Now several leading Tudor authorities are convinced it is Mary, often dubbed -Bloody Mary- because as an ardent Catholic queen she ordered the killing of many Protestants.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/17/after-decades-tiny-500-year-old-royal-portrait-is-identified-as-mary-tudor	2024-11-17T06:00:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6f96b7cb950b502e077d10f33ee673c2051cef9/0_1215_3694_2216/master/3694.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9ca5246b3274a6ad6d6ed46eb2cd0ee5

Middle East crisis live: Israel strike kills Hezbollah lead spokesperson in Beirut	Mohammed Afif killed in first Israeli airstrike on central Beirut in more than a month, official says William Christou reports for the Guardian from Beirut on the strike by Israeli forces on a Ba’ath party center in Ras al-Nabaa, central Beirut, on Sunday afternoon, the first strike on central Beirut in over a month: The attack on the busy residential neighbourhood came without warning, and appeared to cause damage to neighbouring buildings. The strike comes as Israel intensifies its airstrikes across Lebanon as Lebanese officials prepare to give their response to an Israeli ceasefire proposal on Monday. The Israeli military issued a series of evacuation warnings on Saturday and Sunday for Dahiyeh, the southern suburbs of Beirut, striking over a dozen targets in bombings heard across the capital city. Afif had been especially visible after Israel’s military escalation in September and following the assassination of longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was also killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israeli warplanes had earlier pounded the southern suburbs of Beirut after the military warned people to evacuate from several buildings. The Hezbollah militant group has a strong presence in the area, known as the Dahiyeh, and the strikes came as Lebanese officials are considering a U.S.-brokered cease-fire proposal.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/17/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-strike-hezbollah-beirut-mohammed-afif	2024-11-17T05:02:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e75f797e43810f49802f1205f6b515dd5cb2e0a3/0_8_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a42caf50da27bf375b37a3478a75836f

The Danes may have Ozempic but the Swedes have lördagsgodis – Saturday sweets – where families chew through more than 1kg of sticky treats in an evening. That pride has given way to some irritation. Supplies of some Swedish sweets ran dry in the autumn due to the high demand in the US, South Korea and in Scandinavia.

Oxford relying on ‘Deliveroo-style’ contracts with most tutorials not taught by full-time staff	Leading university accused of relying on young academics employed on gig-economy terms Oxford University has been accused of relying on academics on -Deliveroo-style- and precarious fixed-term contracts to give the majority of its tutorials, after new research revealed just a third of lessons are taught by full-time professors. Data obtained through freedom of information requests by the University and College Union and shared exclusively with the Observer, reveals that about 61% of core tutorial teaching is done by academics on fixed-term contracts or in hourly-paid roles. The union says that pay is based mainly on contact hours with students, but once preparation, marking and supporting students is taken into account, this often falls below the minimum wage in real terms.	https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/nov/16/oxford-deliveroo-contracts-tutorials-full-time-staff-gig-economy	2024-11-16T02:06:14-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f520e67a90e90872f710fabddb5aeda3821fb480/0_112_5243_3146/master/5243.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1df48524d00e4e45763ac8c050f97fff

Ukraine war briefing: Zelenskyy says war will ‘end sooner’ once Trump enters White House	US president-elect says the war has ‘got to stop’ as German chancellor urges Putin to start talks with Kyiv in rare phone call. What we know on day 997 Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Russia’s war against his country will -end sooner- than it otherwise would have once Donald Trump becomes US president next year. In a radio interview aired on Saturday, the Ukrainian president conceded that the battlefield situation in eastern Ukraine was difficult and Russia was making advances. He said his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, was not interested in agreeing to a peace deal. Zelenskyy criticised a phone call between the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and Putin, saying it opened a -Pandora’s box- by undermining efforts to isolate the Russian leader. -Now there may be other conversations, other calls. Just a lot of words,- Zelenskyy said in his evening address on Friday. -And this is exactly what Putin has long wanted: it is extremely important for him to weaken his isolation and to conduct ordinary negotiations.- According to Reuters, Zelenskyy and other European officials had cautioned Scholz against the move. Scholz said Donald Trump privately held -a more nuanced position than is often assumed- on Ukraine. Trump’s reelection in last week’s US presidential vote has raised concerns he could withdraw Washington’s significant support for Ukraine once back in the White House. Scholz, who spoke to Trump by phone on Sunday, told the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on Friday his call with the president-elect was -perhaps surprisingly, a very detailed and good conversation-. Asked by the paper whether Trump would make a deal over the head of the Ukrainians, Scholz said Trump gave -no indication- that he would. Germany, for its part, would not accept a -peace by diktat-, Scholz said. Scholz urged Putin to pull Russian forces out of Ukraine and begin talks with Kyiv that would open the way for a -just and lasting peace-, in the first phone conversation between the two leaders in nearly two years. The Kremlin said the conversation on Friday had come at Berlin’s request, and that Putin had told Scholz any agreement to end the war in Ukraine must take Russian security interests into account and reflect -new territorial realities-. A German government spokesperson said Scholz -stressed Germany’s unbroken determination to back Ukraine in its defence against Russian aggression for as long as necessary-. Russian air defence units intercepted a series of Ukrainian drones in several Russian regions, officials said, many of them in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops launched a major incursion in August. Russia’s defence ministry said air defences downed 15 drones in Kursk region on the Ukrainian border. It said units downed one drone each in Bryansk region, also on the border, and in Lipetsk region, farther north. The ministry said one drone was downed in central Oryol region. And the governor of Belgorod region, a frequent target on the Ukrainian border, said a series of attacks had smashed windows in an apartment building and caused other damage, but no casualties were reported. Russia will suspend gas deliveries to Austria via Ukraine on Saturday. Russia’s gas export route to Europe via Ukraine is set to shut at the end of this year. Ukraine has said it will not extend the transit agreement with Russian state-owned Gazprom in order to deprive Russia of profits that Kyiv says help to finance the war against it. The Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, said Gazprom’s notice of ending supplies was long expected and Austria has made preparations, but the Ukrainian foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Russia’s action showed it -once again uses energy as a weapon-. Russia’s leading tanker group, Sovcomflot, said on Friday that western sanctions on Russian oil tankers were limiting its financial performance, as it reported falling revenues and core earnings. The US imposed sanctions on Sovcomflot in February, part of Washington’s efforts to reduce Russia’s revenues from oil sales that it can use to finance its war in Ukraine. Sovcomflot reported a 22.2% year-on-year drop in nine-month revenue to $1.22bn and said its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation slumped by 31.5% to $861m.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/16/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskyy-says-war-will-end-sooner-once-trump-enters-white-house	2024-11-16T00:56:56-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ee334bbe0de648585a49307ad8ebf5b2a74018c/0_0_3435_2060/master/3435.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c8d599474cca4d017bcd8fbebd0e52b0
Middle East crisis live: Israel strikes Beirut after evacuation call	Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said ‘the enemy’ carried out three air raids, including one near Haret Hreik Here is the tweet from the IDF’s Arabic spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, calling for the evacuation of southern Beirut’s Haret Hreik neighbourhood a couple of hours ago. -To all residents in the southern suburb area, specifically in the buildings specified in the attached maps and the buildings adjacent to them in Haret Hreik … You are located near Hezbollah facilities and interests, against which the IDF will act forcefully in the near future,- a translation of the post reads. A senior Hamas official has said the Palestinian militant group is -ready for a ceasefire- in Gaza and urged US president-elect Donald Trump to -pressure- Israel to -end the aggression-. -Hamas is ready to reach a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip if a ceasefire proposal is presented and on the condition that it is respected- by Israel, Hamas political bureau member Bassem Naim said. A UN spokesperson said that aid access in Gaza is at a low point with deliveries to parts of the north of the territory all but impossible. -From our perspective, on all indicators you can possibly think of in a humanitarian response, all of them are going in the wrong direction,- Jens Laerke told a press briefing. An Israeli airstrike flattened a building near one of Beirut’s busiest traffic junctions, Tayouneh. The targeted building was located in an area where the southern suburbs meet other. Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister has asked Iran to help secure a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hezbollah and appeared to urge it to convince the militant group to agree to a deal that could require it to pull back from the Israel-Lebanon border. The prime minister made the comments in talks with Ali Larijani, a top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, AP reported. Twenty-one civil defence rescuers were killed in two Israeli strikes on Lebanon on Thursday, marking one of the deadliest days for rescue workers since the fighting began between Israel and Hezbollah 13 months ago. The airstrikes brought the total number of emergency workers killed by Israel in Lebanon to more than 200. Fifty-nine people were killed in Israeli attacks on Lebanon on Thursday, bringing the total killed since October last year to at least 3,445, with 14,599 wounded, the Lebanese health ministry said in a statement on Friday.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/16/israel-lebanon-gaza-war-middle-east-hamas-hezbollah-latest	2024-11-16T00:41:24-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94fcacece6a50d26f1c905e53aeb21bdb9e1ad88/0_198_4464_2678/master/4464.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5b5630fd077d6c2f33d771655f6b3c7a

First Thing: RFK Jr condemned as ‘clear and present danger’ after Trump nomination	Experts warn making the anti-vaccine activist health secretary ‘is going to cost lives’. Plus, Paul Mescal interviews Ridley Scott Good morning. Donald Trump’s nomination of the anti-vaccine activist and conspiracy theorist Robert F Kennedy Jr as US secretary of health and human services has been decried by consumer advocacy groups, public health experts and pundits across the political divide, who say his appointment will cost lives. What happened in Samoa? Kennedy and his anti-vaccine nonprofit, Children’s Health Defense, reportedly spread anti-vaccine falsehoods in Samoa after its government had temporarily suspended its MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination program owing to the death of two babies because nurses had wrongly prepared doses. A year later, a measles outbreak killed 83. Kennedy denies responsibility. What is the controversy surrounding host countries? Azerbaijan is a large-scale fossil fuel producer. One of its government organizing members was also recently filmed appearing to offer help with fossil fuel deals. Is this new? No. Last year’s summit was also held in a petrostate, the United Arab Emirates, while that conference’s president kept his main job of heading the national oil company, Adnoc.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/15/first-thing-rfk-jr-condemned-as-clear-and-present-danger-after-trump-nomination	2024-11-15T03:25:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b742843ecd3ae28186638face98436ced134ee1/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1012ee6b672295036a130a9f71238f75

Trump’s RFK Jr nomination condemned as ‘public health catastrophe’ – US politics live	Widespread criticism of health secretary role for anti-vaccine activist and purveyor of debunked conspiracy theories Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news from Washington over the next few hours. We start with the news that Donald Trump’s nomination of Robert F Kennedy Jr as US secretary of health and human services has prompted widespread criticisms towards Kennedy, an anti-vaccine activist who has embraced a slew of other debunked health-related conspiracy theories. The FBI should investigate both Gaetz and Tulsi Gabbard before they are confirmed for their cabinet posts, Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton has said. Gabbard, who Trump nominated as director of national intelligence, is known for her tolerant view of Russian president Vladimir Putin and Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Elon Musk reportedly met Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations on Monday, and discussed how to defuse tensions between Iran and the US, two Iranian officials told the New York Times. As Trump prepares to address conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, Musk, the world’s richest man, has been assisting in discussions with foreign officials, establishing himself as the country’s most influential civilian come January. Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are seeking Americans who are -high-IQ small-government revolutionaries- and willing to work over 80 hours a week to join their new department, at zero pay. Trump named Musk to co-lead the newly created government efficiency department that sits outside the federal government. Advocates have urged state governments to find new ways to defend immigrants and block Trump’s mass deportation plan. California shielded many non-citizen residents from removal in Trump’s first term but immigrants rights groups warn an aggressive, multi-pronged response will be needed. A Democratic lawmaker will file a motion specifically mentioning Trump can only serve two terms, after the president-elect joked he would be willing to serve an unconstitutional third term as president while meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday. Trump announced his former Georgia congressman Doug Collins as secretary of veterans affairs. Collins ran for Senate in 2020, finishing third in the primary. He also -provided counsel to Trump in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election as Trump sought to challenge Georgia’s election results-.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/15/donald-trump-rfk-jr-matt-gaetz-us-politics-live	2024-11-15T02:52:13-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/175036941419b4e6ceb17f89e431794e7395420e/0_33_4532_2720/master/4532.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2799fbd25a1f31d855f9c2bd9e5193ef

Reeves ‘not satisfied’ with growth as Tories accuse Labour of talking down economy – UK politics live	UK economy at near-standstill as uncertainty over the budget and high interest rates weighed on consumer spending Chancellor Rachel Reeves has says she is not satisfied with the latest GDP figures, which shadow chancellor Mel Stride also described this morning as -disappointing-. The UK economy slowed to a near-standstill in the third quarter as uncertainty surrounding Labour’s first budget and high interest rates weighed on business and consumer spending. At my budget, I took the difficult choices to fix the foundations and stabilise our public finances. Now we are going to deliver growth through investment and reform to create more jobs and more money in people’s pockets, get the NHS back on its feet, rebuild Britain and secure our borders in a decade of national renewal. I think a lot of that is because this government, on coming to office, talked down the UK economy. And it did that because it always planned to jack up taxes in the way that it has in the budget, and wanted to make out there was a bigger problem than there was. The UK economy slowed to a near-standstill with growth of just 0.1% in the third quarter of the year as uncertainty surrounding Labour’s first budget and high interest rates weighed on business and consumer spending Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: -Improving economic growth is at the heart of everything I am seeking to achieve, which is why I am not satisfied with these numbers- Shadow chancellor Mel Stride has been on the media round, describing the figures, which do partly cover a brief period when his party were still in government, as -disappointing- The Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has urged ministers to -rebuild relations- with the EU, warning that Brexit has undermined the UK’s economy Leading Tories Robert Jenrick and Oliver Dowden were on the committee that backed plans for the -rushed and misjudged- £15m purchase of an asbestos-ridden site for asylum accommodation The Liberal Democrats are campaigning about bus fares in England.

Middle East crisis live: Paramedics reported killed in Israeli attack on Lebanon as IDF orders evacuation of Beirut suburb	Lebanon’s state-run national news agency said the Ghobeiry area ‘witnessed heavy gunfire’ from Israeli forces We are restarting our live coverage of Israel’s wars in Lebanon and Gaza. The Israeli military has ordered residents to immediately evacuate the Beirut southern suburb of Ghobeiry, where it says Hezbollah fighters are located. In Gaza, at least two people were killed and several others injured after an overnight Israeli airstrike hit a residential apartment in the centre of Deir al-Balah, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa. In a separate attack, the outlet reports that two members of the same family – a father and son – were killed in an Israeli missile strike that targeted a home in the village of al-Nasr, northeast of the southern city of Rafah. The Israel Defense Forces said two rockets launched from Lebanon at the Haifa Bay area of Israel were successfully intercepted by air defenses. There were no immediate reports of any injuries. Canada’s foreign minister has expressed deep concern about -catastrophic- humanitarian conditions across Gaza and warned about -the life-threatening levels of acute malnutrition.- The country’s foreign affairs minister, Melanie Joly, cited a 8 November report by the Famine Review Committee that found a strong likelihood that famine is occurring or imminent in areas within the northern Gaza Strip. She said Israel must abide by its obligations under international humanitarian law and provide a significant and sustained increase to humanitarian assistance for Palestinians.

US states urged to find new ways to block Trump’s mass deportation plan	California and other states must mount aggressive, multipronged response to defend immigrants, advocates warn California, home to the largest immigrant population in the US, is bracing for Donald Trump’s plan to enact the -largest deportation operation in American history-, with advocates pushing state leaders to find new and creative ways to disrupt his agenda. The Golden state led the fight against Trump’s first term, shielding many non-citizen residents from removal by restricting local cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

First Thing: Israel accused of crimes against humanity over forced displacement in Gaza	Human Rights Watch says its evidence suggests Israel has committed a war crime against civilians. Plus, Mark Zuckerberg drops a cover of Get Low with T-Pain Good morning. Israel has been accused of crimes against humanity over its use of evacuation orders to pursue the -deliberate and massive forced displacement- of civilians in Gaza, in a new report by Human Rights Watch. How much of Gaza’s population has been displaced? More than 90%, with many civilians forced to move multiple times. What do the Geneva conventions say about displacement? That in occupied territories, civilians must be displaced only in exceptional circumstances – but Israel has used evacuation orders repeatedly. What’s Gaetz’s background? As a member of the Maga-aligned Freedom Caucus in the House, he led the successful charge to oust the former Republican House speaker Kevin McCarthy from his role. Why else might he be controversial? Though charges were never brought, he was investigated by the justice department in a sex-trafficking case involving children, and by the House ethics committee over allegations including sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. He strongly denies wrongdoing.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/14/first-thing-israel-accused-of-crimes-against-humanity-over-forced-displacement-in-gaza	2024-11-14T03:12:55-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64f727ca4a38e9480f9c159fa84a902bae40a10b/0_0_7500_4500/master/7500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=585f7af26393a2ebaca9eda598a445b0

We’re two weeks on from the budget, and from the government’s point of view it seems to have landed quite well.

In the days before the killing of 44-year-old Bobby Smallwood made international news headlines, staffers at Portland’s Legacy Good Samaritan hospital made five separate complaints to administrators against the man later charged with his murder, PoniaX Calles, according to the lawsuit from the victim’s family, which was filed on Tuesday.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/oregon-hospital-security-guard-death	2024-11-13T03:00:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/388e0beffe5400776beb87d2cef6445a3da09864/0_254_3855_2314/master/3855.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dad1b6a114b5f3709bbbfba9bb363e1c
US Congress to hold second hearing on UFOs in attempt to ‘pull back curtain’	House committee’s hearing will have ‘expert witnesses’ to shed light on unidentified anomalous phenomena The United States Congress will hold a hearing on Wednesday to discuss the topic of UFOs that some lawmakers are hopeful will lead to new information on a subject that is the focus of many conspiracy theorists but has also recently attracted serious attention from government officials. The House oversight committee’s hearing will be titled Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.

For months Germany has been hamstrung by the weakness of its squabbling three-way coalition government, leaving allies lamenting that Europe’s most powerful country and largest economy was unable to take big decisions.

Both men, CNN notes, -lead companies with existing, lucrative government contracts.- Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal agencies.

Fox News host Pete Hegseth will serve as secretary of defense, while John Ratcliffe will lead the CIA and William Joseph McGinley will serve as White House counsel Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead a new -Department of Government Efficiency-, which Trump says will not actually be a government agency. They will, according to Trump, work from outside the government to -drive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to government never seen before-.

Streeting defends plan for hospital league tables after backlash – UK politics live	Health secretary says bad managers are NHS’s ‘guilty secret’ in broadcast round ahead of first major speech on health service reform Good morning. Wes Streeting, the health secretary (for England), is giving his first major speech on NHS reform, and there has been almost as much advance pitch-rolling for what he is going to say as you get for a budget. The Department of Health and Social Care has already press released three stories about what Streeting will say, starting on Monday. -Trusts could be banned from using agencies to cover gaps in entry level positions, and agencies could be banned from re-introducing NHS workers that leave permanent jobs,- the DHSC said on Monday, in its first announcement about the reform package. Pay arrangements for NHS trust chief executives will be changed so they are linked to performance, with -no more rewards for failure-, Streeting said in another press release about his plans. -NHS league tables will be introduced to help tackle the NHS crisis-, the DHSC said last night, in a briefing ahead of the speech today. There’s nothing more demoralising than going to work, busting a gut for your patients, and knowing that despite your best efforts you’re letting them down because you’re not given the tools to do the job, and you’re working in a context where … you’ve got poor leadership. On urgent and emergency care, for example, there is a wide variation across NHS performance, ranging from 83% of people in one trust being seen within four hours in type 1 A&amp;Es right down to 38.2%. That’s over 44 percentage points difference.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/13/wes-streeting-nhs-hospital-league-tables-starmer-badenoch-pmqs-uk-politics-live	2024-11-13T00:57:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7b22576a7ab771b567f029a78d5a1cc15c2c4f3/0_298_7975_4785/master/7975.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1f0b8faef7c7cefd220877bc8eba2d8d

Middle East crisis live: Aid groups hit out at Israel as US ultimatum over Gaza expires	Humanitarian groups say almost none of the US’s demands that Israel improve conditions in Gaza have been met A coalition of international aid organisations have accused Israel of ignoring a US ultimatum that threatened sanctions if Israel did not implement a series of measures to counter the acute humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The 30-day ultimatum – which was due to expire yesterday or today – was delivered on 13 October, and almost none of its demands have been met, the humanitarian groups say. Donald Trump has chosen the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee as the next US ambassador to Israel. Huckabee has a track record of hardline, occasionally provocative, pro-Israel rhetoric and previously said Israel has a rightful claim to the West Bank, which he refers to by its Hebrew and biblical name of Judea and Samaria. Palestinian medical officials say Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 46 people in the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours, including 11 at a makeshift cafeteria in an Israeli-declared humanitarian zone. In Lebanon, warplanes struck Beirut’s southern suburbs and killed 33 people elsewhere across the country on Tuesday. Large explosions shook Beirut’s southern suburbs – an area known as Dahiyeh, where Hezbollah has a significant presence – soon after the Israeli military issued evacuation warnings for 11 houses there. Lebanese state-run media reported an Israeli strike on an apartment south of the capital Beirut on Wednesday that injured an unspecified number of people. -Israeli warplanes launched a strike at dawn targeting a residential apartment in a building in the Dawhet Aramoun area, injuring people,- the official National News Agency said. International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi will visit Tehran on Wednesday for crucial talks on Iran’s nuclear programme. His visit comes only two days after the Israel defence minister warned that Iran was -more exposed than ever to strikes on its nuclear facilities-. US forces on Tuesday carried out strikes against targets linked to an Iranian-backed militia in Syria in response to a rocket attack on Washington’s troops in the country, the US military said. The strikes targeted the group’s -weapons storage and logistics headquarters facility … in response to a rocket attack on US personnel,- the US Central Command (Centcom) said in a post on social media that did not identify the militia by name. Australia will not change its laws on the supply of weapons or ammunition to Israel if the coalition wins the next federal election, opposition foreign spokesperson Simon Birmingham says. The Liberal senator said the coalition had -no plans- to change the rules, as it emerged during a parliamentary hearing Australia had amended or lapsed at least 16 defence-related export permits to Israel after a review.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/13/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-aid-gaza-us-ultimatum-sanctions-lebanon	2024-11-12T23:59:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/967ba583087ccfa06c5daaac090e89b15ee236c9/0_200_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4709b8b5122bf123e48224c1b925f799
The C of E’s CEO: how will history judge Justin Welby’s tenure as archbishop of Canterbury?	Welby worked hard to hold the Anglican church together on many controversial issues, but in the end it was his own failings that led to his downfall In the almost 12 years that Justin Welby has been archbishop of Canterbury, the Church of England has both cemented its place at the heart of the establishment and become less and less relevant to the lives of most citizens. Welby has buried a queen, crowned a king and married a prince. He has offered spiritual counsel to six prime ministers and debated issues of national importance in the House of Lords. He has addressed the nation regularly via the BBC, with Christmas, new year and Easter messages and occasional Thought for the Day broadcasts.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/13/how-will-history-judge-justin-welby-tenure-as-archbishop-of-canterbury	2024-11-12T23:50:55-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c77555912662bd074badae14fe4577b7fcbba02d/0_117_2345_1407/master/2345.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=94ae778b772ccbe90c34f181fa56e069

Portland’s first ranked-choice vote elects progressive outsider as mayor	As US electorate moves to right, Oregon city bucks trend and also elects most diverse city council in history In 2022 it appeared the political winds in Portland, Oregon, one of the US’s most progressive cities, were beginning to shift. Residents who had grown frustrated over the city’s approach to homelessness rejected incumbent Jo Ann Hardesty – the first Black woman to serve on the city council – in favor of the -law-and-order- Democrat Rene Gonzalez, who pledged to back an expanded police force and -clean up- Portland. But this month, as swaths of the US electorate moved to the right, the Pacific north-west city took a markedly different approach. Residents elected the most diverse city council in Portland history, opting for more progressives, and rejected Gonzalez as mayoral candidate. Instead, they chose Keith Wilson, a businessperson who has never before held office and has promised to end unsheltered homelessness in a year.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/portland-mayor-election-keith-wilson	2024-11-12T12:00:36-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/611a3c59ab8db102ed5f6e88761474d19ef5b513/205_368_4210_2526/master/4210.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=172882a6ea7c796f619f031ffd66eb85

Australia news live: average age for first porn viewing reduces by two years; NSW nurses to begin strike	Girls now see porn for the first time before they are 14, on average. Follow today’s news live Girls are now seeing porn for the first time at 13.6 years, on average – two years younger than they were in 2018. And more than 70% of young people say porn often shows aggression and violence towards women, a new report from Our Watch has found. Our Watch’s concern is with the representation of certain people, particularly women, rather than porn itself. It’s the frequent viewing of violent porn, that is sexist and derogatory, [and] associated with a greater likelihood of men and boys holding attitudes that can lead to violence against women. The line between IRL [in real life] and online is very blurry, so we can’t just say certain types of porn are bad… we’ve actually got to take proactive actions across the rest of a young person’s life so they can critique it. I want to assure the community that we are doing everything we can to minimise the impact of this on their care. NSW Health is working hard to ensure postponed surgeries are rescheduled as quickly as reasonably possible.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/nov/13/australia-news-live-average-age-for-first-porn-viewing-reduces-by-two-years-nsw-nurses-to-begin-strike	2024-11-12T11:44:59-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30731f9fee75ce74481cb900ac7b7bb3cf028db/0_189_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4211029e06a01371dc5eacfff460ae75

Justin Welby: why archbishop chosen for his managerial skills had to go	Failure to tackle Church of England’s safeguarding issues and own knowledge of abuse reflect religions’ denial In earlier times it used to be more straightforward: archbishops of Canterbury such as Thomas Becket and William Laud used to get it in the neck from the king; or, in the case of Simon Sudbury who was killed in the 14th-century Peasants’ Revolt, at the hands of the mob. Now, it’s more likely to be a politician. Justin Welby has resigned after having lost the confidence of the Church of England over his failure to tackle the institution’s chaotic handling of safeguarding, and his own personal culpability in failing to spot his own vulnerability, arising from his links to and knowledge of the rapacious abuser John Smyth.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/12/justin-welby-why-archbishop-chosen-for-his-managerial-skills-had-to-go	2024-11-12T11:19:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c77555912662bd074badae14fe4577b7fcbba02d/0_58_2345_1408/master/2345.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=37b6edd6cec325144398ef47df6fe287

Some will think a woman should lead the C of E and age limitation will rule out a number of bishops • Keir Starmer refuses to back Justin Welby Justin Welby’s resignation will trigger a search for the 106th archbishop of Canterbury, a role that combines moral and spiritual leadership, ceremonial duties, a seat in the House of Lords, oversight of Anglican churches in more than 160 countries, and the day-to-day management of a large but declining English institution. Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York, is expected to step up to the number one position in the Church of England until a new archbishop of Canterbury can be appointed – a process that will take several months.

But he said he also offered to remain in office until the resolution of the bankruptcy.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/new-orleans-catholic-church-gregory-aymond	2024-11-12T04:00:57-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/013df1f3eb9ba443f8466d224a81c81be20ccc04/0_36_3599_2159/master/3599.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6bfdf15ae6f52e7cb4f7abf04522504c

Trump poised to appoint Rubio as judge decides whether to overturn criminal conviction – US politics live	Former Republican challenger likely to become secretary of state as further developments expected in Trump’s legal battles Good morning, and welcome to our US politics blog. US President-elect Donald Trump announced several new members of his incoming administration on Monday, and is reportedly expected to name Marco Rubio – a one time challenger in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries – as secretary of state. The New York Times reports that Trump is expected to name Florida senator Marco Rubio his secretary of state. The paper cites three unnamed sources -familiar with [Trump’s] thinking-. Rubio has said that Ukraine needs to seek a negotiated settlement with Moscow rather than focus on regaining all territory that Russia has taken in the last decade. He was also one of 15 Republican senators to vote against a $95 billion military aid package for Ukraine, passed in April. Rubio serves as the vice-chairman of the Senate intelligence committee and sits on the foreign relations committee. The US president-elect has reportedly asked US Representative Michael Waltz, a retired Army National Guard officer and war veteran, to be his national security adviser. Waltz, regarded by many in Washington as hawkish on China and Iran, has also been a member of the intelligence and foreign affairs committees. Trump picked South Dakota governor Kristi Noem to serve as the next secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, CNN reported on Tuesday, citing two sources. The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for a range of issues, including border protection, immigration, disaster response and the US secret service. Noem, once seen as a possible running mate for Trump, made headlines after refusing to impose a statewide mask mandate during the pandemic. Trump announced that the former New York congressman Lee Zeldin will be selected to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump, who oversaw the rollback of more than 100 environmental rules when he last was US president, said Zeldin was a -true fighter for America First policies- and that -he will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions-. Stephen Miller, the author of Trump’s so-called -Muslim ban- immigration policy during his first term, is set to be his deputy chief of staff with a broad portfolio. Trump said on Sunday that Tom Homan, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), will be in charge of the country’s borders in his new administration. Homan told Fox News: -If sanctuary cities don’t want to help us, then get the hell out of the way, because we’re coming.- New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, 40, has been made ambassador to the United Nations. Stefanik, a Trump-skeptic turned Trump-ally, is the House Republican Conference chair, making her the fourth-ranking House Republican. On Thursday, Trump made his first appointment, naming Susie Wiles, who has worked on Republican campaigns since the days of Ronald Reagan, White House chief of staff. She was previously the campaign manager for his victorious bid for re-election.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/12/donald-trump-marco-rubio-juan-merchan-stormy-daniels-us-politics-live	2024-11-12T02:59:28-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa308146121a4425136d2e2d48282839b8fabddd/0_0_6086_3651/master/6086.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0c8ab1a9f6df8993bf1a270c00d0ae6a

Starmer says Labour MPs must decide for themselves on assisted dying, refusing to say how he will vote – UK politics live	The prime minister says his MPs must ‘make their own mind up’ on whether to vote in favour of legalising assisted dying Good morning. Parliament passes important laws (as well as some rather tedious ones), but normally the process is predictable because the government is in charge and most of what it does foreshadowed in a manifesto. Once a minister says ‘X will become law’, usually it does. But assisted dying is different because the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater is trying to change the bill through the private member’s bill process, MPs will have a free vote and no one really has much of a clue as to what will happen. The main uncertainty is whether or not MPs will vote to give the bill a second reading when it is debated, on Friday 29 November. But even if it passes at second reading, given the jeopardy inherent in the private member’s bill process, it could still be touch and go whether it becomes law. Look, it’s going to be a free vote and I mean that. It will be for every MP to decide for themselves how they want to vote. I’m not going to be putting any pressure whatsoever on Labour MPs. They will make their own mind up, as I will be.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/12/keir-starmer-labour-kim-leadbeater-assisted-dying-bill-uk-politics-news-updates	2024-11-12T01:13:16-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a73118582c864545e3618b35a7cf0411442cffce/0_0_7073_4246/master/7073.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=09bdcdc6ec7599efdefbaa26ded92ebd
Middle East crisis live: New Israeli defence minister dismisses talk of ceasefire in Lebanon	Comments from Israel Katz follow remarks from fellow minister yesterday that ‘certain progress’ had been made Israel’s newly appointed defense minister Israel Katz has said there will be -no ceasefire- and -no respite- in Lebanon, which has seen a series of Israeli airstrikes and ground incursions in recent weeks. Over 3,000 people have been killed. Posting to social media Israel Katz said: The warning and powerful activity carried out by the IDF and the security agencies against Hezbollah and the elimination of [Hassan] Nasrallah are a picture of victory and the offensive activity should be continued, in order to worsen Hezbollah’s capabilities and realise the fruits of victory. In Lebanon there will be no ceasefire and there will be no respite. We will continue to hit Hezbollah with full force until the goals of the war are achieved. Israel will not agree to any arrangement that does not guarantee Israel’s right to enforce and prevent terrorism on its own, and meeting the goals of the war in Lebanon, [which are] disarming Hezbollah and them withdrawing beyond the Litani River, and returning the residents of the north safely to their homes. Israel’s recently appointed defence minister, Israel Katz, has dismissed talk of a ceasefire in Lebanon, saying -there will be no ceasefire and there will be no respite- Israel’s newly appointed foreign minister, Gideon Saar, who replaced Katz in the role, had said on Monday that -certain progress- had been made on ceasefire talks in Lebanon.

Trump ‘right’ to speak to Putin over Ukraine war, says UK defence secretary – UK politics live	Comments by John Healey come as Starmer is in Paris to meet Macron and discuss implications of Trump’s victory Good morning. Keir Starmer is in Paris this morning for talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron. The prime minister is visiting to attend the French Armistice Day service, but the real interest will lie in what the leaders of Europe’s two military powers have to say as they discuss the implications of Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. Here is Jessica Elgot’s overnight preview story. Donald Trump spoke on the phone with Vladimir Putin on Thursday and discussed the war in Ukraine, the Washington Post reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. The US president-elect advised the Russian president not to escalate the war in Ukraine and reminded him of -Washington’s sizeable military presence in Europe-, the Post reported. Ukraine is certainly under pressure. Russia is certainly escalating, and President Trump has reportedly told Putin and warned him against further escalation. If he’s done that, he’s right to do so. Russia is escalating with massing North Korean troops on their territory. It’s escalating with more than 2,000 one-way attack kamikaze drones aimed at Kyiv and the rest of the Ukrainian cities in the last month alone. And one person is responsible for that escalation, and that’s Putin.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/11/starmer-macron-trump-putin-ukraine-uk-politics-live	2024-11-11T00:59:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d11e795cdda6d54cd944631bdd95d58307aa5b06/0_104_8640_5184/master/8640.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25ff442507b3acc283d5fd2af64d56e6

Israel claims to have intercepted projectile from Yemen as firefighters battle blazes – Middle East crisis live	IDF says fires in Bet Shemesh area, west of Jerusalem, were sparked by debris from intercepting missile fired from Yemen Outgoing US president Joe Biden is due to meet with Israel’s president Isaac Herzog on Tuesday, according to a report from Reuters.

Sweep of swing states rubs salt in Democrats’ wounds as Trump prepares to meet Biden	Trump to visit Oval Office on Wednesday as Biden says he will ‘ensure a peaceful and orderly transition’ Donald Trump was declared the winner in Arizona early on Sunday, completing the Republicans’ clean sweep of the so-called swing states and rubbing salt in Democrats’ wounds as it was announced that the president-elect is scheduled to meet with Joe Biden at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the presidential handover. In a national campaign that was projected as being extremely close but he ended up winning handily, the result in Arizona gives Trump 312 electoral college votes, compared with Kamala Harris’s 226. The state joins the other Sun belt swing states – Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina – and the three Rust belt states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in voting Republican. All were expected to be extremely competitive but all went for Trump, though by fairly close margins.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/10/trump-arizona-swing-states-sweep	2024-11-10T11:55:01-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/827418b53de6099f2f9152ff1aa05bb97d836ad6/0_79_3376_2026/master/3376.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=766efa098b78b0f93c810d4b47a1449d

‘The movement is not over’: leaders of Uncommitted look ahead at organizing during Trump term	While disappointed, leaders say Democratic party stuck with ‘status quo’ instead of listening to voter concerns Following Donald Trump’s decisive victory in this week’s presidential election, leaders of the anti-war group Uncommitted National Movement expressed their disappointment over the results, highlighting the Democratic party’s failure to listen to its base and prioritize progressive policies. Since the movement formed last winter, its leaders have urged the Democratic party to heed their demands of a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and to adopt an arms embargo on Israel, or risk losing their votes. While a full picture of how Arab and Muslim Americans voted in the presidential election is still being captured, this election showed a shift among communities that had long formed the Democratic base. A majority of Muslim Americans voted for the Green party candidate Jill Stein at 53%, according to a nationwide exit poll of more than 1,500 Muslim Americans by the civil rights group Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), followed by 21% for Trump and 20% for vice-president Kamala Harris.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/10/uncommitted-movement-leaders-organizing-trump	2024-11-10T05:00:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a5f190d5604844ff813f71ab274df078a03dabc/0_221_3300_1979/master/3300.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=be45b407db043d107dbe1a22b40f7967

Trump’s White House circle takes shape amid fears over extremist appointments	President-elect said to be considering immigration and foreign policy hardliners – plus the controversial RFK Jr Donald Trump’s second administration has begun to take shape amid fears over extremist appointments and how far right the US will go while Republicans control the White House and probably both chambers of Congress. The range of names being put forward varies from members of Trump’s inner circle to the world’s richest man, tech mogul Elon Musk. Alongside plutocrats and technocrats are hardline ideologues on immigration and foreign policy and the controversial figure of Robert F Kennedy Jr, a leading vaccine conspiracy theorist.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/10/trump-white-house-circle	2024-11-10T04:00:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27d2c09b600f2ae4328bee779ca41a3f29819c8a/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b1f8eb9e93e7512dc34c287f84773100
Kamala Harris is just the latest victim of global trend to oust incumbents	Voters across the world have backed any alternative to the people in charge What do the British Conservatives, the New Zealand Labour party, the LDP of Japan and the ANC of South Africa have in common? Defeat. All four led governments that have been pummelled at the polls recently as part of the greatest wave of anti-incumbent voting ever seen. Governments of left and right, radicals and moderates, liberals and nationalists: all are falling. This week the US Democratic party joined the electoral casualty list, bested by the man they ousted four years ago, the past and now future president, Donald Trump. Critics and cheerleaders alike see Trump as an extraordinary figure with a unique appeal. But his triumph is the rule, not the exception. Defeated vice-president Kamala Harris ran ahead of the global trend, even more so in the crucial swing states. But she was swept away nonetheless.	https://www.theguardian.com/global/2024/nov/10/kamala-harris-is-just-the-latest-victim-of-global-trend-to-oust-incumbents	2024-11-10T04:00:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d81477f4180749705d72e83c356ba9dab4d19800/0_182_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f8004b5be09d574517ee5e696d0170bb

Donald Trump wins Arizona as US House moves closer to Republican control – US politics live	President-elect completes clean sweep of seven battleground states; Republican representative defeats former Navajo Nation president for House seat Donald Trump won the presidential election in Arizona, the Associated Press (AP) declared on Saturday, completing a clean sweep of all seven battleground states and locking in a decisive electoral college victory over the Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris. Trump, who had secured the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White House by early Wednesday, now has what is expected to be a final total of 312 votes to Harris’ 226. Protests against Trump erupted in the US on Saturday as people on both coasts took to the streets in frustration about his re-election. Thousands of people in major cities including New York City and Seattle demonstrated against the former president and now president-elect amid his threats against reproductive rights and pledges to carry out mass deportations at the start of his upcoming presidency. Biden and Trump will meet on Wednesday in the Oval Office, the White House announced on Saturday. -At President Biden’s invitation, President Biden and president-elect Trump will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday,- the press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said in a statement. Republicans on Saturday appeared close to clinching control of the US House of Representatives, a critical element for Trump to advance his agenda when the president-elect returns to the White House in January. The AP reported that three US House races in Arizona were too early to call on Saturday, most notably the first and sixth congressional districts. The president-elect has charged Howard Lutnick, a longtime friend, and one of the few high-profile figures in corporate America to vocally endorse his campaign, with recruiting officials who will deliver, rather than dilute, his agenda. The CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, and co-chair of Trump’s transition team, has made no secret of his plan to stack the new White House with loyalists – and keep out anyone who threatens to derail his pledges. A senior adviser to Trump said that the incoming US administration’s priority for Ukraine will be achieving peace rather than helping it regain territory captured by Russia in the almost three years of the war. In an interview with the BBC, broadcast on Saturday, Bryan Lanza, who has been a political adviser to Trump since his 2016 presidential campaign, said: -When Zelenskyy says we will only stop this fighting, there will only be peace, once Crimea is returned, we’ve got news for President Zelenskyy: Crimea is gone.- An employee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) has been fired from her job and is being investigated because she told a disaster relief team she was directing in Florida after Hurricane Milton to avoid homes displaying election campaign signs supporting Trump, conduct that the agency head on Saturday called -reprehensible-.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/10/donald-trump-arizona-swing-states-house-representatives-republicans-us-politics-latest-updates	2024-11-10T00:57:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4de7ba42cceec10b200fb94a63959087d9bcb02/0_213_7008_4205/master/7008.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=71a8f52781f3e0ccaa6e18ce05fa6dd3

Texas woman sets record for donating more than 2,000 liters of breastmilk	Alyse Ogletree has helped nourished hundreds of thousands of babies as a means of giving to charity Alyse Ogletree would love it if she could donate immense amounts of money to all sorts of worthy causes, but as a mother raising three young children, that’s not something realistic. So the 36-year-old from Flower Mound, Texas, has found another way to fulfill her philanthropic instinct: giving away a record amount of breastmilk that officials estimate has been enough to nourish hundreds of thousands of premature babies. -I have a big heart, [but] at the end of the day, I’m not made of money and I can’t give away money to good causes over and over because I have a family to support for,- Ogletree said in an interview recently published on Guinness World Records’ website.

Middle East live: at least nine Palestinians killed after reported Israeli attack in ‘humanitarian zone’	Al Jazeera reports that women and children are among the dead after the Israeli attack on the al-Mawasi area near Khan Younis Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the conflicts in the Middle East. At least 14 people were killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza late on Friday and early on Saturday, the Palestinian news agency Wafa has reported. There is a -strong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas- of the northern Gaza Strip, a committee of global food security experts warned on Friday, as Israel claims to be pursuing a military offensive against Palestinian militant group Hamas in the area. -Immediate action, within days not weeks, is required from all actors who are directly taking part in the conflict, or have influence on its conduct, to avert and alleviate this catastrophic situation,- the independent Famine Review Committee (FRC) said in a rare alert. The FRC said it could be -assumed that starvation, malnutrition, and excess mortality due to malnutrition and disease, are rapidly increasing- in north Gaza. -Famine thresholds may have already been crossed or else will be in the near future,- the global hunger monitor said. Nearly 70% of the people killed in the war in Gaza are women and children, according to a UN analysis of verified deaths that highlights the heavy civilian toll of the conflict. In a new report, the most detailed analysis of its kind yet, the UN human rights office said it had verified 8,119 of those killed during the first six months of the war in Gaza. Of the fatalities, 3,588 were children and 2,036 were women. The youngest victim was a one-day-old boy and the oldest was a 97-year-old woman. The UN’s peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon said on Friday that the Israeli military’s -deliberate and direct destruction- of its property was a -flagrant violation- of international law. Since Israel launched a ground campaign across the border against Hezbollah fighters at the end of September, Unifil has accused the Israel Defense Forces on several occasions of deliberately attacking its bases, including by shooting at peacekeepers and destroying watchtowers, which Israel denies. In its latest accusation, Unifil said the IDF used excavators and a bulldozer to destroy part of a fence and concrete structure at a UN peacekeeping position in southern Lebanon on Thursday. Peacekeepers had also observed Israeli troops this week removing a barrel that marks blue line, it said. Benjamin Netanyahu has appointed a hardline supporter of the war in Gaza and longtime backer of settlements in the West Bank as his ambassador to the US as Israel prepares for the incoming administration of Donald Trump. Yechiel Leiter, an American-born rightwing publicist and former government aide who immigrated to Israel four decades ago, was announced as Israel’s next ambassador to Washington on Friday. Amsterdam police have made more than 60 arrests after what authorities called -hateful antisemitic violence- against Israeli football fans. A plane carrying football supporters brought home from the Dutch capital by the Israeli government landed on Friday at Israel’s Ben Gurion airport after the clashes on Thursday, which took place after a Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv. Amsterdam’s police chief, Peter Holla, said there had been -incidents on both sides-, starting on Wednesday night when Maccabi fans tore down a Palestinian flag from the facade of a building in the city centre and shouted -fuck you Palestine-. A social media video verified by Reuters showed Maccabi fans setting off flares and chanting -Olé, olé, let the IDF win, we will fuck the Arabs-, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/09/middle-east-live-israel-gaza-war-hamas-lebanon-hezbollah	2024-11-09T00:13:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4dc1f8e202985448dea2e3b89f50fc8ba61f535/0_279_5500_3301/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=131f8b15988bf193615ed0eeaf9885ae
