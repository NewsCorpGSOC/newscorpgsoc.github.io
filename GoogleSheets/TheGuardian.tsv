Family of Ethel Rosenberg say US document proves she was no Soviet spy	Sons whose mother was executed with her husband Julius in 1953 say newly released document proves innocence The family of Ethel Rosenberg, who was sent to the electric chair along with her husband, Julius, in 1953 after being convicted of spying for the Soviets at the height of the Red Scare, have called on Joe Biden to formally exonerate her after a newly released document appeared to show that the US government knew she was not a spy. The couple maintained their innocence until the end and the case of the Rosenbergs has long been seen as a possible miscarriage of justice. Though most historians see Julius Rosenberg as a real Soviet spy, questions about Ethel Rosenberg’s role have lingered and their sons, Robert and Michael Meeropol, have long campaigned in their family’s cause.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/10/ethel-rosenberg-soviet-spy-new-evidence	2024-09-10T11:54:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/feff2c823c1ff9388af862e2dd64f2f92fe7ff5f/0_384_2008_1204/master/2008.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03f0cda00c2c53121770d8bb94c1ba64

Iran’s missile supply to Moscow may reveal true scale of Pezeshkian’s powers	Despite desire to improve relations with Europe, the president has put Iran back on the sanction treadmill Iran’s decision to sell Russia short range missiles supplementing Moscow’s existing supplies appears, on the surface, to be a political reversal for Masoud Pezeshkian, Iran’s new reformist president. He was elected on a promise to lift sanctions and develop more balanced relations with the east and west, especially Europe. The bulk of his diplomatic appointments, including the retention of the former foreign minister Javad Zarif as an adviser, underscored that intention, and already a lively debate had started in Tehran about the extent to which Iran and Russia’s interests truly aligned.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/10/irans-missile-supply-to-moscow-may-reveal-true-scale-of-pezeshkians-powers	2024-09-10T11:03:09-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e737fb2721e6d34f90502b25159275cfd54e8db/0_43_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fc1690befccaf7bb5312d1b032d7e46d

Apple loses EU court battle over €13bn tax bill in Ireland	Ruling is a fillip for European Commission efforts to clamp down on ‘sweetheart’ tax deals Apple has lost a high-profile, €13bn (£11bn) Irish tax battle with Brussels in a decision that will bolster the European Commission’s efforts to clamp down on favourable -sweetheart- tax deals for multinationals. The European court of justice (ECJ) ruling, which had been eagerly awaited, comes after years of legal wrangling over whether the European Commission was right to demand in 2016 that €13bn in -illegal- tax breaks for Apple should be repaid because it gave the iPhone maker an unfair advantage.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/sep/10/apple-loses-eu-court-battle-tax-bill-ireland	2024-09-10T02:23:48-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2584b8496c453a6212233c4b78e5d4caac5499e0/0_166_7724_4635/master/7724.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6dd25b5068e421b59bca4112d0e567a7

Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans have tried to blame Harris for the Afghanistan pullout, including in a report by House GOP lawmakers today. Our investigation reveals the Biden-Harris administration had the information and opportunity to take necessary steps to plan for the inevitable collapse of the Afghan government. At each step of the way, however, the administration picked optics over security. Without involving the Afghan government, he and his administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban that freed 5,000 Taliban fighters and allowed them to return to the battlefield. This chaotic approach severely hindered the Biden-Harris administration’s ability to execute the most orderly withdrawal possible and put our service members and our allies at risk.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/09/trump-harris-presidential-debate-election-latest-updates	2024-09-09T15:59:56-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b37b1f5c23d472eae975f0b6381b9599ea3ae4a7/0_104_4639_2783/master/4639.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=37a29180bf181d8f6a97df5c0f5510b0

Anti-Maduro campaign ‘stronger than ever’ after Venezuelan election, says Machado	Opposition leader María Corina Machado said exile of key figure Edmundo González ‘changes absolutely nothing’ The Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has insisted the campaign to end Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian rule is -stronger than ever-, but the banishing of one of its key figures to Spain has thrown many supporters off balance. Edmundo González, who the US and other countries have recognised as the winner of Venezuela’s 28 July presidential election, flew into exile on Sunday after several weeks holed up in the Dutch ambassador’s residence in Caracas. An arrest warrant, seemingly designed to force the retired diplomat to flee, had been issued a week earlier.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/anti-maduro-campaign-venezuela-machado-gonzales	2024-09-09T12:05:59-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70e1a5aa20424514ffe943b55e6b84d6ee79ef41/0_0_5173_3105/master/5173.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c604ed0bd9ddb2e98da46d9cab5dd12

Monday’s hearing is the latest in the long saga of Salameh, once vaunted as a financial wizard who earned Lebanon its reputation as the -Switzerland of the Middle East- during his 30-year tenure.

Middle East crisis: Israeli strikes on Syria kill at least 25 people, war monitor says – as it happened	Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the dead include civilians as well as soldiers and ‘Syrians working with pro-Iran groups’ The UN human rights chief has said that ending the war in Gaza is a priority and asked countries to act on what he called Israel’s -blatant disregard- for international law in the occupied Palestinian territories. -States must not – cannot – accept blatant disregard for international law, including binding decisions of the (UN) security council and orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), neither in this nor any other situation,- the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Turk, said in a speech at the opening of the UN human rights council in Geneva. The court considers that the violations by Israel of the prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force and of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination have a direct impact on the legality of the continued presence of Israel, as an occupying power, in the occupied Palestinian territory. The sustained abuse by Israel of its position as an occupying power, through annexation and an assertion of permanent control over the occupied Palestinian territory and continued frustration of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, violates fundamental principles of international law and renders Israel’s presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful. Forcible evictions, extensive house demolitions and restrictions on residence and movement. The transfer by Israel of settlers to the West Bank and East Jerusalem and maintenance of their presence. Its failure to prevent or to punish attacks by settlers. Restricting the access of the Palestinian population to water. Israel’s use of the natural resources in the occupied Palestinian territory. The extension of Israel’s law to the West Bank and East Jerusalem.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/09/middle-east-crisis-seven-killed-in-israeli-airstrike-on-iran-linked-military-site-in-syria-says-war-monitor	2024-09-09T07:01:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd28d950d57c091f8974d93ab34a4a7908bbbac9/0_460_7265_4359/master/7265.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=169e54cfaa6f5ef5fce0d1b5f067b3c6

Weather tracker: Francine looking likely to be next Atlantic hurricane	An area of low pressure in the Gulf of Mexico is moving landward, and is expected to bring intense rainfall Francine could soon be the next to be ticked off the list of Atlantic hurricane storm names this week. On Friday, a broad area of low pressure emerged in the Gulf of Mexico, designated as Invest 91L. An -invest- – a shorthand for -investigative area- – refers to a region of atmospheric disturbance, characterised by low pressure and thunderstorms, and is closely monitored for its potential to evolve into a tropical cyclone. Invest 91L is anticipated to encounter more favourable environmental conditions as it progresses northward over the coming days, meandering along the eastern coasts of Mexico and Texas. The National Hurricane Center has now labelled this as a potential tropical cyclone, and it is expected to reach hurricane status before reaching the Gulf coast of the US. It advises that hurricane and storm surge watches will probably be issued on Monday for coastal parts of Texas and Louisiana, with the impacts expected to be felt from Tuesday night.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/weather-tracker-francine-likely-atlantic-hurricane	2024-09-09T01:29:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24cc1827e84491c0c221ac628bc03071cdb1fd63/0_52_3168_1900/master/3168.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1a9b1687edb0a93e205a820382e25175
