Why the financial crisis at the British Council matters as UK pushes soft power	Labour’s recognition of soft power’s intangible value should take in the crucial work of the British Council • British Council could disappear within a decade, says chief executive Something is jarring when the foreign secretary, David Lammy, regards UK soft power as so important he establishes a council to promote the country globally, while one of the longstanding British institutions devoted to bolstering that power is on the verge of a form of bankruptcy. The financial plight of the British Council, and the collapse of its income from English language teaching during the pandemic, has hardly been hidden from view, so much so the organisation was chosen as one of the subjects of inquiry by the Commons foreign affairs select committee. The chief executive of the British Council, Scott McDonald, told MPs that the UK international cultural and educational organisation was at risk of disappearing in two years.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/25/why-the-financial-crisis-at-the-british-council-matters-as-uk-pushes-soft-power	2025-01-24T21:00:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2e1a5fece2ef11303434d21157e379ddcca91eb/0_88_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d0bc4ccbca788268d2e1d7cf858272ed

Britain’s response to Russian ‘spy ship’ is game of political messaging – for now	Deteriorating security environment and incidents in Baltic have forced military reassessment in northern Europe Submarines normally operate in secret, lurking in the deep. So when the British defence secretary, John Healey, authorised a Royal Navy Astute-class attack sub to surface close to the Russian -spy ship- Yantar south of Cornwall in November, it was unusual enough. What was even more notable, however, was that the minister went on to tell the House of Commons on Wednesday what he had done.

Inquest exposes poor leadership, insufficient testing at aged care home that saw 19 Covid deaths in 2020	Deadly wave of Covid that hit Sydney’s Newmarch House made more severe by organisational failings, coroner says Some of the 19 deaths during a 2020 Covid-19 outbreak at a NSW aged-care home could have been avoided had proper testing for the virus been implemented, a coronial inquest has found. Poor leadership, insufficient communication and staff shortages were highlighted in coroner Derek Lee’s review of the deaths from a wave of the virus that swept through Sydney’s Newmarch House. If universal testing of staff had been performed once the outbreak had begun, and timelier reporting of results had allowed for cases of Covid-19 to be identified more readily, it would likely have reduced the extent and severity of the outbreak; Frontline management at Newmarch House did not clearly understand the chain of command and did not get effective support from Anglicare senior executives. -Consequently, Anglicare did not demonstrate adequate leadership and governance during the course of the outbreak-, Lee said; There was a lack of clarity at Newmarch House as to who, if anyone, bore ultimate responsibility for clinical decision-making; Anglicare did not give residents’ families enough specific information about their loved one, and in some cases it was inaccurate or understated the seriousness of what was occurring; During the initial stages of the outbreak there was a -significant deficiency- in the number of staff available which -meant that infection control and the care provided to residents was gravely jeopardised-.

Trump’s executive order on gender uses language pointing to ‘fetal personhood’	Words ‘at conception’ in order gesture to push by anti-abortion movement to give embryos and fetuses legal rights One of Donald Trump’s new executive orders, which claims there are only two genders, quietly incorporates tenets of fetal personhood – the legal doctrine, pushed by the anti-abortion movement, that life begins at conception and that embryos and fetuses therefore deserve full legal rights and protections. -‘Female’ means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell,- reads the order, which was issued just hours after Trump took office on Monday. -‘Male’ means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell.-	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/23/trump-executive-order-fetal-personhood	2025-01-23T04:29:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dd207fabe84944c3e272cc20271d55128f32dc2/0_0_3577_2146/master/3577.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2a4aa2996f1a96b5cfcb5c06d63e7649
First Thing: Trump labels January 6 attacks on police ‘very minor incidents’	President defends offering clemency to the 1,500 people involved in the insurrection. Plus, an oral history of the making of Twin Peaks Good morning. Donald Trump has described attacks by insurrectionists on police officers at the US Capitol on January 6 2021 as -very minor incidents- after he offered sweeping clemency to those who took part. Why so many pardons? Media reports suggest Trump was too impatient to go through cases individually, with Axios quoting an adviser as saying: -Trump just said: ‘Fuck it: Release ’em all’.- What other action are Republicans taking related to January 6? House Republicans will continue investigating the insurrection to try to undermine the previous inquiry that found Trump responsible for the deadly attack. Which aspects of the ACA will be affected? Trump cannot repeal the act by executive order but his directives are restricting eligibility requirements, cutting federal subsidies and affecting enrolment deadlines.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/23/first-thing-trump-labels-january-6-attacks-on-police-very-minor-incidents	2025-01-23T04:17:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6c80b2c175b684ee04ab249ef7430323c11cde6/0_166_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9866ff5584cd26fbafe8614a09a4e607

UK will not accept EU offer to join pan-European customs union ‘at present time’, minister says – UK politics live	Housing minister shoots down idea floated by Maroš Šefčovič designed to help reset UK-EU discussions Good morning. The government is obsessed with finding any levers it can that might promote growth. At Davos yesterday Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, was asked if growth was even more important than promoting net zero, and she replied: -Well if [growth is] the number one mission it’s obviously the most important thing.- Today the government is announcing potentially significant plans that could limit the scope of judicial review applications to hold back growth. Pippa Crerar, Kiran Stacey and Sandra Laville have the details here. Economists argue that an obvious move to promote growth would be to have close trade links with the EU. But the government has ruled out rejoining the single market or the custom union (let alone rejoining the EU proper – which is still largely a taboo proposal in most parts of UK politics). And today a minister has ruled out an EU proposal for the UK to join, not the customs union, but a customs union with the EU. Šefčovič referred to the idea of the UK joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM). These are common rules that allow parts, ingredients and materials for manufacturing supply chains to be sourced from across dozens of countries in Europe and North Africa to be used in tariff-free trade. We’re not seeking to participate in that particular arrangement. I think in general the government’s been very clear … we do want a closer relationship with our European partners, both in trading terms, but also, importantly … in terms of security and defense cooperation, where we need to work far more closely. So absolutely, yes, we do want a closer relationship.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/23/keir-starmer-eu-sadiq-khan-latest-live-politics-news	2025-01-23T01:28:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9bddca2b2830e514cc80df9cdacbccd2233cb74/0_98_5552_3331/master/5552.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9267462122b06c19f2bbf9085fa48f19
Trump suggests it was a mistake for Biden not to pardon himself – US politics live	US president says his predecessor gave ‘everybody pardons’ but says it is a ‘sad thing’ he didn’t give himself one Donald Trump has described attacks on police officers at the US Capitol on January 6 2021 as -very minor incidents- as he sought to defend his decision to pardon the insurrectionists. The US president hinted that those who put him through -four years of hell- via criminal prosecutions should themselves be investigated, adding ominously that his predecessor, Joe Biden, made a mistake by not pardoning himself. Most of the people were absolutely innocent. OK. But forgetting all about that, these people have served, horribly, a long time. It would be very, very cumbersome to go and look – you know how many people we’re talking about? 1,500 people.- This guy went around giving everybody pardons. And you know, the funny thing, maybe the sad thing, is he didn’t give himself a pardon. And if you look at it, it all had to do with him.- Joe Biden has very bad advisers. Somebody advised Joe Biden to give pardons to everybody but him.- Donald Trump has described attacks on police officers at the US Capitol on January 6 2021 as -very minor incidents- as he sought to defend his decision to pardon the insurrectionists. Those pardoned include more than 250 people who were convicted of assault charges, some having attacked police with makeshift weapons such as flagpoles, a hockey stick and a crutch. Trump also used the prime-time Fox News interview to discuss his barrage of executive orders, dismiss security concerns over Chinese-owned app TikTok (-Is it that important for China to be spying on young people, on young kids watching crazy videos?-) and discuss the possibility of cutting off federal funds to so-called -sanctuary cities- that shield undocumented immigrants from federal detention requests. On Thursday, Trump will speak remotely at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, delivering his first major speech to global business and political leaders. He is due to give a speech and engage in a dialogue at 11am US Eastern Time (4pm GMT), according to the meeting schedule. It is not clear what he will discuss. The new US presidential envoy for special missions has pushed back against Nato chief, Mark Rutte’s talk at the World Economic Forum about Ukraine joining Nato, pointing out many members of the alliance aren’t paying their -fair share- already. Richard Grenell, appointed by Trump in December, said it is -pretty shocking- that so many foreign ministers in Europe, and so many US politicians, did not try to stop the Russia-Ukraine war, and criticised Biden’s handling of the situation.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/23/donald-trump-pardons-january-6-us-president-joe-biden-jd-vance-republicans-live-news	2025-01-23T00:42:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5fcf45c541301d81dc486432ff09d991a9e5b5f/196_30_1282_769/master/1282.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=db34cd3853a8542998b1b626bcb60c4f

Thursday briefing: With a new wave of violence, the West Bank is on edge	In today’s newsletter: As Israeli security forces launch an operation in the city of Jenin and violence by settlers escalates, Emma Graham-Harrison explains what happens next Good morning. A few days after a ceasefire brought at least temporary relief to Gaza, violence erupted in the occupied West Bank. On Tuesday, the Israeli military launched what was described as an extensive raid in the city of Jenin, a day after Israeli settlers attacked Palestinians, setting vehicles and property ablaze in a violent rampage that left at least one person dead. Two Israeli were arrested even though dozens of armed settlers were involved in the rioting. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, condemned the attacks, but it is evident that extremist settlers feel emboldened by government policies and ministers who back their agenda.

KemiKaze’s best PMQs so far leaves Starmer entirely unruffled | John Crace	The Tory leader managed to devote all six questions to one subject, even if it was one she didn’t know much about Who would have guessed? Kemi Badenoch may be a slow learner – a painfully slow learner – but she is at least a learner. This may be not much, but it is a lifeline. Possibly. Whether it comes too late is another matter. The latest ConservativeHome poll of party members shows Kemi tumbling down the popularity rankings. Immediately after the election she was well ahead of the rest of the shadow cabinet. Now she’s down to seventh. Even halfwits like Robert Jenrick, Laura Trott and Chris Philp are ahead of her. Imagine that. Most people would want to give up at that point.

The surge in online violence makes declaring a terrorist incident more difficult than ever	The Southport case shows how easily the seeds of extremism can now be sown – and the law needs find a way to keep up As yet, those with the closest knowledge of the Southport case cannot answer these questions: what cause was Axel Rudakubana trying to advance and who was he trying to influence when he unleashed his atrocity? As such, police cannot declare it a terrorist incident. The UK primarily combats the threat of terrorist violence through civilian law enforcement bodies governed by laws, not the military or paramilitaries, so there needs to be a legal definition of terrorism.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/21/the-surge-in-online-violence-makes-declaring-a-terrorist-incident-more-difficult-than-ever	2025-01-21T13:23:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddf4a6db1a964ceea4d8386f6fe9d018ad8394bf/0_389_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=22f2c05c2070a8d8280a11b747bcb954

Michel Friedman, a prominent German-French publicist and former deputy chair of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, described Musk’s actions – at an event after Donald Trump’s swearing in as US president – as a disgrace and said Musk had shown that a -dangerous point for the entire free world- had been reached.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/21/the-gesture-speaks-for-itself-germans-divided-over-musks-apparent-nazi-salute	2025-01-21T11:06:30-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d961608d3f4153535ae0ef64c95d280b8d49f72/0_87_4715_2829/master/4715.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=51a1f7888d95be04900d13e0caec1257
Law experts demand inquiry into Met policing of pro-Palestine protest	Forty academics write to home secretary over weekend’s ‘dangerous assault’ on the right to protest More than 40 legal scholars have signed a letter calling for an independent inquiry into the Met’s policing of a pro-Palestine protest in London on Saturday, describing it as -a disproportionate, unwarranted and dangerous assault on the right to assembly and protest-. The force said it arrested 77 people at the demonstration, having banned protesters from gathering outside the BBC’s London headquarters, citing its proximity to a synagogue and the fact it was taking place on the Sabbath. The ban led to the protest being changed to a static rally, but the Met claimed people broke through police lines in a coordinated effort to breach the conditions.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/21/law-experts-demand-inquiry-into-met-policing-of-pro-palestine-protest	2025-01-21T11:03:29-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fd2c106ab9b4fb93fa746c0a58908b722e263cf/347_469_3654_2192/master/3654.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=61e2234eff40e2bfe83d2d218347fc93

Keir Starmer to give statement on Southport attack inquiry – UK politics live	Prime minister is addressing cameras from Downing Street this morning Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, has been giving interviews this morning, where he was restated Tory suggestions that ministers wrongly withheld information from the public about the Southport attacker, Axel Rudakubana, last summer. This is what Philp told Times Radio. I think it’s just important the inquiry looks at all of this, gets to the truth both about what happened beforehand, but critically also the government’s response afterwards, and what they knew when and whether they should have put more information into the public domain. It appears they withheld information about the perpetrator, potentially, on CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] advice.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/21/keir-starmer-southport-attack-labour-uk-politics-latest-news-updates	2025-01-21T00:21:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9154b4f97662079de3231fec085aa206026cab2a/2694_724_2768_1661/master/2768.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b5b3c0a3308fa68cb973870899b753f9

Trump inauguration live: president pardons January 6 rioters and exits Paris climate agreement in slew of executive orders	On his first day on office the US president sought to undo much of Joe Biden’s legacy, also vowing to ‘unleash’ oil and gas drilling and revoking birthright citizenship Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Donald Trump’s inauguration and first day in office. Immediately after his swearing-in ceremony on Monday the new US president set into motion a slew of executive orders seeking to make good on his campaign promises and undo the legacy of his predecessor Joe Biden, including the pardoning of January 6 defendant and a crackdown on immigration to the US. Trump pardoned about 1,500 January 6 defendants facing prosecution for their role in the 2021 storming of the US capitol. Among those pardoned is Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the Proud Boys, who was sentenced to 22 years in prison on seditious conspiracy charges. Trump also commuted the sentence of Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the Oath Keepers militia, who had been sentenced to 18 years in prison on sedition charges. He also signed an executive order seeking to revoke birthright citizenship – automatic citizenship for people born in the US – for the children of undocumented immigrants. Birthright citizenship is protected by the 14th amendment and the order will almost certainly be challenged in court. One order declared a -national emergency- at the southern border, paving the way to send US troops to the area and another that designated drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. He signed an executive order to, for a second time, withdraw the US from the Paris climate accords. He also declared a national energy emergency as part of a barrage of pro-fossil fuel actions and efforts to -unleash- already booming US energy production. Another order will remove the US from the World Health Organization (WHO). -World Health ripped us off, everybody rips off the United States. It’s not going to happen any more,- Trump said at the signing. The withdrawal of the US would dramatically cut funding from the global public health organization. He issued an executive order requiring federal agencies revoke the use of -gender- and -gender identity- and instead use a binary definition of -sex- in implementing policy – including in issuing passports, a move that LGBTQ+ rights groups have vowed to challenge in court. Another order reclassified thousands of federal employees as political hires, making it much easier for them to be fired. Key aides to Trump have called for mass government firings. Project 2025 made attacks on the deep or administrative state a core part of Trump’s second term. One order renamed the 617,800 sq mile Gulf of Mexico and Alaska’s 20,000ft Denali. The Gulf of Mexico will be renamed the Gulf of America, and Denali, the highest mountain in North America, will revert to Mount McKinley, which it was called before Barack Obama changed the name in 2015. The order will have no bearing on what names are used internationally. Trump also signed an executive order temporarily delaying the enforcement of a federal ban on TikTok for at least 75 days. -I guess I have a warm spot for TikTok that I didn’t have originally,- Trump said at the White House.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/21/donald-trump-inauguration-presidency-executive-orders-pardons-day-two-live-blog	2025-01-20T21:06:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cda7d9b277d8c23917d91e7d6e219ba656aa0705/0_34_4637_2783/master/4637.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c586e722261b4b85725e5119914c76b6

The Sodalitium on Monday confirmed the dissolution, which was conveyed to an assembly of its members in Aparecida, Brazil, at the weekend by the pope’s top legal adviser, Cardinal Gianfranco Ghirlanda. In revealing the dissolution in a statement, the group lamented that news of Francis’s decision had been leaked by two members attending the assembly, who were -definitively expelled-.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/20/pope-dissolves-sodalitium-of-christian-life-peru-catholic-movement-vatican-investigation	2025-01-20T10:27:58-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3862f40939408a6f948146976b53b090d74a028/304_618_3192_1915/master/3192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7e60326d258ab91c19c4840d7a6fd982

Denmark to ditch ‘parenting competency’ tests for Greenlandic families	Human rights bodies have long criticised the tests as culturally unsuitable for Greenlandic people Denmark has announced it is abandoning the use of highly controversial -parenting competency- tests on Greenlandic families, amid fury over the way that they have been routinely used on people with Inuit backgrounds, often resulting in the separation of children from their parents.

Freezing rain dampens mood in Washington ahead of Trump’s inauguration – photo essay	Photographer Jordan Gale documents preparations for 60th presidential inauguration, showing a US poised and polarised between hope and fear Washington is a city on edge. Concrete barriers, unscalable steel fencing and security checkpoints dot the map. In a climate of simmering political violence, and after a divisive election campaign in which he survived two assassination attempts, Donald Trump is returning to an anxious capital where more than nine in 10 voters broke for his opponent, Kamala Harris. A city of tradition and ritual will seek to accommodate the most unconventional of presidents, bringing thousands of Trump’s supporters into direct contact with the residents who feel a sense of foreboding and dread. Trump will take the oath of office under the magnificent dome of the Capitol Rotunda on Monday due to forecasts of intense cold weather, upending months of meticulous planning for a massive outdoor event with crowds sprawling down the National Mall. The swearing-in was last moved indoors in 1985, when Ronald Reagan began his second term.

Parlex is among a number of AI tools being developed for ministers and civil servants, which allows them to predict which topics might cause them difficulty with their own backbenchers – and pinpoint specific MPs who feel passionately about a given subject.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/20/ai-tool-can-give-ministers-vibe-check-on-whether-mps-will-like-policies	2025-01-20T04:53:46-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af9ef13aecce0c53cd60df8371a103d8cf02de5c/0_118_6576_3946/master/6576.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4edaa11a8537b8ce1704396236fe8010
Has South Korea just witnessed its own January 6 moment?	Protesters who stormed a Seoul court at the weekend may not have worn animal skins, but the similarities are striking They arrived intent on causing mayhem. The political figurehead they supported had, they said, been the victim of a grave injustice at the hands of the establishment. The ringleaders had soon broken through security cordons, armed with fire extinguishers, steel pipes and police shields, smashing windows and gaining entry to a government building, leaving destruction worth an estimated £400,000 in their wake. The scene of the riot was not the US Capitol building on 6 January 2021, and the mobs attempting to overturn the rule of law had swapped animal skins and bald eagle masks for hooded down jackets and face masks. But the similarities between Maga ideologues’ attempts to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election, and the far-right protesters who stormed the Seoul Western district court building this weekend in support of the impeached South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, are hard to ignore.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/20/has-south-korea-just-witnessed-its-own-january-6-moment	2025-01-20T04:42:41-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2a6e7cce0737b6f9e49c28e95f364b84edfb5b1/0_398_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=011161c3ec07022572ec05c53efd8714

Donald Trump takes power as US braces for vengeful second term | First Thing	Incoming president has promised retaliation against his opponents. Plus, billionaire wealth grew $2tn in 2024 Good morning. The United States braces for a new era of disruption and division on Monday with Donald Trump scheduled to be sworn in as its 47th president, promising a blitz of executive orders and radical shake-up of the global order. What did Trump promise yesterday? -We’re going to stop the invasion of our borders … We’re going to unlock the liquid gold that’s right under our feet … We’re going to bring back law and order to our cities … We’re going to get radical woke ideology the hell out of our military.- How are some assessing the Biden administration? Joe Biden was a -remarkably consequential one-term president-, writes Katrina vanden Heuvel. Internationally, Biden -was assuming a world that no longer existed- – with calamitous results – but domestically, Biden -consolidated the break- with -failed market fundamentalism-. What is the status of the three Israelis? On Sunday, three women held hostage by Hamas in tunnels beneath Gaza – Emily Damari, 28, Romi Gonen, 24 and Doron Steinbrecher, 31 – were released and reunited with their mothers. Videos showed them in apparently reasonable health. Were there any obstacles? Yes, a three-hour delay to the start of the truce, during which Israeli warplanes and artillery pounded the Gaza Strip. The delay meant a further 13 people were killed, Palestinian health authorities said. At least two missiles hit a family travelling on a donkey cart as they tried to return home, Al Jazeera reported.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/first-thing-donald-trump-takes-power-as-us-braces-for-vengeful-second-term	2025-01-20T04:00:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42d5306728c12f3c84eccde3f020ffd772890eb5/0_0_4535_2722/master/4535.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=81aa44a433400cc2e3c0f4c74c27fba8
Alaska to resume ‘barbaric’ shooting of bears and wolves from helicopters	Renewed program would allow hunters to eliminate up to 80% of the animals on 20,000 acres of state land Alaska is set to resume the aerial gunning of bears and wolves as a population control measure aimed at boosting caribou and moose herd numbers, even as the state’s own evaluation of the practice cast doubt on its effectiveness. The renewed program would allow hunters to eliminate up to 80% of the animals on 20,000 acres of state land. Environmental groups opposed to what they label a -barbaric- practice of shooting wildlife from helicopters is more about sport than scientific practice in part because hunters want caribou populations to increase because they are trophy animals.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/alaska-aerial-gunning-bears-wolves	2025-01-20T04:00:01-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b54e773f36d682e29ee03ac6542d2ae3a33cb44d/109_715_2142_1285/master/2142.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1c0d86a4fb6dd411a622a0875b80e6b8

CNN defamation case foreshadows Trump media crackdown, experts say	Contractor Zachary Young wins damages over Afghanistan story in trial notable for prosecution’s aggressive stance A combative defamation trial in Florida, involving CNN and a former US security contractor in Afghanistan, is providing a roadmap for a crackdown on media independence during the second Trump administration, experts believe. The case was already unusual because CNN chose to defend itself and risk millions in damages, while other media giants such as ABC News and the Washington Post have opted to back down in the face of threats of persecution from the incoming president. Ultimately, after 18 hours of deliberation, the jury found that CNN defamed the contractor and awarded Zachary Young $4m in lost business and $1m in personal damages.	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jan/20/cnn-defamation-trial	2025-01-20T03:00:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b773cd83540a325b05e2522361377a6ab8a21d11/0_48_3754_2253/master/3754.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=080bd0d5a48c0a1e998188ba7afd6d02
US will want Chagos Islands deal reversed, Trump’s ex-national security adviser suggests – UK politics live	Westminster is preparing for Donald Trump’s second term ahead of the US president’s inauguration in Washington Good morning. Donald Trump becomes president of the United States for the second time today and in Westminster, as across the rest of the word, supporters are giddy with excitement, while opponents feel this is a moment for epoch-defining dread. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader and Britain’s leading Trump evangelist, has got so carried away that he has told an interviewer he thinks there is a 20/25% chance that he could be prime minister by the time Trump leaves office (January 2029). It’s not impossible; but few other people would put his chances as high as one in four. Most people in Labour politics, privately at least, regard Trump with horror, but the government has to work with him and Keir Starmer, who has invested a lot of effort in trying to establish a decent personal relationship with the new president, has issued a statement sending Trump his -warmest congratulations- on his inauguration. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, was on the Today programme this morning and, when asked if he he had changed his mind about Trump since the days when he used to denounce him in the strongest possible terms, he said his approach to foreign policy was grounded in -progressive realism-, taking the world as it is. He went on to praise the Trump he met when he and Starmer had dinner with him in New York in September last year. The Donald Trump I met … had incredible grace, generosity, very keen to be a good host, very funny, very, very, very friendly, very warm, I have to say, about the UK, our royal family, Scotland, his relationship with Scotland, his mother. That was the Donald Trump I found. There was a survey this week – 70% of the world welcomed Donald Trump coming to power, 70% of the world, much of that worried about authoritarian actors, actually quite like the fact that Donald Trump keeps them guessing. I think surrendering the Chagos Islands, or putting the Chagos Islands in a situation where they can easily be coerced, by the Chinese Communist Party for example, I hope it’s a position that we see reversed here by Donald Trump, and by the UK government. The Pentagon, the State Department and the White House under the last administration pored through this deal. There was an interagency process, [they] said it was a good deal. It’s right and proper that the new administration is able to consider it. But having gone through the deal in detail, it’s the right deal to keep the global community safe, and I emphasize the importance of that military base and those assets on Diego Garcia that we’ve been working together with with the United States now for all of my lifetime.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/20/us-chagos-islands-deal-david-lammy-uk-politics-live-news-updates	2025-01-20T01:35:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a4433649573bce788cf9c32bd2b31c3554b67db/423_483_5895_3537/master/5895.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ba4684d22839eb21aa9a5cad6a952472

Ninety Palestinians released by Israel as Gaza ceasefire enters second day – live	Palestinian detainees greeted with joy in West Bank after earlier release of three Israeli hostages on Sunday Hello and welcome to our live coverage of major developments in the Israel-Gaza war after a long-awaited ceasefire in Gaza came into effect on Sunday. In the hours since, hostage and prisoner exchanges have been carried out on both sides. Ninety Palestinian prisoners were released early on Monday as part of the ceasefire deal. Those freed from Israeli prisons included 69 women and 21 teenage boys from the West Bank and Jerusalem, according to Hamas. The prisoners, most of whom were freed from Ofer prison in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, were welcomed by thousands of people celebrating. It followed the release of three Israeli women held hostage by Hamas in tunnels beneath Gaza, ending a protracted ordeal that began with their violent abduction by Hamas on 7 October 2023. Among those released was joint British national Emily Damari, 28, who was freed alongside Romi Gonen, 24 and Doron Steinbrecher, 31. The women have been reunited with their mothers after being handed over by International Committee for the Red Cross. The three are in a -stable condition- and will be monitored for a few days, according to a news conference at Sheba Medical Center in Tel Aviv. A member of the hospital staff, Professor Itai Pessach, said: -I’m happy to report that they are in stable condition. That allows us and them to focus on what is the most important thing for now – reuniting with the families.- As the fighting ceased, hundreds of aid trucks queued to enter Gaza to deliver supplies to its 2.3 million residents, 90% of whom have been displaced by the conflict, many multiple times. The World Health Organization says it is ready to pour much-needed aid into Gaza during the Israel-Hamas truce, but that it would need -systematic access- across the territory to do so. Much of the Gaza Strip’s health infrastructure has been destroyed by the more than year-long war. The first phase of the truce took effect after a three-hour delay during which Israeli warplanes and artillery pounded the Gaza Strip. The last-minute blitz killed 13 people, Palestinian health authorities said. Israel claimed it had struck terrorists although Al Jazeera reported that at least two missiles hit a family travelling on a donkey cart as they tried to return home. Thousands of displaced Palestinians have started to return home, many to destroyed buildings and homes in ruins. There is no detailed plan in place to govern Gaza after the war, much less rebuild it. Nine in 10 homes have been destroyed as well as schools, hospitals, shops, mosques and cemeteries. Under the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which is to last 42 days, the militant group has agreed to release 33 hostages including children, women (including female soldiers) and men aged over 50, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli jails. In the second phase, the remaining living hostages are due to be sent back and a corresponding ratio of Palestinian prisoners will be freed, and Israel will completely withdraw from the territory. The specifics are subject to further negotiations, which are due to start 16 days into the first phase. The third phase will address the exchange of bodies of deceased hostages and Hamas members, and a reconstruction plan for Gaza will be launched. Arrangements for future governance of the strip remain hazy.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/20/israel-gaza-ceasefire-live-blog-updates-hostages-palestinian-detainees-released	2025-01-19T21:27:29-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e198aaf878d9a84788c00737a1f113e58142c15c/0_0_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5fad60e65bf5ad363352bf7980fe0284

While it is a truism that all negotiations to end conflicts rely on cautious trust building and are highly vulnerable to spoilers, the deal to end 15 months of fighting in Gaza that followed Hamas’s surprise attack on 7 October 2023 is more obviously fraught than most.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/19/gaza-ceasefire-will-israel-hamas-agreement-hold	2025-01-19T07:58:21-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6e9286e48272f4bc883e60633941d037691de22/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9b12ffdbd51e16f24be722c2d9f62d6a
Biden posthumously pardons civil rights leader Marcus Garvey	Activist who was convicted of mail fraud in the 1920s influenced Malcolm X and other leader leaders President Joe Biden on Sunday posthumously pardoned Black nationalist Marcus Garvey, who influenced Malcolm X and other civil rights leaders and was convicted of mail fraud in the 1920s. Also receiving pardons were a top Virginia lawmaker and advocates for immigrant rights, criminal justice reform and gun violence prevention. Congressional leaders had pushed for Biden to pardon Garvey, with supporters arguing that Garvey’s conviction was politically motivated and an effort to silence the increasingly popular leader who spoke of racial pride. After Garvey was convicted, he was deported to Jamaica, where he was born. He died in 1940.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/19/biden-pardons-marcus-garvey	2025-01-19T07:33:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e29364b501988f63a968a94ad768bc869f198400/17_111_4140_2485/master/4140.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bf4a13e80a54feed69b669bf58818b91

Who banned TikTok? Politicians toss culpability like a football	Claiming a threat from a ‘foreign adversary’, the US has yet to prove China shared propaganda or collected US user data The United States of America deleted TikTok early on the morning of 19 January. A government formed -by the people, for the people-, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, has made scant evidence available to those people as to why. As those in power at the 11th hour realize how unpopular such a paternalistic move might be, each is doing their best to lay blame with the others. Why did the US ban an app used and beloved by some 170 million Americans? For fear of China’s propaganda and data collection. It’s a far-reaching, unprecedented move. The text of the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, passed in April and signed by Joe Biden, reads: -This bill prohibits distributing, maintaining, or providing internet hosting services for a foreign adversary controlled application (eg, TikTok).- Both a federal appeals court and the US supreme court have affirmed that rationale as sufficient.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/19/tiktok-ban-culpability	2025-01-19T06:00:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ad177ca3552e3e3900ce789545ac74332ffd578/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d732af4b390fef33c89ad2b89733777a

‘This is about witnesses speaking their truth’: Prince Harry gets his day in court against Murdoch’s newspapers	The Duke of Sussex and the former Labour deputy leader Tom Watson are the last two claimants still suing An extraordinary personal legal battle which has been years in preparation is to pit one of the most famous members of the British royal family against the world’s best-known media baron this week.

‘Animals can feel good and evil’: film puts new perspective on Ukraine war	Collection of seven shorts due out in 2025 tells story of conflict from perspective of animals The occupying Russian soldiers paid little attention to the elderly woman shuffling through the farmland surrounding the villages outside Kyiv, taking her goat to pasture. But she was focused closely on them. After locating their positions, she headed back home with the goat, and later called her grandson, a soldier in the Ukrainian army, to give the coordinates. The story is one of seven episodes, based on real events from the first year of Russia’s full-scale invasion but lightly fictionalised, that make up a feature film about the war in Ukraine, due out later this year. All seven of the shorts have one thing in common: they tell the story of the conflict from the perspective of animals.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/19/animals-can-feel-good-and-evil-film-puts-new-perspective-on-ukraine-war	2025-01-19T00:00:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02ab8134f621d8d5ac387f2b118ba00b41ba7a55/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=52e84069efb205d4ba2a07eb88f161a4
From GDP to trade, how well equipped is China’s economy for Trump 2.0? | Amy Hawkins	Beijing has prepared for increased tariffs but its actions will not be enough to offset falling demand from the US When Donald Trump enters the White House for the second time on 20 January, the view from the Oval Office will look very different to the one he encountered in 2017. A pandemic, the war in Ukraine and a trade war with China have caused ripples through the global economy that are still being felt midway through the decade. Beijing will be watching closely. Trump has promised to impose tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese imports, partly in retaliation for the flow of fentanyl from China to the US.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/19/gdp-trade-china-economy-trump	2025-01-18T23:00:49-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb72f3ab55755589695f00c36a1efefc1dd61c86/0_114_3419_2052/master/3419.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=824bda971dad7c54e0c92e7fccdede02

Frankenstein inspired by suicide of Mary Shelley’s half-sister, book reveals	New collection of author’s diary entries provides tragic insight Frankenstein’s monster, as horror fans know, did not really spark into life with a bolt of lightning, but was born inside the mind of Mary Shelley during a dreary holiday on a ­mountainside above Geneva. The inspiration came as volcanic ash clouds unexpectedly blocked out the sun that summer of 1816 and she and her friends, including the ­infamous, -bad boy- poets Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley, ­competed to tell scary stories. But a new collection of the young author’s personal diary entries, out in March, provides strong evidence that, although the stay in the Alps set the grim mood of her novel, her imagination was ignited by something ­personal and much closer to home.	https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/19/frankenstein-inspired-by-suicide-of-mary-shelley-half-sister-fanny-imlay-book-reveals	2025-01-18T22:00:49-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d46104c1c19661d008087a3342872c982ce4521b/0_274_2747_1649/master/2747.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ec3651043c859062bfd14495c3d1ae17

Israel-Gaza war live: Israeli forces reportedly withdrawing from parts of Rafah ahead of ceasefire	Reports say Israeli troops start moving from southern Gaza city to Philadelphi corridor on border with Egypt before truce set to begin at 8.30am local time Welcome to our live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war. It’s 7.22am in Tel Aviv and Gaza City and we are under 90 minutes away from the ceasefire and hostage release agreement between Israel and Hamas being scheduled to come into effect at 8.30am local time (6.30am GMT) on Sunday. Here’s a recap of the latest news. Israeli forces have started withdrawing from areas in Gaza’s Rafah to the Philadelphi corridor along the border between Egypt and Gaza, Reuters has cited pro-Hamas media as reporting early on Sunday. Benjamin Netanyahu said the first stage of the deal was temporary, adding: -If we must return to fighting, we will do that in new, forceful ways.- The prime minister added that both Donald Trump and Joe Biden back Israel’s -right to resume fighting if the second stage is fruitless-. Netanyahu also said Israel would not go ahead with the ceasefire deal until it received a list of the 33 hostages kidnapped by Hamas in the deal’s first phase. -Israel will not tolerate violations of the agreement. The sole responsibility lies with Hamas.- Hamas said on Saturday that the mechanism of the release of Israeli hostages it held in Gaza would depend on the number of detained Palestinians Israel would free. Hamas also said Israel had -failed to achieve its aggressive goals- in Gaza. Under the ceasefire agreement, the three-stage truce starts with an initial six-week phase when hostages held by the militant group will be exchanged for Palestinians detained in jails across Israel. Israeli forces have killed at least 46,899 Palestinians and injured 110,725 since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in an update on Saturday. It said 23 Palestinians were killed and 83 were injured over the past 24 hours. Yemen’s Houthis claimed an attack on a US aircraft carrier on Sunday and warned of -consequences- for any retaliation during the coming Gaza ceasefire. The Israeli military said it intercepted two missiles fired from Yemen on Saturday. The military activated air raid sirens in Jerusalem and in parts of central and southern Israel ahead of the interceptions.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/19/israel-gaza-ceasefire-live-news-updates	2025-01-18T21:22:46-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/225cf25bf2144ee5963867d1674c0945cbdba435/0_84_7500_4500/master/7500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c529f7eff3834b80bdd2e84d0ffb78ca

‘It’s an absolute travesty’: fears for border wildlife as Trump takes office	Environmentalists are braced for new construction on the president’s signature border wall – and the damage that would wreak During Donald Trump’s first presidential term, he began an ambitious and costly border militarization program, including the construction of over 450 miles of wall that severed wildlife corridors and fragmented ecosystems in some of the country’s most remote and biodiverse regions. With his second inauguration on Monday, environmentalists are bracing for any new phase of construction that could exacerbate the ecological toll of the border wall. -It’s an absolute travesty and a disaster for border wildlife,- said Margaret Wilder, a human-environment geographer and political ecologist at the University of Arizona, regarding the environmental impact of the existing border wall and the prospect of renewed construction.

‘All hands on deck’: Bird flu in US poultry puts state cooperation to the test	Unusually late migration season means poultry operations may continue to see H5N1 outbreaks, officials say Maryland has detected bird flu among three different commercial poultry flocks in the past week, marking the state’s first outbreak in more than a year. The discoveries come shortly after the establishment of a joint command with Delaware following the latter state’s detection of H5N1 in two other poultry operations. Although the deadly bird flu has circulated in North America since 2022, the past few months have been especially brutal for the poultry industry. More than 20 million egg-laying hens died in the fall, the worst rates since the outbreak began, and egg prices have risen as a result.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/18/bird-flu-poultry-delaware-maryland	2025-01-18T03:00:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/995865c771e8300d85d42acccf17054071140cf5/0_98_5388_3232/master/5388.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0bf8786951ad3d4bd45743e8ebc86b9f

Starmer open to second state visit for Donald Trump, amid worries about tariffs and recent setbacks to political relationship David Lammy was visiting Washington last May when he realised Donald Trump was likely to win the presidential election. The soon-to-be foreign secretary held meetings with the Democrat and Republican campaigns – and found himself admiring the latter. The slickness and professionalism of Trump’s 2024 operation, with its sharp messaging making inroads with black and Hispanic voters, seemed a far cry from his shambolic 2016 campaign. By comparison, Joe Biden’s appeared backward-looking and focused on attacking Trump’s record, while lacking a compelling narrative of its own.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/18/a-watershed-moment-how-will-labour-play-trump	2025-01-18T01:00:21-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ef42c45e36780bded947615d335111c199fab72/0_21_4841_2906/master/4841.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fa96823c7571ae4af67b3004d0a5c23b

Middle East crisis live: Israel says 737 prisoners to initially be freed after cabinet approves Gaza ceasefire	Israeli justice ministry says the Palestinian prisoners and detainees will be released as part of truce’s first phase, under which Hamas is to free 33 hostages Welcome to our live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war. It’s approaching 8am in in Tel Aviv and Gaza City – here’s a snapshot of the latest news. Israel’s cabinet approved a deal with Palestinian militant group Hamas for a ceasefire and release of hostages in the Gaza Strip, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said on Saturday, a day ahead of the agreement’s scheduled start. Lead US negotiator Brett McGurk said after the Israeli cabinet approval that the plan was moving forward on track. The White House expected the ceasefire to start on Sunday morning, with three female hostages to be released to Israel on Sunday afternoon through the Red Cross. Under the deal, the three-stage ceasefire starts with an initial six-week phase when hostages held by Hamas will be exchanged for prisoners detained by Israel. Thirty-three of the 98 remaining Israeli hostages, including women, children, and men over 50, were due to be freed in this phase. Israel will release all Palestinian women and children under 19 in Israeli jails by the end of the first phase. The ceasefire deal was bitterly opposed by some hardliners in the Israeli cabinet, with media reports saying 24 ministers in Netanyahu’s coalition government voted in favour of the deal while eight opposed it. National security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir threatened to resign if it was approved but said he would not bring down the government. His fellow hardliner Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, also threatened to quit the government if it did not go back to war to defeat Hamas after the first six-week phase of the ceasefire. The Israeli high court is still scheduled to hear petitions against elements of the ceasefire deal but it is widely expected not to intervene. Negotiators from Egypt, Qatar, the US and Israel had agreed on -all necessary arrangements to implement- the Gaza ceasefire deal, Egyptian media reported. During Friday’s talks, which reportedly ended -on a positive note-, negotiators agreed to form a joint operations room in Cairo to -ensure effective coordination- and compliance with the truce terms, it said. Under the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which is to last 42 days and take effect from Sunday, Hamas has agreed to release 33 hostages including children, women – including female soldiers – and those aged over 50. In exchange, Israel will release 50 Palestinian prisoners for every female Israeli soldier released by Hamas, and 30 for other female hostages. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said French-Israeli citizens Ofer Kalderon and Ohad Yahalomi were in the first group of hostages to be freed by Hamas. Israel’s justice ministry released a list of 95 Palestinians held in Israeli prisoners to be freed in the first exchange, including 25 male prisoners, all under the age of 21, and 70 female prisoners. One of the most well-known individuals on the list is Palestinian parliament member and feminist lawmaker Khalida Jarrar. At least 115 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the ceasefire deal was announced on Wednesday, the Palestinian health ministry said on Friday, while medics said another five were killed in an Israeli airstrike early on Saturday in the Mawasi area west of Khan Younis. Gaza’s health ministry said at least 46,876 people have been killed and 110,642 injured in more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/18/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-says-737-prisoners-to-initially-be-freed-after-cabinet-approves-gaza-ceasefire	2025-01-17T22:04:58-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/895eeb20d77aefa7e1b2c6d5957825e3e99c5cc6/0_265_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=82e1a7c1951c9292243a41301921bbd9

Supreme court to release opinions as TikTok decision looms – live	US supreme court to release opinions at 10am ET as a challenge to a law that will ban TikTok on Sunday awaits a decision Good morning, US politics blog readers. The supreme court has announced it will release opinions at 10am ET today, as a challenge to a law that will ban TikTok on Sunday unless its China-based owner sells its US business awaits the justices’ decision. As usual, the court did not say how many opinions will be released or on which cases, and thus we will just have to wait an hour or so to find out. Should they decide the TikTok case, we do have some hints on how the justices may rule – in oral arguments last week, they seemed inclined to uphold the law. Meanwhile, we are in the final days of Joe Biden’s administration, and the Democratic president is making some last-minute moves ahead of Donald Trump’s arrival on Monday. This morning, he announced clemency for about 2,500 people convicted of non-violent drug offenses, as well as 15 more prescription drugs that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for. Biden still could have more executive actions planned before he leaves office, including preemptive pardons to Trump’s enemies. We’ll let you know if he announces anything else today. If the TikTok ban is allowed to stand, the Biden administration does not plan to enforce it, NBC News reports. Kristi Noem, the South Dakota governor who Trump picked for homeland security chief, has her Senate confirmation hearing at 9am today. Israel’s cabinet just approved the Gaza ceasefire deal.

Plus, test flight by Elon Musk’s SpaceX ends in failure Good morning. The release of hostages seized by Hamas in its 7 October 2023 attack on Israel is expected to begin on Sunday, Benjamin Netanyahu’s office has said, provided the security cabinet passes the deal. At time of writing, the cabinet’s meeting – where it will discuss and vote on the deal – was underway. Has the fighting continued? Yes.

Yes, to 27 – and is expected to continue doing so. 38 people are still missing. How close are we to containment now?

Mike Pence to Trump: cutting Taiwan support would ‘likely spark a new nuclear arms race’	Former vice-president makes surprise visit to Taipei and predicts that if China annexes its neighbour other Asia-Pacific countries will build nuclear arsenals Mike Pence called on Donald Trump’s incoming administration to maintain support for Taiwan against the threat of Chinese annexation during a surprise visit to the capital, Taipei, on Friday.

‘Everyone thought it would cause gridlock’: the highway that Seoul turned into a stream	Cheonggyecheon stream in the South Korean capital has become an attraction – and helps with flood management, fighting air pollution and cooling the city On a crisp December morning, office workers and tourists stroll along a tree-lined stream in central Seoul, pausing on stepping stones that cross its flowing waters. It’s difficult to imagine that just over 20 years ago, this was a vast elevated highway carrying 168,000 cars daily through the heart of South Korea’s capital. Cheonggyecheon, a stream that runs for about 3.5 miles (nearly 6km) through Seoul, was one of the earliest experiments in an increasing trend in cities globally: turning spaces where there was once car or rail infrastructure into spaces for pedestrians and cyclists. It’s a powerful example of the way that these spaces can become loved and popular, along with projects such as the High Line in New York, where an old railway track has been turned into a raised park, or the city moat in Utrecht, where a multi-lane road (nicknamed the -motorway from nothing to nowhere-) was converted back into a canal, in part of a huge continuing push to allow pedestrians and cyclists to dominate the city’s centre.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/17/seoul-cheonggyecheon-motorway-turned-into-a-stream	2025-01-16T22:00:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc1f4407598278f21fb2bb022431678444304ed6/0_216_6480_3888/master/6480.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7621aeec72978d8563d9dbdc053a2ea9

Austria is set for a far-right chancellor. For the EU it’s the ‘new normal’	If Herbert Kickl becomes chancellor, Vienna will join list of disruptive member states, putting EU policies in peril When Austria’s Freedom party (FPÖ) entered government 25 years ago, shock waves reverberated around Europe. Punitive measures were imposed, diplomatic visits cancelled and Belgium even suggested the EU could do without the Alpine country. That was when the far-right party was only a junior coalition partner. This time, the FPÖ – nativist, anti-immigration and fiercely critical of the EU – is in the driving seat. Its leader, Herbert Kickl, is in pole position to be Austria’s next chancellor.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/17/austria-is-set-for-a-far-right-chancellor-for-the-eu-its-the-new-normal	2025-01-16T21:00:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e8cb4b407979395a893ebd7dbbcac3c5100715d/0_22_7771_4663/master/7771.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=448e25c64ee81b59853372f60ce6f85b

Gaza ceasefire-hostage deal reached, Israel PM’s office says – live	Benjamin Netanyahu’s office says in statement that security cabinet will meet on Friday following earlier delays in talks to release hostages in return for ceasefire Welcome to our live coverage of the Middle East crisis. Here’s a snapshot of the latest news. Senior US officials insisted the hard-won ceasefire would go into effect on Sunday as planned despite the unexpected delay. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he was -very confident- that the ceasefire would go forward and he -fully expects that implementation will begin, as we said, on Sunday-. He confirmed that there had been a -loose end- between the sides in the complex negotiations. US representatives are still believed to be actively involved with talks in Doha on the final details needed to get the deal over the line. A vote is now expected to take place on Friday morning, Israeli media reported. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s hardline national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, announced on Thursday evening that he would quit the government if it ratifies the ceasefire deal, calling it -irresponsible- and -reckless-. Ben-Gvir’s departure would not bring down Netanyahu’s government. Opposition leader Yair Lapid pledged his support for Netanyahu, saying that the deal was -more important than any disagreement we’ve ever had.- Fighting has continued in Gaza despite expectations of a ceasefire, with at least 80 Palestinians killed and hundreds more injured by Israeli airstrikes since the ceasefire announcement, according to the civil defence agency. The Israeli military said that it had conducted strikes on -approximately 50 terror targets- across Gaza since late Wednesday. A civil defence spokesperson said its teams had recovered the bodies of five children after a strike on the northern city of Jabalia. More than 46,788 Palestinians have been killed and a further 110,453 wounded by Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, according to the latest figures by the territory’s health ministry on Thursday. They include 81 killed and 188 injured in the past 24 hours. Among them was Fatin Shaqoura-Salha, the chief of nursing staff at Al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat, ActionAid said. The ceasefire agreement, announced on Wednesday, was due to come into effect on Sunday. In the first phase, to last 42 days, Hamas agreed to release 33 hostages and in exchange, Israel would release 50 Palestinian prisoners for every female Israeli soldier released by Hamas, and 30 for other hostages. Palestinians displaced from their homes would be allowed to move freely around Gaza, wounded people would be vacuated for treatment abroad, and aid to the territory should increase to 600 trucks a day. A second phase would include Israel completely withdrawing from Gaza. The leader of Yemen’s Houthis, Abdul-Malik Badr al-Din al-Houthi, said the Iran-aligned group would suspend their attacks on Red Sea targets but continue if Israel backtracks on the ceasefire. The Houthi attacks have damaged as many as 30 ships and caused a diversion of commercial shipping to South Africa and the Cape of Good Hope. Reprisals by the US, Israel and the UK have damaged key Yemen ports and led to multiple deaths. Arab states are urging Israel and the incoming Trump administration to allow the Palestinian Authority (PA), in conjunction with the UN Palestinian relief agency Unrwa, to oversee Gaza’s recovery. The future governance of Gaza is due to be discussed at the start of negotiations on the second stage of the deal 16 days after a ceasefire begins.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/17/israel-hamas-ceasefire-deal-gaza-live-blog-updates-netanyahu-hostages	2025-01-16T18:53:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91ac90403a4de17a5a6eb34b2044f4a159c48269/0_306_4590_2754/master/4590.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e262ed8740934321113eb600735870c6

Fair to say that Kemi Badenoch’s time as leader of the Tory party has not got off to the best of starts. Hopeless at prime minister’s questions and seemingly already out of ideas, many in the party are already looking around for possible successors. Even Robert Jenrick. Things really are that desperate. Even so, 10 weeks in feels a little premature for a relaunch. If that’s what it was. Hard to know really as no one was much the wiser after Kemi had finished what had been billed as an -important- speech at the Institute of Directors in central London. No one does pointlessness quite like KemiKaze.

Four more of Donald Trump’s nominees will have their confirmation hearings today, after senators over the past two days questioned Pam Bondi, his pick for attorney general, and Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary nominee, among others. Today, hearings are scheduled for Scott Turner, who has been nominated to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development; Lee Zeldin, Trump’s pick as Environmental Protection Agency administrator; interior secretary nominee Doug Burgum; and treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent. Expect lots of questions from Democrats to Bessent regarding his views on Trump’s vows to impose tariffs on a host of countries, friend and foe alike. We can also expect Burgum to face scrutiny about his views on expanding oil and gas drilling on public lands, a Trump campaign pledge.

He delivered a goodbye address to the nation yesterday evening. The House of Representatives will vote on the Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act, another Republican-authored bill aimed at undocumented immigrants.

Firefighters weren’t using women’s purses to put out fires. A fish is not responsible for the blazes. The Los Angeles fire department didn’t see big budget cuts. The fires were not started deliberately as some kind of mass plot related to high-speed rail or the 2028 Olympics. Firefighting efforts did not include spraying a mood stabilizer into the air to put locals into a trance. Diversity measures are not to blame. Fires are still burning in Los Angeles, and with them has come a near-constant stream of rumors, half-truths, conspiracy theories and outright lies. Natural disasters have long led to the spread of misinformation as people try to make sense of destruction and grasp for control when the world around them is destroyed. In the aftermath of the disaster, a lot is still unknown: what caused it, what could have prevented it, who could be to blame.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/16/disinformation-los-angeles-wildfires	2025-01-16T06:00:19-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45fbcc8e41481899fb95029ead029aed6d456d9b/0_371_7451_4473/master/7451.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=44c6ffe223b8652560b594544504a018

Syrians in Germany ask to be allowed to visit home and keep protected status	Refugee organisations say many want to ‘go and have a look’ after fall of Assad regime but fear losing asylum rights Syrians in Germany have called on the government to allow them to travel to their home country for short visits without risking their protection status, as questions mount over how the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime will affect the millions of Syrians who live in Europe. More than a month after a lightning advance by rebels toppled the Assad family’s 54-year rule, the residency status of many Syrians across Europe remains in limbo. A dozen or so countries across the bloc responded to the regime’s ousting by suspending the processing of asylum application from Syrians, with Austria going one step further to say it was preparing a -repatriation and deportation- programme.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/16/syrians-germany-ask-allowed-visit-home-keep-protected-status	2025-01-16T05:27:57-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aa8641110e24911ca5d5e690ea70450e8bba8ed/0_272_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a350b1143eba3ed84096b836860f7352

Russia-Ukraine war live: Keir Starmer in Kyiv to sign ‘100-year deal’	UK prime minister in Ukrainian capital to sign security and trade pact in first official visit Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. The UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, has arrived in Kyiv to sign a security and trade pact with Ukraine, in a public show of support for Volodymyr Zelenskyy before the much anticipated return of Donald Trump to the White House on Monday. The Ukrainian military said on Thursday that its forces had captured more than two dozen troops in the western Russian region of Kursk, where Russian troops have been trying to eject Ukrainian forces for the past five months. -Ukrainian paratroopers together with adjacent units captured 27 enemy servicemen in the Kursk region,- a military statement said, adding that the Russian troops had surrendered. Ukraine downed 34 out of 55 drones launched by Russia across 11 of the country’s regions in an overnight attack, the Ukrainian air force said, with a further 18 failing to reach their targets. Russia launched missiles and drones at Ukrainian energy facilities on Wednesday, one day after Kyiv said it had carried out its largest aerial attack of the war on Russian army factories and energy hubs hundreds of kilometres from the frontline. The mayor of the southern city of Kherson said there were power cuts as a result of the barrage. After the attack, Zelenskyy called on the west to use around US$250bn of unallocated frozen Russian assets to buy Kyiv weapons. Europe must -take responsibility- for its own security, Poland has told its fellow EU member states, as Warsaw takes over the rotating presidency of the bloc at a time of increasing geopolitical uncertainty.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/16/russia-ukraine-war-live-keir-starmer-in-kyiv-to-sign-100-year-deal	2025-01-16T00:50:34-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17daf70c6bb748185580e50412e102fbfb3e62a2/0_106_8148_4889/master/8148.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=34363aae0d5f18c8b5b0ad2a18d2da7f

Trump’s attorney general pick Pam Bondi to face senators as key Republican says she’ll back Hegseth for Pentagon – US politics live	Bondi faces confirmation hearings alongside nominees Kristi Noem, Marco Rubio and CIA pick John Ratcliffe; Joni Ernst signals support for Pentagon pick Good morning, US politics blog readers. A battery of Donald Trump’s nominees for cabinet are going before senators today, including South Dakota governor Kristi Noem to lead the homeland security department, senator Marco Rubio for secretary of state and former congressman and intelligence official John Ratcliffe as director of the CIA. But the marquee event of the day will be former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi’s confirmation hearing to lead the justice department, a role in which she could make good on Trump’s promises to retaliate against his political enemies. Bondi voiced support for Trump’s baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election, and you can expect Democratic senators to demand answers about whether she would bring election denialism into the justice department, if confirmed. Meanwhile, it appears that Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News host who Trump nominated to serve as his defense secretary, won over a key Republican senator in his tense confirmation hearing yesterday. Iowa’s Joni Ernst has announced that she will support Hegseth, after expressing hesitation over comments he had made opposing women serving in combat roles. Hegseth has been dogged by a sexual assault allegation and reports of excessive drinking and financial mismanagement, but Ernst’s endorsement is seen as a major step to winning over other Republicans wary of installing him at the Pentagon. Joe Biden will deliver his farewell address to the nation from the Oval Office at 8pm. Inflation, the politically damaging economic trend Trump vowed to reverse, came in slightly higher than expected in December, according to just-released consumer price data from the labor department. Dangerous winds are expected to strike fire-ravaged parts of Southern California again, threatening new blazes.

Treasury minister warns of ‘tough decisions’ on spending amid high borrowing costs - UK politics live	Chief secretary to the treasury Darren Jones says there will be a spring statement on 26 March Good morning. Keir Starmer faces PMQs today. As he prepares, two issues seem very likely to come up. First, the economy. There is some modest good news this morning, and Rachel Reeves easily fought off a Tory attempted hit job on her in the Commons yesterday, but the underlying fundamentals are still pretty grim. Here are the key developments this morning. UK inflation unexpectedly fell in December, handing some breathing space to the chancellor, figures out this morning showed. The consumer prices index eased to 2.5%, below a reading of 2.6% in November, meaning prices rose at a slower rate. Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government would have to take -tough decisions- to meet its fiscal rules. The rise in government borrowing costs means further spending cuts are likely if the government is to meet its fiscal rules and Jones acknowledged that as he gave interviews this morning. He told BBC Breakfast: People at home know you can’t just keep borrowing every month to pay the bills. And where we do borrow to invest in the country’s infrastructure, the debt has to be falling as a size of the economy over the next five years. Jones said the government will not water down its plans to extend workers’ rights in the employment rights bill. In an interview on the Today programme Jones was asked about an interview on Monday where Rupert Soames, the CBI president, said the proposed changes could lead to firms laying off workers. Asked if the government would rethink the plans, Jones said: -No is the short answer.- He said giving workers more protection would be good for the economy. Jones has rejected claims the Siddiq affair raises questions about Starmer’s judgment. In an interview with Times Radio, the Treasury minister said: I don’t think there’s a question about the prime minister’s judgment. The independent process has been followed. It concluded, and Tulip took the decision to step down from government. Siddiq has been urged to -seek forgiveness from the people of Bangladesh-. As Sky News reports, responding to Siddiq’s resignation, a spokesperson for a Prof Muhammad Yunus, the interim leader of Bangladesh, said the former minister -may not have entirely understood the source of the money and property that she was enjoying in London-. The spokesperson added: She knows now and should seek forgiveness from the people of Bangladesh … We remain committed to accountability and justice and will be working with partners around the world to return the stolen funds to the people of Bangladesh.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/15/pmqs-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-labour-conservatives-uk-politics-live	2025-01-15T01:17:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/218761a797e8d612a7b7ba694728411a2a52a1d1/321_200_4792_2877/master/4792.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e1df1cd5cb5b85eaa9d27e8fa8835e5a

Last night, both sides appeared to have accepted the outlines of a deal, with Reuters reporting that once Israel delivers maps showing how its forces will withdraw from Gaza, Hamas will give its response. -It’s closer than it’s ever been before,- US secretary of state Antony Blinken said yesterday. -But, right now, as we sit here, we await final word from Hamas on its acceptance, and until we get that word, we’ll remain on the brink.- Economy | UK inflation unexpectedly fell in December, handing some breathing space to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, after a week of turbulence in financial markets. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the consumer prices index eased to 2.5%, below a reading of 2.6% in November. UK politics | Tulip Siddiq has resigned as a Treasury minister after accepting the furore over her close ties to her aunt, the ousted prime minister of Bangladesh now accused of corruption, had become a distraction. An investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing but said a lack of records meant that it was not possible -to obtain comprehensive comfort- over properties linked to Sheikh Hasina. South Korea | South Korea’s impeached president, Yoon Suk Yeol, has been arrested and is being questioned over his ill-fated declaration of martial law last month, anti-corruption investigators said on Wednesday, bringing to an end an early-morning standoff outside his official residence in Seoul. Health | Doctors are proposing a -radical overhaul- of how obesity is diagnosed worldwide amid concerns that a reliance on body mass index may be causing millions of people to be misdiagnosed.

Follow today’s news live Brisbane is the most expensive city on average for an independent education, while Canberra tops the list for Catholic schools, according to a new report from an education bonds group. The data, released by Futurity Investment Group as part of its annual cost of education index today, found independent school fees in Queensland’s capital city for a student starting in 2025 would total $12,405. Spiralling cost of living, rent and mortgage repayment pressures mean many households are under considerable pressure.

Stride’s Hamlet gag saves Reeves from slings and arrows of economic fortune | John Crace	Instead of evaluating chancellor’s performance, her shadow apes rightwing press and calls for her sacking You can only conclude that Conservative MPs are just too trusting for their own good. Either that or they are catatonically dim. The rest of us know enough to not always believe what we read on the front page of the rightwing papers, but Tory MPs seem to take everything at face value. If it’s in the paper, it must be true. It’s almost touching. Tuesday’s front pages of the Mail and the Telegraph insisted Rachel Reeves’s time was up.

Texas Right to Life, the state’s largest anti-abortion advocacy group, has had a hand in drafting a number of the bills, and is encouraging men to sue people who have supported their partners’ abortions.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/14/texas-anti-abortion-bills-filed	2025-01-14T06:00:55-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbaf46f78b11ffa56b417ad846001ad78c0d1267/0_287_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f4642d175559263429daeca5d05ef2d4

The Senate armed services committee will convene at 9.30am ET on Tuesday to question Hegseth, who faces an uncertain path to confirmation.

Thought UnitedHealthcare couldn’t get more awful? They’ve gone villain mode | Arwa Mahdawi	Killing people with paperwork instead of a gun doesn’t make you any less of a murderer At this very moment Luigi Mangione, who is accused of shooting UnitedHealthcare’s CEO last month, is sitting in a federal jail cell in Brooklyn. He’s got a barrage of court appearances scheduled and, once he has wound his way through the criminal justice system, he could be behind bars for the rest of his life. Which, of course, is as it should be. While there are a lot of reasons that many people find the 26-year-old alleged assassin sympathetic, you can’t just gun a CEO down outside a hotel in Manhattan and face no consequences for it. And Mangione, who is, by all accounts, an extremely smart guy with an Ivy League education, should really have known better. He should have known that if he wanted to murder someone – and get away with it – there were far more socially acceptable ways of doing so.

Jeremi Sensky of the suburban Pittsburgh community of Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, was in New Orleans to ring in 2025 with relatives at the time the attack occurred, he told KDKA’s The Marty Griffin Show. Sensky was on Bourbon Street when he was hit by a US army veteran inspired by Islamic State in an intentional ramming that killed 14 people and wounded about 30 others.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/14/new-orleans-attack-wheelchair	2025-01-14T03:00:24-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c03cfc7b84b00c155b9c245ea0df6b332c0c9e3/22_0_1353_812/master/1353.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c0a3f1e88d1f8974f291ef1f9655e9a6
Special counsel says Trump would have been convicted over 2020 election | First Thing	Report says evidence ‘was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction’ had Trump not been re-elected. Plus, dangerous winds return to LA Good morning. Donald Trump would have been convicted of crimes over his failed attempt to cling to power in 2020 if he hadn’t won the presidential election in November: that’s the finding of Jack Smith, the special counsel who investigated him. Why didn’t the case go ahead? Smith acknowledged the justice department’s policy prohibiting the prosecution of a sitting president, a factor that ultimately led to the dropping of charges against Trump after his 2024 victory. The report also references a supreme court ruling expanding presidential immunity, which complicated the case, and Trump’s repeated legal attacks, which took up time and resources to fight. How did Trump respond? In a social media post, Trump called the special counsel a -lamebrain prosecutor-. What do we know about the terms of the potential deal? Reuters reports that negotiations are advanced over releasing 33 of 98 hostages still in Gaza in the first stage of the deal, citing an Israeli official. In return, Israel will free 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, according to the Palestinian source close to the talks, who said the first phase would last for 60 days. While negotiators meet, is the war still raging? Yes. Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 18 people overnight, including six women and four children, health officials said, and Gaza’s civil defence agency reported that a wave of Israeli airstrikes killed more than 50 people in the Palestinian territory’s main city on Monday.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/14/first-thing-special-counsel-jack-smith-trump-convicted-2020-election	2025-01-14T02:52:05-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90d54c23d0e29b77c4957032c2727c8e0c47e140/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fc8ffc19667653282a6a6812caafa9fc
LA fires live: Southern California braced for ‘extremely critical fire conditions’ as life threatening winds pick up pace	With fire weather expected to continue until at least Wednesday, officials have pre-deployed firefighters across surrounding counties Additional water tankers and scores of firefighters have arrived at the Los Angeles area ahead of fierce winds that were forecast to return and threaten the progress made so far on two massive infernos that have destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 24 people. Three wildfires are currently burning in Los Angeles county. They are: The Palisades fire, at 23,713 acres and 14% containment. The Eaton fire, at 14,117 acres and 33% containment. The Hurst fire, at 799 acres and 97% containment. At least 24 people have died, and relatives have begun identifying their loved ones as they return to their homes or are notified by local officials. The fires have destroyed more than 12,000 structures and may be the costliest disaster in US history, according to initial estimates of damage and economic losses exceeding $250bn from AccuWeather. With fire weather expected to continue in the Los Angeles area through Wednesday, state and city officials have pre-deployed firefighters across LA and surrounding counties. House speaker Mike Johnson said he believes there should be conditions on disaster aid to California, citing -state and local leaders [who] were derelict in their duties-. Donald Trump is in talks to visit Los Angeles to survey the damage wrought by wildfires over the past week, CNN reported. The visit could occur as early as next week, but no details have been finalized. Altadena residents have filed three lawsuits against Southern California Edison, alleging that the utility is responsible for the Eaton fire. The lawsuits cite evidence that the fire began under a transmission tower and reference the utility’s role in other wildfires. However, no official cause for the fire has yet been determined. California governor Gavin Newsom has called on the state’s legislature to approve $2.5bn in additional funding to aid -response and initial recovery efforts for Los Angeles-. To do so, the governor expanded the special legislative session he’d called for the state in November, designed to prepare for Donald Trump’s inauguration. The firefighting plane that was grounded after sustaining damage from a drone has been repaired and will return to firefighting duty Tuesday, pending FAA approval, said LA county fire chief Anthony Marrone.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/14/la-california-fires-los-angeles-live-wildfire-map-warning-evacuation-latest-news	2025-01-14T02:38:17-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27e1ea77b9bc95d4b07c39817e39422a6dd5eff8/0_388_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=56379e328f0c0881fac3c2b397bc428d
Man in Brazil wrongly charged for 62 crimes after police use flawed photo ID	Police relied on showing photo of Paulo Alberto da Silva Costa, wrongly jailed for years, to victims to identify him as an alleged perpetrator Paulo Alberto da Silva Costa was having a regular day at work as a doorman in Rio de Janeiro when he was arrested in 2020. It was only then that he learned he was a suspect in 62 crimes: almost all were thefts, but there were also two homicide charges. Costa spent three years behind bars before Brazil’s supreme court recognised that it had all been a mistake. There was one common element: every case relied solely on the fact that a witness or victim had been shown a photograph of Costa, and identified him as the alleged perpetrator.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/14/brazil-man-wrongly-charged-photo-identification	2025-01-14T02:00:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2c45bfaab30a46b1fe15064df1c557c4ecbad95/0_0_2999_1800/master/2999.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9beb40f8bbbf32797ede7c3c3bbbda54

Rachel Reeves told it would be ‘politically suicidal’ to impose further cuts as economy falters – UK politics live	John McDonnell says more cuts would be ‘a disaster for the country’ and steer voters towards Reform Good morning. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is back from her trip to China and, according to Politico, she will make a statement in the Commons. This will allow her to address the criticism she has been facing about the rise in government borrowing costs, and what this means for her spending plans. Reading some of the Tory papers this morning you would think she is on the point of being sacked. This is more partisan wishful-thinking than objective truth-telling, but Reeves is is definitely in some difficulty, because she promised growth and events are not going as planned. As Pippa Crerar and Jessica Elgot report, with the rise in borrowing costs putting the government at risk of breaking its fiscal rules, the Treasury is looking at potential cuts to balance the books. There is obviously a problem. There’s turbulence in the international markets, and we’ve just got to see those through. And the way you do that is – you don’t turn to cuts, certainly, because not only will that … be politically suicidal, that would undermine the political support upon which Labour got elected. There are two groups of people who make judgments on an incoming government. One is the international markets, the money markets, of course. But actually the most important people are the electorate and I think what has to happen here is the electorate have to be protected. You should tax the grotesque inequality that we have within our society – 16 million living in poverty, and yet at the same time,we’ve now created in our society 165 billionaires. And on the last calculation I saw, in the two years from 2020 to 2022, they made an additional £15onbn of wealth. I think you have to look at redistribution.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/14/keir-starmer-rachel-reeves-labour-kemi-badenoch-david-lammy-latest-politics-live-news	2025-01-14T01:24:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f1b704e3d0273aad54ab9f2035079aa98d888f8/0_88_3872_2323/master/3872.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5e635f2e576678347e80c699428d74c4

Israel-Gaza war live: Hopes rise for ceasefire and hostage release deal despite Israeli strikes in Gaza	Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip killed at least 18 people overnight as Israel and Hamas appeared to be coming closer to a ceasefire deal Welcome to our live coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. It is nearly 10.30am in Gaza City and Jerusalem. Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip killed at least 18 people overnight, including six women and four children, health officials said, as Israel and Hamas appeared to be coming closer to a ceasefire deal to end the 15-month war and release dozens of hostages. Gaza’s civil defence agency reported that a wave of Israeli airstrikes killed more than 50 people in the Palestinian territory’s main city on Monday. Agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said the strikes pounded Gaza City throughout the day, hitting -schools, homes and even gatherings of people-. -There is no room in hospitals to receive the wounded,- Bassal told AFP. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not immediately comment on the claims. The IDF said five soldiers had been killed in fighting in northern Gaza, bringing to nine the number of its troops killed since Saturday. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels meanwhile fired a missile at central Israel, setting off sirens and sending people fleeing to shelters without causing any casualties. Police said Tuesday several homes were damaged outside Jerusalem and released a photo of a missile casing that had crashed into a roof. An Israeli lawyer has filed submissions to the international criminal court (ICC) alleging incitement to genocide against Palestinians by eight Israeli officials, including President Isaac Herzog and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, said at least five people were killed in the bombing of the Salah al-Din school in Gaza City, which was housing displaced Palestinian people. At least 46,584 Palestinian people have been killed and 109,731 injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in its latest update. At least 19 Palestinians were killed in the last 24 hours, the ministry said.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/14/israel-gaza-war-live-ceasefire-hostage-deal-latest-live-news-updates	2025-01-14T00:24:58-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d95b7c250fb151469bc54715d1051828979f69c8/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1a394d1875c18250eba409fa6b607c18

Tuesday briefing: What Ukraine might gain from two North Korean captives	In today’s newsletter: Kyiv’s interrogation footage of captured North Korean soldiers leads to questions about what it might do with the soldiers – and what the PoWs might do for them Good morning. In a grinding war where significant changes at the front are hard to discern, a video released by Ukraine on Sunday is a rare point of focus: it featured two North Korean soldiers, answering questions from their Ukrainian captors, and weighing the circumstances of their presence in a conflict thousands of miles from home. The video is, perhaps, not militarily significant. But it is a unique insight into one of the more extraordinary aspects of a conflict that has drawn in actors from all over the world, and is a crucible in which every participant is learning how modern wars are fought. Economy | Rachel Reeves will remain as chancellor until the next general election, Keir Starmer has insisted, as he warned the Treasury would be -ruthless- over public spending cuts to help meet the government’s fiscal rules. Gaza | Joe Biden has said his administration is on the brink of sealing a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas that could pause the war after more than 14 months of fighting. Biden administration officials have said they believe the deal may be concluded before Donald Trump’s inauguration next week.

[It is] unclear if North Korea will even claim the two captured soldiers as their own, given Moscow and Pyongyang’s refusal to officially admit that North Korean forces have been deployed to Russia. At the same time, Russia could claim them as their own and hand them over to North Korea after they are traded with Ukrainian PoWs.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/14/tuesday-briefing-what-ukraine-might-gain-from-its-north-korean-captives	2025-01-13T22:48:28-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25743ee3fc336db21bb5bff536ac2d46018d534e/519_516_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=12580eb72feec06e1129248d06681ecd

Bogarde, who died in 1999 and never came out publicly but lived with his life partner and manager, Anthony Forwood, was told by security services that his name was on a list of -six practising British homosexuals- given to the Russians by an unnamed source who had himself been sexually compromised during a visit to Moscow in the late 1950s.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/14/actor-dirk-bogarde-was-disturbed-by-kgb-sting-warning-declassified-files-reveal	2025-01-13T16:01:44-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cf42e33269e381949247fa6aed49e4355db276a/0_182_4493_2696/master/4493.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=da526e4e701eb997b278c6cafcce88ee

Where there’s fire, there’s smoke: Los Angeles blazes raise fears of ‘super toxic’ lung damage	Concerns that dangerous fine particle pollution can become embedded in bloodstream and lungs The Los Angeles wildfires have claimed the lives of at least 24 people and have burned more than 100,000 structures. While the focus is understandably on avoiding the flames, another immediate danger lurks across the county and beyond, one more difficult to escape: smoke. The most dangerous component of wildfire smoke is fine particle pollution, also known as PM2.5 or soot. These tiny particles, smaller than one 20th the width of a human hair, can, if inhaled, become embedded in the bloodstream and lungs. It is estimated that about one-third of all particulate matter pollution in the US now comes from wildfire smoke.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/13/los-angeles-wildfires-smoke-exposures	2025-01-13T14:16:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e11173d30a3a548e43b7610a6084197d35f19692/0_122_6443_3866/master/6443.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40daa767f2bc6d83707a67daf5b8ce4b

Meta moderators were already in Texas before Zuckerberg announced move, say ex-workers	Ex-workers say CEO declaring relocation of moderation and safety teams from California just a play for Trump approval In a carefully worded statement, Mark Zuckerberg announced last week that Meta was moving its trust and safety and content moderation teams out of California and that the company’s content review -is going to be based in Texas-. The thrust of these teams’ work is to ensure that Facebook and Instagram users do not encounter hate speech, pornography and violent content.

JD Vance walks back Trump’s pledge to pardon January 6 protesters on day one – US politics live	Incoming vice-president says people who ‘committed violence’ shouldn’t be pardoned as surveys suggest blanket pardons would be unpopular with Americans Good morning, US politics blog readers. We’re one week out from Donald Trump’s inauguration as president, a day on which he has vowed to act like a dictator, and among the long list of things he has promised to do one his first day in office is pardon people convicted or accused of crimes over the January 6 insurrection. The few surveys done of the issue have indicated that a blanket pardon would be unpopular with Americans, and in an interview on Sunday, JD Vance seemed to walk back his boss’s pledge. -If you protested peacefully on January 6th … you should be pardoned-, the incoming vice-president told Fox News. -If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn’t be pardoned, and there’s a little bit of a gray area there, but we’re very much committed to seeing the equal administration of law.- For all the norms he has shattered, Trump would be far from the first American president to make big promises on the campaign trail then find reason not to keep them once he gets the job. We’ll find out what his supporters think of Vance’s comments as the day goes on. Confirmation hearings begin this week for Trump’s cabinet nominees, with the first scheduled for Tuesday. Some nominees, such as senator Marco Rubio to lead the state department, are expected to be approved with little tension. But others, think Pete Hegseth as defense secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr as secretary of health and human services and Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, will spark fights with Democrats. Joe Biden is looking to make the most of his final week as president, beginning with a speech today at 2pm ET from the state department about his foreign policy legacy. Los Angeles firefighters continue to combat blazes in and around the city, amid fears that another bout of gusty and hot weather could fuel more outbreaks.

‘Particularly dangerous’ wildfire weather returns to California and could linger for months, say experts	Forecasters say there won’t be winds as strong as last week’s record-setting gusts, but LA’s dry season will get worse When it comes to forecasting the conditions for catastrophic California wildfires, there are two main ingredients: fuels (think grasses, shrubs, trees – basically anything that’s available for fires to burn) and winds. When analyzing fuels, forecasters look mainly at the levels of drought, along with any recent rains that may help diminish the effect of longer-term drought. With winds, in southern California at least, it’s all about anticipating the Santa Anas – the fierce winds that blow offshore, from the deserts to the coast, bringing loads of dry air with them.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/13/california-wildfire-weather-conditions-forecast	2025-01-13T03:00:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83ce2e71dae054ed77a312a6fc6657edb6c39592/61_0_4881_2929/master/4881.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7852bfe309b81e20b047e966a9d3ef5a

The main elements have already been well trailed. Here is the Department for Science’s overnight news release, and here is a story by Robert Booth summing it all up. As usual, though, what the government wants to talk about and what it will end up being forced to talk about are not the same. The macro story that matters most in UK politics at the moment is the rise in UK government borrowing costs (largely driven by global economic developments, and the prospect of what Donald Trump will do when he becomes US president next week), and whether this will lead to fresh spending cuts in the spring. On the business live blog, Julia Kollewe says UK bond yields (borrowing costs) are marginally up again this morning.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/13/keir-starmer-labour-ai-yvette-cooper-tulip-siddiq-latest-politics-news-live	2025-01-13T01:23:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/840d45084eef6a8324b9d6fe2f3351625b814b0b/0_67_3214_1930/master/3214.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=daa6e8378b14630937da06728fc6946f

Tories back Badenoch’s ‘risky’ call for grooming gangs inquiry	Keir Starmer accuses opposition leader of spending ‘a lot of time on social media over Christmas’ When Kemi Badenoch used prime minister’s questions this week to echo Elon Musk’s demands for a new inquiry into sexual grooming gangs, the MPs behind her were trying to interpret the intentions of their fledgling leader.

There was one point, however, that seemed to unite those with differing theories about their leader’s motives. Her decision to warn Keir Starmer that refusing a fresh inquiry could prompt speculation about a -cover-up- was the kind of political gamble they had expected her to be willing to take.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/12/tories-back-badenochs-risky-call-for-grooming-gangs-inquiry	2025-01-11T22:00:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38d25e0a70cfb4643b95f571b4972d7d0f321d80/0_127_7318_4391/master/7318.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f405cc2505c6a0f1160e23a98746b2fe

Silicon Valley’s tycoons are bending the knee to Trump | Blake Montgomery	In 2017, Silicon Valley rebuked Trump’s travel ban. Today, it has reversed course and is bending over backwards with displays of deference to Trump On 28 January 2017, I rushed to the San Francisco international airport (SFO). Like elsewhere in the US that night, demonstrations were growing against a travel ban Donald Trump had issued against visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries. The night was chillier than normal, and I had not brought an adequate jacket. Luckily, the train to the airport was warm, full to the brim with jittery, talkative protesters. The airport itself was a rowdy scene: cabs and Ubers stalled as angry protesters blocked the roads, meters still running; demonstrators in hijabs prayed on their protest signs in baggage claim as others shouted at any arriving flyer coming for their luggage. Trump was the most outrageous man in America then, his election a shock to a wide swath of the world. After a few hours, whispers of a $150bn face floated through the crowd: Sergey Brin, creator and co-founder of Google, was there. At the time, he was the president of Google’s parent company Alphabet, which also owns YouTube. The effect was thrilling: one of the richest and most powerful men in the world was registering his discontent with Trump by bodily joining a protest against him. Brin, a native of Moscow who arrived in the US at the age of six, said he came to SFO that night -because I’m a refugee-. It was a personal rebuke of Trump, the consummate nativist.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/11/trump-silicon-valley	2025-01-11T05:00:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad0153854745673e2dce46a20cefa32880506b81/0_203_3071_1844/master/3071.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=95226bc01dd29236a9c07c20d61c0535

California fires live: progress made against some LA blazes but thickening smoke prompts ‘health emergency’	Palisades and Eaton fires start coming under control as fierce winds ease but forecasters predict another red flag warning for Monday Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the California wildfires that have devastated six neighborhoods of Los Angeles county, killed at least 11 people and damaged or destroyed more than 12,000 structures. Firefighters finally started gaining control over two major wildfires on the eastern and western flanks of Los Angeles on Friday as fierce winds that supercharged the fires for days eased. The Palisades fire, at 21,317 acres and 8% containment The Eaton fire, at 13,690 acres and 3% containment The Kenneth fire, at 1,052 acres and 50% containment The Hurst fire, at 771 acres and 37% containment The Lidia fire, at 395 acres and 98% containment The Archer fire, at 19 acres and 0% containment Six deaths have been confirmed in the Eaton fire and five in the Palisades. As family members have been alerted to the loss of their loved ones, six of the victims have been publicly identified. Law enforcement officials expect the death toll to rise once weather and fire conditions allow cadaver dogs and detectives into the burn zones. Conditions in the Los Angeles area were forecast to improve through the weekend, with sustained winds slowing to about 20mph (32km/h), gusting between 35-50mph, according to the National Weather Service, a respite from recent wind gusts of 80mph. -It’s not as gusty, so that should help firefighters,- NWS meteorologist Allison Santorelli said, adding that conditions were still critical with low humidity and dry vegetation. Forecasters predicted another red flag warning would be issued for Monday. Fire chief Kristin Crowley criticised city officials over water supply issues and budget cuts that she says hindered her department’s ability to fight the Palisades fire. The water supply has become a focal point, with California governor Gavin Newsom calling for an investigation into the shortage. Newsom has invited Donald Trump to visit the state and tour the the LA wildfires’ devastation. Trump visited the state six years ago in the wake of the Camp fire, the most destructive fire in California history, which hit the town of Paradise.
