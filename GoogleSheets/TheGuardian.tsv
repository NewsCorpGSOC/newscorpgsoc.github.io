I won’t let critics get to me, says Reeves after speculation about her future	Chancellor says she has the ideas needed to turn things around after week of speculation about whether she can remain in post Rachel Reeves has said she is not going to let her critics get her down after a bruising week of speculation about whether she could be ousted as chancellor. Reeves said she is qualified for the job and has the ideas to turn things around, amid worries about falling business confidence and the rising cost of government borrowing.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/17/i-wont-let-critics-get-to-me-says-rachel-reeves-after-speculation-about-her-future	2025-01-16T22:00:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baafb94f1d45eaef4bff8e2c17fc999a559de1d6/0_411_6206_3726/master/6206.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=82bf46418d99bad8e0bb2a6e697e6cf3
‘Everyone thought it would cause gridlock’: the highway that Seoul turned into a stream	Cheonggyecheon stream in the South Korean capital has become an attraction – and helps with flood management, fighting air pollution and cooling the city On a crisp December morning, office workers and tourists stroll along a tree-lined stream in central Seoul, pausing on stepping stones that cross its flowing waters. It’s difficult to imagine that just over 20 years ago, this was a vast elevated highway carrying 168,000 cars daily through the heart of South Korea’s capital. Cheonggyecheon, a stream that runs for about 3.5 miles (nearly 6km) through Seoul, was one of the earliest experiments in an increasing trend in cities globally: turning spaces where there was once car or rail infrastructure into spaces for pedestrians and cyclists. It’s a powerful example of the way that these spaces can become loved and popular, along with projects such as the High Line in New York, where an old railway track has been turned into a raised park, or the city moat in Utrecht, where a multi-lane road (nicknamed the -motorway from nothing to nowhere-) was converted back into a canal, in part of a huge continuing push to allow pedestrians and cyclists to dominate the city’s centre.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/17/seoul-cheonggyecheon-motorway-turned-into-a-stream	2025-01-16T22:00:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc1f4407598278f21fb2bb022431678444304ed6/0_216_6480_3888/master/6480.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7621aeec72978d8563d9dbdc053a2ea9

In Gaza itself, Israeli warplanes kept up intense strikes, and Palestinian authorities said late on Thursday that at least 86 people had been killed in the day after the truce was unveiled. Earlier on Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had attacked approximately 50 terrorist targets throughout the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/17/israel-hamas-ceasefire-deal-gaza-war-netanyahu-updates	2025-01-16T21:13:42-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3eeda668c06dc27185ac85df1b18f3539cc532fd/0_131_4304_2582/master/4304.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cac814d00fe5328b1c659b94af218250
Austria is set for a far-right chancellor. For the EU it’s the ‘new normal’	If Herbert Kickl becomes chancellor, Vienna will join list of disruptive member states, putting EU policies in peril When Austria’s Freedom party (FPÖ) entered government 25 years ago, shock waves reverberated around Europe. Punitive measures were imposed, diplomatic visits cancelled and Belgium even suggested the EU could do without the Alpine country. That was when the far-right party was only a junior coalition partner. This time, the FPÖ – nativist, anti-immigration and fiercely critical of the EU – is in the driving seat. Its leader, Herbert Kickl, is in pole position to be Austria’s next chancellor.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/17/austria-is-set-for-a-far-right-chancellor-for-the-eu-its-the-new-normal	2025-01-16T21:00:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e8cb4b407979395a893ebd7dbbcac3c5100715d/0_22_7771_4663/master/7771.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=448e25c64ee81b59853372f60ce6f85b

Gaza ceasefire-hostage deal reached, Israel PM’s office says – live	Benjamin Netanyahu’s office says in statement that security cabinet will meet on Friday following earlier delays in talks to release hostages in return for ceasefire Welcome to our live coverage of the Middle East crisis. Here’s a snapshot of the latest news. Senior US officials insisted the hard-won ceasefire would go into effect on Sunday as planned despite the unexpected delay. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he was -very confident- that the ceasefire would go forward and he -fully expects that implementation will begin, as we said, on Sunday-. He confirmed that there had been a -loose end- between the sides in the complex negotiations. US representatives are still believed to be actively involved with talks in Doha on the final details needed to get the deal over the line. A vote is now expected to take place on Friday morning, Israeli media reported. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s hardline national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, announced on Thursday evening that he would quit the government if it ratifies the ceasefire deal, calling it -irresponsible- and -reckless-. Ben-Gvir’s departure would not bring down Netanyahu’s government. Opposition leader Yair Lapid pledged his support for Netanyahu, saying that the deal was -more important than any disagreement we’ve ever had.- Fighting has continued in Gaza despite expectations of a ceasefire, with at least 80 Palestinians killed and hundreds more injured by Israeli airstrikes since the ceasefire announcement, according to the civil defence agency. The Israeli military said that it had conducted strikes on -approximately 50 terror targets- across Gaza since late Wednesday. A civil defence spokesperson said its teams had recovered the bodies of five children after a strike on the northern city of Jabalia. More than 46,788 Palestinians have been killed and a further 110,453 wounded by Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, according to the latest figures by the territory’s health ministry on Thursday. They include 81 killed and 188 injured in the past 24 hours. Among them was Fatin Shaqoura-Salha, the chief of nursing staff at Al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat, ActionAid said. The ceasefire agreement, announced on Wednesday, was due to come into effect on Sunday. In the first phase, to last 42 days, Hamas agreed to release 33 hostages and in exchange, Israel would release 50 Palestinian prisoners for every female Israeli soldier released by Hamas, and 30 for other hostages. Palestinians displaced from their homes would be allowed to move freely around Gaza, wounded people would be vacuated for treatment abroad, and aid to the territory should increase to 600 trucks a day. A second phase would include Israel completely withdrawing from Gaza. The leader of Yemen’s Houthis, Abdul-Malik Badr al-Din al-Houthi, said the Iran-aligned group would suspend their attacks on Red Sea targets but continue if Israel backtracks on the ceasefire. The Houthi attacks have damaged as many as 30 ships and caused a diversion of commercial shipping to South Africa and the Cape of Good Hope. Reprisals by the US, Israel and the UK have damaged key Yemen ports and led to multiple deaths. Arab states are urging Israel and the incoming Trump administration to allow the Palestinian Authority (PA), in conjunction with the UN Palestinian relief agency Unrwa, to oversee Gaza’s recovery. The future governance of Gaza is due to be discussed at the start of negotiations on the second stage of the deal 16 days after a ceasefire begins.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/17/israel-hamas-ceasefire-deal-gaza-live-blog-updates-netanyahu-hostages	2025-01-16T18:53:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91ac90403a4de17a5a6eb34b2044f4a159c48269/0_306_4590_2754/master/4590.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e262ed8740934321113eb600735870c6

Labour’s pivot on grooming gangs may not be enough to silence critics	Yvette Cooper’s unveiling of a rapid review of evidence, after week of arguments against new inquiry, has already been called inadequate When is a U-turn not a U-turn? When it is less a complete volte face and more of a change of direction. The question looms over Keir Starmer, whose announcement of a review into grooming gangs is his second such positional pivot this week alone. On Tuesday, the Treasury minister, Tulip Siddiq, departed over her links to much-disputed claims of family corruption centred on her aunt, the former president of Bangladesh. Downing Street had insisted for days that the facts must first be established.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/16/labours-pivot-on-grooming-gangs-may-not-be-enough-to-silence-critics	2025-01-16T11:21:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2c1d7acf16a17b9a972dd24284c5d8931f94e8d/0_546_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a3f929244a241cc2e8fbdddddf44d9f3

KemiKaze’s ‘relaunch’ speech reveals a Tory leader already out of ideas | John Crace	Kemi Badenoch says she’s sorry not sorry for the mess left by 14 years of the Tories, but offers no clue of how to dig us out of it Seeing is not always believing. Fair to say that Kemi Badenoch’s time as leader of the Tory party has not got off to the best of starts. Hopeless at prime minister’s questions and seemingly already out of ideas, many in the party are already looking around for possible successors. Even Robert Jenrick. Things really are that desperate. Even so, 10 weeks in feels a little premature for a relaunch. If that’s what it was. Hard to know really as no one was much the wiser after Kemi had finished what had been billed as an -important- speech at the Institute of Directors in central London. No one does pointlessness quite like KemiKaze.

Trump nominees for treasury, interior secretary and EPA chief to face senators – live	Four more of Donald Trump’s nominees have confirmation hearings today after senators have grilled Pam Bondi and Pete Hegseth this week Good morning, US politics blog readers. Four more of Donald Trump’s nominees will have their confirmation hearings today, after senators over the past two days questioned Pam Bondi, his pick for attorney general, and Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary nominee, among others. Today, hearings are scheduled for Scott Turner, who has been nominated to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development; Lee Zeldin, Trump’s pick as Environmental Protection Agency administrator; interior secretary nominee Doug Burgum; and treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent. Expect lots of questions from Democrats to Bessent regarding his views on Trump’s vows to impose tariffs on a host of countries, friend and foe alike. We can also expect Burgum to face scrutiny about his views on expanding oil and gas drilling on public lands, a Trump campaign pledge. Here’s what else is going on today: Joe Biden is continuing his presidential farewell, with a ceremony for defense department staff at 2pm. He delivered a goodbye address to the nation yesterday evening. The House of Representatives will vote on the Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act, another Republican-authored bill aimed at undocumented immigrants. This one is targeted at migrants convicted of domestic violence, sexual abuse and related crimes.

Firefighters weren’t using women’s purses to put out fires. A fish is not responsible for the blazes. The Los Angeles fire department didn’t see big budget cuts. The fires were not started deliberately as some kind of mass plot related to high-speed rail or the 2028 Olympics. Firefighting efforts did not include spraying a mood stabilizer into the air to put locals into a trance. Diversity measures are not to blame. Fires are still burning in Los Angeles, and with them has come a near-constant stream of rumors, half-truths, conspiracy theories and outright lies. Natural disasters have long led to the spread of misinformation as people try to make sense of destruction and grasp for control when the world around them is destroyed.

Ukraine downed 34 out of 55 drones launched by Russia across 11 of the country’s regions in an overnight attack, the Ukrainian air force said, with a further 18 failing to reach their targets.

Demetrius Terrence Frazier, 52, is scheduled to be executed on 6 February for the 1991 murder and rape of Pauline Brown. His attorneys in a court filing asked a judge to block the execution unless the state makes changes to the protocol, such as giving him a sedative before the gas begins flowing. The court filing cited witness descriptions of the state’s first three executions with nitrogen gas.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/15/alabama-prisoner-nitrogen-gas-execution	2025-01-15T13:48:01-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44bef8f04b78c5e88dab2474603d6e26ad1b4b16/71_0_1837_1103/master/1837.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cf389e797dee916020460a6b7df4f7e2

Trump’s attorney general pick Pam Bondi to face senators as key Republican says she’ll back Hegseth for Pentagon – US politics live	Bondi faces confirmation hearings alongside nominees Kristi Noem, Marco Rubio and CIA pick John Ratcliffe; Joni Ernst signals support for Pentagon pick Good morning, US politics blog readers. A battery of Donald Trump’s nominees for cabinet are going before senators today, including South Dakota governor Kristi Noem to lead the homeland security department, senator Marco Rubio for secretary of state and former congressman and intelligence official John Ratcliffe as director of the CIA. But the marquee event of the day will be former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi’s confirmation hearing to lead the justice department, a role in which she could make good on Trump’s promises to retaliate against his political enemies. Bondi voiced support for Trump’s baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election, and you can expect Democratic senators to demand answers about whether she would bring election denialism into the justice department, if confirmed. Meanwhile, it appears that Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News host who Trump nominated to serve as his defense secretary, won over a key Republican senator in his tense confirmation hearing yesterday. Iowa’s Joni Ernst has announced that she will support Hegseth, after expressing hesitation over comments he had made opposing women serving in combat roles. Hegseth has been dogged by a sexual assault allegation and reports of excessive drinking and financial mismanagement, but Ernst’s endorsement is seen as a major step to winning over other Republicans wary of installing him at the Pentagon. Joe Biden will deliver his farewell address to the nation from the Oval Office at 8pm. Inflation, the politically damaging economic trend Trump vowed to reverse, came in slightly higher than expected in December, according to just-released consumer price data from the labor department. Dangerous winds are expected to strike fire-ravaged parts of Southern California again, threatening new blazes.

Fossil-fuel industry lobbying in California spiked to record levels during the 2023-24 legislative session, and the polluter pay bill was among the most targeted pieces of legislation, a Guardian review of state lobby filings found.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/15/polluter-pay-bill-climate-disasters	2025-01-15T03:00:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20d0e12e49e625954ba2ffc7ca0af6984df9c247/0_417_7497_4498/master/7497.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ee1cca69daae747e3c28db5a82e53824

On Tuesday, Siddiq resigned as minister for the City and anti-corruption after accepting that allegations of corruption linked to her aunt Sheikh Hasina, the deposed prime minister of Bangladesh, had become a distraction.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/15/treasury-chief-darren-jones-welcome-tulip-siddiq-return-minister	2025-01-15T02:12:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae7f8a4221b68bc3dccbb20786acc85254f3d81d/0_568_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0d040118499bb96ff93a58dc3359b58e
Treasury minister warns of ‘tough decisions’ on spending amid high borrowing costs - UK politics live	Chief secretary to the treasury Darren Jones says there will be a spring statement on 26 March Good morning. Keir Starmer faces PMQs today. As he prepares, two issues seem very likely to come up. First, the economy. There is some modest good news this morning, and Rachel Reeves easily fought off a Tory attempted hit job on her in the Commons yesterday, but the underlying fundamentals are still pretty grim. Here are the key developments this morning. UK inflation unexpectedly fell in December, handing some breathing space to the chancellor, figures out this morning showed. The consumer prices index eased to 2.5%, below a reading of 2.6% in November, meaning prices rose at a slower rate. Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government would have to take -tough decisions- to meet its fiscal rules. The rise in government borrowing costs means further spending cuts are likely if the government is to meet its fiscal rules and Jones acknowledged that as he gave interviews this morning. He told BBC Breakfast: People at home know you can’t just keep borrowing every month to pay the bills. And where we do borrow to invest in the country’s infrastructure, the debt has to be falling as a size of the economy over the next five years. Jones said the government will not water down its plans to extend workers’ rights in the employment rights bill. In an interview on the Today programme Jones was asked about an interview on Monday where Rupert Soames, the CBI president, said the proposed changes could lead to firms laying off workers. Asked if the government would rethink the plans, Jones said: -No is the short answer.- He said giving workers more protection would be good for the economy. Jones has rejected claims the Siddiq affair raises questions about Starmer’s judgment. In an interview with Times Radio, the Treasury minister said: I don’t think there’s a question about the prime minister’s judgment. The independent process has been followed. It concluded, and Tulip took the decision to step down from government. Siddiq has been urged to -seek forgiveness from the people of Bangladesh-. As Sky News reports, responding to Siddiq’s resignation, a spokesperson for a Prof Muhammad Yunus, the interim leader of Bangladesh, said the former minister -may not have entirely understood the source of the money and property that she was enjoying in London-. The spokesperson added: She knows now and should seek forgiveness from the people of Bangladesh … We remain committed to accountability and justice and will be working with partners around the world to return the stolen funds to the people of Bangladesh.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/15/pmqs-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-labour-conservatives-uk-politics-live	2025-01-15T01:17:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/218761a797e8d612a7b7ba694728411a2a52a1d1/321_200_4792_2877/master/4792.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e1df1cd5cb5b85eaa9d27e8fa8835e5a

Wednesday briefing: What a Gaza ceasefire might look like	In today’s newsletter: With reports of a breakthrough in ceasefire negotiations, a look at what the detail includes – and what its obstacles are Good morning. After months of false starts, Israel and Hamas are close to agreeing a ceasefire that would involve the release of hostages and a major influx of aid into Gaza. Last night, both sides appeared to have accepted the outlines of a deal, with Reuters reporting that once Israel delivers maps showing how its forces will withdraw from Gaza, Hamas will give its response. -It’s closer than it’s ever been before,- US secretary of state Antony Blinken said yesterday. -But, right now, as we sit here, we await final word from Hamas on its acceptance, and until we get that word, we’ll remain on the brink.- Economy | UK inflation unexpectedly fell in December, handing some breathing space to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, after a week of turbulence in financial markets. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the consumer prices index eased to 2.5%, below a reading of 2.6% in November. UK politics | Tulip Siddiq has resigned as a Treasury minister after accepting the furore over her close ties to her aunt, the ousted prime minister of Bangladesh now accused of corruption, had become a distraction. An investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing but said a lack of records meant that it was not possible -to obtain comprehensive comfort- over properties linked to Sheikh Hasina. South Korea | South Korea’s impeached president, Yoon Suk Yeol, has been arrested and is being questioned over his ill-fated declaration of martial law last month, anti-corruption investigators said on Wednesday, bringing to an end an early-morning standoff outside his official residence in Seoul. Health | Doctors are proposing a -radical overhaul- of how obesity is diagnosed worldwide amid concerns that a reliance on body mass index may be causing millions of people to be misdiagnosed. Relying only on BMI is -ineffective- because it is not a direct measure of fat and does not provide information about a person’s health, a report by the Lancet commission said.

Australia news live: Brisbane tops list for most expensive private schooling; Albanese to campaign in Tasmania	Prime minister to spruik NBN and housing spending in latest early campaign visit. Follow today’s news live Brisbane is the most expensive city on average for an independent education, while Canberra tops the list for Catholic schools, according to a new report from an education bonds group. The data, released by Futurity Investment Group as part of its annual cost of education index today, found independent school fees in Queensland’s capital city for a student starting in 2025 would total $12,405. Spiralling cost of living, rent and mortgage repayment pressures mean many households are under considerable pressure. With less discretionary money to spend, it is going to be a challenge for many families to pay for education, including school fees and voluntary contributions, which have all increased in the past year.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/jan/15/australia-news-live-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-election-campaign-nbn-education-school-cost	2025-01-14T11:37:21-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e4e764b4080820d369e854a11c3f97d5affb58c/0_0_8042_4824/master/8042.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2816d1ac0601f22ef6b796cf010841ff

Stride’s Hamlet gag saves Reeves from slings and arrows of economic fortune | John Crace	Instead of evaluating chancellor’s performance, her shadow apes rightwing press and calls for her sacking You can only conclude that Conservative MPs are just too trusting for their own good. Either that or they are catatonically dim. The rest of us know enough to not always believe what we read on the front page of the rightwing papers, but Tory MPs seem to take everything at face value. If it’s in the paper, it must be true. It’s almost touching. Tuesday’s front pages of the Mail and the Telegraph insisted Rachel Reeves’s time was up. Going to China while the international bond markets crept upwards was the last straw. The chancellor should resign. What’s more, the prime minister had expressed his -full confidence- in Reeves, which could only mean that he was about to sack her. Let’s just say that Monday had been a slow news day in Westminster and some hacks had decided to make mischief.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/14/strides-hamlet-gag-saves-reeves-from-slings-and-arrows-of-economic-fortune	2025-01-14T10:19:59-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71e7fcb812b69e1059045495c89bfd1ee8b9b59d/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7724509257eb96ec7be49811824d3860

German police investigate AfD flyers resembling plane tickets for immigrants	Karlsruhe police say they have opened inquiry into ‘persons unknown on suspicion of incitement of racial hatred’ German police have launched an investigation after the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party distributed flyers designed to resemble plane tickets for deportation that were addressed to -illegal immigrants- as part of an increasingly provocative campaign for next month’s general election. People from immigrant communities in the south-western city of Karlsruhe found the flyers in their mailboxes although it was not immediately clear if they had been directly targeted.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/14/german-police-investigate-afd-flyers-resembling-plane-tickets-for-immigrants	2025-01-14T05:40:14-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/695546882866143d1c60692e9d2cc74379a93ace/0_285_2744_1645/master/2744.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=74446f0861d8d4163bd1b883ca0f431c

Trump’s Pentagon pick to testify amid claims of sexual assault and alcohol use	Bitter battle expected at Senate hearing but Republicans appear confident Pete Hegseth will be confirmed Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump’s controversial pick for US secretary of defense, will testify at a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, as the military veteran and Fox News host faces intense scrutiny over allegations of sexual assault, excessive alcohol use and financial mismanagement. The Senate armed services committee will convene at 9.30am ET on Tuesday to question Hegseth, who faces an uncertain path to confirmation. Hegseth can only afford to lose the votes of three Senate Republicans, assuming every Democratic senator opposes his nomination, and several Republican members have voiced concerns about Hegseth’s personal history and his views on women in the military.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/14/pete-hegseth-testimony-congress-secretary-defense	2025-01-14T04:00:26-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6447c15701321a29b35286a1583fd2174ec064c1/0_16_4900_2940/master/4900.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f4912913c72e336a3504ef26a2c24da1

Thought UnitedHealthcare couldn’t get more awful? They’ve gone villain mode | Arwa Mahdawi	Killing people with paperwork instead of a gun doesn’t make you any less of a murderer At this very moment Luigi Mangione, who is accused of shooting UnitedHealthcare’s CEO last month, is sitting in a federal jail cell in Brooklyn. He’s got a barrage of court appearances scheduled and, once he has wound his way through the criminal justice system, he could be behind bars for the rest of his life. Which, of course, is as it should be. While there are a lot of reasons that many people find the 26-year-old alleged assassin sympathetic, you can’t just gun a CEO down outside a hotel in Manhattan and face no consequences for it. And Mangione, who is, by all accounts, an extremely smart guy with an Ivy League education, should really have known better. He should have known that if he wanted to murder someone – and get away with it – there were far more socially acceptable ways of doing so.

Jeremi Sensky of the suburban Pittsburgh community of Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, was in New Orleans to ring in 2025 with relatives at the time the attack occurred, he told KDKA’s The Marty Griffin Show. Sensky was on Bourbon Street when he was hit by a US army veteran inspired by Islamic State in an intentional ramming that killed 14 people and wounded about 30 others.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/14/new-orleans-attack-wheelchair	2025-01-14T03:00:24-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c03cfc7b84b00c155b9c245ea0df6b332c0c9e3/22_0_1353_812/master/1353.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c0a3f1e88d1f8974f291ef1f9655e9a6
Special counsel says Trump would have been convicted over 2020 election | First Thing	Report says evidence ‘was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction’ had Trump not been re-elected. Plus, dangerous winds return to LA Good morning. Donald Trump would have been convicted of crimes over his failed attempt to cling to power in 2020 if he hadn’t won the presidential election in November: that’s the finding of Jack Smith, the special counsel who investigated him. Why didn’t the case go ahead? Smith acknowledged the justice department’s policy prohibiting the prosecution of a sitting president, a factor that ultimately led to the dropping of charges against Trump after his 2024 victory. The report also references a supreme court ruling expanding presidential immunity, which complicated the case, and Trump’s repeated legal attacks, which took up time and resources to fight. How did Trump respond? In a social media post, Trump called the special counsel a -lamebrain prosecutor-. What do we know about the terms of the potential deal? Reuters reports that negotiations are advanced over releasing 33 of 98 hostages still in Gaza in the first stage of the deal, citing an Israeli official. In return, Israel will free 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, according to the Palestinian source close to the talks, who said the first phase would last for 60 days. While negotiators meet, is the war still raging? Yes. Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 18 people overnight, including six women and four children, health officials said, and Gaza’s civil defence agency reported that a wave of Israeli airstrikes killed more than 50 people in the Palestinian territory’s main city on Monday.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/14/first-thing-special-counsel-jack-smith-trump-convicted-2020-election	2025-01-14T02:52:05-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90d54c23d0e29b77c4957032c2727c8e0c47e140/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fc8ffc19667653282a6a6812caafa9fc
LA fires live: Southern California braced for ‘extremely critical fire conditions’ as life threatening winds pick up pace	With fire weather expected to continue until at least Wednesday, officials have pre-deployed firefighters across surrounding counties Additional water tankers and scores of firefighters have arrived at the Los Angeles area ahead of fierce winds that were forecast to return and threaten the progress made so far on two massive infernos that have destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 24 people. Three wildfires are currently burning in Los Angeles county. They are: The Palisades fire, at 23,713 acres and 14% containment. The Eaton fire, at 14,117 acres and 33% containment. The Hurst fire, at 799 acres and 97% containment. At least 24 people have died, and relatives have begun identifying their loved ones as they return to their homes or are notified by local officials. The fires have destroyed more than 12,000 structures and may be the costliest disaster in US history, according to initial estimates of damage and economic losses exceeding $250bn from AccuWeather. With fire weather expected to continue in the Los Angeles area through Wednesday, state and city officials have pre-deployed firefighters across LA and surrounding counties. House speaker Mike Johnson said he believes there should be conditions on disaster aid to California, citing -state and local leaders [who] were derelict in their duties-. Donald Trump is in talks to visit Los Angeles to survey the damage wrought by wildfires over the past week, CNN reported. The visit could occur as early as next week, but no details have been finalized. Altadena residents have filed three lawsuits against Southern California Edison, alleging that the utility is responsible for the Eaton fire. The lawsuits cite evidence that the fire began under a transmission tower and reference the utility’s role in other wildfires. However, no official cause for the fire has yet been determined. California governor Gavin Newsom has called on the state’s legislature to approve $2.5bn in additional funding to aid -response and initial recovery efforts for Los Angeles-. To do so, the governor expanded the special legislative session he’d called for the state in November, designed to prepare for Donald Trump’s inauguration. The firefighting plane that was grounded after sustaining damage from a drone has been repaired and will return to firefighting duty Tuesday, pending FAA approval, said LA county fire chief Anthony Marrone.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/14/la-california-fires-los-angeles-live-wildfire-map-warning-evacuation-latest-news	2025-01-14T02:38:17-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27e1ea77b9bc95d4b07c39817e39422a6dd5eff8/0_388_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=56379e328f0c0881fac3c2b397bc428d
Man in Brazil wrongly charged for 62 crimes after police use flawed photo ID	Police relied on showing photo of Paulo Alberto da Silva Costa, wrongly jailed for years, to victims to identify him as an alleged perpetrator Paulo Alberto da Silva Costa was having a regular day at work as a doorman in Rio de Janeiro when he was arrested in 2020. It was only then that he learned he was a suspect in 62 crimes: almost all were thefts, but there were also two homicide charges. Costa spent three years behind bars before Brazil’s supreme court recognised that it had all been a mistake. There was one common element: every case relied solely on the fact that a witness or victim had been shown a photograph of Costa, and identified him as the alleged perpetrator.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/14/brazil-man-wrongly-charged-photo-identification	2025-01-14T02:00:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2c45bfaab30a46b1fe15064df1c557c4ecbad95/0_0_2999_1800/master/2999.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9beb40f8bbbf32797ede7c3c3bbbda54

Rachel Reeves told it would be ‘politically suicidal’ to impose further cuts as economy falters – UK politics live	John McDonnell says more cuts would be ‘a disaster for the country’ and steer voters towards Reform Good morning. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is back from her trip to China and, according to Politico, she will make a statement in the Commons. This will allow her to address the criticism she has been facing about the rise in government borrowing costs, and what this means for her spending plans. Reading some of the Tory papers this morning you would think she is on the point of being sacked. This is more partisan wishful-thinking than objective truth-telling, but Reeves is is definitely in some difficulty, because she promised growth and events are not going as planned. As Pippa Crerar and Jessica Elgot report, with the rise in borrowing costs putting the government at risk of breaking its fiscal rules, the Treasury is looking at potential cuts to balance the books. There is obviously a problem. There’s turbulence in the international markets, and we’ve just got to see those through. And the way you do that is – you don’t turn to cuts, certainly, because not only will that … be politically suicidal, that would undermine the political support upon which Labour got elected. There are two groups of people who make judgments on an incoming government. One is the international markets, the money markets, of course. But actually the most important people are the electorate and I think what has to happen here is the electorate have to be protected. You should tax the grotesque inequality that we have within our society – 16 million living in poverty, and yet at the same time,we’ve now created in our society 165 billionaires. And on the last calculation I saw, in the two years from 2020 to 2022, they made an additional £15onbn of wealth. I think you have to look at redistribution.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/14/keir-starmer-rachel-reeves-labour-kemi-badenoch-david-lammy-latest-politics-live-news	2025-01-14T01:24:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f1b704e3d0273aad54ab9f2035079aa98d888f8/0_88_3872_2323/master/3872.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5e635f2e576678347e80c699428d74c4

Israel-Gaza war live: Hopes rise for ceasefire and hostage release deal despite Israeli strikes in Gaza	Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip killed at least 18 people overnight as Israel and Hamas appeared to be coming closer to a ceasefire deal Welcome to our live coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. It is nearly 10.30am in Gaza City and Jerusalem. Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip killed at least 18 people overnight, including six women and four children, health officials said, as Israel and Hamas appeared to be coming closer to a ceasefire deal to end the 15-month war and release dozens of hostages. Gaza’s civil defence agency reported that a wave of Israeli airstrikes killed more than 50 people in the Palestinian territory’s main city on Monday. Agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said the strikes pounded Gaza City throughout the day, hitting -schools, homes and even gatherings of people-. -There is no room in hospitals to receive the wounded,- Bassal told AFP. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not immediately comment on the claims. The IDF said five soldiers had been killed in fighting in northern Gaza, bringing to nine the number of its troops killed since Saturday. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels meanwhile fired a missile at central Israel, setting off sirens and sending people fleeing to shelters without causing any casualties. Police said Tuesday several homes were damaged outside Jerusalem and released a photo of a missile casing that had crashed into a roof. An Israeli lawyer has filed submissions to the international criminal court (ICC) alleging incitement to genocide against Palestinians by eight Israeli officials, including President Isaac Herzog and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, said at least five people were killed in the bombing of the Salah al-Din school in Gaza City, which was housing displaced Palestinian people. At least 46,584 Palestinian people have been killed and 109,731 injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in its latest update.

Tuesday briefing: What Ukraine might gain from two North Korean captives	In today’s newsletter: Kyiv’s interrogation footage of captured North Korean soldiers leads to questions about what it might do with the soldiers – and what the PoWs might do for them Good morning. In a grinding war where significant changes at the front are hard to discern, a video released by Ukraine on Sunday is a rare point of focus: it featured two North Korean soldiers, answering questions from their Ukrainian captors, and weighing the circumstances of their presence in a conflict thousands of miles from home. The video is, perhaps, not militarily significant. But it is a unique insight into one of the more extraordinary aspects of a conflict that has drawn in actors from all over the world, and is a crucible in which every participant is learning how modern wars are fought. Economy | Rachel Reeves will remain as chancellor until the next general election, Keir Starmer has insisted, as he warned the Treasury would be -ruthless- over public spending cuts to help meet the government’s fiscal rules. Gaza | Joe Biden has said his administration is on the brink of sealing a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas that could pause the war after more than 14 months of fighting. Biden administration officials have said they believe the deal may be concluded before Donald Trump’s inauguration next week. US politics | Donald Trump would have been convicted of crimes over his failed attempt to cling to power in 2020 if he had not won the presidential election in 2024, according to the special counsel who investigated him. Jack Smith’s report detailing his team’s findings about Trump’s efforts to subvert democracy was released early on Tuesday.

PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are used in everything from cosmetics to nonstick pans but are almost indestructible without human intervention. [It is] unclear if North Korea will even claim the two captured soldiers as their own, given Moscow and Pyongyang’s refusal to officially admit that North Korean forces have been deployed to Russia. At the same time, Russia could claim them as their own and hand them over to North Korea after they are traded with Ukrainian PoWs.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/14/tuesday-briefing-what-ukraine-might-gain-from-its-north-korean-captives	2025-01-13T22:48:28-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25743ee3fc336db21bb5bff536ac2d46018d534e/519_516_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=12580eb72feec06e1129248d06681ecd

While the focus is understandably on avoiding the flames, another immediate danger lurks across the county and beyond, one more difficult to escape: smoke. The most dangerous component of wildfire smoke is fine particle pollution, also known as PM2.5 or soot. These tiny particles, smaller than one 20th the width of a human hair, can, if inhaled, become embedded in the bloodstream and lungs. It is estimated that about one-third of all particulate matter pollution in the US now comes from wildfire smoke.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/13/los-angeles-wildfires-smoke-exposures	2025-01-13T14:16:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e11173d30a3a548e43b7610a6084197d35f19692/0_122_6443_3866/master/6443.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40daa767f2bc6d83707a67daf5b8ce4b

JD Vance walks back Trump’s pledge to pardon January 6 protesters on day one – US politics live	Incoming vice-president says people who ‘committed violence’ shouldn’t be pardoned as surveys suggest blanket pardons would be unpopular with Americans Good morning, US politics blog readers. We’re one week out from Donald Trump’s inauguration as president, a day on which he has vowed to act like a dictator, and among the long list of things he has promised to do one his first day in office is pardon people convicted or accused of crimes over the January 6 insurrection. The few surveys done of the issue have indicated that a blanket pardon would be unpopular with Americans, and in an interview on Sunday, JD Vance seemed to walk back his boss’s pledge. -If you protested peacefully on January 6th … you should be pardoned-, the incoming vice-president told Fox News. -If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn’t be pardoned, and there’s a little bit of a gray area there, but we’re very much committed to seeing the equal administration of law.- For all the norms he has shattered, Trump would be far from the first American president to make big promises on the campaign trail then find reason not to keep them once he gets the job. We’ll find out what his supporters think of Vance’s comments as the day goes on. Confirmation hearings begin this week for Trump’s cabinet nominees, with the first scheduled for Tuesday. Some nominees, such as senator Marco Rubio to lead the state department, are expected to be approved with little tension. But others, think Pete Hegseth as defense secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr as secretary of health and human services and Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, will spark fights with Democrats. Joe Biden is looking to make the most of his final week as president, beginning with a speech today at 2pm ET from the state department about his foreign policy legacy. Los Angeles firefighters continue to combat blazes in and around the city, amid fears that another bout of gusty and hot weather could fuel more outbreaks.

‘Particularly dangerous’ wildfire weather returns to California and could linger for months, say experts	Forecasters say there won’t be winds as strong as last week’s record-setting gusts, but LA’s dry season will get worse When it comes to forecasting the conditions for catastrophic California wildfires, there are two main ingredients: fuels (think grasses, shrubs, trees – basically anything that’s available for fires to burn) and winds. When analyzing fuels, forecasters look mainly at the levels of drought, along with any recent rains that may help diminish the effect of longer-term drought. With winds, in southern California at least, it’s all about anticipating the Santa Anas – the fierce winds that blow offshore, from the deserts to the coast, bringing loads of dry air with them.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/13/california-wildfire-weather-conditions-forecast	2025-01-13T03:00:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83ce2e71dae054ed77a312a6fc6657edb6c39592/61_0_4881_2929/master/4881.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7852bfe309b81e20b047e966a9d3ef5a

Starmer claims AI could led to ‘golden age of public service reform’, even making services ‘feel more human’ – UK politics live	Government to publish AI opportunities action plan amid backdrop of economic difficulties in UK Good morning. Today the government wants to talk about AI (artificial intelligence). It is due to publish its AI opportunities action plan this morning, Keir Starmer is giving a speech on the topic, and Peter Kyle, the science secretary, is giving a statement to MPs later. The main elements have already been well trailed. Here is the Department for Science’s overnight news release, and here is a story by Robert Booth summing it all up. As usual, though, what the government wants to talk about and what it will end up being forced to talk about are not the same. The macro story that matters most in UK politics at the moment is the rise in UK government borrowing costs (largely driven by global economic developments, and the prospect of what Donald Trump will do when he becomes US president next week), and whether this will lead to fresh spending cuts in the spring. On the business live blog, Julia Kollewe says UK bond yields (borrowing costs) are marginally up again this morning.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/13/keir-starmer-labour-ai-yvette-cooper-tulip-siddiq-latest-politics-news-live	2025-01-13T01:23:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/840d45084eef6a8324b9d6fe2f3351625b814b0b/0_67_3214_1930/master/3214.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=daa6e8378b14630937da06728fc6946f

Court ruling on Belgium’s conduct in colonial Africa hailed as turning point	Verdict of crimes against humanity for kidnap of mixed-race children could pave way for wider justice, activists say A historic court ruling that found Belgium guilty of crimes against humanity during its colonial rule of central Africa has been hailed as a turning point that could pave the way for compensation and other forms of justice.

Each was awarded €50,000 (£42,000) in damages.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/12/court-ruling-crimes-against-humanity-belgium-colonial-africa-hailed-turning-point	2025-01-12T06:01:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70364647ca15d3c05328eaa353bfe0b0582679ec/0_456_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a6120f4d4531ff91b67e24fe640651ce

Tories back Badenoch’s ‘risky’ call for grooming gangs inquiry	Keir Starmer accuses opposition leader of spending ‘a lot of time on social media over Christmas’ When Kemi Badenoch used prime minister’s questions this week to echo Elon Musk’s demands for a new inquiry into sexual grooming gangs, the MPs behind her were trying to interpret the intentions of their fledgling leader. Was it a long-held view? A short-term move to wrong-foot Labour or appeal to Reform voters? A sign she was adopting a more radical politics? There was one point, however, that seemed to unite those with differing theories about their leader’s motives. Her decision to warn Keir Starmer that refusing a fresh inquiry could prompt speculation about a -cover-up- was the kind of political gamble they had expected her to be willing to take.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/12/tories-back-badenochs-risky-call-for-grooming-gangs-inquiry	2025-01-11T22:00:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38d25e0a70cfb4643b95f571b4972d7d0f321d80/0_127_7318_4391/master/7318.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f405cc2505c6a0f1160e23a98746b2fe

Silicon Valley’s tycoons are bending the knee to Trump | Blake Montgomery	In 2017, Silicon Valley rebuked Trump’s travel ban. Today, it has reversed course and is bending over backwards with displays of deference to Trump On 28 January 2017, I rushed to the San Francisco international airport (SFO). Like elsewhere in the US that night, demonstrations were growing against a travel ban Donald Trump had issued against visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries. The night was chillier than normal, and I had not brought an adequate jacket. Luckily, the train to the airport was warm, full to the brim with jittery, talkative protesters. The airport itself was a rowdy scene: cabs and Ubers stalled as angry protesters blocked the roads, meters still running; demonstrators in hijabs prayed on their protest signs in baggage claim as others shouted at any arriving flyer coming for their luggage. Trump was the most outrageous man in America then, his election a shock to a wide swath of the world. After a few hours, whispers of a $150bn face floated through the crowd: Sergey Brin, creator and co-founder of Google, was there. At the time, he was the president of Google’s parent company Alphabet, which also owns YouTube. The effect was thrilling: one of the richest and most powerful men in the world was registering his discontent with Trump by bodily joining a protest against him. Brin, a native of Moscow who arrived in the US at the age of six, said he came to SFO that night -because I’m a refugee-. It was a personal rebuke of Trump, the consummate nativist.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/11/trump-silicon-valley	2025-01-11T05:00:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad0153854745673e2dce46a20cefa32880506b81/0_203_3071_1844/master/3071.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=95226bc01dd29236a9c07c20d61c0535

California fires live: progress made against some LA blazes but thickening smoke prompts ‘health emergency’	Palisades and Eaton fires start coming under control as fierce winds ease but forecasters predict another red flag warning for Monday Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the California wildfires that have devastated six neighborhoods of Los Angeles county, killed at least 11 people and damaged or destroyed more than 12,000 structures. Firefighters finally started gaining control over two major wildfires on the eastern and western flanks of Los Angeles on Friday as fierce winds that supercharged the fires for days eased. The Palisades fire, at 21,317 acres and 8% containment The Eaton fire, at 13,690 acres and 3% containment The Kenneth fire, at 1,052 acres and 50% containment The Hurst fire, at 771 acres and 37% containment The Lidia fire, at 395 acres and 98% containment The Archer fire, at 19 acres and 0% containment Six deaths have been confirmed in the Eaton fire and five in the Palisades. As family members have been alerted to the loss of their loved ones, six of the victims have been publicly identified. Law enforcement officials expect the death toll to rise once weather and fire conditions allow cadaver dogs and detectives into the burn zones. Conditions in the Los Angeles area were forecast to improve through the weekend, with sustained winds slowing to about 20mph (32km/h), gusting between 35-50mph, according to the National Weather Service, a respite from recent wind gusts of 80mph. -It’s not as gusty, so that should help firefighters,- NWS meteorologist Allison Santorelli said, adding that conditions were still critical with low humidity and dry vegetation. Forecasters predicted another red flag warning would be issued for Monday. Fire chief Kristin Crowley criticised city officials over water supply issues and budget cuts that she says hindered her department’s ability to fight the Palisades fire. The water supply has become a focal point, with California governor Gavin Newsom calling for an investigation into the shortage. Newsom has invited Donald Trump to visit the state and tour the the LA wildfires’ devastation. Trump visited the state six years ago in the wake of the Camp fire, the most destructive fire in California history, which hit the town of Paradise. The state of California issued a one-year moratorium preventing insurance companies from canceling or refusing to renew home policies in zip codes impacted by the Palisades and Eaton fires. Fire agencies are investigating whether Southern California Edison’s utility infrastructure sparked a brush fire that is still burning in a Los Angeles suburb, SCE said on Friday, adding no determination has been made. SCE, a unit of US utility Edison International, said in a filing to its regulators that a downed conductor was discovered at a tower associated with its Eagle Rock – Sylmar 220 kV circuit. -SCE does not know whether the damage observed occurred before or after the start of the fire,- it said.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/11/california-fires-la-fires-live-updates-latest-news	2025-01-10T23:16:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80c17a89ee8f6bb37c80659a71ead40b9cf18c8b/0_274_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bcc8f27f6817807d5c7e350012d223d7

Kenya court rules that criminalising attempted suicide is unconstitutional	The judgment has been welcomed as an important shift in perceptions by human rights and mental health groups A Kenyan judge has declared as unconstitutional sections of the country’s laws that criminalise attempted suicide. In a landmark ruling on Thursday, Judge Lawrence Mugambi of the country’s high court stated that section 226 of the penal code contradicts the constitution by punishing those with mental health issues over which they may have little or no control. While the constitution says in article 43 that a person has the right to the -highest attainable standard of health-, criminal law states that -any person who attempts to kill himself is guilty of a misdemeanour and is subject to imprisonment of up to two years, a fine, or both-, with the minimum age of prosecution for the offence set at eight years old.	https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jan/10/kenya-court-rules-that-criminalising-attempted-suicide-is-unconstitutional	2025-01-10T03:32:46-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f151e2de9768b827721edcfc8cbc805ae4abde5/0_0_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=30da1b56d6237d0798bcd1bfb92d5e2d

Labour has worked very hard to ‘restore economic credibility’, minister says – UK politics live	Culture secretary Lisa Nandy defends chancellor amid economic turbulence Culture secretary Lisa Nandy has said she believes that the Labour government is still -on track- with its ambition for the UK to be -the fastest growing economy in Europe.- Conceding that the budget decision to increase national insurance contributions on employers was -a difficult one for many companies-, she told listeners of the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the government was not going back to the -bad old days- of Tory budgets. She said: We inherited an economy where it was hard to see who had confidence, both to invest, and particularly for consumers to be able to feel that they could spend, given the huge fluctuations that we’d seen, particularly after the Liz Truss/Kwasi Kwarteng mini-budget. The chancellor has been absolutely clear that we are not going back to those bad old days. We have had two interest rate cuts since she became chancellor, and we have worked very hard to restore economic credibility. We are not only confident that we’re on track, but the OECD is confident that we’re on track to become the fastest growing economy in Europe.

US supreme court to hear arguments in TikTok ban-or-sale case	Latest battle over whether to ban the app will force justices to weigh importance of security with freedom of speech The US supreme court will hear oral arguments over the fate of TikTok on Friday. It’s the latest battle in the long war over whether to ban the tremendously popular social media app in the US – and will force the justices to weigh the importance of national security with the freedom of speech. TikTok and its parent company, Chinese-based ByteDance, asked the supreme court to review the case after a lower court ruled last month to uphold a law to ban the app in the US. That ban is scheduled to go into effect on 19 January, unless ByteDance sells TikTok’s assets to a non-Chinese company. While ByteDance has the option to divest, it claimed in a legal filing that divestiture -is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally-.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/10/us-supreme-court-tiktok-ban-sale-bill	2025-01-10T00:57:21-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f14922a7766f55097b07031906e4c6a7d2bbb37e/1287_854_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5e816d41bd3b57dea1c1c6274e43688c

LA fires live updates: at least seven deaths as California wildfires rage and crews battle new fire	Palisades, Kenneth, Eaton fires remain uncontrolled as Los Angeles officials say ‘historic winds’ and extensive droughts have created the ‘perfect storm’ Hello, and welcome to our live coverage of the wildfires in California, where some of the worst blazes in the region’s history have ravaged homes and reduced entire neighbourhoods to ash. I’m Petra Stock. It’s approaching 8pm in Los Angeles and here is a recap of what you need to know. The Palisades fire, at 19,978 acres and 6% containment The Eaton fire, at 13,690 acres and 0% containment The Kenneth fire, at 960 acres and 0% containment The Hurst fire, at 671 acres and 10% containment The Lidia fire, at 348 acres and 60% containment Seven people have died, and more than 10,000 structures have burned, in the Palisades and Eaton fires. Five deaths have been confirmed in the Eaton fire and two in the Palisades. The Palisades fire, which had remained 0% contained since it broke out Tuesday, was 6% contained by 6pm Thursday. A new fire, now called the Kenneth fire, sparked around 3:34pm and quickly ballooned to 960 acres. President Joe Biden has announced that the federal government would pay for 100% of the firefighting needs for the next 180 days. Law enforcement officials are working to issue a curfew for affected burn zones in Los Angeles, in order to combat looting, though it is unclear when it will go into effect. Vice-president Kamala Harris canceled a trip to Singapore, Bahrain and Germany shortly after President Biden canceled a trip to Italy in order to more closely monitor the fires. The California prison system has now deployed nearly 800 incarcerated firefighters to fight the devastating blazes.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/10/la-fires-live-updates-california-los-angeles-wildfires-fire-map-latest-news	2025-01-09T19:36:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91a838607c4536aa6b71519444bdc53cae9d3f72/0_3_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=50d72be040640e281f7eb9279c77eb4b

Immigration groups ‘doing everything we can’ amid Trump deportation threat	As the incoming president pledges a crackdown, activist groups anticipating migrant raids are preparing to resist Almost immediately after Donald Trump took office in 2017, he directed his administration to begin rounding up and deporting immigrants living in the country without authorization. He implemented a travel ban that caused chaos at airports, leaving families, students and scholars stranded. He also attempted to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program, which shields hundreds of thousands of people brought to the country as children from deportation and imposed a -zero-tolerance- at the US-Mexico border that led to the separation of thousands of families. Many immigration advocates fear that the next four years could be even worse.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/09/trump-border-deportation-threat	2025-01-09T04:00:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ce33c9f15d654b145a3106ccaeb54ffc3ce3f43/0_143_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1934762323680d9d9b89c6c8f15cd9fa
Five people killed as firefighters struggle to contain LA blazes | First Thing	Fires have consumed area the size of San Francisco.

What’s the Trump-Netanyahu relationship like? Historically it has been one of mutual benefit, with Trump handing Netanyahu diplomatic wins such as recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights in 2019. But he then blasted Netanyahu for congratulating Biden for winning the 2020 election, saying -fuck him-.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/09/first-thing-five-people-killed-firefighters-struggle-la-blazes	2025-01-09T03:27:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/440e052687c18f1bbd07cfc4a9bfcd5ce1b63ca6/0_546_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7d5558f65e70a79653183e17037373da

David Lammy says Trump’s rhetoric can be ‘destabilising’ but threat to invade Greenland won’t happen – UK politics live	Foreign secretary says Trump’s comments should be understood as reflection of his concerns about Arctic security Good morning. For the first time in six months, David Lammy, the foreign secretary, was put up by No 10 to do the morning broadcast interview round – ahead of a speech he is giving later. At PMQs yesterday, perhaps surprisingly, Keir Starmer was not asked about Donald Trump’s suggestion that he might invade Greenland, an autonomous territory that belongs to Denmark. The French and German governments have both condemned Trump’s comments. But, in an interview with the Today programme, Lammy was rather more diplomatic. Lammy said that, although Trump’s language could be -destabilising-, he did not always do what he threatened. Asked about Trump’s comments, Lammy said: I think that we know from Donald Trump’s first term that the intensity of his rhetoric, and the unpredictability sometimes of what he says, can be destabilising. He did it with Nato. But in fact, in practice, he sent more troops to Europe under his administration. He sent the first Javelins [anti-tank weapons] and weapons to Ukraine under his administration. Lammy said that Trump would not use military force to seize Greenland – despite suggesting he might. Asked if the UK should be following France and Germany in saying this would be unacceptable, Lammy replied: Let’s be serious … It’s not going to happen because no Nato allies have gone to war since the birth of Nato which Ernest Bevin, my great predecessor, was part of. Lammy said Trump’s comments should be understood as reflection of his concerns about Arctic security. He explained: Here, I suspect on Greenland, what he’s targeting is his concerns about Russia and China in the Arctic, his concerns about national economic security. He recognises, I’m sure, that in the end, Greenland today is a Kingdom of Denmark. There is a debate in Greenland about their own self determination. But behind it, I think, are his concerns about the Arctic. Of course, the US has troops and a base on Greenland. So it has got a stake in that Arctic region.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/09/uk-politics-labour-conservatives-david-lammy-trump-greenland-latest-updates	2025-01-09T01:13:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22c61051e995e1dc39b88c1bf75d8429f40446ab/98_492_4419_2652/master/4419.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=23e73b51fa9dbc1a4a372ae644056b11

Amber alerts have been extended and will now run until 12 January, meaning a rise in deaths is likely, the agency said. Dr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at the UKHSA, said: We are extending the duration of our cold health alert, since the Met Office are forecasting that the low temperatures we are seeing will continue further into this week, with snow and icy conditions likely to persist.

California fires live: Los Angeles fighting largest blaze in its history amid water and firefighting shortages	Palisades fire grows to more than 15,000 acres as Eaton and Hurst fires also gain in size; Biden directs DoD to deploy extra firefighters to tackle flames About 1.5 million residents are without power in southern California, with nearly a million of them in Los Angeles County, according to PowerOutage.us, as wildfires continue to rage across the region. The Palisades fire, which is the most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles’ history, has increased in size yet again – now encompassing 15,832 acres. At least two people were killed in the Eaton fire, north of Pasadena which has grown to 10,600 acres and has destroyed more than 100 structures. There have also been -a number of significant injuries-, fire officials said, and -tens of thousands of homes- are affected. About 32,500 residents were under evacuation orders, a drop from the more than 50,000 residents evacuated overnight. The Palisades fire, west of Los Angeles, has grown to 11,802 acres and destroyed more than 1,000 structures, making it the most destructive fire in the city’s history. About 37,000 residents are under evacuation orders. The Hurst fire, in the San Fernando Valley, is close to 500 acres after erupting on Tuesday night. More than 3,000 residents have been ordered to evacuate the area in Sylmar. All Los Angeles fire department air operations in the Palisades have resumed after being grounded due to extreme weather conditions. LAFD helicopters are back to dropping water and hundreds of firefighters continue to be on the scene to help respond to the Palisades fire and Hurst fire, said LA’s mayor, Karen Bass. More than 400,000 power customers were without power, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us. Another 440,000 customers could face similar shutoffs depending on weather conditions. Officials are urging residents across the region to conserve water so there is enough for firefighters to use. Demand was so high that three tanks emptied by Wednesday morning, causing some fire hydrants to dry out. California governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on Tuesday. President Joe Biden warned the recovery -is going to take time- as he attended a briefing with Newsom at a Santa Monica fire station. President-elect Donald Trump blamed Newsom’s environmental policies for the fires.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/08/california-los-angeles-fires-live-updates	2025-01-08T13:58:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea29802fba69f1cf43c2ff2d7beae28d6d1dff47/0_368_5561_3339/master/5561.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d9f68d22674127ce7c46e1ba3c13387b

Biden may preemptively pardon Liz Cheney, Anthony Fauci, after Trump’s threats of revenge – US politics live	Biden confirms he may still opt to protect Trump’s enemies from prosecution, while Trump scrambles to halt sentencing in criminal business fraud case Good morning, US politics blog readers. Joe Biden is in his final days in office, and still has a few pieces of unfinished business to deal with before he hands power to Donald Trump on 20 January. One of them is deciding whether to issue preemptive pardons to political enemies of the incoming president, such as former congresswoman Liz Cheney or Anthony Fauci, who spearheaded the fight against Covid-19 in Trump’s first term. In an interview with USA Today published today – a rare, final sit-down interview by a president who spent much of his term avoiding the press – Biden confirmed he may still opt to protect Trump’s enemies from prosecution, and signaled he would decide based on who the president-elect appoints to top roles in his administration. Meanwhile, Trump is scrambling to halt the sentencing in his criminal business fraud case that is scheduled to take place in a Manhattan court on Friday. Reuters reports that his attorneys have asked the US supreme court to intervene to pause the proceedings, though the New York judge presiding over the case has signaled he is unlikely to sentence the president-elect to jail time. We will let you if the nation’s highest court responds. Trump will this evening trek to Capitol Hill for a strategy meeting with the Republican senators tasked with enacting his administration’s priorities, ranging from mass deportations to extending tax cuts enacted during his first term. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the rightwing Georgia congresswoman, says she will introduce legislation to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the -Gulf of America-, as Trump proposed at a rambling press conference yesterday.

Malawi sees influx of refugees from post-election violence in Mozambique	Marauding gangs and political unrest since October’s polls have driven thousands of Mozambicans across the border into Malawi, despite its drought, food and fuel shortages On a sunny Saturday afternoon, Manase Madia, 50, shows his Mozambican identity card. Once a sign of pride, he does not know what to believe in any more. Over the past few weeks he has seen houses being burned down, and shops and businesses looted, including his own. He now fears for his family, which has scattered in fear. At a community ground where officials are processing new arrivals before being transferred to a shelter, Madia is one of about 13,000 people who have crossed into Malawi in the past two months, seeking refuge from post-election violence in Mozambique. The arrival of the refugees, albeit in smaller numbers, is reminiscent for people here of the civil war when almost a million Mozambicans sought refuge in the neighbouring southern African nation in the 1980s and early 1990s.	https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jan/08/malawi-sees-influx-of-refugees-from-post-election-violence-in-mozambique	2025-01-08T03:02:59-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80d7b27e8a4d387686361b8e8cc8c41f73312040/422_0_1875_1125/master/1875.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1b523995f15bee171cf50963f7f2e5b4

Extreme UV radiation belts down throughout the day and winds whip at you in the afternoon.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/08/how-missing-hiker-survived-in-kosciuszko-national-park	2025-01-08T01:58:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78b3ff572ebd26422b99b0adc39f4a697ab7cb62/399_274_2139_1284/master/2139.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d87ae4f23898b6e833ec1da52888dc48
Top Tory claims Elon Musk ‘may have saved humanity’ as Starmer attacks Badenoch over child safety – UK politics live	Prime minister says if Tories vote for amendment on children’s wellbeing bill, it will show ‘they are more interested in retweets than children’s safety’ as shadow business secretary praises Musk Good morning. Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch will be in the Commons today for the first PMQs of 2025 and the Tory calls for national inquiry into grooming gangs will continue to be near the top of the news agenda. That is because Badenoch is pushing for a vote on the children’s wellbeing and schools bill that would block the legislation and call on the government to set up an inquiry instead. The inquiry element is a procedural red herring because the Conservatives would have voted against the bill anyway. But, if the Speaker does allow a vote on the Tory reasoned amendment, Badenoch will be able to launch a social media campaign accusing Labour of voting against a grooming gang inquiry. The Conservatives are opposed to the bill primarily because it will restrict some of the freedoms enjoyed by academies. But the legislation also contains safeguarding measures that have widespread support, and Starmer has given an interview to the Daily Mirror saying that, if the Tories vote for their amendment, it will show they are more interested in retweets than children’s safety. He told the paper: I would implore any right-thinking Tory MP to vote for the bill because [the Conservative reasoned amendment] would kill the bill, this would kill the legislation. It would kill the provisions for a unique identifying number that will stop children falling through the cracks … No MP should be voting down children’s safeguarding measures. It’s shocking they are even thinking about this as a tactic. It’s the elevation of the desire for retweets over any real interest in the safeguarding of children. The @elonmusk purchase of X may have saved humanity. With X becoming a true freedom of speech platform, the common ground of public opinion is no longer determined by a left-leaning elite.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/08/conservatives-elon-musk-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-child-safety-pmqs-uk-politics-latest-updates	2025-01-08T01:41:29-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e40c507446dd3da2bfcb442b9e4d40b96ddd0146/0_246_7536_4522/master/7536.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6408a15555e5a791a04e82278b6fb357

UK weather live: Met Office weather warning for snow in southern England comes into force	Warnings issued on Tuesday for snow and ice in the Midlands, north Wales, north-west of England, north and west of Scotland and Northern Ireland remain in place Good morning and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the UK’s freezing weather. A fresh weather warning is set to come into force as it is revealed that 300 properties have flooded across England since New Year’s Eve, reports the PA news agency. Dozens of people have been rescued by firefighters across Leicestershire since Monday, Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service said. Homeowners on Belton Road in Loughborough were stranded on the first floor of their semi-detached houses on Tuesday after rising water from the nearby Grand Union canal flooded the street. Patients have been urged to attend A&amp;E alone as NHS hospitals grapple with high demand amid rising flu cases. Several NHS trusts declared critical incidents due to -exceptionally high demands- in emergency departments. Hundreds of schools were closed across the UK on Tuesday, with road and rail links blocked. Manchester, Bristol and Liverpool John Lennon airports were forced to suspend flights because of the conditions. The RAC said Monday was the busiest day for breakdowns this winter. Rod Dennis, RAC spokesperson said: -Anyone unfortunate enough to break down should expect a longer wait than normal this week. It’s therefore more important than ever that drivers ensure they have an emergency breakdown kit in the boot.-	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2025/jan/08/uk-weather-met-office-yellow-weather-warning-snow-ice-flooding-latest-updates	2025-01-08T00:42:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d86551da2daf247dc7c91bb974fa32388146301/0_163_5071_3043/master/5071.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f8a8578b4fe7853f2480e764a5efd9b0
Wednesday briefing: What Elon Musk’s focus on grooming gangs reveals about alt-right online discourse	In today’s newsletter: The owner of X, who previously said ‘civil war is inevitable’ in Britain, has stoked online unrest with incendiary comments about the UK Good morning. What is a news story in the UK? Whatever Elon Musk says it is. That is the conclusion you might draw, anyway, from the influence of the billionaire Trump adviser’s posts on X claiming that -a quarter-million little girls were – still are – being systematically raped by migrant gangs in Britain-, and demanding a new public inquiry into historic child sexual exploitation in Oldham, Rotherham, Rochdale and elsewhere. There is no reliable basis for the quarter-million figure. In any case, Prof Alexis Jay, the chair of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse in England and Wales that looked extensively at grooming gang scandals and published a series of recommendations in 2022, said yesterday that -we’ve had enough of inquiries, consultations and discussions-, and urged the government to instead implement more of her proposals. But the political energy is still around the idea of a new inquiry as some sort of panacea, and the Conservatives will try to force a vote on one in parliament today. Social media | Meta will get rid of factcheckers, -dramatically reduce the amount of censorship- and recommend more political content on Facebook and Instagram, founder Mark Zuckerberg has said. The suite of changes was met with dismay by critics, who described them as -a full bending of the knee to Trump-. British army | Afghans who were killed by members of the SAS in Afghanistan were described dismissively as having been -flat packed-, according to a former member of the elite force’s sister unit. The soldier, known only as N1799, was giving evidence to an inquiry into the deaths of 80 civilians in Helmand province. California | A fast-moving wildfire erupted in Los Angeles on Tuesday, quickly consuming nearly 3,000 acres and destroying homes in an affluent community along the Pacific Ocean. Amid a significant windstorm across much of southern California, a second unrelated blaze also forced evacuations in a different part of Los Angeles. France | Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of France’s far-right National Front party, who sent shock waves through the country when he made it to the second round of the presidential election in 2002, has died at 96. Drugs | Ketamine could be reclassified as a class A drug by the Home Office after illegal use reached record levels last year. Ministers are seeking -expert advice- on reclassification – it is currently a class B substance – after an estimated 299,000 people reported use of the drug in 2024.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/08/wednesday-briefing-what-elon-musks-focus-on-grooming-gangs-reveals-about-alt-right-online-discourse	2025-01-07T22:52:36-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e5573231a4bfc5fd11849cc4f48a2b5e07932c9/0_94_5665_3400/master/5665.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ac294ec52d863e7a55d44ee0a98d699f

The interim government fears the lifting of sanctions will be tied to excessive demands imposed by the west, with suspicion of the UN deeply embedded after what are seen as its failures during 14 years of civil war. Ahmed al-Sharaa, the country’s de facto leader, has told Gulf and western states that his group, Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), long ago transformed itself from a Salafi jihadi group in Idlib province to a technocratic force willing to accommodate all Syrians.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/08/un-influence-pluralist-syria-assad	2025-01-07T21:00:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33d03b5f120d0cf651c51a8c4cb35f1826c67e0c/25_0_1666_1000/master/1666.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3fc60db547bcf53cf9efe8e4dd0a353e

Environmental groups sue FDA over agency’s refusal to restrict phthalates	Agency has either ignored petitions or ruled against taking action against chemical that presents serious health risks A coalition of environmental groups has sued the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over the use of highly toxic phthalates in plastic food packaging because the chemicals have been found to leach at alarming rates and present a serious health risk, especially for developing children. The suit is the latest salvo in an ongoing eight-year battle in which advocates have pressured the FDA to ban the chemicals’ use in food packaging, but the agency has sided with industry that opposes the calls. Since 2016, the FDA has either illegally ignored petitions or rejected demands to revoke a 40-year-old authorization for the chemicals that is based on long-outdated science.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/07/fda-phthalates-plastic-lawsuit	2025-01-07T08:52:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54490647f3d0a86e55798bd00b0875101c6e6564/0_0_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a0a13a1a8828501554a5f0c41b48ee81

Trump moves to block report on election interference and classified documents cases – US politics live	President-elect’s lawyers ask attorney general to stop release of outgoing special counsel Jack Smith’s report Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump may be less than two weeks away from returning to the White House, but his lawyers are keeping busy with motions to frustrate the final developments in his lingering criminal cases. Yesterday, they asked New York judge Juan Merchan to delay the president-elect’s sentencing on the 34 felony business fraud charges he was convicted of last year, but their motion was denied and the hearing is expected to take place on Friday. The case, brought by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, was the only one of Trump’s four criminal indictments to go to trial before his election victory in November. His prosecution in Georgia for allegedly meddling in the state’s election result four years ago has stalled, likely permanently, while special counsel Jack Smith dropped the charges he brought against Trump for allegedly hiding classified documents, and plotting to overturn the 2020 election. However, justice department regulations mandate that Smith release a report at the end of his investigations, which could bring to light damaging evidence about Trump’s actions. Late yesterday, the president-elect’s attorneys asked outgoing attorney general Merrick Garland to prevent the report’s completion. We’ll let you know if Garland makes his response known today. Donald Trump Jr is scheduled to arrive in Greenland today, the massive island that his father has talked about the United States buying from Denmark. We’ll see how that visit goes. Jimmy Carter will lie in state at the US Capitol today, with Kamala Harris laying a wreath on his casket and eulogizing him at 4.30pm ET.

Congress certifies Trump’s election win amid high security measures | First Thing	Joe Biden urged Americans not to forget the Capitol attack. Plus, Trudeau to resign as Canadian prime minister Good morning. Congress certified Donald Trump’s presidential election victory yesterday in an event heavy with symbolism, four years to the day since he incited a violent mob in attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat. What were November’s final results? Trump won the electoral college by 312 to 226, and the popular vote by a margin of about 2.5m. What did Harris say yesterday? -I do believe very strongly that America’s democracy is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it,- she told reporters. -Otherwise, it is very fragile, and it will not be able to withstand moments of crisis. And today, America’s democracy stood.- The president, Joe Biden, wrote an op-ed urging Americans not to forget the Capitol attack. What do we know about the quake’s ferocity? The US Geological Survey said the earthquake was centred in the Tibet region at a depth of about 10km (6 miles). It measured the tremor at a magnitude of 7.1, while China recorded it as 6.8.

Child abuse inquiry chair attacks ‘politicisation’ of issue and says new investigation would delay reforms – UK politics live	Prof Alexis Jay says ‘many people, sometimes in a very uninformed way, have waded into the argument’ over whether a further inquiry was needed Good morning. Keir Starmer is basking in praise from liberal, progressive Britain today for the way he hit back at calls for a new inquiry into child sexual abuse scandals, and the way they are being driven by inflammatory and false claims by Elon Musk and other rightwingers on X. But Tory Britain has yet to be persuaded, and the rightwing papers are promoting the Conservative party’s (very dubious) claim that Starmer was smearing anyone opposed to child rape as far-right. This morning Prof Alexis Jay stepped into this argument. As the main chair of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA), the eight-year, all-encompassing inquiry into child sexual abuse in Britain, she has as much authority on this subject as anyone. Today she clearly came out against calls from Musk, Reform UK, the Tories and others for a new national inquiry focusing specifically on rape or grooming gangs. No, I don’t agree with that, in the sense of requiring further and more detailed national inquiries into child sexual exploitation. We have learned quite a lot from those reviews that have already been undertaken. I think that the time has passed for more inquiries. We’ve had enough of inquiries, consultations and discussions, and especially for those victims and survivors who’ve had the courage to come forward … They clearly want action, and we have set out what action is required, and people should just get on with it, locally and nationally. I would not attribute that to everyone, but I’ve certainly been very unhappy about the politicisation of child sexual exploitation and child sexual abuse in the way that many people, sometimes in a very uninformed way, have waded into the argument.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/07/child-abuse-grooming-gangs-elon-musk-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live-updates	2025-01-07T01:14:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/981d9fd4f58f51b0473b6ae2ce0d6ada5159dc1e/0_301_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=85d64bd110195bb1473385fe74ccc762

Tuesday briefing: How Britain has coped with an Arctic blast	In today’s newsletter: Widespread flooding, snow and power outages have left thousands of households and travellers facing the aftermath of a cold snap – with more disruption to come Good morning. British winters have grown markedly milder over the past century: analysis has shown that the average UK winter has gotten 1C warmer and 15% wetter in the last century. Last February was the warmest in recorded history. There have been fewer and fewer snow days and the Met Office found that ground frost periods are three weeks shorter compared to the 1970s. Canada | Justin Trudeau has said he will step down as Canada’s prime minister. His resignation throws open the doors to a fierce political battle to be the country’s next leader, with polls showing the Liberals losing badly to the official opposition Conservatives. Child sexual exploitation | Keir Starmer has condemned Elon Musk’s increasingly erratic attacks on the government, suggesting that his -lies and misinformation- on grooming gangs were amplifying the -poison- of the far right. Ministers meanwhile promised to implement a key demand of a 2022 child sex abuse inquiry so that professionals who do not report claims of abuse will be sanctioned. US politics | The US Congress certified Donald Trump’s presidential election victory on Monday, in an event heavy with symbolism four years to the day since he incited a violent mob to disrupt a similar ceremony. Kamala Harris presided over a joint Senate and House of Representatives session to validate the result. Foster care | The UK is facing a fostering crisis where retiring carers are not being replaced by younger people, while the number of children entering care homes is rising, a charity has warned. The decline in foster carers is due to the impact of the pandemic, the costof living crisis, biological children staying at home for longer, spare rooms being used as home offices and changing family situations, Barnardo’s children’s charity said. Tibet | A magnitude 6.8 earthquake has struck near one of Tibet’s holiest cities, the China Earthquake Networks Centre has said, killing 53 people, injuring 62 and damaging buildings around Shigatse, according to state media.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/07/tuesday-briefing-how-britain-has-coped-with-an-arctic-blast	2025-01-06T22:34:35-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99894d56e5d340c61cd130ff0b7d0d2f538e2dea/0_366_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d3bb5fa4c5ed304567b96230e54ab9b7

Congress to certify Trump’s election win four years after insurrection – US politics live	Senate and House to convene in joint session to certify results four years after Trump’s supporters stormed Capitol Good morning, US politics blog readers. It is January 6, the legally designated day when the Senate and House of Representatives convene in a joint session to certify the results of the presidential election – in this case, Donald Trump’s victory two months ago. Today’s meeting comes four years after the then-president’s supporters stormed the Capitol after he addressed them outside the White House, a historic attack that Trump’s successor, Joe Biden, tried and ultimately failed to have him prosecuted over. There’s no sign that a repeat of those events will take place this year. Washington DC is socked in by a snowstorm that’s snarled roads across parts of the east coast and midwest, the Capitol is under heavy guard, and, unlike the Republicans who in 2021 tried to used procedural moves to block Biden from taking office, no congressional Democrats have signaled plans to object to Trump’s re-election during the session. The session is set to begin at 1pm ET, with Kamala Harris presiding in her role as president of the Senate. Once Trump’s victory is certified, it will clear the way for his inauguration two weeks from today, on 20 January. Trump on Sunday said he will support efforts by Republicans in Congress to pass one massive piece of legislation that will enact many of his campaign promises, including better fortifying the country’s borders and removing taxes on tips. There had been some debate among the GOP over whether to split those priorities up into separate bills, but with that decided (for now), expect Republicans to spend the next several months getting that legislation through Congress. Biden wrote on opinion piece for the Washington Post, in which he encouraged Americans not to forget the insurrection that took place four years ago today. Seven US states in the midwest and east coast have declared emergencies as a big winter storm blows through.

Trump promised pardons for January 6 rioters in ‘first hour’ of his second term. What might this mean?	Observers raise alarm about how pardons for convicted Capitol attackers might weaken US criminal justice system As Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House, politicians, legal observers and even sitting federal judges are expressing alarm about his stated intention to pardon or offer commutations to supporters who attacked the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 and were then convicted of crimes.

Trump and Republicans plot radical policy agenda in one ‘big, beautiful bill’	House speaker says party seeks single piece of legislation covering tax cuts, immigration and military spending Donald Trump is working with top Republicans in Congress to devise a single -big, beautiful bill- that will contain all of his major policy ambitions – including a clampdown on immigration, tax cuts, and increased military spending in an attempt to supercharge his radical agenda as he embarks on a second presidency. The plan to pile all of Trump’s main policy goals into one mega-bill, against the wishes of some top congressional Republicans, raises the prospect of months of potentially bruising political in-fighting needed to secure its passage. Though the Republicans hold both chambers of Congress, their margin in the House is the slimmest in almost a century.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/06/trump-republicans-policy-agenda-bill	2025-01-06T03:00:47-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b22e9f8eae97b94047d7960010182dec306dd52/0_19_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8e3d72b726b661084f8232c232331277

Convicted January 6 rioters anticipate Trump pardons four years after US Capitol attack | First Thing	‘We’re excited that we have our country back,’ one convicted man said. Plus, Adrien Brody wins Golden Globe for The Brutalist Good morning. Once back in power, Donald Trump has promised he will pardon people prosecuted over the assault on the Capitol four years ago today. Carried out by a mob of Trump’s supporters after he had addressed them outside the White House, the 6 January 2021 attack brought political violence into the halls of Congress and has been linked to nine deaths among police and rioters. How many have been charged? The justice department has charged more than 1,500 people, nearly 600 of whom have faced felony charges of assaulting or impeding law enforcement. How popular would the move be? For all the enthusiasm among Trump’s supporters, a December poll from Monmouth University found that 61% of respondents would disapprove of Trump pardoning people convicted of attacking the Capitol. What do we know about the attack? Jabber’s truck displayed an IS flag. A rifle he used in the shootout was bought privately from someone who did not know what he had planned. Officials said Jabbar – who wore body armor and a helmet – had fashioned a homemade device meant to suppress the noise of gunshots fired by the rifle. What do authorities believe about the motive? Indications suggest Jabbar fell into extremism after marital and financial woes.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/06/first-thing-convicted-january-6-rioters-anticipate-trump-pardon-us-capitol-attack	2025-01-06T02:46:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21466ef563ff78864d7783feecef3d3b336ce875/0_185_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ee0ba5980be86089357d585b859fe2ec

Firms that donated to Republican party avoided tariffs in Trump first term – study	President-elect has threatened to levy tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China, which can burden businesses With Donald Trump threatening to impose steep tariffs upon his return to office this month, US firms are bracing for impact. But an analysis of Trump’s last presidency identified one way to boost their chances of avoiding the levies: donating to the Republican party. While the initial stage of the president-elect’s tariff agenda is designed to hit America’s largest trading partners – Canada, Mexico and China – it is US firms that pick up the bill, paying duties imposed on the goods they buy from these markets.

Middle East crisis live: Israel and Hamas wrangle over potential ceasefire and hostage deal	Disagreements over deal continue as Palestinian officials say more than 100 people died over the weekend due to Israeli bombardments Israel and Hamas are wrangling over the details of a potential deal to halt Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip and return hostages home, as Palestinian officials said intensified Israeli bombardments had killed more than 100 people over the weekend. A Hamas official said the group had approved a list of 34 Israeli hostages to be returned as part of a deal that could eventually lead to a ceasefire, Reuters reported. But Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office swiftly issued a statement on Sunday saying Hamas had not provided such a list. Israeli military airstrikes continued throughout the Gaza Strip on Sunday, with an airstrike killing five people in a house in the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza and another killing four in Jabalia in the territory’s north, Gaza health officials said. Later in the day, an airstrike hit a police station in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, killing five people, medics said. It was not immediately clear if all the people who were killed were police officers. At nightfall, medics said an Israeli airstrike had killed three people in Bureij camp in central Gaza, bringing Sunday’s death toll to 17. Two Palestinians, including a 17-year-old boy, were killed by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank on Sunday, according to the Palestinian Fatah party and the Palestinian health ministry. Palestinian media said Israeli forces opened fire on the home of a 37-year-old man in a town south of Jenin. The health ministry said the 17-year-old was killed in an Israeli raid in Askar camp in Nablus. The Israeli military said its forces killed an armed militant in the West Bank, confiscated weapons and dismantled an explosives manufacturing laboratory. Separately, it said it was looking into reports that a 17-year-old was killed. Social order in Gaza is likely to collapse further if Israel goes ahead with its threat this month to end all cooperation with the UN refugee agency for Palestinians (Unrwa), Louise Wateridge, its senior emergency officer, has warned. Gunmen opened fire on vehicles, including a passenger bus, on Monday near a village in the occupied West Bank, killing three people and injuring at least seven others, the Israeli military and emergency services said. -Paramedics have confirmed the deaths of three victims, including two women and a man,- emergency service provider Magen David Adom said, while the military reported that troops were -pursuing the terrorists- who carried out the attack near the village of Al-Funduq. Antony Blinken will meet his European counterparts Thursday in Rome on Syria, as the west looks to engage the new Islamist-led leadership.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike last year while inside the militant group’s war operations room, according to new details on Sunday disclosed by a senior Hezbollah security official, the Associated Press reports. -His eminence [Nasrallah] used to lead the battle and war from this location,- Wafiq Safa told a news conference on Sunday near the site where Nasrallah was killed.

Republicans try to exploit New Orleans attack to push through Trump agenda	Trump loyalists make baseless link between attack and US border and say cabinet nominees must be urgently ratified Republicans in the US Senate are attempting to exploit the New Year’s Day attack that killed 14 victims in New Orleans, while injuring dozens more, to push through Donald Trump’s most controversial cabinet nominations and rocket-charge the incoming president’s anti-immigration agenda – despite the fact that the attacker was a US citizen born and raised in east Texas.

The cold weather health alert, issued by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), lasts until midday on Wednesday. It means it is expected temperatures inside places such as hospitals, care homes and clinics could drop below the recommended levels. The Met Office has warned that the freezing weather could cause delays to rail and air travel, power cuts and the cutting off of rural communities, with up to 30cm of snow forecast in some areas.

Manchester said its teams are working to clear them -as quickly as possible- but had been hampered by -heavy snow- around 7am. The National Grid said there were a number of power cuts and it was working to restore power across the Midlands, south-west England and South Wales on Saturday evening, including in Birmingham, Bristol and Cardiff. The Irish government’s emergency planning team is holding a meeting as Ireland braces for a -multi-hazard weather event-, which is due to hit the country later on Saturday. Snow, ice, heavy rain and sleet are to sweep over Ireland as a series of orange and yellow weather warnings come into effect. Met Éireann has warned that the cold snap will create difficult travelling conditions and poor visibility. Forecasters have said that depending on snow accumulations on Monday, schools could remain closed as the sub-zero temperatures stretch into next week. They have warned that it will probably lead to disruption to public transport, air, rail and bus services, difficult conditions underfoot and animal welfare issues.

Some football games have already been called off this weekend. They include Cheltenham’s clash with League Two leaders Walsall and Halifax’s National League home game against Fylde. It remains to be seen if Manchester United and Liverpool’s clash in the English Premier League, one of the most watched sporting events in the world, will be cancelled on Sunday. Horse racing at Sandown Park in Surrey was abandoned on Saturday, with the racecourse saying the weather meant there -would not be sufficient time for the ground to become raceable-.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2025/jan/05/uk-weather-warnings-remain-in-place-as-uk-hit-by-snow-and-freezing-rain-live-updates	2025-01-05T00:08:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b01d4f960eda3b57a14779fe2ca38089d08727e/0_653_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ed30fecb6fdea2358563c48888952e7a

Ukraine waits for Trump the dealmaker to broker end of Putin’s war | Shaun Walker in Kyiv	The US president-elect’s policy on the conflict may prove decisive, but appeasing both sides will be a challenge A new year in Ukraine began in much the same way as the old one finished: with deadly Russian drone attacks across the country. In Kyiv, one person was killed and at least six others were injured in the first few hours of 2025. It is Ukraine’s third new year since Russia’s invasion. If 2023 began with hopes high that Ukrainian battlefield gains would push Russia back and lead to an outright victory, by the start of 2024 the Ukrainian army and population were already settled in for the long haul and had few illusions about a quick victory.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/04/ukraine-dealmaker-trump-putin-war-russia-zelenskyy	2025-01-04T08:29:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55c732ceca99894ff00b099c7f3d6427a9aac999/0_26_4418_2651/master/4418.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=78a1b857311b088c22bdd6b74798b492

Barcelona to fine e-scooter users up to €500 for riding on pavements	Council to crack down on antisocial behaviour linked to rapid rise of e-scooter riders in city Anyone riding an electric scooter on the pavement or without a helmet in Barcelona faces a fine of up to €500 (£415) from 1 February as part of a crackdown on antisocial behaviour linked to the rapid rise of e-scooter use in the Mediterranean city. In an urban landscape that is mostly flat, with more than 250km (155 miles) of cycle lanes, 2,500 hours of sunshine and barely 55 rainy days a year, electric scooters are a perfect fit. According to the city council’s figures, the number of people using e-scooters since the pandemic has risen four times faster than those choosing to travel by bicycle.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/03/barcelona-fine-e-scooter-users-riding-pavements	2025-01-03T04:56:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e585172e2ceda685d6552d0c53e31f30a0691fc/0_165_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=81ef3cd48e23bbb71340bec2f0cb98e2

First Thing: Arrest of South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol fails amid security force standoff	Anti-corruption officials say they were blocked by 200 presidential personnel. Plus, FBI says New Orleans terror suspect acted alone Good morning. South Korea’s political crisis took a dramatic turn on Friday when investigators were forced to abandon an attempt to arrest the impeached president, Yoon Suk Yeol, after a tense standoff with his security forces. What are the details of Friday’s standoff? Local media reports said anti-corruption officials – who are leading a joint team of police and prosecutors – entered the compound to find themselves blocked by troops under the control of the presidential security service. What happened on 3 December? Yoon declared martial law in an attempt to root out what he described as -anti-state, pro-North Korean- forces – a reference to opposition MPs in the national assembly. He did not provide any evidence for those claims, however. He was forced to lift the order six hours later after lawmakers forced their way past troops into the parliament building to vote it down. What do we know about the New Orleans attack suspect? It’s understood Jabbar was born and raised in Texas, served in the US army 2007-2015, and in 2022 was $27,000 behind on house payments, he said in court documents. Jabbar’s brother told AP that in recent months he’d isolated himself. Why didn’t steel bollards stop the attack? Seven years ago, officials began installing barriers at intersections in the French Quarter of the city. But the steel bollards were in the process of being replaced over New Year’s Eve.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/03/first-thing-arrest-of-south-korean-president-yoon-suk-yeol-fails-amid-security-force-standoff	2025-01-03T02:32:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa19edbf0482114c05b6dac6818d0ae662ff4005/0_0_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=37343acafc9f657f0c3d835c4b097dc5

Streeting defends pace of plans for adult social care reform – UK politics live	Ministers to launch historic commission to reform ‘failing’ system amid warnings the NHS risks being overwhelmed Wes Streeting has set out overnight for the Guardian his view on the new Labour government’s proposal for adult social care reform. The health secretary wrote: By 2050, there will be 4 million more people aged 65+ in England than today. If we do nothing, real social care costs are expected to nearly double by 2038, compared with 2018 numbers. Many more people will be left without the care they need, the burdens will fall on the health service and our NHS will be overwhelmed. We can’t keep paying a heavier and heavier price for failure. Our NHS can’t afford to keep bearing a heavier burden. We can’t afford not to act. Labour took a lot of flak in the general election campaign for not spelling out in more detail our plans for a National Care Service. I was honest about the reason why – general election campaigns are where plans for social care go to die. If anyone is going to help us to break the cycle of bad politics, knock heads together, and forge the national consensus I think we need on social care, it is Louise Casey. And that work will begin in April. It will report initially next year. And within three years I hope we will have built the consensus we need to build a national care service fit to meet the challenges for older and disabled people in the 21st century.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/03/wes-streeting-adult-social-care-reform-elon-musk-uk-politics-live-updates	2025-01-03T01:12:38-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1de800d53bf6061d31c375d7b1b4a6347a48125/0_304_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=70f8f898159a73578eb8d97244c6d434
