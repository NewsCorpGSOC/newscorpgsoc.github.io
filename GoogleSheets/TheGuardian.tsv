Middle East crisis live: White House walks back Trump’s Gaza ‘takeover’ comments in face of widespread international anger	Secretary of state Marco Rubio says Trump comments should not be seen as ‘hostile move’; Netanyahu says ‘remarkable idea’ should be pursued Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that there was nothing wrong in Donald Trump’s idea of displacing Palestinians from Gaza after the US president’s proposal drew international criticism. Rights groups have condemned as ethnic cleansing Trump’s suggestion the previous day that Palestinians in the territory should be permanently displaced, while also proposing a US takeover of Gaza. Defence secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon was prepared to look at -all options- when it comes to Gaza. Hegseth made the comments on Wednesday before meeting with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, reportedly said the US president does not want to put any American troops into Gaza. -Witkoff said that the president doesn’t want to put any troops into Gaza, and that he doesn’t want to spend any US money on Gaza,- the Republican senator for Missouri, Josh Hawley, said, according to the Washington Post. Peace through strength is a concept Israel shares with the United States, Netanyahu said. -The only way to get peace, and enduring peace, is by being very, very strong,- he said, according to a readout of the meeting. -And with our alliance and your support, including the decision … of supplying Israel the much-needed tools for our defense, we are a lot stronger than we’ve ever been.- The UN said forcible deportation of people from occupied territory is -strictly prohibited- under international law, while Human Rights Watch said the policy would be a -moral abomination-. Amnesty International condemned Donald Trump’s comments as -inflammatory, outrageous and shameful-. International law experts said it could amount to a war crime or crime against humanity. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Gaza was -an integral part of the State of Palestine- and that -we will not allow the rights of our people … to be infringed on-. The estimated death toll in Gaza since the start of Israeli operations in the territory after the 7 October attacks reached 47,552, according to the Palestinian ministry of health on Wednesday.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/06/middle-east-crisis-live-white-house-walks-back-trumps-gaza-takeover-comments-in-face-of-widespread-international-anger	2025-02-05T22:35:25-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff709adc79faf9b774aab35fd222c4c819b79682/0_71_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=88b64fbaed0db1dfaf351258124d9508

Trump’s plan to own Gaza a throwback to 19th-century imperialism	It does not seem to occur to US administration that to the rest of the world they seem to be advocating a second Nakba Donald Trump’s vision of Gaza as a US-administered Riviera stripped of Palestinians indulges the fantasies of Israel’s extremist right, but also, if taken seriously, builds on an expansionist foreign policy that Trump has articulated since he took on the presidency. The outlook is more akin to mid-19th century US imperial thinking than the era of isolationism his election appeared to herald. Indeed the one moment Benjamin Netanyahu did not look delighted at Tuesday’s joint press conference was when Trump, negotiating in real time, referred to the US as being opposed to Israeli ownership of Gaza.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/trumps-plan-to-own-gaza-chimes-of-19th-century-imperialism	2025-02-05T09:46:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82d0146aa21e3b8a3516520a688a31f39c1bd8a3/306_635_6183_3712/master/6183.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=edfea944c8380254a9d1d1d92ff53862

RFK Jr’s claim about Black people’s immune systems is ‘unscientific and terrifying’	Kennedy’s hearing signifies how close a man with medically racist beliefs is to becoming the US’s leading health official During Robert F Kennedy Jr’s Senate confirmation hearing on 30 January, Angela Alsobrooks, a Democratic senator from Maryland, pressed the nominee on his past claims that Black people have a stronger immune system than white people, and thereby should receive vaccines on a different schedule than them. -What different vaccine schedule would you say I should have received?- Alsobrooks, who is Black, asked the health secretary nominee. Kennedy then referenced a -series of studies- showing that -to particular antigens, Blacks have a much stronger reaction-. The exchange is cause for alarm for many, as it signified how close a man who holds medically racist beliefs was to becoming the country’s leading health official. Dr Richard Kennedy – an author of the study referenced at the hearing, who is not related to Kennedy – told NPR that while it’s true the immune response to vaccination can vary by race, sex and -potentially dozens of other factors-, the data does not support a change in vaccine schedule based on race.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/rfk-jr-hearing-black-people-immune-systems	2025-02-05T07:00:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/294ec248c43050e9123072395aae5c8e5dcd54a4/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b81978fc9efefe58777fc783bccc5148

Government rejects claim Chagos deal to cost £18bn amid growing Labour backlash – UK politics live	Foreign policy set to dominate PMQs amid unease over deal with Mauritius and Trump’s Gaza comments Good morning. PMQs is normally mostly about domestic politics, but today – despite the government doing its best to promote an announcement about a £2.65bn investment in flood defences – foreign policy may well dominate. That is partly because of President Trump, and his desire to leave office with the US territorially bigger than it was when it arrived (something that went out of fashion in most parts of the respectable world around the end of the 19th century). Last night Keir Starmer had dinner with the prime minister of Denmark, the country that has sovereignty over Greenland, and late last night No 10 put out a statement that slightly firmed up Starmer’s support for Denmark in its determination to see off Trump’s plan to buy/annex the vast, frozen island. More on that soon. This reporting is incorrect. The figures being quoted are entirely inaccurate and misleading. A person familiar with the views of one cabinet minister said they did not understand why the UK was agreeing to pay large sums of money to Mauritius at a time when the Treasury was telling UK government departments to prepare for spending cuts. A second person familiar with a different cabinet member’s views said Starmer should cancel the deal. Both suggested Starmer was acting on legal advice from Attorney General Richard Hermer. Making calls on this story to contacts in government last night, it became clear to me that some of the most senior people in government are opposed to this deal … Just looking through the words in my notebook, -terrible-, -mad-, -impossible to understand- – those are the words I can use, at least at this time of day on air. But there are other words in my notebook. And these are from very senior government sources. One MP who fears Nigel Farage’s outfit could be closing in on their marginal seat told Playbook the treaty would be -Reform rocket fuel.- -How am I supposed to tell my constituents that we took away their winter fuel allowance to pay a foreign country to take our sovereign territory?- they messaged to say.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/05/pmqs-chagos-islands-trump-gaza-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-uk-politics-live	2025-02-05T01:39:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06f1d3c3d7f167878498ab50e00929a92170270b/0_241_4940_2964/master/4940.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ca0642c9f5b1f81e3bfeefdcebe4bb5f

How the world’s richest man laid waste to the US government	Elon Musk has achieved astonishing power in Trump’s administration – and spent the weekend wielding it Since declaring his support for Donald Trump in July of last year and subsequently spending more than $250m on his re-election effort, Elon Musk has rapidly accumulated political influence and positioned himself at the heart of the new administration. Now as prominent as the president himself, he has begun to make use of that power, taking actions that could affect the health of millions of people, gaining access to highly sensitive personal data and attacking anyone who opposes him. Musk, the world’s richest man and an unelected official, has achieved an astonishing level of power over the federal government. Over the weekend, workers with Musk’s -department of government efficiency- (Doge) clashed with civil servants over demands for unfettered access to the computer systems of major US government agencies in a breakneck series of confrontations. When the dust settled, several top officials who opposed the takeover had been pushed out, and Musk’s allies had gained control.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-elon-musk-federal-government	2025-02-04T11:52:24-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/153a0c447760596072c83ad7ac0d282977bda122/0_136_4109_2467/master/4109.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=042e0ef1f9f5255f0aca6a429bbc820d

In this Trump era of shakedown diplomacy, everything has a price	Friends and allies of the US president will say his recent tariff threats delivered quick wins, but he may find there are no winners in a trade war As the world reels from the first three weeks of Donald Trump’s shakedown diplomacy, it is divided between those who marvel at this display of raw American economic hegemony, and those who fear that the US’s president, fatally misreading how the globe has changed since his first term, is storing up trouble that will diminish the US as an economic and moral force in four years’ time. At one level Trump’s antics are wearily familiar. After all, the last rites of the 70-year-old liberal world order were also read when Trump came to power in 2017, before that order was briefly disinterred under Joe Biden. The diplomatic pearls were collectively clutched when Trump 1.0 threatened to pull out of Nato, launched a trade war with China, introduced a travel ban on mainly Muslim countries, and withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation trade agreement championed by Barack Obama. In 2019 Trump dropped the threat of a 5% tariff in return for Mexico sending 6,000 militarised police to the southern border. Grievances, and bargains, have always animated Trump’s thinking.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/in-this-trump-era-of-shakedown-diplomacy-everything-has-a-price	2025-02-04T08:22:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a726668bb3d94b624fc479e88c91803807ce29b/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42f35e6ec17d14d7c76dce942479aa18

Trump personally ordered firings of special counsel prosecutors	Exclusive: move to purge those who worked for Jack Smith came from Trump, sources say, in show of unchecked power The US justice department fired more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on the criminal cases against Donald Trump hours after the president directly ordered it from the Oval Office, according to two people familiar with the intervention. The move to purge people who worked for former special counsel Jack Smith had ostensibly come from the acting attorney general, James McHenry, who sent the formal termination notices that said they could not be trusted to implement Trump’s agenda.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-jack-smith-special-counsel-prosecutors-firings	2025-02-04T03:00:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0776e26d7469aabda4b7d90baaf584b286f1823/0_440_8256_4952/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3867b07a4b95e75f432f2d8bcd339397
Scientists brace ‘for the worst’ as Trump purges climate mentions from websites	Trump administration pulling references online ‘won’t make crisis’ stop impacting Americans’ lives, say experts Donald Trump’s administration has started to remove or downgrade mentions of the climate crisis across the US government, with the websites of several major departments pulling down references to anything related to the climate crisis. Climate scientists said they were braced -for the worst-. A major climate portal on the Department of Defense’s website has been scrapped, as has the main climate change section on the site of the Department of State. A climate change page on the White House’s website no longer exists, nor does climate content provided by the US agriculture department, including information that provides vulnerability assessments for wildfires.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-climate-change-federal-websites	2025-02-04T03:00:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f06133fa24a4e1366e5cabeeb4a898f0da1b3e94/0_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1957e265c42a6b72ab896d36c3a5bd16
Netanyahu hoping to ‘redraw map’ of Middle East in Washington DC ceasefire talks with Trump – Israel-Gaza war live	Israeli PM in Washington for talks with US president as Hamas says it is ready to discuss details of second phase of ceasefire and hostage releases Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the latest news from the Middle East. Today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in Washington for talks with US President Donald Trump about the ceasefire in Gaza. Trump said on Monday he did not known whether the ceasefire deal in Gaza was going to last. -I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,- he told reporters. Hamas is ready to begin talks on the details of a second phase of the ceasefire, two officials from the group told the AFP on Monday. -We are waiting for the mediators to initiate the next round of negotiation,- said one. Israel continued its operations in the West Bank city of Jenin for a 14th consecutive day, with dozens of homes demolished and at least 25 people killed, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa The Palestinian ministry of health said the Israeli military had killed at least 70 people, including 10 children in the West Bank, since the beginning of 2025. More than 545,000 Palestinians are estimated to have crossed from southern Gaza to northern Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect, according to figures by the UN. The Trump administration has asked congressional leaders to approve transfers of roughly $1bn worth of bombs and other military hardware to Israel, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing US officials. The sales would include 4,700 1,000-pound bombs as well as armoured bulldozers built by Caterpillar. The head of Amnesty International, Agnes Callamard, said the ceasefire should not erase the events of the last 15 months and that Israel should held accountable for -genocide-. -If you have any sense of the future, you need a reckoning for the past,- she told Al Jazeera. The office of Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said the ongoing Israeli military operation in the occupied West Bank amounts to -ethnic cleansing- and urged the US to intervene. A spokesperson said the presidency -condemned the occupation authorities’ expansion of their comprehensive war on our Palestinian people in the West Bank to implement their plans aimed at displacing citizens and ethnic cleansing-. A car bomb killed at least 15 people in the northern Syrian city of Manbij. The attack was the second in three days and the deadliest since Bashar al-Assad was deposed in December. The office of the president vowed that those responsible would be help accountable.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/04/benjamin-netanyahu-donald-trump-israel-gaza-middle-east-ceasefire-latest-live-news	2025-02-04T02:54:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a18271bda488f2f0ee5861668d403ec200bb0fb1/0_72_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f7868134d28da8a88c0c4bbd518ef1ab
Labour dropped plan to ban foreign donors after Waheed Alli intervened, book claims	Peer who gave gifts to Keir Starmer is said to have blocked ban on potential Elon Musk donations to Reform UK Labour reportedly dropped a plan to ban foreign political donations after an intervention from Waheed Alli, the Labour peer who paid for Keir Starmer’s clothes and glasses. The plan would have scuppered any potential donations from the billionaire Elon Musk to Reform UK. It would have made it illegal to donate unless donors were registered to vote in the UK or via companies owned by people based in Britain.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/04/labour-dropped-plan-ban-foreign-donors-waheed-alli-intervened-book-claims	2025-02-04T01:38:57-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fc45f3f92d3b76d5c4175eb442bac7617a01827/541_319_2493_1496/master/2493.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=269f7f1eaa07ec1846e94c5009b78a0d
Reform UK overtakes Labour for first time in national opinion poll – UK politics live	Trend shows support for Nigel Farage’s Reform UK has grown significantly since general election Good morning. A good rule of thumb in political reporting is that any news story about voter intention polling is wrong. That is because news stories, by definition, are what’s what new and what’s different, and polls that show anything unusual (or at least anything significantly unusual) are probably outliers. In polling, what matters is the trend (because polls are a reliable guide to voting trends) but not so much the actual numbers (where polling is much more hit and miss). So it it is with some reservation that we start with YouGov polling, for the Times and Sky News, showing Reform UK in first place, and ahead of Labour for the first time in a national opinion poll. It has Reform UK on 25%, Labour on 24% and the Conservatives on 21%.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/04/latest-live-uk-politics-news-labour-reform-tory-conservatives-keir-starmer	2025-02-04T01:30:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ce7dbc5a63bc37033987f48a5f49ba3247aea66/0_164_4929_2957/master/4929.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1da340d05b6e227e3e21a5c1ff06947a

Trump to pause Canada tariffs for at least 30 days as China levies set to take effect Tuesday – live	Canadian PM Justin Trudeau says he had ‘good call’ with US president, as Mexico tariffs paused too Donald Trump’s administration has confirmed plans to merge the US international aid agency USAid into the state department in a major revamp that would shrink its workforce and align its spending with Trump’s priorities. The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, declared himself the acting administrator of the agency and employees have been locked out of its Washington DC headquarters, while others have been suspended. Trump announced he’s planning to appoint Michael Ellis and the deputy director of the CIA. Ellis is a close Trump ally and worked in the president’s previous administration and helped fight allegations of collusion with Russia in the 2016 election. The Trump administration is opening new investigations into allegations of antisemitism at five US universities including Columbia and the University of California, Berkeley, the Education Department announced Monday. The US Senate on Monday confirmed Chris Wright, a fracking executive, to be Donald Trump’s energy secretary. The vote was 59-38. Wright, 60, the CEO of Liberty Energy since 2011 has said he will step down from the company once confirmed. He wrote in a Liberty report last year that he believes human-caused climate change is real, but that its hazards are -distant and uncertain-. He has also said that top-down governmental policies to curb it are destined to fail. The US interior department has unveiled a suite of orders aimed at carrying out Donald Trump’s agenda to maximise domestic energy and minerals production and slash red tape, Reuters reports. In a statement, the agency said interior secretary Doug Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota, signed six orders on his first day in office. US President Donald Trump has invited Indian prime minister Narendra Modi to visit the White House next week, a White House official said, hours after a US military plane departed to return deported migrants to the country. Senator Susan Collins, a republican from Maine, said she’ll vote to confirm Tulsi Gabbard as the director of national intelligence. Collins is a key swing vote and her support brings Gabbard’s nomination close to being sealed. Trump is reportedly mulling an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education, in alignment with mandates from Elon Musk’s -department of government efficiency- to slash federal agencies. Musk’s Doge reportedly accessed administration systems for the federal Small Business Administration. It has also reportedly accessed secure information at USAid and the Treasury department. According to Wired, Musk has reportedly deployed six young men to lead Doge’s efforts to access federal government data. The Trump administration made plain its intent to merge USAid with the state department under Musk’s supervision. Employees were barred from the agency headquarters today, after the website was shuttered over the weekend. Several democrats cried foul, calling the act illegal and denouncing Musk. The Trump administration may today begin using an obscure 18th-century law to deport undocumented migrants without first going through the courts. Darren Beattie, a former White House official who wrote, -Competent white men must be in charge if you want things to work,- is reportedly set for a top role at the state department.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/feb/04/donald-trump-tariffs-live-blog-news-updates-canada-trudeau-mexico-china	2025-02-03T18:50:35-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c6c32f7de6d46668cfb725059f5a2f0e8ff0662/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=57c8c39923efef51a60d05e4860c4c9e

Starmer’s EU dinner date a big moment in tricky tightrope act	Domestically and on the world stage, the PM faces a series of challenges as he resets UK’s post-Brexit relationship Whichever way you slice it, Keir Starmer’s invitation to dinner in Brussels is a big moment. For the first time since Brexit, the UK prime minister is sitting down for an informal summit with the 27 EU leaders. Five years on from its departure from the bloc, the UK has a Labour government populated with politicians who are far more sympathetic to Europe than their Conservative predecessors. Starmer was a committed remainer who spent years steering his party towards endorsing a second referendum. Most of the cabinet privately think Brexit was an act of self-harm — and David Lammy, the foreign secretary, has reportedly been arguing that the UK should now rejoin the customs union.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/03/starmers-eu-dinner-date-a-big-moment-in-tricky-tightrope-act	2025-02-03T10:07:45-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c3a1fe20aab7905fd7ef18421044fd29d6c5d22/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fa5221c9359123c0157eb2a15056d3c8

In the first two weeks of his return as president, Trump has, like his first term, issued orders to open up more American land and waters for fossil fuel extraction and started the process to yank the US from the Paris climate agreement. -We will drill, baby drill,- said Trump, who has promised to cut energy and electricity prices in half within 18 months.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/03/trump-war-on-clean-energy-big-oil	2025-02-03T03:00:39-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4692017038050d670d846cb0365ac4ff2bcfa5b3/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=60028ce25095472afb904a7d603f0aa4

Ron DeSantis tried to crusade against undocumented students.

‘Vicious cycle’: far-right parties across Europe are inspiring imitators	Hardline agendas, especially on immigration, are copied by mainstream conservatives in vain effort to win back votes Far-right parties could become the largest force on the right in Europe within a decade, experts have said, as mainstream conservative parties look to copy their hardline agendas, especially on immigration, in a vain effort to win back votes. Germany’s conservatives last week sparked fury when their leader, Friedrich Merz, the country’s likely next chancellor, broke a longstanding pledge by relying on far-right votes to adopt a non-binding motion urging a drastic immigration crackdown. The leader of Alternative für Deutschland, Alice Weidel, hailed -a historic day for Germany- as the Bundestag, for the first time in its history, passed a vote with the backing of her party, which is second in the polls weeks before this month’s elections.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/01/vicious-cycle-far-right-parties-across-europe-are-inspiring-imitators	2025-02-01T05:23:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4915bc32566be05f06e4d18bcc20b5a5fc357434/0_407_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4bacd9be57590359b3fb0dbc2cebcff1

Simon & Schuster imprint will no longer ask authors to obtain blurbs for their books	Publisher says expecting authors, agents and editors to secure blurbs can create ‘an incestuous and unmeritocratic literary ecosystem that often rewards connections over talent’ When you buy a new book, you can usually expect to see praise from other authors emblazoned on its cover.

But soon we may not see so many of these author blurbs – Sean Manning, publisher of Simon &amp; Schuster’s flagship imprint in the US, has written an essay for Publishers Weekly explaining that as of this year he will -no longer require authors to obtain blurbs for their books-.	https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/31/simon-schuster-us-imprint-authors-blurbs-books	2025-01-31T09:27:59-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d43f8ba0fcd502759c6eaae34477607818759d9/0_128_3854_2314/master/3854.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=10de228e4820ceb3fb90fd9869ae7511

Trump baselessly blames ‘diversity’ and Democrats for deadly DC plane crash | First Thing	Sixty-seven people die in deadliest US air tragedy since 2001. Plus, Israeli-Hamas deal leads to release of eight hostages and 110 prisoners Good morning. Donald Trump used the plane crash in Washington DC to attack his political enemies, claiming Democrats were responsible for declining standards in air traffic control and that the disaster -could have been- caused by diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies at the Federal Aviation Administration. What details have emerged about the passengers? As many as 14 figure skaters and coaches were onboard the plane, as well as other Americans and citizens of several other countries. How did Democrats respond to Trump’s rant? Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic House minority leader, said Trump used the collision to -peddle lies, conspiracy theories, and attack people of color and women without any basis whatsoever-. He continued: -Have you no respect for the families whose lives have been turned upside down?- What is the death toll of the war? At least 47,460 people have been killed in the Israeli offensive, according to Gaza health officials, but a study published in the Lancet says the true number is about 41% higher. How many hostages have been released? Fifteen since the ceasefire began on 19 January.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/31/first-thing-trump-baselessly-blames-diversity-and-democrats-for-deadly-dc-plane-crash	2025-01-31T03:55:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f99f1403eddda91ece62fd87cde432fa67e1810/0_336_5043_3026/master/5043.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3bdafec776f0445ac02c020c021c4216

Tory bid to celebrate Brexit anniversary marred by spat between Badenoch and Patel over party’s migration record – UK politics live	Kemi Badenoch issues rebuke to Priti Patel after former home secretary defends rise in migration since Brexit Good morning. It is five years to the day since the UK left the European Union. Despite complaints from some of the pro-Brexit papers, Keir Starmer and the government are not planning anything today to mark the occasion – which is not surprising because polling suggests only 11% of the population believe that it has been a success, and most people know think that, when voters followed the advice of Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Nigel Farage, they made a mistake. Still, in some parts of British politics Brexit has long ceased being a policy option, and become more of a cult, and some supporters of Brexit have been marking the anniversary with statements defending the policy. But, in the Conservative party, that has all gone a bit haywire. Five years ago today, the Conservatives honoured the democratic will of the British people and Got Brexit Done. Since then, our country has reaped the benefits—securing new trade deals with dynamic, fast-growing markets across the world and reclaiming sovereignty from Brussels. This has allowed us to reform or revoke 2,500 EU laws, ensuring Britain’s future is shaped by our own parliament.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/31/brexit-politics-tory-kemi-badenoch-priti-patel-keir-starmer-live-latest-news	2025-01-31T01:29:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f249e0eab725ff7f432527f7c52516c5a820164/33_459_2315_1389/master/2315.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e01c6fb84ff41eec33067680e6ee257f
Delays to post-Brexit border checks may have let diseased chicken enter UK	Exclusive: Officials admitted in 2023 there were ‘no current border checks’, as salmonella and other illnesses surged UK health bosses privately admitted that a lack of border inspections in the wake of Brexit had left British consumers exposed to diseased meat, an investigation has found. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism has previously uncovered a host of failings in the government’s handling of outbreaks of drug-resistant salmonella, particularly that linked to supermarket chicken from Poland. Illnesses connected to the outbreaks – which also affected eggs – peaked at different points between 2020 and 2024, while border checks that were supposed to be in place post-Brexit were being repeatedly delayed.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/31/delays-to-post-brexit-border-checks-diseased-chicken-uk	2025-01-31T01:27:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2532e2d438c6dcf85049779fbbdd10fd55db9d2/0_229_4689_2813/master/4689.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eea0a65fe02408ed0e738babb43d79a5

Washington DC plane crash live: flight data and cockpit voice recorders recovered, officials say	National Transportation Safety Board announces recorders are now at a lab for evaluation; operation to recover bodies continues Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Wednesday’s night’s collision between a regional passenger jet and a military helicopter near Washington DC’s Reagan airport. The flight data and cockpit voice recorders have been recovered from the American Airlines flight, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has announced, and they are now at the NTSB’s labs for evaluation. With the 67 people aboard both the American Airlines flight and the army Black Hawk helicopter all presumed dead, the collision is being called -the deadliest aviation disaster- in the US since 2001. At least 28 bodies have been recovered from the Potomac River, with recovery operations ongoing. A day before Wednesday night’s midair collision near Reagan airport, a different jet there had to abort its landing and make a second approach after a helicopter appeared near its flight path, the Washington Post reported. The US army saw an increase in very serious aviation incidents during the last fiscal year, with 15 flight and two ground incidents that resulted in deaths of service members, destruction of aircraft, or more than $2.5m in damage to the airframe, the Associated Press reported, Donald Trump and members of his administration claimed, without evidence, that diversity efforts at the FAA under the Biden and Obama administration could be to blame for the crash, with Trump specifically claiming that the FAA had been accused of being -too white,- and suggesting efforts to hire Americans with disabilities were irresponsible. Trump signed an executive order that rolls back diversity initiatives to stop -woke policies- in federal aviation. The Trump administration’s choice to draw an unfounded connection between a deadly tragedy and diversity initiatives at a press conference sparked broad condemnation from Democratic politicians. They called the comments -disgusting,- -despicable,- and -racist,- with Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries saying that Trump was -blaming women and people of color for the deadly plane crash.- As many as 14 skaters and coaches, including two 16-year-olds and a married pair of world champions, were onboard the American Airlines plane. The Skating Club of Boston said Jinna Han and Spencer Lane, both aged 16, and the Russian-born ice skating coaches and former world champions Yevgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, who were husband and wife, were on the flight.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/31/washington-dc-plane-crash-live-flight-data-and-cockpit-voice-recorders-recovered-officials-say	2025-01-30T18:28:45-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3748ed9af0e94997caf2a79eb9847e0b925d0e68/0_43_4992_2995/master/4992.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2413bcf7502e0ebdedd284b648309532

Kidnapped Spanish man rescued using photo of steering wheel	Man sent coordinates and photo of steering wheel to his girlfriend allowing officers to locate car and rescue him Spanish police have rescued a man who was kidnapped and bundled into the boot of a car after he managed to alert his girlfriend by sending her a photo of the vehicle’s steering wheel and a set of coordinates. On 23 January Policía Nacional officers in the Andalucían province of Málaga received a report that a man had been kidnapped two days earlier on the promenade of the town of Sabinillas.

Trump moves to gut government by offering to buy out 3m federal workers | First Thing	Memo says aim is to retain only those employees who are ‘reliable, loyal, trustworthy’. Plus, 85% of Greenlanders reject US advances Good morning. The Trump administration has offered buyouts to almost all of the roughly 3 million people who work for the US government if they leave their jobs by 6 February in exchange for seven months’ salary, as the White House attempts to gut the civil service. What are the details? The email had the same subject line – -Fork in the road- – as one sent by Elon Musk to employees at Twitter in 2022 when he bought the social media platform. It asked interested workers to reply with the word -Resign-. How did the employees’ union react? The American Federation of Government Employees denounced the offer. It said it was an effort to pressure workers who are not considered loyal to the new administration to leave their jobs – which could cause upheaval in federal programs. What do we know about the death toll so far? Local officials counting casualties into hospital tents said at least 38 were feared dead while other officials and doctors have given death tolls ranging from 15 to 50.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/first-thing-trump-moves-to-gut-government-by-offering-to-buy-out-3m-federal-workers	2025-01-29T04:21:59-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d257fbebf1ad95256ab043fdfe15c3aeea51df0/0_2_4001_2400/master/4001.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=425e446bdc554dc41dc5d5344619ea40

And no wonder, because she is hoping that it will do almost as much work, politically at least, as a budget. Although she has not had to unravel the mega, £25bn tax raising package she announced in October, it suppressed business confidence more than she expected and there now seems to be a Westminster consensus that she included a bit too much gloom powder in the cake mix.

Wednesday briefing: The problems, perils and precedent of ‘cleaning out’ Gaza	In today’s newsletter: After Donald Trump’s remarks, renewed alarm about what will follow the first phase of the ceasefire Good morning. Donald Trump presented his proposal as one rooted in a concern for the safety of Palestinians: it was time to find many of the residents of Gaza somewhere else to live. -I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing at a different location where they can maybe live in peace for a change,- he said. -You’re talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing and say: ‘You know, it’s over.’- That was more than stream of consciousness: Trump doubled down on his comments on Monday. But the idea of -cleaning out- Gaza is not welcomed by the Palestinians who live there – or the countries that Trump has in mind as their new home. And if they were to be forced to leave after Gaza was devastated by the Israeli military, it would appear to be a clear case of ethnic cleansing.

Louvre’s decision to move Mona Lisa is a misguided act of snobbery	Crowds give life to the Paris museum and the painting is a silent, compelling mystery at the heart of the hubbub What a wonderful headache for a museum to have. The Louvre in Paris gets so many visitors it is taking drastic measures to cope, which include moving its most famous treasure to a dedicated space where fans can visit without entering the main museum at all. It will no longer suck the oxygen from other art. Nearly 9 million visitors a year stream through the Louvre and it’s believed 80% of them are looking for Leonardo da Vinci’s portrait of Lisa Gherardini del Giocondo, better known as La Gioconde, better still as the Mona Lisa. I’m worried the Louvre is trying to solve a problem that is not really a problem. Ask Britain’s museums if high visitor numbers are a bad thing: they still haven’t recovered their pre-pandemic crowds. The decision, dramatically announced by Emmanuel Macron, to move the Mona Lisa to a special hygienically isolated gallery where les idiots who flock to take selfies in front of it won’t bother more cultured visitors who wish to study art in a hushed atmosphere, is a misguided act of snobbery. It may ruin the Louvre’s ecosystem as a place where high art becomes popular culture.	https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jan/28/louvres-decision-to-move-mona-lisa-is-a-misguided-act-of-snobbery	2025-01-28T11:57:34-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce1fdb682db5613f2299e7e4efa91b547ee881f7/0_118_5447_3268/master/5447.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a807182f6370aeb60ad606bd4207cc88

At the center of the case in question is Andrew Taake, 36, of Houston, Texas, who assailed police with bear spray and a metal whip when a mob of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol in early 2021 in a desperate attempt to keep him in office at the end of his first presidency, according to prosecutors.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/28/jan-6-rioter-pardon-andrew-taake	2025-01-28T02:00:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7548df2fd1b1cca2da3cb1f8d91917345ae1e40/0_233_7000_4202/master/7000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4c93799be03f74e38a338b6854ceb530

Middle East crisis live: Netanyahu planning to meet Trump next week as US president repeats aim to move Palestinians from Gaza	Israeli prime minister could visit White House as soon as next week, making him the first foreign leader to meet Trump since his inauguration Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the latest events in the Middle East. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is planning to meet US President Donald Trump in Washington as early as next week, according to reports, as hundreds of thousands of Palestinian people made their way back into northern Gaza on Monday. US secretary of state Marco Rubio held a call with Jordan’s King Abdullah on Monday, two days after a suggestion by Donald Trump that Jordan and Egypt should take more Palestinians from Gaza. -The Secretary and King Abdullah discussed implementation of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, the release of hostages, and creating a pathway for security and stability in the region,- the state department said in a statement. Trump’s weekend remarks were not mentioned. Lebanese officials say firing by Israeli troops has killed two people and injured 17 in the second day of deadly protests in southern Lebanon. Residents displaced by the 14-month war between Israel and Hezbollah on Monday again attempted to return to villages where Israeli troops remain. On Sunday, 24 people were killed and more than 130 injured when Israeli troops fired at protesters. Israel said on Monday that it had arrested two Israelis suspected of spying for Iran, including one accused of handing the country classified information obtained during his military service. Tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem were set to lose education, healthcare and other services provided by UN agency Unrwa as an Israeli ban on the organisation takes effect on Thursday. Eight of the 26 hostages yet to be released under the first phase of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas are dead, Israel has confirmed. A Hamas delegation has arrived in Cairo to discuss the implementation of the Gaza ceasefire deal, the group said in a statement. The EU’s foreign ministers have agreed to a -roadmap- to ease current sanctions on Syria, a move welcomed by the country’s government.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/28/israel-gaza-netanyahu-trump-hamas-palestinians-middle-east-latest-live-news	2025-01-27T23:33:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64dff35b74022795939d2f256cd5875dbb0fbc4e/0_62_3360_2016/master/3360.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9c64645370c6e3fa95d70b4b52f99896
Tuesday briefing: How an unknown Chinese startup wiped $593bn from the value of an AI giant	In today’s newsletter: the US had a huge head start on artificial intelligence – but now a low-cost rival from Hangzhou has turned the industry on its head Good morning. Since the emergence of ChatGPT, OpenAI’s groundbreaking artificial intelligence tool, American companies have appeared to have a huge head start in the development of the most significant technology of its generation. But now a small Chinese rival has emerged that appears to match what OpenAI and the other US giants can do at a much lower cost, and without the same hunger for computing power that has made the chip manufacturer Nvidia the most valuable company in the world. The result was a stunning collapse in the value of Big Tech stocks yesterday – and a $593bn fall in the value of Nvidia, the biggest in the US stock market’s history. Gaza ceasefire | Tens of thousands of Palestinians flooded back into northern Gaza on Monday after Israel opened military checkpoints that had divided the strip for more than a year, ending a forced exile from homes and loved ones that many feared could become permanent. UK security | Hindu nationalism, misogyny and the -manosphere- have been identified as breeding grounds for extremism in a leaked government report commissioned after last summer’s riots. The -rapid analytical sprint- also dismissed claims of -two-tier policing- as a -rightwing extremist narrative-. Auschwitz | Elderly former inmates of Auschwitz gathered for perhaps the final time on the 80th anniversary of the concentration camp’s liberation. In remarks at the event, four survivors warned world leaders against the danger of rising antisemitism. Roman Abramovich | An offshore scheme appears to have helped companies owned by the billionaire Roman Abramovich avoid duties potentially amounting to tens of millions of dollars. Abramovich’s lawyers denied he had knowledge of or was personally responsible for any alleged tax evasion. Local government | Bristol city council could become the first local authority in England to collect black rubbish bins only once every four weeks.

Australia’s road toll hits 12-year high as pedestrian and cyclist fatalities rise	Government figures show 1,300 people died on the roads last year in a worsening trend not seen since the 1960s Australia’s roads are getting deadlier, as a four-year period of surging fatalities marks a trend of increasing danger not recorded since the 1960s, before seatbelts were compulsory. Annual road fatality data collated by the federal government’s Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE) shows that 1,300 people died on Australian roads in 2024, up from 1,258 in 2023.

Open (your wallet) wide: Australians pay more for dental care than most OECD countries	Australia ranks well when it comes to total dental care expenditure. But a closer look at the numbers reveals that trips to the dentist are a luxury many people can’t afford Australia spent $11.1bn on dental care in 2021–2022, ranking it sixth out of 31 OECD countries for per capita expenditure. At first glance, that statistic seems pretty good. Dig deeper?

Peter Dutton’s boilerplate campaign video is most interesting for what it omits	The shots of sharing cuppas with constituents and laughing with his kids skates over the details of his ‘small family business’ Election season officially begins when the prime minister drives in the back of C1 to visit the governor general – but its unofficial commencement is when leaders start releasing soft-focus profile videos with their log cabin story, surrounded by family and backed by twinkling music. For an opposition leader especially, whose contributions can often be overshadowed by the prime minister whose job they covet, the productions – often short yet packed with meaning – are a vital chance to re-introduce or repackage themselves to a public who might not know much about them.

How Australia’s ‘unfair’ dental system – and the way $1.3bn is spent – is driving inequality and leaving millions of people behind	Half of all government spending on dental care goes to private insurance rebates – meaning those without often skip treatment until things get worse Patients bear the brunt of dentist fees. But of the $1.3bn the federal government spends on the nation’s teeth, more than half goes to subsidising the uptake of private health insurance. The inequality of Australia’s dental care system can be seen in the numbers, says Peter Breadon, the health program director at the Grattan Institute.

Israel insists it is going ahead with Unrwa ban – what it may mean for Palestinians	UN agency ordered to vacate HQ by Thursday – just as aid is being increased to Gaza after ceasefire Israel has insisted it will not back down over its plan to close down the Gaza operations of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa), the UN relief agency for Palestinians, even though critics say the move will jeopardise urgent humanitarian aid efforts. Israel has ordered the UN agency to vacate its headquarters in East Jerusalem by Thursday, after the Israeli Knesset passed a law on 28 October banning its operations in Israel and the Palestinian territories. It has not yet said how it will implement a related law ending all Israeli government cooperation with Unwra, which could come into force on the same day and strangle its operations in the West Bank and Gaza.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/27/israel-insists-it-is-going-ahead-with-unrwa-ban-what-it-may-mean-for-palestinians	2025-01-27T01:34:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adff4b9663f772eb7daf31c395a32157b48f48d6/0_252_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7c97c99e527485eb0dc1d4dfac83f3b0

Auschwitz survivors return to camp as they and world leaders mark 80th anniversary of its liberation – live	Holocaust survivors return for memorial ceremony on 80th anniversary of liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp Europe and the world will commemorate the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the former Nazi German concentration and extermination camp Auschwitz today, putting the increasingly chaotic global politics on pause for a brief moment to reflect on the darkest moments of our history. But in a growingly polarised and aggressive world, the ceremony will also for many be a call for action and renewal of our collective memory. As the last survivors inevitably fade away, many fear that we risk forgetting the horrors of the Holocaust and the founding pledge on which Europe built the postwar order: never again.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/27/auschwitz-survivors-memorial-holocaust-ceremony-europe-latest-live-news	2025-01-26T23:58:38-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89f50104138212d073298c77cbe2846058250e28/0_137_8192_4915/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=59847bca5d2b5ba82446454a51f2b778
Monday briefing: What if the climate crisis makes disaster insurance unaffordable?	In today’s newsletter: The Los Angeles wildfires highlighted the immense challenges faced by the insurance industry amid the escalating risks of the climate crisis. Are there any potential solutions for homeowners? Good morning. If the Los Angeles wildfires are bracing evidence of the general threat posed by the climate crisis, they have also brought home a specific problem: how can you make the insurance system work when the risks are so high? That is not a question limited to California, or to the United States: the insurance industry has rated the climate crisis as the biggest threat to its future four years in a row, a very concrete riposte to those politicians who continue to question the reality of global heating. It is impossible to know whether a specific weather event like storm Éowyn in the UK has been caused by climate change – but we know that they, and the damage they leave in their wake, are only going to get more frequent. Israel-Gaza war | Donald Trump’s proposal that large numbers of Palestinians should leave Gaza to -just clean out- the whole strip has been rejected by US allies in the region. Trump’s intervention came as a deal was reached to allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza and release a civilian hostage who Israel said should have been freed already. Heathrow | Rachel Reeves has given her heaviest hint yet that she will back a third runway at Heathrow airport, arguing that she is willing to make difficult decisions while pursuing economic growth. Campaigners have warned that the move would be a severe setback for the UK’s climate commitments. Southport attack | Prevent’s assessment of the danger posed by Axel Rudakubana followed policy at the time, an official review will find – but it will criticise the scheme for rejecting extra help to tackle his interest in violence. The review of the way three referrals were handled before Rudakubana committed an atrocity in Southport is due to be published this week. AI | Ministers have shut down or dropped at least half a dozen artificial intelligence prototypes intended for the welfare system, the Guardian has learned, in a sign of the headwinds facing Keir Starmer’s effort to increase government efficiency. Belarus | Alexander Lukashenko is set to win a seventh five-year term as Belarusian president with 87.6% of the vote in Sunday’s election, according to an exit poll. The US and the EU said in the run-up to the election that it could not be free or fair because independent media are banned and all leading opposition figures have been jailed or forced to flee abroad.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/27/monday-briefing-will-the-climate-crisis-kill-off-disaster-insurance	2025-01-26T22:51:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03add73c9b2af5547f821b444886c401681ebea9/0_431_7914_4749/master/7914.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=15f15fd168fde2e4ce4975bea0ff8a4a

Workers who were considered to be on the frontline during the pandemic have seen no change to their working hours or shift patterns in recent years, according to research by Timewise, a social enterprise that helps businesses with flexible working policies.

Middle East live: Palestinians start to return to homes in north Gaza after Israeli hostage deal reached	Israel said it would stop blocking Palestinians from travelling north after agreement reached with Hamas on release of Israeli civilian Arbel Yehoud Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Middle East. Displaced Palestinians are expected to begin returning to their homes in northern Gaza on Monday, two days later than scheduled, after an agreement was reached between Israel and Hamas to release a civilian Israeli hostage. Israeli forces opened fire on people trying to return to their homes, killing at least 22 people, including a Lebanese soldier and six women, and injuring 124 amid a dispute with Lebanon over a ceasefire agreement. Israel said it would not allow civilians to return to southern Lebanon, and accused the Lebanese army of violating key commitments under the ceasefire deal. Videos showed tense face-offs between Israeli soldiers and tanks and Lebanese crowds waving banners and chanting slogans. The White House said late on Sunday that Israel and Lebanon had agreed to extend the deadline for Israeli troops to depart southern Lebanon until 18 February. Israeli prime minister Netanyahu said on Friday that the Lebanese state had not yet -fully enforced- a deal to secure the south, meant to ensure that Hezbollah withdrew beyond the Litani River. -To ‘clean’ Gaza immediately after the war would in fact be a continuation of the war, through the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people,- said Hassan Jabareen, the director of Palestinian rights group Adalah. Omer Shatz, a lecturer in international law at Sciences Po Paris and international criminal court (ICC) counsel, said Trump’s comments were a -call for ethnic cleansing- that echoed calls from extremist Israeli politicians and public figures dating to the start of the war. The US president had said Palestinians could move to countries including Jordan, which already hosts more than 2.7 million Palestinian refugees, and Egypt. -I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing at a different location where they can maybe live in peace for a change,- Trump told reporters on Air Force One. -You’re talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing and say: ‘You know, it’s over.’-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/27/middle-east-live-israel-palestinians-gaza-return-hostage-deal	2025-01-26T21:23:57-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9717d811a094a62121d4330ae7a7ffcf25495566/0_0_8064_4838/master/8064.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=216157cdf94d97c5b4ef80914283038b

Australia news live: Minns condemns vandalism of NSW police monument; Victorians brace for searing heat	Police launch investigation over defacement of wall of remembrance in the Domain. Follow today’s news live Peter Dutton says Holocaust education an important mission In his statement for International Holocaust Day, Peter Dutton, the opposition leader, drew parallels between current anti-semitism and the Holocaust. The weight of history will be especially felt by survivors and their families this International Holocaust Remembrance Day with 2025 marking the 80th Anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau. In the magnitude of anti-Semitism which is plaguing Western democracies today – including Australia – many citizens who have read about the history and horrors of the Holocaust have, for the first time, grasped how that catastrophe eventuated. They have seen, with their own eyes, a type of hate that, if left unchecked, unleashes greater evils. Educating Australians about atrocities of the Holocaust and the October 7 attacks is an important mission that deserves support. By gaining awareness of the persecution and atrocities committed against Jews, Australians will have a better understanding of why there is no place for antisemitism in our community. It was a pitiless and unrelenting act of cruelty that was long in the planning, cold in its calculation, and carried out on a scale that falls across the decades like a terrible shadow. The devastation felt when witnessing the horror, destruction and brutality inflicted by Hamas on October 7 is reminiscent of the dark and painful stories of the past. For the Australian Jewish community, those are the stories of their families. We embraced the Jewish community then, and we embrace you now. Tragically, we are not yet free of antisemitism. It stands in vile opposition to all we are as a nation and all that we have built - together - over generations. We will not tolerate it in any form. It has no place in our nation, and we will combat it with the full force of our laws and with total commitment from every level of government.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/jan/27/australia-news-live-chris-minns-police-victoria-melbourne-heatwave-antisemitism-holocaust-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-election-campaign	2025-01-26T12:36:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4df95bbd39d6732418f9ce4664dad230b74cdf77/612_45_2959_1775/master/2959.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=de858cb9e0b9306e309c79e90c8d7e4a

The framing of the shrew: California students photograph mammal never caught on film	Three young scientists set traps to capture and film species of special concern in move that can help conserve the shrew In a 7,000ft-high marshy spot in the cold, rugged eastern Sierra mountains, two groups of mammals scurried around at night. One was going about their normal nocturnal routine of hunting worms. The other was hoping for a glimpse of an elusive creature: the Mount Lyell shrew, the only known California mammal never photographed alive. The three young student scientists faced a tight timeline. They baited 150 pitfall traps – small cups dug into the earth to catch wandering creatures – with cat food and mealworms and monitored them across a 600ft area, checking each trap every two hours for any signs of their goal. They slept no more than two hours at a time. Shrews have such a fast metabolism that they die in traps quickly, one of the reasons this species had never been photographed or studied live.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/26/mount-lyell-shrew-california-photograph	2025-01-26T09:43:13-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/290d1f56a6b048b829ce818933cd13f74e098059/0_731_2914_1749/master/2914.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5890e19466a34d400bc20d7cb73033f1

People losing faith with democracy, economic shocks and environmental breakdowns are some of the potential triggers for a decline or collapse in social cohesion, the thinktank said. One warning sign of democracy being undermined is a lack of public trust in institutions, so it commissioned a survey of 2,000 adults by Opinium, which found 63% believe the very rich have too much influence on UK politics, ­compared to 40% for businesses and ­religious organisations, and 38% for ­international organisations, such as the EU and UN.	https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2025/jan/25/nearly-two-thirds-of-britons-say-very-rich-have-too-much-influence-on-politics	2025-01-25T08:23:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b190b7c4d605519a4c9b9425f9cd47b9c9ae251/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25b46cf185d4a9de713cdd02e94c9dcf

Britain’s response to Russian ‘spy ship’ is game of political messaging – for now	Deteriorating security environment and incidents in Baltic have forced military reassessment in northern Europe Submarines normally operate in secret, lurking in the deep. So when the British defence secretary, John Healey, authorised a Royal Navy Astute-class attack sub to surface close to the Russian -spy ship- Yantar south of Cornwall in November, it was unusual enough. What was even more notable, however, was that the minister went on to tell the House of Commons on Wednesday what he had done. It was, Healey said, conducted -strictly as a deterrent measure-, as was his decision to accuse the Kremlin of spying on the location of undersea communication and utility cables that connect Britain to the world.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/24/britain-russian-spy-ship-response-political-messaging	2025-01-23T22:00:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02c418d56f91cb671ee7e605f90e7e3d9bc12ed9/438_375_2231_1339/master/2231.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d3856ffd78c4f1e03be381ee626aad1f

Inquest exposes poor leadership, insufficient testing at aged care home that saw 19 Covid deaths in 2020	Deadly wave of Covid that hit Sydney’s Newmarch House made more severe by organisational failings, coroner says Some of the 19 deaths during a 2020 Covid-19 outbreak at a NSW aged-care home could have been avoided had proper testing for the virus been implemented, a coronial inquest has found. Poor leadership, insufficient communication and staff shortages were highlighted in coroner Derek Lee’s review of the deaths from a wave of the virus that swept through Sydney’s Newmarch House. If universal testing of staff had been performed once the outbreak had begun, and timelier reporting of results had allowed for cases of Covid-19 to be identified more readily, it would likely have reduced the extent and severity of the outbreak; Frontline management at Newmarch House did not clearly understand the chain of command and did not get effective support from Anglicare senior executives. -Consequently, Anglicare did not demonstrate adequate leadership and governance during the course of the outbreak-, Lee said; There was a lack of clarity at Newmarch House as to who, if anyone, bore ultimate responsibility for clinical decision-making; Anglicare did not give residents’ families enough specific information about their loved one, and in some cases it was inaccurate or understated the seriousness of what was occurring; During the initial stages of the outbreak there was a -significant deficiency- in the number of staff available which -meant that infection control and the care provided to residents was gravely jeopardised-.

Nato chief urges ‘step up’ in support for Ukraine	Vladimir Putin victory would lead to bloc’s members spending ‘trillions’ more on defence, says Mark Rutte The head of the Nato military alliance has called for a -step up- in support for Ukraine, to put Kyiv in the strongest position to achieve a sustainable peace deal with Russia.

UK will not accept EU offer to join pan-European customs union ‘at present time’, minister says – UK politics live	Housing minister shoots down idea floated by Maroš Šefčovič designed to help reset UK-EU discussions Good morning. The government is obsessed with finding any levers it can that might promote growth. At Davos yesterday Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, was asked if growth was even more important than promoting net zero, and she replied: -Well if [growth is] the number one mission it’s obviously the most important thing.- Today the government is announcing potentially significant plans that could limit the scope of judicial review applications to hold back growth. Pippa Crerar, Kiran Stacey and Sandra Laville have the details here. Economists argue that an obvious move to promote growth would be to have close trade links with the EU. But the government has ruled out rejoining the single market or the custom union (let alone rejoining the EU proper – which is still largely a taboo proposal in most parts of UK politics). And today a minister has ruled out an EU proposal for the UK to join, not the customs union, but a customs union with the EU. Šefčovič referred to the idea of the UK joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM). These are common rules that allow parts, ingredients and materials for manufacturing supply chains to be sourced from across dozens of countries in Europe and North Africa to be used in tariff-free trade. We’re not seeking to participate in that particular arrangement. I think in general the government’s been very clear … we do want a closer relationship with our European partners, both in trading terms, but also, importantly … in terms of security and defense cooperation, where we need to work far more closely. So absolutely, yes, we do want a closer relationship.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/23/keir-starmer-eu-sadiq-khan-latest-live-politics-news	2025-01-23T01:28:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9bddca2b2830e514cc80df9cdacbccd2233cb74/0_98_5552_3331/master/5552.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9267462122b06c19f2bbf9085fa48f19
Trump suggests it was a mistake for Biden not to pardon himself – US politics live	US president says his predecessor gave ‘everybody pardons’ but says it is a ‘sad thing’ he didn’t give himself one Donald Trump has described attacks on police officers at the US Capitol on January 6 2021 as -very minor incidents- as he sought to defend his decision to pardon the insurrectionists. The US president hinted that those who put him through -four years of hell- via criminal prosecutions should themselves be investigated, adding ominously that his predecessor, Joe Biden, made a mistake by not pardoning himself. Most of the people were absolutely innocent. OK. But forgetting all about that, these people have served, horribly, a long time. It would be very, very cumbersome to go and look – you know how many people we’re talking about? 1,500 people.- This guy went around giving everybody pardons. And you know, the funny thing, maybe the sad thing, is he didn’t give himself a pardon. And if you look at it, it all had to do with him.- Joe Biden has very bad advisers. Somebody advised Joe Biden to give pardons to everybody but him.- Donald Trump has described attacks on police officers at the US Capitol on January 6 2021 as -very minor incidents- as he sought to defend his decision to pardon the insurrectionists. Those pardoned include more than 250 people who were convicted of assault charges, some having attacked police with makeshift weapons such as flagpoles, a hockey stick and a crutch. Trump also used the prime-time Fox News interview to discuss his barrage of executive orders, dismiss security concerns over Chinese-owned app TikTok (-Is it that important for China to be spying on young people, on young kids watching crazy videos?-) and discuss the possibility of cutting off federal funds to so-called -sanctuary cities- that shield undocumented immigrants from federal detention requests. On Thursday, Trump will speak remotely at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, delivering his first major speech to global business and political leaders. He is due to give a speech and engage in a dialogue at 11am US Eastern Time (4pm GMT), according to the meeting schedule. It is not clear what he will discuss. The new US presidential envoy for special missions has pushed back against Nato chief, Mark Rutte’s talk at the World Economic Forum about Ukraine joining Nato, pointing out many members of the alliance aren’t paying their -fair share- already. Richard Grenell, appointed by Trump in December, said it is -pretty shocking- that so many foreign ministers in Europe, and so many US politicians, did not try to stop the Russia-Ukraine war, and criticised Biden’s handling of the situation.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/23/donald-trump-pardons-january-6-us-president-joe-biden-jd-vance-republicans-live-news	2025-01-23T00:42:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5fcf45c541301d81dc486432ff09d991a9e5b5f/196_30_1282_769/master/1282.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=db34cd3853a8542998b1b626bcb60c4f
