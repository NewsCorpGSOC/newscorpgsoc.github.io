Pete Hegseth’s nomination hangs on key senator as more details of drinking emerge – US politics live	Senator Joni Ernst expected to be key to fate of Trump’s Pentagon pick; media reports say Hegseth faced HR investigation over Fox Christmas party antics Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, will be back once again on Capitol Hill today to try to convince Republican senators that he’s the right man to lead the Pentagon. Reports of excessive drinking, financial mismanagement and poor treatment of women, as well as a sexual assault allegation, have dogged his nomination over the past days, with several conservative lawmakers expressing doubts over approving him for the job. But the most important voice in determining his fate has not piped up yet: Iowa’s Republican senator Joni Ernst. The army veteran and sexual assault survivor met with Hegseth yesterday but said little publicly about their talk. Her views on him will be pivotal in determining whether the former Fox News host’s nomination advances, or goes the way of Matt Gaetz. Meanwhile, the New York Times has uncovered more details of incidents Hegseth was involved in while employed by the conservative network. These include another story of him drinking to excess, as well as an incident at a Christmas party eight years ago that led to an investigation from Fox News’s human resources department. We’ll see what Republican senators have to say about that throughout today. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be together in public again at 6pm ET to light the national Christmas tree outside the White House. The pair have not been seen together much since Harris lost last month’s presidential election to Trump. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are heading to the Capitol today to promote the Department of Government Efficiency, their unorthodox, Trump-sanctioned idea to cut spending and downsize Washington’s federal organs. The House committee investigating the attempted assassination of Trump will hear testimony from acting Secret Service director Ronald Rowe Jr, and will also mark up its final report.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/dec/05/trump-hegseth-defense-drinking-us-politics-latest-updates	2024-12-05T06:01:43-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b780f6d71d2b25177f08a1e727674413bdeb0c12/1160_481_3360_2016/master/3360.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dec94b935632b4c6c5acaa8a1f14ada4

Thursday briefing: What the martial law attempt means for South Korea’s future	In today’s newsletter: Yoon Suk Yeol’s shock declaration – and subsequent reversal – has sent South Korea into political chaos, and left their president facing impeachment Good morning. South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, is facing impeachment after he sent heavily armed forces into Seoul’s streets with his baffling and sudden declaration of martial law on Tuesday. The move stirred memories of past dictatorships in the country, moving thousands to come out on to the streets and protest, with the military powerless, or unwilling, to do anything about it. Opposition parties submitted an impeachment motion hours after parliament unanimously voted to cancel Yoon’s declaration, forcing him to lift martial law just six hours after it began. Impeaching Yoon requires the support of two-thirds of the national assembly and at least six of the nine constitutional court justices. The liberal opposition Democratic party holds a majority in the 300-seat parliament and has called for Yoon’s resignation. A vote on his impeachment could come as early as tomorrow. Today we’ll look at what happened and why. But first, here are the headlines.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/05/thursday-briefing-south-korea-martial-law-first-edition	2024-12-04T22:45:36-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4662818167d8e8775f4e37f88d6a87e40c498a6f/0_72_7432_4462/master/7432.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=073d3a77a2c1d730676487a67fb3f53d

Australia news live: Greens propose new national drug testing regime	The minor party have announced an election policy for the federal expansion of pill testing. Follow today’s news live The Greens’s new election policy for a federal expansion of pill testing would involve the creation of a new drug testing agency. The agency, housed within the federal department of health and aged care, would coordinate and run drug testing sites in capital cities and regional hubs as well as providing free testing services at Australian music festivals. At the moment the biggest danger facing young people using drugs at festivals isn’t the substance itself but a failure of government policy that doesn’t allow people to be able to check what is in that drug and access education and medical services when needed. We have a system designed to criminalise and stigmatise people who take drugs in our community which has led to tragic outcomes.

South Korea crisis live: President Yoon faces impeachment calls amid martial law outcry	Opposition Democratic party lawmakers call on Yoon Suk Yeol to resign immediately or they would seek his impeachment Welcome to our continuing live coverage of the political crisis in South Korea following President Yoon Suk Yeol’s sudden and short-lived declaration of military law on Tuesday night. Here is a quick summary of recent developments: President Yoon is facing mounting calls to step down after he declared martial law in a surprise, late-night address on Tuesday, a severe measure he said was necessary to safeguard the country’s liberal democracy from -anti-state forces- and -threats posed by North Korea-. Within hours Yoon had backtracked, saying that troops would return to their barracks and the order would be lifted after a cabinet meeting. The main opposition Democratic party has said it will attempt to impeach Yoon if he refuses to tender his resignation immediately. Even Yoon’s own aides have offered to resign -en masse-. Yoon’s martial law order included a six-point decree that banned political activities and parties, -false propaganda-, strikes and -gatherings that incite social unrest-. The order also brought all media outlets under the authority of martial law and directed all medical staff, including striking doctors, to return to work within 48 hours. The move was met with vociferous condemnation and widely defied. Despite the deployment of troops and helicopters on the roof of the parliament building, 190 lawmakers managed to enter the building and proceeded to unanimously vote to reject Yoon’s declaration and call for martial law to be lifted. On the streets, hundreds protested, and chanted for the president to be arrested. To successfully impeach Yoon, a two-thirds majority is required in the legislature. Opposition parties together control 192 of the 300 seats in the national assembly, so would need lawmakers from Yoon’s own party to join them. This the first time that martial law has been declared in South Korea in more than four decades, alarming allies. The United States, which stations nearly 30,000 troops in South Korea to protect it from the nuclear-armed North, initially voiced deep concern at the declaration, then relief that martial law was over. The UK Foreign Office’s minister for the Indo-Pacific, Catherine West, issued a statement, calling for -a peaceful resolution to the situation, in accordance with the law and the constitution of the Republic of Korea-. To many watching from outside, the sudden political chaos appears to have come out of nowhere. But inside South Korea, Democratic party lawmaker Kim Min-seok had warned in recent months that Yoon was gearing up to declare martial law. Korea analysts say concerns had grown after several key military positions, related to defence, counterintelligence, and information on North Korea had been filled by individuals who graduated from the same school as the president. Opposition figures such as Kim suggested these figures could play a critical role in enforcing martial law in a contingency.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/04/south-korea-crisis-live-blog-martial-law-yoon-suk-yeol-impeachment-calls	2024-12-03T19:52:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45dc0fd1dd347355fbb84390137de4ee4e30e270/0_48_7173_4306/master/7173.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a64466abf3d64dd83c8743a4d440650b

More than 90% of people caught with small amounts of illicit drugs criminalised in NSW despite diversion reforms	Exclusive: Police used discretion to divert just 6.9% of people caught with personal use quantities of drugs from criminal justice system, data shows A New South Wales government program that gives police discretion to divert people found with small quantities of illicit drugs away from the courts has only been extended to 6.9% of people caught, including just 2.6% of those who are Indigenous. The major reform by the Minns government came into effect in February this year and was flagged by the attorney general, Michael Daley, as a way to treat drug use as a health issue rather than a criminal one.

Russian strikes pounded hospitals and neighborhoods in the rebel-held northern region of Idlib as insurgents continued to fight Bashar al-Assad’s forces, against whom they have made significant and surprising gains in the past week.

US history of enslavement in spotlight as Biden speaks in Angola	Joe Biden to make speech at Angola’s National Museum of Slavery in what could be his last foreign trip as president Joe Biden will address America’s history of enslavement in a speech on Tuesday at Angola’s National Museum of Slavery, during a trip in which he is also expected to laud recent US investment in the region. Biden’s visit to the museum will take in the 17th-century Capela da Casa Grande, where enslaved people were forcibly baptised before being trafficked across the Atlantic. About 4 million Angolans were enslaved in the Americas from the 16th to the 19th century, most in Brazil.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/03/us-history-of-enslavement-in-spotlight-joe-biden-angola	2024-12-03T02:52:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6aa40e7e7dd44f4f23270a36ea87a08353df725/522_533_4620_2772/master/4620.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b8531f221f9216ea56c6865b0a667feb
White House defends Biden’s pardon as Trump hints at potential clemency for January 6 rioters – US politics live	Spokesperson says president feared political opponents would attack Hunter in future, while Trump speaks supportively about US Capitol attackers The White House said on Monday that president Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter in part to protect him from future persecution from political opponents, but his move drew fierce criticism, with some Democrats saying it undermined public trust in the rule of law. Biden, a Democrat whose term ends on 20 January when Republican president-elect Donald Trump takes office, signed an unconditional pardon for Hunter Biden on Sunday and said he believed his son had been selectively prosecuted and targeted unfairly by the president’s political opponents. Donald Trump seized on Hunter Biden’s pardon to drop one of his strongest hints yet that he intends to grant clemency to at least some of the instigators and participants of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by a mob trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat. -Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years?

Stalking victims to be told perpetrator’s identity, says Jess Phillips	Tougher guidance in England and Wales will also prevent convicted stalkers from contacting victims while in prison Victims of stalking will be given the right to know the identity of the person who is doing it, Jess Phillips, the UK safeguarding minister has said, as part of a wider look at whether legislation connected to the crime is fit for purpose. Under new guidance from the Home Office, police in England and Wales will be told to inform people if they uncover the identity of a stalker, for example one using a series of anonymous online identities.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/03/stalking-victims-to-be-told-perpetrator-identity-jess-phillips	2024-12-03T01:35:28-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed62014c7c961b8db1f006694778cbdf78439070/0_147_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=98d84be93fee1a0a8924e06b45dd4e9f
Jess Phillips announces measures to give stalking victims more protection – UK politics live	Minister for safeguarding unveils measures including ‘right to know’, ensuring police tell victims the identity of online stalkers as soon as they can Good morning. Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, was the government voice on the morning broadcast round. She says she is unveiling six measures to protect the victims of stalking, including -right to know- guidance intended to ensure that the police tell victims the identity of online stalkers as soon as they can. Speaking on Times Radio, Phillips said: I have been a victim of stalking, and I wasn’t told [the identity of the stalker]. I didn’t have the right to know. And in most of the cases of my stalkers, they made it clear who they were as part of their desire to control and frighten me. I’m afraid to say that I’ve had more than one in my life. This was a case raised by Nicola Thorp, where somebody had been stalking her over multiple identities online, and when they said the police told her that they’d found out who it was, they then told her that they couldn’t tell her who it was. And so everybody became her stalker – the person she was sat next to on the street – and already, when you’re living through something as harrowing as somebody stalking you and making you feel frightened and anxious, the idea that then you have to distrust all of the people around you as well just seems like a terrible added burden … and so that is what we’re going to eliminate.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/03/jess-phillips-stalking-protection-measures-violence-women-girls-labour-conservatives-uk-politics-latest-updates	2024-12-03T01:28:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96259a15387bf3a6c9e633b39aa1bed070ec3d51/0_458_7728_4637/master/7728.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=82f9db3d83ed556585d970da54199f2c

Middle East crisis live: ceasefire on edge after deadly Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon	Nine people reported killed as military hits Hezbollah targets while the Iran-backed group fires on IDF positions Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. The ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah is looking increasingly fragile after both sides exchanged fire and accused each other of violating the US-brokered truce less than a week after it came into force. US president-elect Donald Trump demanded the immediate release of Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza, saying that if they are not freed before he is sworn into office for a second term there will be -hell to pay- A wave of airstrikes pummelled hospitals and neighbourhoods in the rebel-held region of Idlib in northern Syria as Islamist insurgents continued to battle forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad after the militants’ lightning assault on Aleppo. At least 18 people were killed and 35 injured, White Helmets civil defence forces based in Idlib said Iranian-backed Iraqi militias crossed into eastern Syria overnight in an attempt to shore up struggling forces loyal to Damascus, battling an insurgency that has swept much of the country’s north-west as Islamist militants seized control of Aleppo.

Tuesday briefing: Why Ireland bucked the trend for punishing incumbent governments	In today’s newsletter: After a general election, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil look set to retain power – how have two main, centre-right parties avoided the kicking seen elsewhere? Good morning. All over the western world, incumbent governments have been given a kicking over the cost of living crisis. But in the Irish election, where the counting of results concluded yesterday, it’s a very different story. Not long ago, Sinn Féin appeared on course to win the popular vote and become the leading party in a new coalition, but its support fell away badly earlier this year. Instead, Ireland’s traditionally dominant parties of the centre-right, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, appear to have it sown up again.

Foreign policy | Keir Starmer has -utterly rejected- the idea that the UK must choose between the United States and Europe when Donald Trump comes to power. In a major foreign policy speech in London, Starmer said the UK would -never turn away- from the US but would continue to -reset- the relationship with Europe.

NT government’s bid to not supply safe drinking water to Indigenous communities is ‘shocking,’ lawyer says	Lawyer says they are ‘wasting time in court’ rather than working to fix the water in towns across the Northern Territory Lawyers for Aboriginal residents of a remote town in the Northern Territory say it is -shocking and disappointing- that the NT government is trying to overturn a landmark court ruling which found it was legally required to provide them safe drinking water. The challenge is the latest development in a five-year legal stoush between the NT government and residents of Laramba, an Aboriginal community 205km north-west of Alice Springs, who took the government to court over elevated levels of uranium in their drinking water.

Families and doctors grappling with a crisis that has claimed about 900,000 lives say the move may signal that a second Trump administration will finally get serious about tackling the flow of fentanyl into the US.

UK politics live: Labour under pressure over housing and waiting list targets	Health bosses reportedly concerned about government’s focus while council leaders are said to believe building targets are unrealistic Good morning. Keir Starmer is giving a speech on Thursday and you can tell that it is important because No 10 started briefing on what it is going to say in a news release to journalists sent out on Friday. He is going to announce a -plan for change- that will include -measurable milestones-. In the earlier briefing Keir Starmer said it would be -the most ambitious yet honest programme for government in a generation-. But hang on – hasn’t Starmer announced plenty of -measurable milestones- already? In 2023 he announced five missions, which he said were not just conventional performance targets but part of an attempt to make government more strategic and focused on the long term. The five headline missions all included sub-missions, so arguably there were around 26 targets or pledges in the document. Then, as the election approached, Labour simplified matter by announcing six first steps for change. Health bosses accept the need to focus on the government’s political priority but say ministers will need to accept trade-offs to achieve it. -If the priority is putting all the money into electives, what we will see is warzone A&amp;E departments and all sorts of other things being sidelined,- said an NHS source. -It will have a number of casualties, including mental health, community care and waits in A&amp;E.- Local councils have told the government its flagship plan to build 1.5m new homes in England over the next five years is -unrealistic- and -impossible to achieve-, the BBC can reveal. The vast majority of councils expressed concern about the plan in a consultation exercise carried out by Angela Rayner’s housing department earlier this year. Labour-run Broxtowe council in Nottinghamshire described the proposed changes as -very challenging, if not impossible to achieve-. South Tyneside, another Labour-run council, said the plans were -wholly unrealistic-, while the independent-run council in Central Bedfordshire, said the area would be left -absolutely swamped with growth that the infrastructure just can not support-.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/02/uk-politics-live-keir-starmer-nhs-waiting-lists-housebuilding	2024-12-02T01:26:47-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbbb3b129af7eddfb7bcae46eecfd7ac2802175c/0_138_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=689be9bcdd5019b7e3adb5768eb64183

Who are the Syrian rebels HTS who have advanced in Aleppo?	The fast-moving offensive began on Wednesday, surprising forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad and his allies Eight years ago, indiscriminate Russian airstrikes helped the forces of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, drive rebels from Aleppo – a crucial turning point in the country’s civil war, which has largely been in a state of stalemate since 2020. Over the weekend a stunning rebel offensive seized Aleppo again – and the Assad regime now faces its greatest threat in years.

Monday briefing: How the civil war in Syria reignited	In today’s newsletter: President Bashar al-Assad’s forces were driven from Aleppo over the weekend by a rebel offensive, forcing global attention to turn back to the country • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. Eight years ago, indiscriminate Russian airstrikes helped Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad’s forces drive rebels from Aleppo, the country’s second-largest city. Assad’s victory in Aleppo, once a symbolic stronghold of the Syrian rebellion, relied on a brutal -surrender or starve- strategy that killed thousands of civilians and forced many more to flee. It was seen as a turning point in the country’s civil war, which has largely been in a state of stalemate since 2020. But over the weekend, a stunning rebel offensive seized Aleppo again – leaving the Assad regime facing the greatest threat to its control in years. Yesterday, Syrian and Russian airstrikes pummeled opposition controlled areas in response. Whatever happens next, if the frozen conflict in Syria has become a -forgotten war- as attention has focused on Gaza and Ukraine, it will now be impossible to ignore. US politics | Joe Biden has issued -a full and unconditional- pardon to his son Hunter Biden covering convictions on federal gun and tax charges.

Immigration and asylum | The number of small boat arrivals since Keir Starmer took power has passed 20,000, with the Home Office claiming a record number of calm autumnal days in the Channel was responsible. 6,288 people crossed the Channel over 31 days in October and November, compared with 768 over the same period in 2023. Georgia | Protesters rallied in Georgia’s capital for a fourth consecutive night on Sunday amid signs of widening opposition to the government’s decision to suspend talks on joining the European Union.

Follow today’s news live A year-long review of Australia’s research and development investment will soon be underway in an effort to boost the country’s scientific output and manufacturing self-sufficiency. The science minister, Ed Husic, announced on Monday the review will inquire into the value of existing investments and ties between research and industry in order for Australia to boost its value and drive productivity. Our ideas and intellectual property are an indicator of future economic success. This review is designed to give us an evidence-based pathway to stronger growth.

Romania elections: ruling Social Democrats on course for most votes	Exit poll suggests leftwing PSD poised to defeat resurgent far-right movement in parliamentary election Romania’s ruling leftwing Social Democrats (PSD) look set to have won the most votes in Sunday’s parliamentary election, defeating a resurgent far-right movement challenging the country’s pro-western orientation, an exit poll shows. The vote is the second of three ballots for a new parliament and a new president, after the first round of the presidential election on 24 November in which an independent far-right candidate, Călin Georgescu, emerged from relative obscurity to become the frontrunner.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/01/romania-parliamentary-election-social-democrats-far-right	2024-12-01T11:27:41-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f765a17fa7d424caacb33635daa92b42302ba74a/209_430_4358_2615/master/4358.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=65a416e02c112293f25746fe62a27d12
Rebels behind Aleppo’s surprise fall took advantage of Russian and Iranian distraction	Forces only took three days to take the city from Bashar al-Assad’s regime, but the Middle East’s newest conflict looks set to last It was not Kyiv that fell in three days, but Aleppo. A surprise offensive launched by Syrian rebels from the north west of the country last week has reignited a dormant conflict – and revealed a change in the balance of power caused not by one but two nearby wars, in Ukraine and Lebanon and the Middle East. Aleppo was the scene of fierce and destructive fighting between 2012 and 2016 when the Syrian civil war was at its height. Rebel groups were forced out as Syrian government forces supporting the president, Bashar al-Assad, were able to capture the country’s second city, with the help of Russia and its air force.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/01/rebels-behind-aleppos-surprise-fall-took-advantage-of-russian-and-iranian-distraction	2024-12-01T11:10:19-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79273eba299052369f8e4feb04a08a838d46a10a/0_0_5416_3250/master/5416.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7ec6080ff8a80df14a8905d3d7f74a7d

Conspiracy theorist Kash Patel, Trump’s pick to lead FBI, faces Senate blowback	‘Deep state’ critic who has threatened to shut down agency’s headquarters could face tough confirmation battle Donald Trump’s plan to nominate as FBI director the -deep state- conspiracy theorist Kash Patel, a virulent critic of the bureau who has threatened to fire its top echelons and shut down the agency’s headquarters, is facing blowback in Congress as US senators begin to flex their muscles ahead of a contentious confirmation process. Politicians from both main parties took to the Sunday talk shows to express starkly divergent views on Patel, whom Trump announced on Saturday as his pick to lead the most powerful law enforcement agency in the US.

House minority leader asks for ‘maximum protection’ after bomb threats target Democrats	Hoax threats come days after similar threats to Republicans set to fill roles in incoming Trump administration American lawmakers are on edge after a wave of hoax bomb threats targeted figures across the political spectrum and prompted the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives to demand that Congress take action to provide -maximum protection-.

‘Absolutely outrageous’: wealthy residents living in shadow of Harrods wage war on e-bikes	Cycle chaos on streets has made the south-west London area a ‘scrapyard’, threatening pedestrians’ safety, say householders Anyone popping into Harrods for a lobster roll at lunch or to pick up a new Jimmy Choo handbag in advance of the Christmas rush may have to watch their step on nearby pavements in case they walk into a haphazardly parked e-bike. The streets surrounding the historic department store have become the unlikely latest front in the problem of e-bikes being dumped on thoroughfares, blocking pedestrians and causing disruption to disabled people, who are trying to navigate the already densely populated paths. Residents in Kensington ­complain that there are so many e-bikes being parked in some of the streets that they have difficulty leaving their multi-million-pound homes. The area, they say, has turned into a -scrapyard- as tourists and commuters dump the rental bikes on the pavement when the designated collection bays are full.	https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/nov/30/absolutely-outrageous-wealthy-residents-living-in-shadow-of-harrods-wage-war-on-e-bikes	2024-11-30T06:04:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74be4528a54a1128a745ebfc38502c38f366b714/0_0_4980_2988/master/4980.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=980454f3d4f048fe92a97eff38c49d76

Labour urged to take immediate action on palliative care after MPs back assisted dying – UK politics live	Layla Moran, chair of the health and social care select committee said Wes Streeting should be taking a more proactive approach to the issue Liberal Democrat Layla Moran, chair of the health and social care select committee, voted for the assisted dying bill in the House of Commons yesterday. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, she said she has -long believed, especially in the cases of terminally ill adults, that they should have that choice at the end of life-. I’ve been moved by personal experiences, my best friend’s mother contracted cancer about 20 years ago and we lived in Belgium at the time. She started the process but in fact died before she was able to complete the legal part of the process because the cancer was so aggressive. I saw how taking back that little bit of control in her life was important to her. I was disappointed. I was expecting an announcement from Wes Streeting yesterday to say ‘look, we’ve heard and we are going to do something’ … immediate funding commitments and a view to making sure this is dealt with in the next year or two. I would argue that, whether this passes or not, that is one of the key messages that came out of the debate. Those who don’t want an assisted death and don’t want to take part in providing assisted dying can opt out of it, don’t have to do it, don’t choose to end their lives that way. So it offers everyone equal choice, whatever their religion.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/30/assisted-dying-bill-uk-politics-latest-news-kim-leadbeater-labour	2024-11-30T00:44:21-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3e77a13b9f797982fb881d688a8436474ad698c/0_131_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4ac8df8a0b38a1ed458e902b633ef390

First Thing: Trump victory ‘not a mandate for radical change’	US expert says models showed voters did not seek sweeping transformation. Plus: hiker found alive after 50 days lost Good morning. Despite Donald Trump’s decisive victory in the presidential election, a political scientist who developed a model that correctly predicted his sweep of battleground states warns that voters have not necessarily given the president-elect a mandate to make radical changes. What did Trump’s Ukraine envoy pick controversially propose? The retired lieutenant general Keith Kellogg has written that the US could help end the war by withdrawing weapons from Ukraine if it does not enter peace talks – and giving even more weapons to Ukraine if Russia does not do the same. What’s Musk’s latest big idea? The tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has been tapped to run a -department of government efficiency- has said he wants to -delete- the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal watchdog that helps protect consumers from predatory financial practices. Did they discuss tariffs? No, according to Sheinbaum, but she nevertheless said that her conversation with Trump had reassured her that no tit-for-tat tariff battle would be needed in future.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/29/first-thing-trump-victory-not-a-mandate-for-radical-change	2024-11-29T04:05:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a3872c59deb7bd3a9ed8ac995c98ebedea575d9/0_484_4973_2985/master/4973.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=00b5cc102092e8b05358e2118db2e6fd
Trump cabinet picks shaped by new power centers in his orbit	Boris Epshteyn, Susie Wiles and JD Vance hold outsized influence in the president-elect’s administration selections Donald Trump’s picks for the incoming administration are being shaped by a combination of different power centers including one-man influences like top Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn and combined groups led by chief of staff Susie Wiles and vice-president-elect JD Vance.

Ukraine war live: Russian defence minister says ties with North Korea ‘expanding in all areas’ during visit	Andrei Belousov arrives in Pyongyang for political and military talks; Putin threatens Kyiv with hypersonic missile Photos released by Russia’s defence ministry showed Belousov walking alongside North Korean defense minister, No Kwang Chol, on a red carpet laid out at a Pyongyang airport. According to the AP, North Korean military officials were seen clapping under a banner that read: Complete support and solidarity with the fighting Russian army and people.- Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike Kyiv with Oreshnik missiles, an intermediate-range weapon that Moscow used against the city of Dnipro last week and that Putin has claimed cannot be shot down by any air defence system. It came after Moscow pummelled Ukraine’s energy grid in an attack that left a million people without power. Russia fired more than 90 missiles and about 100 drones during the barrage, according to Kyiv, with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy urging his allies to respond firmly to what he dubbed Russian -blackmail-. Putin said the fresh bombardment was a -response- to Ukrainian strikes on his territory with western missiles. Russian drone attacks on Ukraine injured at least eight people and damaged residential buildings in the capital Kyiv and in the southern Odesa region overnight, officials said on Friday. Ukraine’s air force said in a statement that, of 132 drones launched against the country overnight, it had downed 88 drones, while 41 were -lost-, likely due to electronic warfare, and one returned to the Russian territory. Georgian riot police deployed teargas and water cannon against demonstrators protesting a government decision to delay asking for EU accession, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reporters witnessed. Thousands rallied in the capital Tbilisi and cities across Georgia after prime minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, announced the decision amid a post-election crisis that saw the country’s president challenge the legitimacy of the newly elected parliament and government. Donald Trump’s plan to tap the retired US Lt Gen Keith Kellogg as US envoy to Ukraine and Russia has triggered renewed interest in a policy document he co-authored.

Weather tracker: Indonesia flash floods and landslides leave dozens dead	Rescuers in Sumatra search for people trapped in cars after landslide triggered by torrential rainfall Last week, torrential rainfall across Indonesia’s largest island, Sumatra, triggered flash floods and landslides, causing widespread destruction. Twenty people died earlier this week in four areas in North Sumatra province amid flash floods and landslides. On Thursday morning, another devastating landslide claimed seven more lives. This landslide struck the main access route between Medan, the provincial capital, and surrounding regions, burying vehicles – including a tourist bus – in mud, rocks, and trees. More than 10 people were injured as a result and rushed to the nearest hospital in Medan. Rescue efforts are continuing, with several vehicles still trapped in the debris. North Sumatra’s traffic director estimated that it may take up to two days to evacuate those affected. Flash floods and landslides are a frequent occurrence in Indonesia owing to seasonal rainfall from October to March, caused by the Asia-Australia monsoon circulation system. This phenomenon causes wind to blow from Asia to Australia, bringing increased water vapour and consequential rainfall to Indonesia. Teleconnections such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation can also influence rainfall patterns, with the likely upcoming La Niña phase expected to bring further extreme weather by the end of the year, intensifying the risk of flooding and landslides as sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean drop below average and easterly trade winds strengthen, pushing additional moisture into the region.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/29/weather-tracker-indonesia-flash-floods-landslides-dozens-dead-sumatra	2024-11-29T00:04:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96c6dd4a54edadd20fafb546714e2bed630c07f6/0_37_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5581eef7e0fca0ac384536017b49ef79

First Thing: Canada leaders agree to unite against Trump tariff threat	Deputy PM says ‘we need to be smart, strong and united’. Plus: plastic lobbyists in rear-guard action • Don’t already get First Thing in your inbox? Sign up here Good morning. Canada’s federal government and the premiers of the 10 provinces have agreed to work together against a threat by the US president-elect, Donald Trump, to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian imports, with one official saying the country was already examining possible retaliatory measures. What are tariffs? A tariff is a tax on imports, or foreign goods brought into a country, and paid for by the importing companies. The way that tariffs work, in Trump’s mind, is that high tariffs will incentivize American companies to move their manufacturing from abroad to the US. What did political commentators have to say? Jeet Heer, a writer for the leftwing Nation magazine, said: -Is it too much to ask for a little humility and self-reflection from the people whose strategies failed badly?-	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/28/first-thing-canada-leaders-unite-against-trump-tariff-threat	2024-11-28T03:39:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e4c86eb4f584b05618114fac1cd05239d26ec49/0_154_8606_5167/master/8606.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a6abb2bf61144f53f7b8b02ca466fb24
Daniel Khalife: a fantasist or a player in the world of spies?	The young man who escaped Wandsworth prison offered a mixed picture of ineptitude and threat, according to police At the heart of the Daniel Khalife trial has been the question: is he an amateurish fantasist who convinced himself he was playing a game of chess with spies, or a consequential character in the global world of espionage? The answer, the police have said, is a bit of both. They believed Khalife to be inept in many regards. Khalife’s own barrister, Gul Nawaz Hussain KC, said he was -hapless- and -sometimes bordering on the slapstick- – more Scooby-Doo than 007.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/28/daniel-khalife-a-fantasist-or-a-player-in-the-world-of-spies	2024-11-28T03:15:55-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70d9286b9ae1df4d1c28a8a40f61d5b33c96c8ed/0_30_2443_1465/master/2443.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b00b4025b5739ae2b213bc03f7404185

Net migration falling, latest figures expected to show, as Tories claim it is due to their visa rule changes – UK politics live	Kemi Badenoch gave speech on Wednesday referring to James Cleverly’s 2023 visa rule changes, while government says it is important to tackle causes of high migration Good morning. The latest immigration figures are out this morning, but the political debate about them has already started. They are expected to show net migration figures falling, and the Conservatives say that is because of decisions they took before the general election. They are referring to the sweeping changes to visa rules announced by James Cleverly in December last year. Kemi Badenoch deployed this line at the start of her speech on immigration yesterday, saying: Tomorrow, immigration figures will be released that should show a drop in net migration. This is because of the changes we made in the last year of the Conservative government. The figures we saw for 2023 were astonishing. They highlighted a big problem we must be honest about. Even if we see a decline in tomorrow’s data, the fact is immigration, both legal and illegal, is too high. We want to see net migration coming down, but we have to do so in a way that is tackling the causes of net migration, because if much of net migration has been driven by recruiting workers from overseas, you also have to look at what the impact on the economy would be.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/28/figures-net-migration-expected-falling-conservatives-labour-uk-politics-latest-updates	2024-11-28T01:03:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70649bde267d16e1958aae6630b191bf22f59c17/0_331_5693_3418/master/5693.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c42318f385f554a258bbf49cc5210a1d

Middle East crisis live: Hezbollah says its hands are still ‘on the trigger’ amid uneasy ceasefire	Iran-backed Lebanese militia says it remains ‘fully equipped’ and will monitor Israel’s withdrawal In its first statement since a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah took effect on Wednesday, the Lebanese militia proclaimed -victory- without making any direct mention of the ceasefire. The militia said its fighters -remain fully equipped to deal with the aspirations and assaults of the Israeli enemy- and that its forces would monitor Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon -with their hands on the trigger-. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said the Lebanon ceasefire was the -first ray of hope- in the regional conflict after the -darkness of the past months-. -It is essential that those who signed the ceasefire commitment respect it in full,- Guterres said on Wednesday. He reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. In a sign of how volatile the situation remains, Israeli forces opened fire on a number of cars that attempted to enter what it said was a restricted area on Wednesday. Doubts over whether the ceasefire would hold were widespread on both sides. Supporters of Hezbollah, which has suffered heavy losses since October 2023, celebrated the group’s survival and waved its yellow and green flag across southern Beirut on Wednesday. Iran, Hezbollah’s ally, welcomed the end of Israel’s -aggression- in Lebanon. In Israel, the ceasefire has met a more mixed reaction where rightwingers and residents of Israel’s north have criticised the agreement. Dozens of people gathered outside the Israeli army’s headquarters in Tel Aviv on Tuesday night to protest against the ceasefire. The French government has claimed that Benjamin Netanyahu has immunity from arrest warrants issued by the international criminal court (ICC) for war crimes on the grounds that Israel is not an ICC member. The claim came soon after Netanyahu’s cabinet agreed to a French-backed ceasefire in Lebanon and is in contrast to Paris’s attitude towards last year’s ICC war crimes warrant issued against Vladimir Putin, another leader of a non-member country. Netanyahu said Israel had submitted to the ICC its intention to appeal against the arrest warrants, and demand a delay in their implementation. In a statement from his office, he said: -Should the ICC reject the appeal, this will underscore to Israel’s friends in the US and around the world how biased the ICC is against the state of Israel.- The ceasefire in Lebanon came after Israel launched the heaviest day of raids on Beirut, including a series of strikes in the city’s centre. At least 42 people were killed in Israeli strikes on Beirut and the south of Lebanon before the ceasefire began. Hezbollah also fired rockets into Israel, triggering air raid sirens. In Gaza, the death toll passed 44,282 on Wednesday. Gaza’s health ministry said an additional 104,880 Palestinians have been injured since October 2023. An Egyptian security delegation is reportedly expected to travel to Israel on Thursday to discuss a Gaza ceasefire deal. The US will renew a push for a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory, president Joe Biden said. At least 12 Palestinians, including children and women, were killed in an Israeli strike on a school in central Gaza City on Wednesday, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. A pregnant woman and two other Palestinians were killed in Israeli bombing in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza and Khan Younis in the south on Wednesday, Wafa reported. Two journalists were injured when Israeli forces -opened fire- on a group of journalists covering a border town of Khiam in south-east Lebanon on Wednesday, Lebanon’s National news agency said. A video journalist told AFP that he was shot at while reporting in Khiam and that it was clear that the group were journalists. The Biden administration is reportedly pushing ahead with a $680m arms sales package to Israel. The package includes thousands of joint direct attack munition kits (JDAMs) and hundreds of small-diameter bombs, Reuters reported.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/28/israel-gaza-lebanon-benjamin-netanyahu-hamas-hezbollah-middle-east-crisis-live-latest-news-updates	2024-11-28T00:25:25-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67ec4c3c7f7bfac7e41d7b87f56fbef518be533c/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9c6bb63a05c0d7b49bb26f2ff9fef0a3

By that time, some displaced residents of Lebanon’s devastated south were already on their way back, many of them wondering as they travelled whether the homes they had fled were still there. The pause in hostilities has been broadly welcomed in Lebanon, Israel and beyond, both for those who have been exiled on either side of the border and as a step towards regional stability. There are even some optimistic claims that it might help bring about a ceasefire in Gaza. But as the Lebanon ceasefire begins, a formidable task remains: the reconstruction of a shattered region of a country that is perilously close to being a failed state. Assisted dying | The former president of the supreme court, who ruled on the most high-profile assisted dying cases, has declared his support for the law change. David Neuberger’s intervention came as MPs backing the bill say they believe they have the numbers for Friday’s historic vote to pass. UK news | Police believe Mohamed Al Fayed may have raped and abused more than 111 women over nearly four decades, with his youngest victim said to have been 13 years old. The Metropolitan police said that five unnamed individuals were being investigated for facilitating the offences. Ukraine | Ukraine’s power infrastructure was -under massive enemy attack- on Thursday, the country’s energy minister said, after a nationwide air raid alert was declared due to incoming missiles. Weather | The third named storm of the autumn, Conall, has brought more disruption to the UK, with trains cancelled in parts of southern England on Wednesday and the Met Office warning of delays on roads and potential power cuts. Trade | Canada’s federal government and the premiers of the 10 provinces have agreed to work together against a threat by US president-elect Donald Trump to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian imports.

UK government failing to list use of AI on mandatory register	Technology secretary admits Whitehall departments are not being transparent over way they use AI and algorithms Not a single Whitehall department has registered the use of artificial intelligence systems since the government said it would become mandatory, prompting warnings that the public sector is -flying blind- about the deployment of algorithmic technology affecting millions of lives. AI is already being used by government to inform decisions on everything from benefit payments to immigration enforcement, and records show public bodies have awarded dozens of contracts for AI and algorithmic services. A contract for facial recognition software, worth up to £20m, was put up for grabs last week by a police procurement body set up by the Home Office, reigniting concerns about -mass biometric surveillance-. The Department for Work and Pensions has been using generative AI to read more than 20,000 documents a day to -understand and summarise correspondence- after which the full information is then shared with officials for decision-making. It has automated systems for detecting fraud and error in universal credit claims, and AI assists agents working on personal independence payment claims by summarising evidence. This autumn, DWP started deploying basic AI tools in jobcentres, allowing work coaches to ask questions about universal credit guidance in an attempt to improve the effectiveness of conversations with jobseekers. The Home Office deploys an AI-powered immigration enforcement system, which critics call a -robo-caseworker-. An algorithm is involved in shaping decisions, including returning people to their home countries. The government describes it as a -rules-based- rather than AI system, as it does not involve machine-learning from data. It says it brings efficiencies by prioritising work, but that a human remains responsible for each decision. The system is being used amid a rising caseload of asylum seekers who are subject to removal action, now at about 41,000 people. Several police forces use facial recognition software to track down suspected criminals with the help of artificial intelligence. These have included the Metropolitan police, South Wales police and Essex police. Critics have warned that such software -will transform the streets of Britain into hi-tech police line-ups-, but supporters say it catches criminal suspects and the data of innocent passersby is not stored. NHS England has a £330m contract with Palantir to create a huge new data platform. The deal with the US company that builds AI-enabled digital infrastructure and is led by Donald Trump backer Peter Thiel has sparked concerns about patient privacy, although Palantir says its customers retain full control of the data. An AI chatbot is being trialled to help people navigate the sprawling gov.uk government website. It has been built by the government’s digital service using OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology. Redbox, another AI chatbot for use by civil servants in Downing Street and other government departments, has also been deployed to allow officials to quickly delve into secure government papers and get rapid summaries and tailored briefings.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/uk-government-failing-to-list-use-of-ai-on-mandatory-register	2024-11-27T22:00:35-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdbafee376c2dcd8d17cdcaadfcffac973ec621c/0_130_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b86a5381c13f58ac5e5531798a62b005

‘Stay true to yourself and hit post’: a flashy, absurd night at Australia’s TikTok awards	More than 3m votes were cast for this year’s awards, which went heavy on T-shirt guns and brand activations, but stayed quiet on the government’s proposed social media ban Between them, the Australian online personalities who took the stage at the annual TikTok awards on Wednesday have more than 100 million followers – but if you’re over the age of 30, you probably haven’t heard of any of them. About 3.4m public votes were cast for this year’s TikTok awards, which honour the top creators in categories like beauty, fitness, food, comedy and music. Just about everyone at the invite-only event found fame in a particular niche. Among the online stars in attendance were a quartet of brothers who perform highly choreographed dances in public (160,000 followers), a gay couple who constantly redecorate their home (3.4m followers), and a woman who has built her following on having very long hair (The Aussie Rapunzel, 1.3m followers). Another woman has amassed 1.5m followers by posting videos where she asks strangers if they are currently on their period. These are people who are regularly stopped on the street by fans, and who have so many followers they can make their living from brand deals.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/australia-tiktok-awards-recap-jojo-siwa-winners	2024-11-27T20:44:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd1a50c626698da54310da7f63971dfecb231ea0/772_328_2213_1328/master/2213.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cd04932d7a46bea25abf46b54561b560

In 2023, the US saw more than 1m abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortions and restrictions on the procedure – the highest number recorded in more than a decade.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/27/post-roe-abortion-rate	2024-11-27T10:00:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b224ef17554a2c2eedbbe7d21d3c882b6a7f7a37/0_284_4500_2699/master/4500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f6314e7389309a0d22bcc55e08d96966

Trump transition process raises ‘concerns about corruption’, top senator says – US politics live	US senator Elizabeth Warren says transition agreement between Trump team and White House fails to answer key questions about FBI vetting and security The MOU was supposed to be signed weeks ago, before the election. Trump has already indicated he will sidestep standard transition processes, including, The Guardian has reported, by issuing security clearances to appointees without requiring FBI background checks. In refusing to sign a transition agreement with the DOJ regarding FBI background checks, the incoming Trump administration stands to forgo access to classified information from Biden administration officials. Lawmakers have already raised concerns about key Trump appointees avoiding the standard security clearance process – which will likely arise during senate confirmation hearings early next year. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the incoming Trump and outgoing Biden administrations outlining some terms of the transfer of power departs from the norm in a few key ways, which is raising eyebrows on Washington. The Trump team said the transition will be privately funded and will not utilize -government buildings or technology [...] and will operate as a self-sufficient organization.- Susie Wiles, Trump’s incoming chief of staff said the transition team -has an existing ethics plan-, which she said would be uploaded to the General Services Administration website. Warren called Trump’s use of private funds -nothing more than a ploy for well-connected Trump insiders to line their pockets while pretending to save taxpayers money.- She expressed -concerns of corruption-. There is a fresh flurry of Trump appointments. Among those announced last night were John Phelan, an investor and Trump campaign donor, as his pick for secretary of the Navy, and Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford University health researcher who opposed Covid-19 lockdowns, to head the National Institutes of Health.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/27/donald-trump-transition-us-politics-updates	2024-11-27T06:24:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd455029b6f71b0400472eea9f342ffda3b2158/0_195_3528_2119/master/3528.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b41aa2fb0d8488ba1e6028215148d2e2

‘An emotional wrench’: Smithfield traders absorb news that market is to close	Stunned workers at London meat market first established in 1133 say closure will mean end of a way of life The junction at Cowcross Street marks the place where for centuries cattle were driven daily to London’s Smithfield Market.

Soon these will be among the last vestiges of a truly historic site that was central to London life, feeding the city’s people, dispensing justice as a place of public execution and even, in a shameful chapter from the early 19th century, providing a place where a man wishing to avoid a costly divorce could sell his wife.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/27/an-emotional-wrench-smithfield-traders-absorb-news-that-market-is-to-close	2024-11-27T05:39:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c5c7abf6f9f701e6d903e84f599d65f9dba9df6/0_274_8192_4915/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b8d8322282156a6d159627b801d9a6a7

While that is music to the ears of crypto investors and enthusiasts who poured money into his campaign, there are other unlikely winners for such policies, including far-right extremists and terrorist organizations who are using crypto to finance their ends.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/27/trump-crypto-extremism	2024-11-27T04:46:55-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1b8e3a93b9efeb9d5b6130cc63c47583700d8ed/0_0_5875_3525/master/5875.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7a98dd0020662aae3a2a7f41707c5c03
First Thing: Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire in Lebanon takes effect	Reports of cars heading south inside Lebanon despite Israeli army warning. Plus, record South Korea snowfall Good morning. A highly anticipated ceasefire aimed at ending the 14-month-old war between Israel and Hezbollah officially came into effect early this morning, hours after Joe Biden hailed the -historic- moment. The ceasefire began at 4am in Lebanon after the heaviest day of raids on Beirut, including a series of strikes in the city’s centre, since Israel stepped up its air campaign in Lebanon in late September before sending in ground troops. What does the ceasefire stipulate? The resolution calls for the withdrawal of Hezbollah fighters north of the Litani River – about 18 miles from the Lebanon-Israel border – and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon. What other views does Bhattacharya hold? He has questioned the safety of vaccines, testified against the effectiveness of face masks, and argued that NIH officials should not be involved with scientific policy. Has Trump tapped people with direct ties to Project 2025? Many. For example, Trump’s nominee to chair the Federal Communications Commission wrote the chapter on the FCC in Project 2025.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/27/first-thing-israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-lebanon-takes-effect	2024-11-27T04:18:17-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56620c7de68e4cc34df12655f15e2b799cfaec1b/0_35_5382_3231/master/5382.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3a4fef7f313ad2c139d26ead94b152a6
Polls underestimated Trump support for third election in a row	Chance, demographics or even people reluctant to voice support for Trump could all be reasons for discrepancy In the weeks leading up to the 2024 presidential election, Guardian polling averages showed Kamala Harris winning an incredibly close race. Still, Donald Trump won, showing that yet again his volume of support was underestimated.

Liz Truss opposes assisted dying bill saying NHS should be ‘protecting lives, not ending them’ – UK politics live	The Telegraph, which first reported Truss’s stance, also said Theresa May and Boris Johnson were against the bill Good morning. We have got PMQs later, which means party politics will probably dominate for much of the day in the chamber, but increasingly MPs are preoccupied with a free vote, non-partisan matter, the vote on the assisted dying bill on Friday. This morning there are at least two interesting developments on that story. Three former Conservative prime ministers are all opposed to the bill, the Telegraph is reporting. The paper has a quote from Liz Truss who says: It is wrong in principle: organs of the state like the NHS and the judicial system should be protecting lives, not ending them. No doubt, as we have seen in Canada, vulnerable people would be put under appalling pressure to end their lives early. The law would be ripe for being exploited by the unscrupulous. MPs should vote this terrible Bill down and instead focus on improving health services. Added to Gordon Brown’s intervention last week, that makes four former PMs opposed to a change in the law. There’s still no word from Rishi Sunak, David Cameron, Tony Blair or John Major … or really from Keir Starmer, for that matter. Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP who has tabled the private member’s bill being debated on Friday, has criticised the MPs who have called for the bill to be voted down to allow time for a full policy review. Four Labour backbenchers are among the seven MPs who have tabled an amendment to this effect. The amendment does not oppose assisted dying in principle. In an interview with the Today programme this morning, Leadbeater said the amendment was -disappointing- because, if passed, it would stop the Commons voting on the substance of the bill. She explained: The route of the private member’s bill is absolutely the right route for taking this legislation through. That means that there can be a free vote by all MPs. It is not a government bill. The government has a neutral position on this and, sadly, the amendment that a handful of MPs have put forward is disappointing in that the public clearly want this debate to take place, and I think we’ve got responsibilities as parliamentarians to make sure that that debate does take place. In terms of time and scrutiny, look, this is not a new debate. This debate has been going on for decades. It’s been going on, as you quite rightly said, particularly in recent years, in no short part to due to high-profile campaigners like Esther Rantzen. But I think we can already see from what’s happened in the last few months, this bill will receive more scrutiny and more discussion and more debate, probably, than any piece of legislation.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/27/pmqs-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-assisted-dying-bill-liz-truss-labour-tories	2024-11-27T01:20:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ac03c9aaf03f4cfbc7d96d74ae5b39629faec31/0_119_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a3d29f36ef9f4f4da03a138da0b229a1

Wednesday briefing: Why was the UK so poorly prepared for extreme flooding?	In today’s newsletter: Our environment reporter on what went wrong following Storm Bert and whether widespread flooding might make the government to face up to the country’s leaky defences • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. Storm Bert brought heavy rain, gale-force winds and snow across the country last weekend, overwhelming flood defences already described as being in disrepair. Parts of south Wales and south-west England, where a month of rain pummelled sodden towns and villages, fared particularly badly. Middle East | A highly anticipated ceasefire aimed at ending the 14-month-old war between Israel and Hezbollah officially came into effect early on Wednesday morning, hours after Joe Biden hailed the -historic- agreement. The ceasefire officially began at 4am in Lebanon after the heaviest day of raids on Beirut by Israel including a series of strikes in the city centre. Health | Plans to end the deepening crisis in access to NHS dental care are failing, leaving patients unable to get treatment, according to a warning from the National Audit Office. A pledge to provide an extra 1.5m treatments in England this year is in disarray amid falls in both the number of dentists doing NHS work and people receiving help from them.

Two-thirds of Americans think Trump tariffs will lead to higher prices, poll says	Exclusive: Harris poll raises questions about the popularity of one of Trump’s key economic policy platforms Two-thirds of Americans think Donald Trump’s tariff plans will only add to rising costs if implemented, and many are planning purchases ahead of his inauguration anticipating higher prices, according to a Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian.

Beijing warns US ‘nobody will win in a trade war’ after Trump vows to impose tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada – US politics live	Donald Trump says he will sign executive order imposting 25% tariff on products coming into the US from Mexico and Canada with additional tariff for China Donald Trump’s vow to impose 25% import tariffs on products from Mexico and Canada, and 10% from China, when he takes power in January has sent global stockmarkets into a spin, Mark Sweney report in the Business live blog. The US dollar rose but shares and European stock markets fell at the start of trading as investors worried about the ramifications of Trump’s threats. Copper prices fell, weighed down by a stronger US dollar and Trump’s pledge to levy more tariffs on Chinese products. -President-elect Donald Trump has promised to implement sweeping new tariffs aimed at protecting American industries, promoting domestic manufacturing, and reducing reliance on foreign imports. -However, tariffs imposed during the first Trump term – and continued and extended under Biden – did not achieve all of the promised outcomes.

Keir Starmer’s jobs plan won’t work because Labour are ducking tough welfare decisions, Tories claim – UK politics live	PM set to unveil what government calls 'biggest employment reforms in generation’ as Tories say he is not making tough calls on sickness and benefits Good morning. Today the government is unveiling what it is calling, in the headline on its overnight press release, the -biggest employment reforms in a generation-. The reforms are intended to tackle the fact that Britain is the only major economy where the employment rate has fallen over the last five years, largely because more people are out of work due to long-term ill health. A white paper called Get Britain Working is being published later, and Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, is due to make a statement in the Commons later. In its overnight briefing, the Department for Work and Pensions has already flagged up numerous initiatives which are in the white paper. Overall, the focus seems to be more carrot than stick. -Our reforms put an end to the culture of blaming and shaming people who for too long haven’t been getting the support they need to get back to work,- Keir Starmer says. But quite a lot of key decisions have been postponed, and at this point it is hard to assess quite how significant, or effective, these meaures will turn out to be. The history of welfare reform is littered with announcements that don’t quite live up to -biggest in a generation- hype. From the broken NHS, flatlining economy, and the millions of people left unemployed and trapped in an inactivity spiral – this government inherited a country that simply isn’t working. But today we’ve set out a plan to fix this. A plan that tackles the biggest drivers of unemployment and inactivity and gives young people their future back through real, meaningful change instead of empty rhetoric and sticking plaster politics. We’re overhauling jobcentres to make them fit for the modern age. We’re giving young people the skills and opportunities they need to prepare them for the jobs of the future. We’re fixing the NHS so people get the treatment and mental health support they desperately need to be able to get back to work. We’re working with businesses and employers to better support people with disabilities and health conditions to stay and progress in work, and it doesn’t stop there. This latest announcement shows that Labour are not prepared to take the tough but necessary choices to bring down the benefits bill. There is no attempt to match the £12bn in welfare savings we promised in our manifesto. They have even dodged the difficult decisions on sickness benefits, which are needed to make the welfare system sustainable in the long term.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/26/keir-starmer-labour-tory-jobs-plan-latest-politics-news-live	2024-11-26T01:12:29-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/396526c1795bdd6274c80e27394d70ceef3e46fb/1710_861_2386_1432/master/2386.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5729f894b4741f76313b9342987af6ed
Russia-Ukraine war live: record number of Russian drones fired overnight	Ukraine’s military shoots down 76 out of 188 weapons with Kyiv coming under attack and critical infrastructure hit in Ternopil Welcome to our coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine with the news that Russia has fired 188 drones into Ukraine, the highest number in a single night. Ukraine’s military said on Tuesday it shot down 76 of the weapons, adding it lost track of 96 of the drones, likely due to active electronic warfare, and five drones headed towards Belarus. The British foreign secretary has said the UK is not sending troops into Ukraine, after Le Monde reported on Monday that France and the UK are -not ruling out- such a move. When he was asked about the report in an interview, David Lammy said the UK’s position had not changed. -We are very clear that we stand ready and continue to support the Ukrainians with training particularly, but there has been a longstanding position that we are not committing UK troops to the theatre of action,- he told newspapers La Repubblica, Le Monde and Die Welt at the G7 foreign ministers’ meeting in Italy. Russian forces are advancing in Ukraine at the fastest rate since the early days of the 2022 invasion, taking an area half the size of Greater London over the past month, analysts and war bloggers say. The war is entering what some Russian and western officials say could be its most dangerous phase after Moscow’s forces made some of their biggest territorial gains. -Russia has set new weekly and monthly records for the size of the occupied territory in Ukraine,- independent Russian news group Agentstvo said in a report. The Russian army captured almost 235 sq km (91 sq miles) in Ukraine over the past week, a weekly record for 2024, it said. Ambassadors from Ukraine and Nato’s 32 members will meet on Tuesday in Brussels over Russia’s firing last week of an experimental hypersonic intermediate-range missile. Russia on Thursday carried out a strike on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro which President Vladimir Putin said was a test of its new Oreshnik missile. But, according to the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency, expectations are low for any major results from the consultations on Tuesday afternoon at the alliance’s Brussels headquarters. The most that is expected is a reiteration of Nato’s earlier insistence that Moscow’s deployment of the new weaponry will not -deter Nato allies from supporting Ukraine-. A new Nato mission located in Wiesbaden will take over the coordination of western military aid for Ukraine in January, Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said on Monday. The setting up of NSATU – Nato Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine – has been months in the planning and is widely seen as an effort to safeguard the aid mechanism against interference by Donald Trump. Europeans will step up military support for Ukraine, Pistorius pledged, after talks in Berlin with his British, French, Italian and Polish counterparts. -Our target must be to enable Ukraine to act out of a position of strength,- Pistorius said after hosting a meeting of the five leading nations in European defence.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-record-russian-drones-ukraine-kyiv-nato	2024-11-26T00:44:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c85b1351e1c2e49101a28111624134ea7c2207e/0_210_4220_2533/master/4220.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4a1a5ce9f8438d445a72e6272b9f7736

Tuesday briefing: Why everyone’s suddenly worked up about ‘non-crime hate incidents’	In today’s newsletter: A police visit to a Daily Telegraph columnist about a tweet unleashed a barrage of coverage – but the story is more complicated than it appears • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. A journalist visited by police over an erroneous tweet. A barber accused of racism over a dodgy haircut. And someone in Warwickshire reported for refusing to shake hands. These are some of the examples cited in recent days in an escalating media storm over -non-crime hate incidents- recorded by police. The problem, frequently laid at the door of the woke mob, is so catastrophically vexing that former Conservative MEP and Daily Telegraph columnist Daniel Hannan declared it evidence of -the bleak reality of our DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] police state-. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, has now said that the police should apply a -common sense and consistent approach-, an apparent nod to the criticisms of how the system works. And there are some reasonable objections to the status quo. But there are also important reasons for its existence that have very little to do with haircuts or handshakes. Unemployment | Teenagers will get training at the Premier League, Royal Shakespeare Company and Channel 4 in a government drive to get hundreds of thousands into jobs or education. The scheme is part of a suite of changes to the welfare system and out-of-work support being announced today. US politics | Donald Trump said on Monday he would sign an executive order imposing a 25% US tariff on products from Mexico and Canada. He said the tariffs would only be lifted if Mexico and Canada clamp down on migrants and illegal drugs crossing the border, and promised an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports. Storm Bert | Forecasters, environment officials and politicians have been criticised over the warnings issued before Storm Bert and the fitness of flood defences to cope with increasingly common extreme weather. The Met Office defended its work, saying that the storm was -well forecast, 48 hours in advance-. Regulation | Britain’s financial sector watchdog is -incompetent at best, dishonest at worst-, according to a damning report by MPs and Lords which called for a big shake-up. An examination of the Financial Conduct Authority found -very significant shortcomings- after a series of financial scandals. Health | Weight-loss drugs can reduce the risk of worsening kidney function, kidney failure and dying from kidney disease by a fifth, according to a study. Compared with placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists like Ozempic reduced the risk of kidney failure by 16% and the worsening of kidney function by 22%, Victim-led hate reporting has had significant and important positive impacts for police, and communities, in diagnosing harm, extremism, and failing integration or community-cohesion efforts … We all know that recording rules can be complex, but they should not be a concern to a victim at their time of distress.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/26/tuesday-briefing-why-everyones-suddenly-worked-up-about-non-crime-hate-incidents	2024-11-25T22:57:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39ed9cf6cf7349a2cc382a02b9c05af036683716/0_4_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2b19407d555432baa586b9a44ca5a829

But that does not appear to have mattered to a vandal in Shropshire, where a gravestone of Scrooge used in a 1984 film adaptation has been smashed into multiple pieces.	https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/25/humbug-vandal-smashes-gravestone-of-ebenezer-scrooge	2024-11-25T09:56:53-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1ec72cb034e902c9a092eaaa08b6c3839810cc0/0_171_2208_1325/master/2208.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9377749a002d9c2915a03e56f89c78b3

Public health experts are concerned that if confirmed, Trump’s selection for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F Kennedy Jr could jeopardize access to pharmaceutical drugs in favor of more experimental treatments.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/25/trump-cabinet-administration-politics-updates	2024-11-25T05:45:54-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aba12aab3ba519cd1119b54880c429d46de4bb57/0_181_5516_3312/master/5516.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=634a2c925d4ce7ba59c3b9cf97e7adb5

Judge to decide whether evidence of sexual abuse will set the Menendez brothers free	Judge will address abuse evidence in 1989 murder convictions, with immediate freedom as one possible result A judge will decide Monday whether new evidence warrants a re-examination of the convictions of Erik and Lyle Menendez in the murders of their parents in their Beverly Hills home more than 30 years ago. The brothers were found guilty of murdering Jose and Kitty Menendez in 1989 and sentenced to life in prison without parole. While their defense attorneys argued at trial that they had been sexually abused by their father, prosecutors denied that and accused them of killing their parents for money.

First Thing: Amazon workers in 20 countries to protest or strike on Black Friday	Organizers demand better workers’ rights and climate action. Plus, Israeli killing of journalists in Lebanon could be war crime, experts say Good morning. Thousands of Amazon workers are expected to protest or strike in more than 20 countries during Black Friday and Cyber Monday to agitate for better workers’ rights and climate action. What are organizers saying? Christy Hoffman, the general secretary of UNI Global Union, said: -Amazon’s relentless pursuit of profit comes at a cost to workers, the environment and democracy.- Amanda Gearing, a senior organiser at GMB, said: -Amazon represents everything that is broken about [the UK’s] economy. Insecure work, poverty wages and often unsafe working conditions.- How has Amazon responded? A spokesperson said -we’re always listening and looking at ways to improve- but insisted -we remain proud of the competitive pay, comprehensive benefits, and engaging, safe work experience we provide our teams-. What’s the humanitarian toll of the war? After the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed 1,200 people and during which 250 were taken hostage, Israel has bombarded the territory with airstrikes and a ground invasion. Infrastructure has been decimated, the population displaced multiple times and brought close to starvation, and more than 44,000 people have been killed, according to Gaza health officials, with the UN Human Rights Office verifying nearly 70% were women and children. The death toll is understood to be an underestimate, with the UN estimating in May 2024 that more than 10,000 people’s bodies were under the rubble.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/25/first-thing-amazon-workers-in-20-countries-to-protest-or-strike-on-black-friday	2024-11-25T03:01:38-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/790030147e5024cf1e7fdea590366841b7bfae61/0_385_5500_3299/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a0933849f1e1972a00ff4f787b068303

UK politics live: vote on assisted dying bill impossible to predict, says minister	Jess Phillips says ‘we do not know how this vote is going to go’ with the views of many MPs still unclear Good morning. There is plenty happening today. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, and Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, at both speaking at the CBI conference, where the CBI chief executive Rain Newton-Smith is warning about the impact of the budget on business. Keir Starmer is hosting a meeting at Downing Street about plans to protect women from spiking. -My government was elected on a pledge to take back our streets, and we will never achieve this if women and girls do not feel safe at night,- he says. There will be tributes to John Prescott in the Commons this afternoon. But one issue is going to dominate the week, the vote on the assisted dying bill on Friday, and already that is a big topic of discussion. Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, has been giving interviews this morning and she told the Today programme this morning she is finding it impossible to predict if the bill will pass the second reading vote. She said: We do not know how this vote is going to go. I literally couldn’t call it for you at the moment … Each week I think a different thing. Last week I thought it wouldn’t [pass]. This week I think it might. Honestly, I’ve learned over the years not to try and second guess parliament. I should underline that these figures are *not* a prediction of the vote, but an interesting look at the direction MPs are leaning With 291 MPs not stating a view at the time of writing, the vote very easily could go either way A source close to the MPs campaigning in favour of legalisation told The Telegraph: -If all the MPs who have said they support the Bill turn out and vote for it, then it will pass.- She will make the decision about how she votes on assisted dying on a matter of conscience, just exactly like I will. How she comes to that and what moral code she uses to come to that will be exactly the same as the moral code that I use to come to that decision as well … I think that Shabana is making a decision on what she thinks is best for her constituents, like every constituency MP.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/25/uk-politics-live-assisted-dying-bill-labour-conservatives-starmer-reeves-badenoch	2024-11-25T01:02:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d467eb782da585015bad5c7cb58331d66ab8cd1/0_260_2939_1763/master/2939.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a11de454bc86f97a38da1c55828781f1

Australia politics live: Labor rejects Greens’ compromise offer on housing bill; NSW reveals master plans for 60,000 homes	The Help to Buy bill faces a final vote in the Senate scheduled for Tuesday. Follow today’s news live The government has rejected the Greens’ latest compromise offer to pass the Help to Buy housing bill, continuing the long-running stand-off into the parliament’s final week for 2024. Government sources said the Greens’ demands would be variously unlawful, unhelpful or require spending Labor saw as wasteful. The government is now challenging the Greens to back the Help to Buy bill anyway, still not budging on any demands – with a final vote in the Senate scheduled for tomorrow. Clare O’Neill has today said: This continuous charade from the Greens has to stop. You get the distinct impression the Greens want Australians to continue to be in housing distress, so Adam Bandt can try to harvest those grievances into votes. It’s the crassest form of politics there is, straight out of the Peter Dutton playbook. The Greens are offering Labor an opportunity to announce the construction of 25,000 social and affordable homes, helping over 60,000 people into affordable homes in the middle of a housing crisis, why on earth would Labor block that? Consistently throughout this Parliament, the Greens have blocked and delayed action on the housing crisis, looking for every excuse to vote down legislation which is clearly good for the country.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/nov/25/australia-politics-live-labor-coalition-greens-housing-help-to-buy-question-time-peter-dutton-anthony-albanese-social-media	2024-11-24T12:26:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/860d8e54cd799726e1431f63866e805a23c75a1e/0_139_4168_2501/master/4168.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42d0ed196ec56acae48079aeecf51245

Russia-Ukraine war live: French foreign minister says there should be ‘no red lines’ in supporting Ukraine	Jean-Noël Barrot says western allies should not put any limits on support for Ukraine against Russia but does not confirm if French weapons have been used Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, has told the BBC in an interview that western allies should not put any limits on support for Ukraine against Russia, and -not set and express red lines-. Ukraine’s air defence units destroyed more than 10 Russia drones that were targeting Kyiv in an overnight drone attack, Ukraine’s military said on Sunday. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries as a result of the attack. -The UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) were flying in different directions towards Kyiv,- Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, said. -The air raid alert in the city lasted for more than three hours.- Ukraine’s air defences downed 50 of 73 Russian drones launched overnight, the Ukrainian military said this morning. In a post on Telegram, the air force said it lost track of 19 drones and four more are still in the air. Russia’s air defence systems destroyed 34 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 27 over the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, Russia’s defence ministry said. Russian media is reporting that colonel general Gennady Anashkin, the commander of the southern grouping, had been removed from his command, for giving misleading reports about the progress of the war. There has been no official confirmation from the Russian ministry of defence. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan will discuss the latest developments in the war with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, on Monday during his visit to Ankara, a Turkish official. They are expected to discuss the removal of defence procurement obstacles between Nato allies and the military alliance’s joint fight against terrorism. Ukraine has lost over 40% of the territory in Russia’s Kursk region that it rapidly seized in a surprise incursion in August as Russian forces have mounted waves of counter-assaults, a senior Ukrainian military source told Reuters. The source, who is on Ukraine’s general staff, said Russia had deployed about 59,000 troops to the Kursk region since Kyiv’s forces swept in and advanced swiftly, catching Moscow unprepared two and a half years into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. -At most, we controlled about 1,376 square kilometres (531 square miles), now of course this territory is smaller. The enemy is increasing its counterattacks,- the source said.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/24/russia-ukraine-war-live-french-foreign-minister-says-there-should-be-no-red-lines-in-supporting-ukraine	2024-11-24T00:41:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae7e93f0855289bd2d1364edf46721258b04a834/0_73_2347_1409/master/2347.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=224cbf28411e15721ea87fac5ed84634

Trump depends on the EU and UK to act as peacemakers more than he thinks	The US doesn’t need to spend more on Ukraine.

His supporters say they don’t take him literally but seriously – but who decides what -serious- is? The very ambiguity can be part of Trump’s appeal. There’s something exhilarating in the sense one is in an exclusive negotiation with the president to define reality.

Storm Bert live: Met Office warns of ‘multiple hazard event’ with snow, ice and flood warnings for UK	Met Office says UK will see as much as 20 to 40cm of snow over hills, accompanied by strong winds New national severe weather warnings have been issued for the weekend by the Met Office as Storm Bert has begun to make an impact with snow closing roads and strong rains and winds expected to cause further travel disruption and potential flooding. Weather warnings and 16 flood alerts have come into effect across the UK, as the Met Office described the forecasted weather as a -multiple hazard event- due to Storm Bert binging with it snow, ice, heavy rain and gale force winds. We’ll see two to four hours of heavy snow across parts of northern England and Scotland during Saturday morning. This snow will accumulate thick and fast, with five to 10cm at lower levels and as much as 20 to 40cm over hills accompanied by strong winds. You can expect blizzards over hills across northern England and Scotland, atrocious conditions for travelling and going over the hills and also the risk of power interruptions because of snow build up on power lines. The melting snow and the heavy rain could lead to localised flooding in places but the wettest spots would be Wales, in the south-west, particularly over south-facing hills, that’s where we’re likely to see gales and certainly the risk of impacts from wind as well as from rain.-	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2024/nov/23/storm-bert-live-met-office-warns-of-multiple-hazard-event-with-snow-ice-and-flood-warnings-for-uk	2024-11-23T00:46:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af6585a2b86765fbb14dff4162ed98fbd8ddcbfd/1287_588_6699_4019/master/6699.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a3ac29646c33507f9fac7ef17c13c40a

While Putin conducts his missile diplomacy, restrictions around the use of long-range weapons may help Kyiv In Kyiv, as autumn turns fast turns to winter, Ukrainians in the government describe a vacuum before the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House on 20 January that will be filled by more war as both sides jockey for advantage. -Trump has said he wants to end the war within 24 hours. Nobody is more interested in this topic than Ukraine,- a senior official told the Guardian. -But the problem is, for the moment, everything is just speculation. Will it be the first peace plan, the second plan, the first variant, the 10th variant?- they said.

Dua Lipa’s pickle drink is latest twist in growing appreciation for ‘dirty’ cocktails	Brine from pickled onions, beetroot, pickles and even oysters is now a fixture on bar menus across the UK If Donald Trump has ruined Diet Coke for you, perhaps the answer is following Dua Lipa’s lead.

Using both hands, she sips it like it’s hot chocolate. It may seem like the latest in a series of drinks-based social experiments that only the most successful and famous can get us to try (see Tom Hanks’ Diet Cokagne, or Diet Coke and champagne).

Alabama man shook and gasped in final moments of nitrogen gas execution	Death of Carey Dale Grayson, 50, marks third time the southern US state has killed someone using controversial method An Alabama man convicted in the 1994 killing of a hitchhiker cursed at the prison warden and made obscene gestures shortly before he was put to death on Thursday evening in the nation’s third execution using nitrogen gas – as the daughter of his victim spoke out against capital punishment. Carey Dale Grayson, 50, was executed at the William Holman correctional facility in southern Alabama. He was one of four teenagers convicted of killing Vickie DeBlieux, 37, as she hitchhiked through the state on the way to her mother’s home in Louisiana. The woman was attacked, beaten and thrown off a cliff.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/22/alabama-nitrogen-gas-execution	2024-11-22T06:19:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab211353c010522236604f608c004ddae2d39f34/0_527_5712_3427/master/5712.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1be59f6e4c86ada938c2061069037524

Greens and some independents are biggest winners from Labor’s proposed donation cap, data shows	Labor and Coalition would have missed out on $4.1m and $4.7m in donations after public funding boost, while the Greens would have been $2.9m better off The Greens and independent MPs who ran low-cost campaigns have emerged as the biggest winners from Labor’s proposed donation cap and increased public funding of elections, data shows. According to a Guardian Australia analysis of 2021-22 data, the Greens would have lost just $2.7m in donations if Labor’s proposed $20,000 cap had been law at the time, a sum more than made up for by a $5.6m increase in public funding.

Project 2025: the Trump picks with ties to ultra-rightwing policy manifesto	The president-elect has tried to distance himself from Project 2025, but several key choices have direct links to it On the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly disavowed Project 2025, saying he had -nothing to do- with the blueprint for a conservative presidency and didn’t know the people behind it. But as he starts to assemble his cabinet and White House staff, it seems likely he’ll get to know the people involved very well soon. Trump’s attempts to disavow the project before winning re-election seemed improbable, given that it was written by various members of his first administration and aligned on policy goals with his own proposed second term agenda.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/22/project-2025-trump-picks	2024-11-22T06:00:14-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bb72440e21561f467387af26b886e1c01647815/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=820eb260f0e19b12aa522bb4efb655ee

First Thing: ICC seeks Netanyahu’s arrest over allegations of ‘war crimes and crimes against humanity’	The international criminal court also issued arrest warrants for Israel’s Yoav Gallant and Hamas’s Mohammed Deif. Plus, Trump picks Bondi for attorney general after Gaetz withdraws Good morning. The international criminal court has issued arrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the country’s former defense minister Yoav Gallant and the Hamas military leader Mohammed Deif – over allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity. What did the chamber say? There are -reasonable grounds to believe that both individuals intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival, including food, water, and medicine and medical supplies, as well as fuel and electricity-. What does it mean? The court has no police force, so we’re unlikely to see them standing trial anytime soon, but the ruling holds strong moral weight. Netanyahu and Gallant are at risk of arrest if they travel to any of the 124 countries that signed the Rome statute establishing the court. What was the reaction? The move was broadly welcomed by human rights groups. But Joe Biden said it was -outrageous- and Netanyahu’s office called it -antisemitic-. Why has Trump picked Bondi? It is likely to be because of loyalty. She became a fierce defender of his candidacy in 2016, helped with Trump’s legal defense during his first impeachment trial, parroted claims that the 2020 election was stolen, and continued working as a surrogate through the 2024 campaign when she attended Trump’s criminal trial in New York.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/22/first-thing-icc-seeks-netanyahu-arrest-over-allegations-of-war-crimes-and-crimes-against-humanity	2024-11-22T03:28:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4add4f8dc13b7472d9c4fd7eddefeb3ec963e7a3/107_82_3699_2220/master/3699.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4b9ac694b081574800d9826ce9d9c28c

Russia-Ukraine war live: Nato says Moscow’s strike with new ballistic missile won’t alter course of war	Alliance accuses Russia of seeking to intimidate Kyiv’s allies while Volodymyr Zelenskyy calls attack a ‘severe escalation’ Russia fired an -experimental- ballistic missile at the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Thursday in what the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called -a clear and severe escalation- of the 33-month-old war. Vladimir Putin said the strike was -a response to US plans to produce and deploy intermediate and short-range missiles-. The Russian president also threatened further attacks, saying Moscow -had the right- to strike western countries that provided Kyiv with weapons used against Russian targets. The new ballistic missile was part of a wider salvo of nine missiles fired from the Astrakhan region of Russia in the early hours of Thursday. Six of the missiles were intercepted by Ukraine’s air force but the new ballistic missile was not stopped. The missile was said to have hit -without consequences-, Ukraine’s air force said, though it added that complete information about victims had yet to be received. Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for strong worldwide condemnation on the strike, describing it as a major step-up in the -scale and brutality- of the war. The Ukrainian president said the attack was -yet more proof that Russia has no interest in peace-, adding that a -response is needed. Pressure is needed. Russia must be forced into real peace, which can only be achieved through strength-. US and UK sources indicated they believed the missile was an experimental, nuclear-capable, intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), which has a theoretical range of below 3,420 miles (5,500km). That is enough to reach Europe from where it was fired in south-western Russia, but not the US. UN secretary general António Guterres’s spokesperson said Russia’s use of the new ballistic missile was -yet another concerning and worrying development. -All of this [is] going in the wrong direction,- Stéphane Dujarric said as he called on all parties to de-escalate the conflict and -to protect civilians, not hit civilian targets or critical civilian infrastructure-. Russian strikes killed at least two people in the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Sumy, the acting mayor said on Friday. -Several massive explosions occurred in Sumy,- Artem Kobzar said on Telegram. He said air defences were still working as of just before 6am local time and warned residents to stay away from windows. The Sumy regional military administration said a residential neighbourhood had been struck by a Russian drone, adding that rescue operations were under way. It confirmed the two deaths and said 12 people had been injured. Russia’s defence ministry said on Thursday that its forces had captured the eastern Ukrainian village of Dalne in the Donetsk region, a focal point of their advance. Ukraine’s general staff made no acknowledgment of Dalne being in Russian hands. The Ukrainian military’s late report mentioned the village as one of seven in an area where Russian forces had tried to pierce Ukrainian defences 26 times over the previous 24 hours. It said 10 of 16 armed clashes in the area continued. Ukraine’s parliament postponed a sitting due to have taken place on Friday out of security concerns, public broadcaster Suspilne reported, quoting sources. It said the order told members to keep their families out of Kyiv’s government district and quoted parliamentarians as saying that, for the moment, the next sitting was not scheduled until December.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-nato-says-moscows-strike-with-new-ballistic-missile-wont-alter-course-of-war	2024-11-21T23:14:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ef13efa7069f9e9b00c0da95bea9d10016df5dd/0_343_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cbe5f3b6484782c8d56edba2ce8726e5

Putin’s Ukraine missile a warning to west before second age of Trump	The current escalations will set a new status quo for life under Trump – what does the US president have planned? Like Chekhov’s gun coming off the wall in Act V, it was probably only a matter of time before Vladimir Putin launched an experimental, nuclear-capable ballistic missile into Ukraine. It is hardly a coincidence that his decision comes as the war approaches a likely endgame, with both sides jockeying for position ahead of negotiations in the shadow of Donald Trump. Neither Ukraine nor Russia quite knows what Trump will do when he takes office in January. But the escalations taking place now will set a new status quo for the day he becomes president, at which point Trump’s options range from hard-nosed horse-trading to simply throwing Ukraine under the bus.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/22/russia-ukraine-war-ballistic-missile-warning	2024-11-21T23:00:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c67d0e8f7c62dfd56a8250326c690ea2797bab8a/0_0_4264_2559/master/4264.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fb6c21a99ef4b6de9ad8352e52543686
