Donald Trump has signed an executive order to expand access to in vitro fertilization (IVF). The order directs the domestic policy council to make recommendations to -aggressively- reduce the costs for accessing IVF, according to a White House fact sheet. Trump criticized Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appearing to blame Ukraine for the war with Russia after the Ukrainian leader complained about being left out of peace talks between the US and Russia. -Today I heard, ‘oh, well, we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there for three years ... You should have never started it. You could have made a deal,- Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida when asked about the Ukrainian reaction. Zelenskyy responded to Trump’s comments by saying the US president -is living in this disinformation bubble-.

Reaction to the rise in inflation, Davey said: The chancellor’s misguided policies are putting us at risk of a new era of stagflation. The economy still isn’t growing, and now people are being hit in their pockets too. The Conservative government plunged Britain into a cost of living crisis, and Labour’s failures are just making the misery drag on and on. Well, look, we inherited a terrible situation from the previous government, and their failure to make sure that sufficient prison places were built. It is a disgrace. And unfortunately, that’s the inheritance we had. The lord chancellor had to take some really difficult decisions because of that. We are committed, obviously, to building the 14,000 additional places that we need.

Nigel Farage, Jordan Peterson & co worship each other in alt-right heaven | John Crace	Welcome to the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship conference, a fatuous echo chamber of self-congratulation Fighting the culture wars doesn’t come cheap these days. Tickets for the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (ARC) conference at the Excel Centre in London cost a discounted £450. A bargain said the organisers, as the original price was £1500. Maybe they had a point. All 4,000 tickets were sold long before the event began. Even access to a livestream set you back £150. A meta-event where only the global elite are welcome to watch a global elite take on the global elite. This was alt-right heaven. A gathering of some of the biggest names on the circuit. Douglas Murray. Jordan Peterson. Nigel Farage. Niall Ferguson. An echo chamber of self-referential congratulation.

Architects warn post-Brexit visa rules hindering recruitment	Firms want review of decision to remove architecture from shortage occupation list and raise salary threshold Architect firms are calling on the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, to urgently review the post-Brexit visa salary rules, claiming they are choking an industry that is trying to help meet Labour’s housing targets.

The decisions that we make right now over the coming weeks will not only define the outcome of the conflict in Ukraine, but the security of our world for a generations to come. And the nature of government means dealing with these challenges. But in my view, the test of leadership, of political leadership, isn’t just about managing the immediate, it’s also about reforming for the future. We are in a new era of threat, and that demands a new era for defence.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/18/defence-secretary-john-healey-armed-forces-nigel-farage-reform-uk-politics-live-news-updates	2025-02-18T01:45:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2b516b29e4ca8e1ce2095e4901df7bdb9b0d1b4/1206_215_4250_2550/master/4250.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c519c32e65b139f0471520665587a614

Middle East crisis live: Israeli troops remain in five locations in Lebanon after deadline for withdrawal expires	Original deadline in late January extended to 18 February by both Israel and Lebanon as both sides claim the other has violated ceasefire agreement Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of developments in the Middle East. Israel’s army has left southern Lebanese villages but remains in five positions, a Lebanese security source told Agence France-Presse (AFP), as a deadline for their withdrawal agreed to under a peace deal with Hezbollah expired. Itamar Ben-Gvir has suggested that the Egyptian government may have had a role to play in the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. -They [Egypt] have a role in what happened on October 7,- the former national security minister, who resigned from Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet in protest over the Gaza ceasefire deal, said in comments carried by Israeli state radio. -There was probably some partnership, or at the very least, a willful blindness.- An alternative to Donald Trump’s proposal for the effective ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from Gaza is being prepared by Egypt, under which Hamas would be formally excluded from governance and control of the territory’s reconstruction. The process would be handed over on an interim basis to the control of a social or community support committee. No member of Hamas would sit on the committee (you can read more about the alternative plan here). The World Bank will release an assessment of damages to infrastructure in Gaza in coming days. It is expected to provide a fuller overview of damage done to the territory by Israeli airstrikes after an interim report in April showed it suffered $18.5bn in damages to critical infrastructure in the first four months of the war.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/18/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-troops-lebanon-withdrawal-deadline-passes-egypt-gaza-latest-updates-news	2025-02-17T23:58:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecab4c4e38ec405cd9e3cc0ff4d45b715e02f3b4/0_102_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f9b4a4fc474243255915cc145e50ebce

Tuesday briefing: Europe faces tough choices on Ukraine as US pursues own path	In today’s newsletter: As the US and Russia go ahead with talks in Saudi Arabia, Keir Starmer and other European leaders are grappling with their next move Good morning. Yesterday, European leaders attended an emergency meeting in Paris to discuss how best to respond to the shift in Ukraine policy from the US under Donald Trump. Today, US and Russian officials will meet in Saudi Arabia for preliminary peace talks. And while Volodymyr Zelenskyy says that there can be no -agreements about us without us-, events of the last week have made it clear that the second of these summits is likely to be more consequential than the first. As shocking as interventions from the US vice-president, JD Vance, and the secretary of defence, Pete Hegseth, were last week, part of their argument was emanating from Washington even before Trump’s first term: the demand that European nations take more responsibility for their own security as the US seeks to shift its focus towards Asia. Prisons | Successive governments’ overreliance on longer prison sentences and desire to seem -tough on crime- have driven the justice system to the brink of collapse, an official review has found. The prison population in England and Wales was more than 85,000 at the end of last year, having increased by more than 40,000 since 1993. UK news | A woman shot dead at a Kent pub on Valentine’s Day has been named as Lisa Smith. The 43-year-old from Slough was killed in Knockholt near the Three Horseshoes pub shortly after 7pm on Friday, Kent police said. Conservatives | Kemi Badenoch has said -our country and all of western civilisation will be lost- if efforts to renew the Conservative party and drive forward rightwing ideas globally fail. In a speech at a right-wing conference attended by Jordan Peterson and Nigel Farage, Baedenoch said that -pronouns, diversity policies and climate activism- are a -poison-. Canada | A plane carrying 80 people crash landed at Toronto Pearson airport on Monday, flipping upside down and leaving at least 18 people injured. Video from the scene showed a Delta Air Lines plane belly-up on snow-covered tarmac and people walking away. Religion | Pope Francis will remain in hospital for as long as required after tests in recent days showed a -complex clinical picture-, the Vatican has said. The pontiff, 88, was admitted to Gemelli hospital in Rome on Friday with worsening bronchitis and was diagnosed and treated for a respiratory tract infection. If current trends in the decline of European defence capabilities are not halted and reversed, future US political leaders – those for whom the cold war was not the formative experience that it was for me – may not consider the return on America’s investment in Nato worth the cost.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/18/tuesday-briefing-europe-faces-tough-choices-on-ukraine-as-us-pursues-own-path	2025-02-17T22:51:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/476db846c2b307d8aaca7a3f876ebe7c9d78dd90/0_193_4675_2805/master/4675.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5493440d148fd4666e280dc53aec9a34

Russian and US officials meet in Saudi Arabia for high-stakes talks on war in Ukraine, without Kyiv – Europe live	European officials not part of discussions as Volodymyr Zelenskyy warns his country will not recognise peace deals made without Ukrainian participation Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the US-Russia talks in Riyadh – it’s approaching 8am in the Saudi capital. Today’s talks aim to pave the way for the first exchanges on a potential peace deal to end the Ukraine war. However, Kyiv and European leaders have been excluded, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that Ukraine -cannot recognise any things or any agreements about us without us-. Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s foreign policy adviser, said on Monday upon arrival in Riyadh that talks on Ukraine would be strictly bilateral, Russia’s RIA state news agency reported. -We came to negotiate with American colleagues,- it quoted Ushakov as saying. -These are bilateral talks, purely bilateral. There can be no trilateral talks in Riyadh.- The Riyadh talks are proceeding to follow up on a surprise phone call to Putin initiated by Trump last week. Trump’s special Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, stressed Trump wanted a quick deal: -We are now at Trump time, which means I get an assignment today and tomorrow at noon he asks me why it hasn’t been done yet.- Russia said ahead of the meeting that Putin and Trump wanted to move on from -abnormal relations- and that it saw no place for Europeans to be at any negotiating table. Zelenskyy accused Washington of wanting -to please- Putin by -now saying things that are very favourable- to him. The Ukrainian president said any peace deal would need to include -robust and reliable- security guarantees, which France and Britain have called for but not all European powers support.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/18/russia-us-ukraine-peace-talks-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-volodymyr-zelenskyy-saudi-arabia-live-latest-updates-news	2025-02-17T21:02:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/622c4bb6b535f011d104729e1b824259ef95b88f/0_436_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=55af9545ebb57f8fb79fce600939363e

Weatherwatch: Cyclone Zelia brings 130mph winds to north-west Australia	Tropical cyclone first to make landfall this year, while a winter storm causes extreme cold across north-eastern US Cyclone Zelia became the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in 2025, hitting north-west Australia on Valentine’s Day as a category 4 system. It brought damaging winds of 130mph and heavy rainfall, with 440mm of rain falling in two days. Prior to landfall, Zelia affected southern Indonesia, including Bali, with winds of more than 45mph. The storm weakened into a tropical low by Saturday, but continued to cause widespread flooding, particularly near the Pilbara rivers and the Great Sandy Desert. Zelia intensified rapidly because of the record-warm Indian Ocean temperatures, which were 1-2C above seasonal average, providing increased energy and moisture to fuel the storm. While Port Hedland in Western Australia had minimal damage, nearby areas like Pilbara and Marble Bar faced flooding and fallen trees. The Great Northern Highway remains closed, disrupting food supplies and leaving supermarket shelves empty. The tropical low is now tracking southwards, with rainfall becoming patchier and lighter.	https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/feb/17/weatherwatch-cyclone-zelia-brings-130mph-winds-to-north-west-australia	2025-02-17T02:37:42-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06272b018467c240a6bf8e5d338236bd8a6e8cc5/0_46_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6e5bc709d2fbbac52f5225f3bb5f8303

In a statement, the government said: The prime minister has welcomed new figures published by NHS England which reveal that between July and November last year, the NHS delivered almost 2.2 million more elective care appointments compared to the same period the previous year – delivering on the government’s mission to fix the NHS as part of the plan for change. The new data confirms the government reached the target seven months earlier than promised – with 100,000 more treatments, tests, and scans for patients each week, and more than half a million extra diagnostic tests delivered. What we’ve seen in the NHS over the course of winter with ambulance response times, and corridor care, [there’s] a hell of a lot more to do there. Mental health is in a dire state.

Trump vowed to champion US workers - the reality has been a relentless assault	President has begun slashing federal workforce while hobbling labor watchdogs NLRB and EEOC As a presidential candidate last fall, Donald Trump repeatedly promised to battle for US workers, but ever since he returned to the White House, he has taken a surprisingly large number of anti-worker actions, labor experts say. Some of those moves, among them hobbling the National Labor Relations Board, will help Trump’s billionaire business friends, most notably Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. In his first few weeks back in office, Trump fired the acting chair of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), leaving the US’s top labor watchdog without a quorum to enforce laws that protect workers’ right to unionize. Trump has designated Musk, a vehemently anti-union billionaire, to launch an all-out war against the federal bureaucracy and workforce, and Trump and Musk have essentially treated the country’s 2 million-plus federal employees as if they were disposable.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/16/trump-anti-worker-actions-unions	2025-02-16T04:00:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b5183e9e7d14cb5785e66134d6df6fc744b6431/0_83_8640_5182/master/8640.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a160f433cf0dfc34a0e76f1856483368

‘There has been an awakening’: ancient sects on the rise in Modi’s India	Some 400 million devotees will attend this year’s Kumbh Mela festival. Pilgrims and politicians explain why it’s bigger than ever They sat quietly together on the banks of the Ganges river, heads bowed in sombre meditation. Some men were naked, their bodies smeared grey with ash. Others had a simple saffron cloth tied around their waist. Nearby, barbers balanced on their haunches, shaving the head of each man clean with a flick of their knives, save for a small strand at the back. This ceremony, in which millions of pilgrims seek to cleanse their sins to break the cycle of reincarnation has been taking place at the Kumbh Mela festival for centuries. It is mandatory for thousands of sadhus – Hindu holy men who live an austere life of strict spiritual discipline. Among the most sacred events in the Hindu calendar, the festival occurs every 12 years across four sacred locations in India where it is believed the Hindu god Vishnu once spilled drops of the nectar of immortality.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/16/modi-india-kumbh-mela-hindu-festival-sects	2025-02-16T01:00:05-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16f9931a617907325e9faf12087ec4efe52b3aa1/370_0_6356_3815/master/6356.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ae7699d0e64f733f4585ebbc442b79ff
Munich security conference concludes as Europe scrambles to mount united front amid warming US-Russia ties – Europe live	Reports of planned meeting between US and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia leaves Europe concerned over Ukraine ceasefire negotiations The Munich security conference concludes today after a dramatic two days during which the US vice-president, JD Vance, excoriated European leaders, accusing them of suppressing free speech, and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, declared it was time to create a European army. With Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine looming over the conference, the two men met at its sidelines, with Zelenskyy demanding -security guarantees- and a joint US-Ukrainian peace plan before he enters into any talks with Moscow. Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said Europe will be consulted – but ultimately excluded – from the talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US. -To my European friends, I would say: ‘Get into the debate, not by complaining that you might, yes or no, be at the table, but by coming up with concrete proposals, ideas, ramp up [defence] spending’,- Kellogg said at the Munich conference on Saturday. Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb, said -Europe needs to talk less and do more-, in response to the prospect of being shut out of talks. -There’s no way in which we can have discussions or negotiations about Ukraine, Ukraine’s future or European security structure, without Europeans,- Stubb told reporters in Munich. -But this means that Europe needs to get its act together.- The Nato chief, Mark Rutte, said Europe had to come up with -good proposals- for securing peace in Ukraine if it wanted to be involved in US-led talks. -If Europeans want to have a say, make yourself relevant,- Rutte told journalists. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, and Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, have discussed Kyiv’s vision of a path to peace with China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi. Sybiha said on X the meeting that took place on the sidelines of the Munich conference was to -reaffirm mutual respect for territorial integrity-. On Friday, Wang told the conference that China believes all stakeholders in the war in Ukraine should participate in the peace talks, underscoring Europe’s role in them.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/16/ukraine-us-europe-donald-trump-russia-uk-relations-munich-conference-keir-starmer-live-latest-news	2025-02-16T00:34:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc1340e562fb3621e899bff82a7a81c1281bda60/0_280_7677_4608/master/7677.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=52c9812c64eb75be2e80ea40357c2a02
‘They may be Russian some day’: was this the week that changed the war in Ukraine?	As Donald Trump and his officials rip up three years of US rhetoric on supporting Kyiv, Volodymyr Zelenskyy is walking an unenviable diplomatic tightrope Volodymyr Zelenskyy has had some tough weeks in the past three years, but this past one may be up there with the worst of them. Back on Monday, in an hour-long interview with the Guardian at his Kyiv offices, the Ukrainian president was in a cautiously optimistic frame of mind. He said he had received -positive signals from the Americans- over upcoming negotiations. His team was working to fix a date for a meeting with Donald Trump, he said, and he was sure that the US president understood the importance of coordinating his position with Kyiv before talking to Russia.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/16/has-trump-made-the-first-move-in-the-ukraine-end-game	2025-02-16T00:00:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a4b65547766d5c04524080b3407cc2ded0a5d05/0_750_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9636271362ffce553266e996ca076765

Australia news live: Dutton suggests teal MPs ‘will never come our way’ in event of a hung parliament; poll points to Coalition wave in outer suburbs	Follow all today’s headlines live On the upcoming election, Spender says -we need to see how this plays out- and that -it is very unclear exactly what [parliament] is going to look like in the end.- On statements from Peter Dutton this morning that the Independents should back him in any minority government: Yes, I’m sure that is what he thinks and it will depend on the numbers and the shape of the crossbench and what people are willing to negotiate and back at that time so I think we really need to look at it at the time. In relation to climate, I haven’t worked with the Coalition because I don’t think they are committed to a transition in terms of the most cost-effective and frankly good for the climate transition that we have at the moment. So my point is I take things on the basis of the arguments and on the basis of the evidence and I am very open to working with a coalition government and I’m open to working with the Labor government, but that depends on what they are actually going to put on the table. What I want to see is good process, good parliamentary process where all of these issues are really fleshed out, where community can actually listen to the experts arguing about these laws so that we can get one answer that is going to get big money out of politics and make sure there is a level playing field. Myself and I think others on the crossbench have approached decisions on parliament and how we vote and what we support really on the basis of what the evidence is saying. Is it in our long-term interests? What do our communities think? What are the experts think? Bringing that together, backing good ideas from all sides, working with all sides to try and get good policy through – that is how I will continue to behave whatever form the next parliament takes.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/feb/16/australia-news-live-tropical-cyclone-zelia-foreign-investors-housing-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-federal-election-ntwnfb	2025-02-15T15:43:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb828aba8f44a179a149d9d3830dc6f16efe0e14/0_277_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c3f61b4d4c1945c044f0d2b37e30613f

Sydney’s archaic sewerage system a ‘significant’ source of microplastic pollution, CSIRO finds	Malabar wastewater plant discharges 5.4bn to 120bn of microplastics each day, report says, prompting calls for more advanced treatment processes It is not just human waste that is being pumped into the ocean off Sydney’s popular beaches due to the city’s unusual and archaic sewerage system – government scientists have confirmed billions of microplastics are also polluting the water. A CSIRO report, released in 2020 but not reported on until now, found the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) at Malabar discharged an estimated 5.4bn to 120bn of microplastics into the ocean each day.

‘We can’t change our leader again’: Tories despair at Badenoch’s poor PMQs performances	Allies want to give Conservative leader more time, but many insist her approach to Keir Starmer needs total overhaul Kemi Badenoch is being urged to overhaul her approach to prime minister’s questions and bring in more experienced advisers to prepare for the weekly political joust, amid criticisms of her approach to taking on Keir Starmer. Some MPs are complaining that their fledgling leader is raising the wrong topics and picking unconvincing lines of attack against the prime minister at PMQs, which is her most prominent opportunity to make the political weather. Others have been concerned about the level of support for her from colleagues during the exchanges.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/15/we-cant-change-our-leader-again-tories-despair-at-badenochs-poor-pmqs-performances	2025-02-15T10:44:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d8ca4841f87f870abbc02a13cdeef4e304a38ba/130_0_7878_4727/master/7878.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f4a2f6a662ef6d2ded6c77d8ab02a988

JD Vance’s Munich speech laid bare the collapse of the transatlantic alliance	The US vice-president was hypocritical and insensitive, but bracingly clear in his resetting of relationships Since 1963, the Munich Security Conference has seen many consequential speeches, notably Vladimir Putin announcing in 2007 that Russia would never accept a subordinate role in the new world order. But Friday’s speech by JD Vance, the US vice-president, has the potential to be the most consequential – the moment the world order against which Putin railed fell apart. Sometimes, even in this digital age, speeches can act as clarifiers. Yes, the 22 minutes were full of laughable hypocrisy, distorted portraits of European democracy and insensitivity to Europe’s trauma with fascism, but for what it said about the chasm in values between most in Europe and the Trump administration, it was hard to overlook.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/15/jd-vance-munich-speech-laid-bare-collapse-transatlantic-alliance-us-europe	2025-02-15T05:20:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fede26e2075023a08e341126494482c24e421d78/0_94_2526_1516/master/2526.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0b657cb7de8bf912e4468208ba3d036c

There are only two possible outcomes for any deal with Putin. If he remains in power, he will find a way to break the agreement.

Trump administration continues to gut federal workforce – US politics live	Tens of thousands of government employees told to leave amid Elon Musk’s call to ‘delete’ entire agencies Good morning, US politics blog readers. The Trump administration’s drive to downsize the federal workforce continues, with news that thousands of US government employees across the United States have been told they are being let go. The latest cuts target employees in their probationary periods at agencies that include the Department of Veterans Affairs, Small Business Administration and US Forest Service. That’s in addition to the 75,000 employees the White House said accepted its legally questionable offer of deferred resignations. All this is taking place after Elon Musk, who Trump has appointed as chair of his -department of government efficiency- said that his intention was to -delete entire agencies-. Federal worker unions have sued over his moves, while warning that the Trump-Musk drive to downsize government by going after the people who work there threatens to undermine programs Americans depend on. We’ll tell you more about that today. Here’s what else is going on: Trump is heading to Mar-a-Lago for the weekend this afternoon, but before he does, he’ll sign executive orders at 1pm. He often invites the press into the Oval Office to watch him do so. Top federal prosecutors have resigned after receiving orders from the justice department to drop bribery charges against New York mayor Eric Adams. We expect to hear more about the fallout from the decision throughout the day. JD Vance is scheduled to meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and deliver remarks at the Munich security conference, where America’s European allies are grasping for details of the Trump administration’s new policy on Ukraine.

Plus, Texas judge fines New York doctor for mailing abortion pills Good morning. The US vice-president, JD Vance, is to meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and other European leaders in Munich, after widespread criticism of Donald Trump’s statements on Ukraine. What’s the reaction been in Ukraine? Anger and betrayal were common emotions among those the Guardian spoke to in Kyiv.

Middle East crisis live: Hamas expected to name Israeli hostages it will free this weekend	Israel warned Thursday that Hamas must release three living hostages this weekend or face a resumption of the war in Gaza Hamas is expected on Friday to name three hostages it will release this weekend as part of a planned exchange for Palestinian prisoners and detainees, according to local media. Israeli media reported on Thursday that Hamas was to name three hostages it would release on Saturday, after it reiterated its commitment to the ceasefire and to carrying out the next exchange -according to the specified timetable-. The Israeli government has signalled that it intends to stick to the hostage-release schedule agreed in the ceasefire deal with Hamas, but warned that if the anticipated three hostages are not released on Saturday, it would go back to war. Hamas said on Thursday it will continue implementing the Gaza ceasefire deal, including hostage exchange. Yemen’s Houthis said they will immediately take military action if the US and Israel attack Gaza, the group’s leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, said in a televised speech on Thursday. In Israel, dozens of relatives of hostages held in Gaza blocked a highway near Tel Aviv, waving banners and demanding the terms of the ceasefire be respected, an AFP journalist said on Thursday. US secretary of state Marco Rubio is expected to visit Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates soon to discuss the fragile Gaza ceasefire. On Thursday, for the first time since the truce began, Israel’s military said it identified a rocket launch from Gaza. The rocket landed back inside the Palestinian territory and the military later said it had struck the launcher. Two Jerusalem booksellers detained this week on charges their books were causing -public disorder- have said the experience reflected an intensifying campaign by the Israeli government against Palestinian culture and free speech. Mahmoud Muna and his nephew Ahmed, whose family has owned the Educational Bookshop for more than 40 years, spent two days in detention and will remain under house arrest until Sunday, despite the absence of evidence to support the vague accusations against them.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/14/israel-gaza-war-hostages-ceasefire-middle-east-latest-news	2025-02-13T23:41:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff04320e94723d3eb6b98b1d9ada2fdd83cbdcb8/0_168_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8092470913aae97059028299b105d7aa

Trump’s Ukraine call with Putin leaves UK sounding at odds with reality	Statements that there can be no negotiations without Kyiv ring hollow when the US president has just sidelined it In the aftermath of Donald Trump’s incendiary call with Vladimir Putin, UK ministers and officials have had to do some extraordinary contortions. There is no greater priority in the UK’s foreign policy than keeping the volatile occupant of the White House on side. And that has meant over the past 24 hours that some pronouncements by the British government have seemed at odds with reality.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/13/trumps-ukraine-call-with-putin-leaves-uk-sounding-at-odds-with-reality	2025-02-13T11:18:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fb525d03bb91a12efe5151644272075fa895597/456_300_3976_2386/master/3976.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6b4f196c137cd21ec5bbf8b9aea1f62a

EU failed to Trump-proof Europe and now faces humiliation over Ukraine	As Putin’s actions again disrupt the start of a Munich security conference, Brussels largely has itself to blame The start of the Munich security conference has a habit of being disrupted by a display of power by Vladimir Putin. In 2022, the transatlantic security establishment gathered in the knowledge that Putin was days from launching his attack on Kyiv. In 2023, the opposition leader Alexei Navalny died in disputed circumstances in a Russian jail and this year Russia’s leader is on the brink of opening talks with Donald Trump that many analysts predict will end with Russia not just gaining Ukrainian territory but dismembering Ukraine as a sovereign independent state. For Europe it is a humiliation. And yet little that Trump or his defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, said on Wednesday about their approach to a ceasefire including the US’s refusal to commit further resources to Ukraine could have come as a shock. Indeed Europe largely has only itself to blame.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/13/eu-failed-trump-proof-europe-humiliation-ukraine	2025-02-13T10:35:39-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff6f8280eb4bf537d4241a1670b083db040b64f4/0_216_2962_1777/master/2962.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a2377b9c40b84246b6935159df785531

Norway to open protected rivers to hydropower plants	Green politicians describe plan as ‘a historic attack on Norwegian nature’ The Norwegian parliament has voted to open up protected rivers to hydropower plants, prompting fury from conservation groups who fear for the fate of fish and other wildlife.

Believing the prospect of a Ukrainian defeat to be closer after Trump’s call and statements on Wednesday, she thought for the first time that she perhaps ought to leave, for the sake of her daughter. -But then, leave and go where?

Ukraine just the latest Trump wheeze for Labour to try to defend and disown | John Crace	It was left to the poor junior defence minister Maria Eagle to walk that particular tightrope in the Commons In his ghostwritten 1987 bestseller, The Art of the Deal, Donald Trump delivers his own version of the American Dream. Get as much as you can for yourself. There’s always someone out there who’s stupider than you. Any attention is better than none. Promise people the Earth even if you know you can never deliver. Paint yourself orange and glue what’s left of your hair to your head. This is business as a macho willy waving contest. So much so you suspect The Donald is deeply insecure about the size of his own. But maybe we should have read between the lines better. For the real message is: -Always let someone else take the hit.- After all, it wasn’t Trump who was left out of pocket when his hotels and casinos six times filed for bankruptcy between 1991 and 2009 due to an inability to meet scheduled payments. It was his creditors. That’s a business style The Donald has taken into his presidency. After the Trump Plaza and the Trump Tower, we now have the Trump Toilet.

Shortly after the announcement, Sabsabi admitted to being shocked at being chosen, telling the Guardian: -I felt that, in this time and in this space, this wouldn’t happen because of who I am.-	https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/feb/13/khaled-sabsabi-dropped-as-australias-representative-to-venice-biennale-ntwnfb	2025-02-13T06:15:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f348bcc4c9e1efa84256dfab19323de7db70e4f1/0_149_4416_2650/master/4416.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=685a3f5f0ad08e16cf53f86d8e4c11eb

Price hikes and shortages flagged after banana crops ‘cop a flogging’ in north Queensland floods	Banana prices expected to rise in the short term, while cost of sugar should remain stable despite damage to cane crops Australians can expect banana shortages and price hikes as the cleanup begins in flood-ravaged north Queensland, which grows almost 94% of Australia’s banana crop, growers say. But the good news, for consumers at least, is that any banana dramas playing out on supermarket shelves over coming days will be linked to transport disruption, rather than widespread crop destruction – meaning the price and availability of one of the country’s favourite fruits should soon return to normal.

Backlash over ‘spiteful’ move to block small boat refugees from ever claiming British citizenship – UK politics live	Stella Creasy says Home Office decision ‘erects more barriers’ to refugees integrating and contributing to communities in UK Good morning. On Monday MPs debated, and passed, the second reading of the border security, asylum and immigration bill. It is a signficant piece of legislation that repeals a lot of the Rwanda-policy law passed by the Tories and gives the authorities new anti-terrorism-style powers to tackle people smuggling. There is a good summary of it here. During the debate Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said one reason why the Conservatives were opposed to the bill was because it repealed section 32 of the Illegal Migration Act 2023 which -prevents people who enter the country illegally from gaining citizenship-. He went on: By repealing that section, the bill will create a pathway to citizenship for people who entered the country illegally, and I think that is unconscionable. This change flies in the face of reason. The British public want refugees who have been given safety in our country to integrate into and contribute to their new communities, so it makes no sense for the government to erect more barriers. We know that men women and children who are refugees want to feel part of the country that has given them a home, and support to rebuild their lives. So many refugees over many generations have become proud hard working British citizens as doctors, entrepreneurs and other professionals. Becoming a British citizen has helped them give back to their communities and this should be celebrated, not prevented. We urge ministers to urgently reconsider. What this message is saying is that we will judge your asylum claim, so we will let you stay in the country, but we will not expect you to be part of our community. I just genuinely, gently, say to my colleagues on the front bench, I think that is counterproductive. That is not where the British public are at. They recognize that there are not safe routes [for many refugees wanting to come to the UK]. If you are an Iranian dissident right now fleeing the regime, there is not a safe route. So you may well have come in a boat. We should absolutely interrogate your claim. If your claim is not well founded, you should not be able to stay. At first I hoped this was some sort of accident, a residue of the Illegal Migration Act, which legislated to have this same effect, still making its way through the system. But it doesn’t look like it. It looks deliberate. Even though those provisions of the Illegal Migration Act are being scrapped by this government. A permanent bar on citizenship for illegal entrants is a bad idea. It creates a permanent group on non citizens who are forever excluded from civic life no matter how long they live here and no matter what they do.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/12/pmqs-starmer-badenoch-small-boat-arrivals-citizenship-blocked-uk-politics-live-news	2025-02-12T01:22:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb7918a41f20b36de1b6b6419940b9c7c446def2/0_138_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8305877a5c6da4a780f0e8fdce0d85ec

Few words can fully capture the first few weeks of Donald Trump’s presidency. Dizzying? Unrelenting? Disorienting? Middle East | Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Israel will resume fighting in Gaza if Hamas does not release more hostages by noon on Saturday, endorsing a threat by Donald Trump that could shatter the three-week-old ceasefire between the two sides. Economy | Nationwide, Britain’s biggest building society, has waded into a row over whether the government should cut tax breaks on cash Isas, arguing such a move would reduce the availability of mortgages for first-time buyers. AI | The US and the UK have refused to sign the Paris AI summit’s declaration on -inclusive and sustainable- artificial intelligence, in a blow to hopes for a concerted approach to developing and regulating the technology. Assisted dying | The Labour MP Kim Leadbeater has said her assisted dying bill for England and Wales will still have the strongest safeguards in the world despite the removal of a requirement for scrutiny from a high court judge. Opponents derided the change as -rushed and badly thought out-. Housing | Rogue landlords in England will face curbs on how much housing benefit income they can receive if their properties are substandard, Angela Rayner has said as she announced an extra £350m for affordable housing.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/12/wednesday-briefing-us-president-donald-trump-chaos	2025-02-11T22:53:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a784c09859b10073a3f0a91b02dd1c5bd34fadeb/656_186_3988_2393/master/3988.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=739d45f6c0cb77603873edd40cecf96b

Amid the ceasefire wrangling, how popular is Hamas in Gaza now?	The group still projects a powerful presence but, after all the damage, it will need to divert blame if the truce collapses Of the many factors that will determine the fate of the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, one of the most difficult to quantify and predict is the level of popular support for Hamas. On Monday, Hamas threatened to delay the release of further Israeli hostages, accusing Israel of breaches of the ceasefire deal. The uncertainty, just over halfway into the ceasefire’s six-week first phase, complicates talks on the far more difficult second phase. It also jeopardises the pause in the devastating fighting and the increase in humanitarian aid for Gaza that the truce has made possible.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/amid-the-ceasefire-wrangling-how-popular-is-hamas-in-gaza-now	2025-02-11T08:35:14-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3441c1fde51b1285dffe7c3555d314b69b9b0d2/0_311_8103_4861/master/8103.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6e18570896036c41efa9ca8dbdb3edbf

Amid court losses, Trump administration talk of ignoring rules fuels fears of constitutional crisis – live	Democrats and scholars fear Trump will create a constitutional crisis by defying the courts blocking the administration’s efforts to upend federal government Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump’s efforts to upend the federal government have been given a dim reception by judges nationwide, who in recent days handed down rulings blocking his attempt to curtail birthright citizenship for undocumented immigrants, allow Elon Musk and his cohort access to the Treasury’s payment systems, coax government workers to resign en masse and freeze federal funding, among others. But as the decisions have come down talk among Trump administration officials of ignoring decisions they disagree with has increased. JD Vance was the most prominent of those who have floated these ideas, musing over the weekend that -judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.- Such statements have sparked worries among Democrats and legal scholars that the Trump administration will create a constitutional crisis by defying the courts. You can expect to hear plenty more about that today, as the president’s campaign, and the legal battle it has created, continues. Here’s what else we are watching for: Trump will host King Abdullah II of Jordan at the White House beginning at 11.30am, then sign unspecified executive orders at 3pm. Yesterday’s orders included new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and regulations to hold off on enforcing an anti-bribery law. Today may be the day that House Republicans release details of their big bill that is expected to cut taxes and government spending and pay for Trump administration priorities such as mass deportations. Mike Johnson and his team have a press conference scheduled for 10am. Hamas said they are holding off on the release of future Israeli hostages over breaches of the ceasefire deal, prompting Trump to say -let hell break out- if more aren’t freed by Saturday.

NSW Health could save $35m a year by giving psychiatrists a 25% pay rise, modelling suggests	Exclusive: Modelling assumes the pay rise would entice psychiatrists back to work and reduce state’s reliance on casual doctors over four years NSW Health could save $35m a year and improve patient care by giving psychiatrists a 25% pay rise compared with what they are currently spending on staff due to a reliance on contractors to fill vacancies, according to modelling seen by Guardian Australia. The modelling, conducted by a group of senior psychiatrists who have worked in medical administration, assumes the pay rise would entice psychiatrists back to work as staff specialists, who are employed in permanent roles in New South Wales public health, and reduce the state’s reliance on casual doctors, known as locums, over four years.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/12/nsw-health-could-save-35m-a-year-by-giving-psychiatrists-a-25-pay-rise-modelling-suggests-ntwnfb	2025-02-11T06:00:05-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/735eaf799e019f3d45a288556aa95aa04a77dead/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b11cc78bad9ea5182545fe87194e8aec
Tenants demand protections as LA fires exacerbate housing crisis: ‘Huge source of stress’	Renters are not only facing an escalation in rent prices but also pressure to evict apartments from landlords Wendy Lopez, a single mother of three from Guatemala, received an eviction order the day before wildfires destroyed Pacific Palisades, where she worked as a caregiver for people with disabilities. The crisis only escalated the eviction process, Lopez said. The landlord for her rent-stabilized Mid City apartment has sent her threatening letters nearly every day. On 1 February , he raised her monthly rent from $1320 to $1430, exceeding the 4% legal rent increase limit. Moving is not an option, she said, because rent for similar housing elsewhere has doubled since the fires.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/11/housing-rent-protection-la-fires	2025-02-11T06:00:05-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e9ee1eb25fdeb3d5427a458370140fafb77b29f/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5b85cc447848686e4ad3d16b4e024ada

Assisted dying bill has lost Commons majority now high court signoff abandoned, says MP – UK politics live	Danny Kruger says those who backed the bill did so under false premise after change to safeguards announced Good morning. In parliament MPs and peers don’t simply vote yes or no on proposed legislation. They debate it at length, over weeks and months, and consider amendments line by line. This process is at the heart of parliamentary democracy, and it happens like this so that bills, in theory, can be improved before they reach the statute book. There is a good example of this today. The terminally ill adults (end of life) bill is perhaps the most consequential bill going through this session of parliament and the Labour MP who has sponsored it, Kim Leadbeater, has announced a significant change. As Jessica Elgot reports, she wants to scrap the requirement for an assisted dying application to be approved by a high court judge, because the judiciary said this process would be too time-consuming and would clog up the courts. Instead an expert panel, with a legal chair, would vet the assisted dying applications already approved by two doctors.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/11/assisted-dying-bill-high-court-judge-kim-leadbetter-danny-kruger-keir-starmer-labour-uk-politics-live-news	2025-02-11T01:29:28-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e404adb8611a601af5a30bc11cb7a770fc34452c/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=09f17ad23a4bfa571b2073a994d71ce5

Tuesday briefing: Will Labour’s own ‘go home’ moment work – or lead to more desperate measures?	In today’s newsletter: As the Home Office trails a tough new stance against illegal immigration, Daniel Trilling explains what an alternative approach might look like Good morning. Last night, the Home Office published footage of a group of men being escorted from a bus onto a deportation flight. With that release, the Labour government gains the dubious honour of being the first to publish that kind of footage. It follows the publication on Sunday of video showing immigration raids on illegal workers, and comes as ministers announce that nearly 19,000 refused asylum seekers, foreign criminals and other immigration offenders had been returned to their home countries since the election. Labour explains that it has a good story to tell. All of this makes for bleak viewing – and that’s the point. The Labour government is pushing a well-trailed effort to counter Reform and the Conservatives on immigration by showing it is every bit as tough as its rivals. As well as the videos, there are Facebook ads – styled in Reform’s signature turquoise – and a leaflet resembling a red-top newspaper declaring that -Labour is tackling illegal immigration-. Taken together, the implication is clear: the hostile environment has not gone away. Trump tariffs | Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum on Monday, ramping up his controversial bid to boost the US economy by hiking taxes on imports from overseas. The changes are not due to come into effect until 4 March, raising the prospect of the White House brokering deals with governments seeking reprieve. Assisted dying | MPs are to scrap the requirement for a high court judge to decide on assisted dying cases, with an expert panel to scrutinise decisions instead. The removal of mandatory high court involvement is likely to worry MPs who had been reassured the safeguards were uniquely robust. Israel-Gaza war | Hamas has said it is delaying the release of Israeli hostages indefinitely over -violations- of the ceasefire deal, prompting Israel’s defence minister to order the military to prepare for -any scenario in Gaza-. Mediators now fear that the three-week old ceasefire is in jeopardy.

Lucy Letby and the medical experts who believe she is innocent – podcast	She was called the worst child serial killer in Britain in modern times. So why are medical experts saying her conviction is unsafe? Josh Halliday and Felicity Lawrence report Lucy Letby was convicted for the murder and attempted murder of more than a dozen babies. She has been called the worst child serial killer the UK had seen. But even before the trial was over experts had begun raising concerns about her conviction. Then, last week, came a bombshell press conference in which a panel of renowned neonatal experts said they believed not just that Letby’s conviction was unsafe - but that there was no murder or deliberate harm. Instead they said the deaths had been caused by a series of factors including understaffing and a lack of skills on the ward to treat the babies they were caring for. So what is the evidence that the panel was looking at and why do so many questions seem to swirl around the Letby trial?	https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/feb/11/lucy-letby-and-the-medical-experts-who-believe-she-is-innocent-podcast	2025-02-10T19:00:05-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/921b1f342a3da5476688e7e6b85dff3ddff967e4/48_0_1769_1062/master/1769.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=01bad96d03fa2790b27c3257a69ebc91

Middle East crisis live: Trump says Gaza ceasefire should be cancelled if hostage release delayed	US president said it was ultimately up to Israel but he warned that ‘all hell is going to break out’ if the remaining hostages aren’t released on Saturday Hello and welcome to our live coverage of events in the Middle East. The latest development is that US President Donald Trump has said that if all the hostages held in Gaza are not returned by Saturday at noon he would propose canceling the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and letting -all hell break loose.- Donald Trump said his plan to -take over Gaza- would not include a right of return for the more than 2 million Palestinians that he has said have -no alternative- but to leave because of the destruction left by Israel’s military campaign. Trump continued to endorse a plan for the Palestinians to be resettled in Egypt and Jordan, a plan that both countries have rejected. The remarks are the latest effective endorsement of ethnic cleansing by the US president. Hamas’s announcement prompted Israel’s defence minister to put the country’s military on alert with orders to prepare for -any scenario in Gaza-. Israel’s security cabinet has moved forward a meeting to discuss negotiations on second phase, which had been set for Tuesday evening. The army has cancelled all leave for soldiers in the Gaza division, the Kan news outlet reported, in a sign that Israeli authorities are preparing for the resumption of war. Mediators fear a breakdown of the three-week-old ceasefire and have postponed talks until they receive a clear indication of Washington’s intent to continue with the phased deal, according to reports. Qatar had reportedly warned Israeli officials at the weekend that even the first stage of the ceasefire deal was being put in jeopardy by provocative statements from Benjamin Netanyahu and by his government’s approach to talks on a second stage. Israeli police raided a leading Palestinian-owned bookshop in Jerusalem and detained two of its owners, accusing them of selling books that supported terrorism, including a children’s colouring book entitled From the Jordan to the Sea. Karim Khan, the international criminal court’s (ICC) chief prosecutor, is the person to be hit with economic and travel sanctions authorised by Trump that target the court over investigations of US citizens or US allies, the White House has confirmed. The US president signed an executive order last week authorising aggressive economic sanctions against the ICC, accusing the body of -illegitimate and baseless actions- targeting the US and Israel. A former UK supreme court judge described Israel’s assault on Gaza as -grossly disproportionate- and said there was -at least an arguable case- that it was genocidal.

First Thing: Trump to announce 25% aluminum and steel tariffs as China’s levies kick in	US allies criticize Trump’s plans as harmful for all parties. Plus, the Forbes ‘30 Under 30’ curse Good morning. Donald Trump has said he will announce new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the US on Monday that would affect -everybody-, including its largest trading partners, Canada and Mexico, in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul. How have US allies reacted? Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, said tariffs would harm European economies but also the US, given the level of economic ties. -It means if you put tariffs on a lot of sectors, it will increase the costs and create inflation in the US. Is it what your people want? I’m not so sure,- Macron said. How are markets reacting? Gold hit an all-time high of $2,900 per ounce, as trade war fears spark a dash for safe assets.

Minister defends plan to broadcast footage of deportation of illegal workers – UK politics live	Angela Eagle defends government plan to broadcast deportations as Home Office launches new immigration raids The Labour MP Oliver Ryan is to meet the government chief whip to decide on any sanctions over his membership of a WhatsApp group that featured racist, sexist and other offensive comments, Angela Eagle has said. Peter Walker has the story. Good morning. Politicians like to claim that they are completely different from their opponents, because to win elections they need dividing line issues, but in truth the similarities can be striking too, because they end up facing the same challenges, and the electorate does not change much either. This Labour government is not the same as the last Conservative one. But at times it has sounded like Rishi Sunak (it adopted his signature anti-smoking legislation wholesale), Liz Truss (ministers constantly stress that growth is the number one priority) and even Boris Johnson (after the negativism of last year’s budget, there is a pivot towards more optimism). And today it it is sounding a bit like Theresa May in her -hostile environment- phase as home secretary. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, is expected to join an early morning raid this week targeting illegal working, while the government will broadcast footage of deportations, a number of them involving foreign criminals, from detention to removal centres and on to waiting planes … Downing Street is planning to go beyond simply taking the fight to Reform. -We don’t think it’s enough just to look strong on migration, we actually need to be strong.

Emmanuel Macron hosts AI summit, while EU braces for Trump tariffs – Europe live	Tech conference will also mark first visit to Europe for new US vice-president JD Vance Responding to Trump’s comments on aluminium and steel tariffs overnight, the EU has just said that it had not received any official notification yet, but insisted there was no justification of any such move and it would be ready to respond if needed. A spokesperson for the European Commission said: We will not respond to broad announcements without details or written clarification. The EU sees no justification for the imposition of tariffs on its exports. We will react to protect the interests of European businesses, workers and consumers from unjustified measures. In general: The imposition of tariffs would be unlawful and economically counterproductive, especially given the deeply integrated production chains the EU and U.S. established through transatlantic trade and investment. Tariffs are essentially taxes. By imposing tariffs, the U.S. would be taxing its own citizens, raising costs for business, and fuelling inflation. Moreover, tariffs heighten economic uncertainty and disrupt the efficiency and integration of global markets.

Ukraine war live: Zelenskyy ready for talks if given ‘an understanding that US and Europe will not abandon us’	Ukrainian president’s comments came as Donald Trump indicated he had been in contact with Russia’s Vladimir Putin Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he would be ready for talks in any format if he has -an understanding that America and Europe will not abandon us-. Chinese President Xi Jinping has accepted Russia’s invitation to Moscow to attend second world war commemorations, Tass state news agency reported on Monday. Trump’s national security adviser Mike Waltz said on Sunday that senior US diplomats would be in Europe this week -talking through the details of how to end this war and that will mean getting both sides to the table-. In an interview on NBC Waltz said the Russian economy was not doing well and that Trump -is prepared to tax, to tariff, to sanction- Moscow to get Putin to the negotiating table. He added that the Trump administration is looking to use this week’s engagements to begin talks on clawing back some of the United States’ assistance to Ukraine nd said European allies would need to take a greater role in supporting Ukraine. Russia’s deputy foreign minister said Moscow had yet to receive a good offer to start talks on Ukraine, in remarks published on Monday. -It is important that words be backed up by practical steps that take into account Russia’s legitimate interests, demonstrating a readiness to eradicate the root causes of the crisis and recognise the new realities,- Mikhail Galuzin told Ria state news agency in an interview. -Concrete proposals of this nature have not yet been received,- he said. Russia launched an overnight drone attack on Kyiv, injuring a woman and damaging several houses in the northeastern city of Sumy, Ukrainian officials said on Monday. The Ukrainian military said on Monday that it had shot down 61 out of 83 drones with 22 more likely downed by electronic warfare. Russia said on Sunday that its forces had captured the eastern Ukrainian village of Orikhovo-Vasylivka, near the strategic military hub of Chasiv Yar that Moscow is attempting to seize. An explosion on Sunday on an oil tanker at a port in north-west Russia forced the crew to evacuate and was being investigated, the country’s federal shipping agency said.

Middle East crisis live: returning Palestinians ‘shocked’ by ‘complete scale of destruction’ of northern Gaza	Unicef says many displaced people had hoped their homes had been spared, but have returned to total devastation Welcome back to our live coverage of the latest news from the Middle East. Displaced Palestinian families who have returned to northern Gaza since the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas came into effect last month have been -shocked- by the -complete scale of destruction- of their homes and neighbourhoods, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef). The families that I’ve spoken to this week here in the north of Gaza have been shocked by what they have returned to. They’ve been shocked by the complete scale of this destruction. Even after seeing photos and videos from the south, they hoped that their homes, their neighborhoods, their communities, maybe had been spared. Egypt will host an Arab summit on 27 February to discuss what it said were -serious- developments for Palestinian people, according to the country’s foreign ministry. Egypt has rejected Donald Trump’s plans – condemned as ethnic cleansing - to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank to neighbouring countries such as Egypt and Jordan. Speaking on Sunday, the US President repeated his pledge to take control of the Gaza Strip. -I’m committed to buying and owning Gaza. As far as us rebuilding it, we may give it to other states in the Middle East to build sections of it. Other people may do it through our auspices. But we’re committed to owning it, taking it, and making sure that Hamas doesn’t move back. There’s nothing to move back into. The place is a demolition site. The remainder will be demolished,- he told reporters. A spokesperson for Israeli prime minster Benjamin Netanyahu said that an Israeli delegation arrived in Qatar on Sunday for further ceasefire talks between Hamas and Israel. Reuters reports that indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas on the next stage of the ceasefire are set to begin this week.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/10/middle-east-crisis-live-palestinians-complete-destruction-northern-gaza-latest-news	2025-02-09T23:51:54-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85754371c4999963567a264f47c0e1179e33efc7/0_209_6260_3757/master/6260.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7b4acfd65ee2f2a9931be04665e88d68
Monday briefing: Why the brutal fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo could spiral into wider war	In today’s newsletter: As Rwandan-backed M23 rebels seize more territory and the humanitarian crisis worsens, what’s the background to the war and prospect of peace? Good morning. Over the weekend, the presidents of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda – Félix Tshisekedi and Paul Kagame – were among those who took part in a regional summit aimed at ending the resurgent violence in eastern DRC. The summit ended with a call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. But while there was a lull in the fighting yesterday, many fear that a ceasefire is less likely than escalation to a wider regional war. Rwanda does not officially admit to its involvement in the latest episode of the long-running and devastating conflict in eastern DRC. But M23, an armed group with Rwanda’s tacit and practical support, has taken the capital of North Kivu province, Goma, and is now moving south to expand the territory under its control. At stake is control of a mineral-rich region of crucial strategic significance, and the fate of civilians there who are frequently the subject of ethnically targeted attacks – but also the question of whether national borders can act as any sort of constraint. Arms trade | Britain’s system for controlling arms exports is broken, subject to political manipulation and has seen conduct that crossed the threshold into complicity with war crimes, a former UK diplomat has claimed. Mark Smith said officials were instructed to manipulate findings on the misuse of UK arms by allies. Immigration | The Home Office is launching a fresh wave of immigration raids as Labour attempts to counter the growing political threat from Reform UK. Amid anger from critics who believe the approach echoes Theresa May’s -hostile environment- regime, the government will broadcast footage of deportations from detention to removal centres and on to waiting planes. Israel-Gaza war | Israeli forces have withdrawn from the strategic corridor that divides northern and southern Gaza, as part of a ceasefire plan that has brought a fragile pause to the 16-month war. Despite the withdrawal – and the release of hostages and prisoners – little progress has been made on negotiating the second phase of the deal. Air pollution | More than 1,100 people a year in the UK are developing the most prevalent form of lung cancer as a result of air pollution, the Guardian can reveal. Health experts, cancer charities and environmental campaigners said the UK findings were -devastating- Trump tariffs | Donald Trump has said he will announce new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the US on Monday that would affect -everybody’, including its largest trading partners Canada and Mexico, in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/10/monday-briefing-why-the-brutal-conflict-in-the-democratic-republic-of-congo-could-spiral-into-wider-war	2025-02-09T22:53:17-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80e2fafb43e0d8e758c182d76562fdb8d12436d5/0_352_5651_3392/master/5651.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40778a090c4c3570294644c7f90a0d05

France braces for trial of surgeon accused of sexually abusing hundreds of children	Joël Le Scouarnec has been charged with the rape or sexual assault of 299 patients from 1989 to 2014 The biggest child abuse trial in French history will open in Brittany this month amid anger that a surgeon was allegedly able to attack hundreds of young patients over decades, targeting some when they were under anaesthetic, in the post-surgery recovery room or in their hospital beds. France is braced for serious questions over child protection amid harrowing testimony from a record number of alleged victims of Joël Le Scouarnec, 73, who worked as a digestive surgeon.

‘Finally this is justice’: the Assad torture survivors who guard their former jail	Men imprisoned and abused at the notorious Palestine branch detention centre return to the facility as free men The first thing the three militants did on entering Syria’s notorious Palestine branch prison as free men was to search for their former solitary confinement cells. They crossed under the towering iron gates and barbed wire at the edge of the Damascus complex after the fall of Bashar al-Assad and headed immediately to the squalid cells just a few feet wide where they had spent years huddled in the dark, staring at the back of the heavy metal doors and drawing on the walls. Mahmoud Chtawi said that when he entered he lifted his head to gaze up at the 10-storey concrete building just to prove to himself that he could. For decades, anyone passing the facility run by military intelligence was terrified to even steal a glance. He headed to find cell number 15, firing off rounds of bullets in celebration when he did. He then decided to spend the night inside his former cell to -process the memories- of his time there.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/10/syria-assad-torture-survivors-guard-their-former-jail	2025-02-09T21:00:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb79033552b4b44223afec7b082db828dd66c8ec/0_127_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b983ed59b02e39e1268446933989d34e

Why Trump blinked before imposing his ‘beautiful’ tariffs on Canada and Mexico	Trump has teased two of the US’s biggest trading partners with levies but has moved the goalpost at least three times in two weeks Donald Trump was in his element in the Oval Office this week. Surrounded by cameras, flanked by billionaire allies and confronted by a barrage of questions about whether he was really prepared to unleash a trade war on the US’s closest neighbors, the president talked tough. By his telling, powerful economies were scrambling to bend to his will. Hours earlier, Mexico had announced a series of measures to shore up its border, prompting the White House to hastily postpone the imposition of 25% tariffs on all its goods; Canada would announce similar measures, and receive the same reprieve, later that day.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/09/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china	2025-02-09T05:00:01-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e6f48fc5a55df678120527b901ed80a3fc706f1/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5018f35d495d58b390673e3ebd3338c9

Nigel Farage has been a threat to every recent UK prime minister. But this is something new	Reform has surged in the polls, panicking both Labour and the Conservatives. It’s a trap, and the risks are high Nigel Farage is making trouble again. Reform, his latest political vehicle, has surged in the polls, moving into first place with some pollsters, and ruffling feathers on Labour back benches. While Farage has caused headaches for every prime minister since David Cameron, his recent rise is something new. Reform scored an average of almost 25% in January polls, past the peaks achieved by Ukip or the Brexit party in earlier parliaments. And while past Farage surges were spikes driven by circumstances – European parliament elections, the EU referendum, the collapse of Theresa May’s ­government – the current rise is more sustained.

Rediscovered, a young English novelist’s warning of the Nazi threat	Crooked Cross, Sally Carson’s ‘electrifying masterpiece’ from 1934, to be republished Sally Carson was not an oracle or a prophet, just a young woman from Dorset, born in 1901. Yet she foresaw a dark and violent future for Europe and gave voice to those fears in a 1934 novel that is now being hailed as -an electrifying masterpiece-. Carson’s book, Crooked Cross, predicted the scale of the Nazi threat and is to be republished for the first time this spring, ahead of the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war. Controversial in its day, her novel had to walk a careful path to avoid the accusation that it was alarmist about the Fuhrer’s aims. A stage adaptation of her story was even censored, shorn of all its -Heil Hitlers-.	https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/feb/08/rediscovered-a-young-english-novelists-warning-of-the-nazi-threat	2025-02-07T21:00:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f493fd41ed958183bd48f6351bea672f8b43bf1c/0_577_3292_1975/master/3292.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=be1ee4a42b29d9c98c079301de44cd7a
‘We make the most of every minute’: relief and resolve at Gaza’s few reopened restaurants	Palestinians find moment of respite in going out to dinner or relaxing in cafes as devastated territory seeks to rebuild It is a Thursday night in Khan Younis and business is good at the al-Sawafiri restaurant. Not far away, entire blocks have been reduced to rubble, but here, in this small corner of the city in the southern Gaza Strip, the damage is less extensive. Raed al-Sawafiri, the owner and manager, stands in front of chicken rotating on a grill and smiles. Every one of his plastic tables is occupied. Al-Sawafiri had no experience of the restaurant trade until very recently. Displaced 10 times during the 16-month conflict in Gaza, the 23-year-old opened his first establishment in Rafah, the southernmost city in the territory, early this year, after sourcing old equipment and sending his father to the border with Egypt to buy meat.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/08/gaza-restaurants-khan-younis-ceasefire-war	2025-02-07T21:00:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ee1be8c819e5c64524cbb56beb8103b827457a8/0_341_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6f6b9be2204cac59c07341a9989d4e78

Trump’s blitz to expand his power is direct threat to democracy, experts say	Executive actions aims to test limits of president’s authority and perhaps win backing from conservative supreme court Donald Trump’s spate of executive orders include many aimed at expanding his presidential powers in areas that pose threats to the rule of law and democratic norms in the US, say legal experts. Trump’s orders include the abrupt firing of 17 agency watchdogs called inspectors general without giving Congress the required 30 days’ notice, the rejection of birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants, which is guaranteed by the 14th amendment, and pardons for more than 1,500 people convicted for their roles in the January 6 Capitol insurrection.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/07/trump-executive-actions-democracy	2025-02-07T03:00:42-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3c38934d4b9bf61bf5a7e5502cfaed3b0935315/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b927889136057bc2d11211ab7986dbb9

Trump’s Gaza plan suggests his pro-settler advisers are in the ascendant	Idea of US occupying Gaza and pushing out the Palestinians delights Israel’s pro-settler movement and its US allies Donald Trump’s plan for Gaza has no cost estimates or budget. There are no troop estimates or outlines in the Pentagon. Even Donald Trump’s allies have admitted that his proposal for the US to -take over- Gaza and for Palestinians to make their homes elsewhere was an idea he had only tinkered with before Tuesday evening, when it tumbled out to the obvious surprise of his closest aides. One of the very few constituencies to welcome the proposal – which if enacted would amount to the effective ethnic cleansing of the territory – was Israel’s rightwing pro-settler movement and their allies in the US. In these circles there is optimism that the shifting US policy gives the green light to settlement expansion or even the eventual annexation of all the occupied Palestinian territories, including the West Bank.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/07/trumps-gaza-plan-suggests-his-pro-settler-advisers-are-in-the-ascendant	2025-02-07T02:03:54-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/530e4383f554502e7e68883489965326c465e093/0_342_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d2557e86adde8e06e56e08c732119c31

Some people on sickness and disability benefits ‘taking the mickey’, says Liz Kendall – UK politics live	The work and pensions secretary said those who think they were unable to work probably could with the right support Good morning. Keir Starmer is chairing an extended meeting of cabinet today. There will be a normal cabinet meeting, and then a political cabinet, where ministers will discuss the many challenges facing the government in a party political context. They won’t be in Downing Street, and it has been described by some people as an away days, but it is not one of those away days that involves a spa hotel in the countryside. They will be somewhere in Whitehall apparently, but being out of Downing Street should provide a change of scene. One of the problems the government needs to address soon is what to do about the rising cost of working-age people on sickness and disability benefits. A recent inquiry by the Lords economic affairs committee found that that there are 3.7m, people of working-age on health-related benefits – up 1.2m on the figure five years ago – and that incapcity and disability benefits are costing almost £65bn, more than the government spends on defence. Kendall said that some people on sickness and disability benefits who think they could not do a job probably could work with the right support. Asked about a DWP survey saying 49% of people on these benefits think they will never be able to work, Kendall said: I don’t blame people for thinking that they can’t, because they’re stuck on a waiting list for treatment. They haven’t had the proper support that they might need from the job centre or the skills that they need to get the jobs, we’ve also got to create more jobs in the areas that need them most. So I’m under no illusions about the scale of the challenge that we’ve got. I believe more of those people could work. But even if we just start with those who say they can, we need to do more to get them back into work. She said that the government’s drive to cut waiting lists would make a difference. She said: When 2 in 5 of people on sickness and disability benefits are stuck on an NHS waiting list, we’ve got to drive those down. That’s why health secretary Wes Streeting has got a big plan to drive down that backlog, get people the help they need. She said there were some people claiming sickness and disability benefits who were -taking the mickey-. Asked if she agreed with people who think that too many claimants are just pretending they cannot work, she replied: If you speak to people here today, you will know that many of them have either just lost jobs that they desperately miss, or really want to get back into to work once they’ve got their health condition under control. So I think that there are many more people who want to work. I have no doubt, as there always have been, there are people who shouldn’t be on those benefits who are taking the mickey and that is not good enough - we have to end that. She suggested that some young people might have to adjust more to having to work. Asked if she agreed that some conditions were being over-medicalised, and that people were taking time off for anxiety when in the past that might just have been regarded as normal worry, she replied: I think there is genuinely a problem with many young people, particularly the Covid generation. But we can’t have a situation where doing a day’s work is in itself seen as stressful. I went to visit one of my local supermarkets recently to see the brilliant work they’re doing with the charity to get young people into work. And we saw two things. One was young people with genuine mental health problems who the supermarket was doing great stuff to help them get work and stay in work.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/07/liz-kendall-benefits-welfare-angela-rayner-grenfell-tower-uk-politics-live-news-updates	2025-02-07T01:30:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea5ab1324564526581acc8830e74948b8a15cbba/469_297_4649_2791/master/4649.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1bd8ada294a19cc9ca6d1d3d6a760b98
US politics live: Trump administration sued by largest government workers’ union over dismantling of USAid	American Federation of Government Employees and American Foreign Service Association seeks order to block ‘unconstitutional actions’ Good morning, Donald Trump has signed an executive order authorising unprecedented and aggressive sanctions against the international criminal court (ICC), accusing the body of -illegitimate and baseless actions- targeting the US and Israel. Leaders of the southern California city of San Clemente, which lies between Los Angeles and San Diego, are partnering with US Customs and Border Protection to place surveillance cameras along the city’s beach to detect boats carrying passengers attempting to enter the country without authorization. -People have observed pangas crammed with illegal aliens, hitting our beach, and then scattering in the community or jumping into a van, which is parked nearby and ready to receive them,- Knoblock told the LA Times. The largest US government workers’ union and an association of foreign service workers sued the Trump administration on Thursday in an effort to reverse its aggressive dismantling of the US Agency for International Development. The lawsuit, filed in Washington, DC federal court by the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Foreign Service Association, seeks an order blocking what it says are -unconstitutional and illegal actions- that have created a -global humanitarian crisis- Donald Trump demanded the -termination- of 60 Minutes, a staple of US broadcast news. The move is a continuation of the president’s vendetta against the media that also included baseless claims that money from the country’s beleaguered foreign aid body had been illicitly funding news organisations. Trump said: -CBS should lose its license, and the cheaters at 60 Minutes should all be thrown out, and this disreputable ‘NEWS’ show should be immediately terminated.- Donald Trump’s shutdown of USAid has already had disastrous effects on humanitarian aid and development programmes around the world, but it has also ceded ground to the US’s chief rival, China, analysts have said. -[The US is handing] on a silver platter to China the perfect opportunity to expand its influence, at a time when China’s economy is not doing very well,- said professor Huang Yanzhong, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. The NCAA changed its participation policy for transgender athletes on Thursday, limiting competition in women’s sports to athletes assigned female at birth. The move came one day after Donald Trump signed an executive order intended to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports. Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly gave Donald Trump a -golden pager- during their meeting in Washington DC this week, in an apparent reference to Israel’s deadly attack against Hezbollah in Lebanon last year.In photos circulating online, the golden pager can be seen mounted on a piece of wood, accompanied by a golden plaque that reads in black lettering: -To President Donald J. Trump, Our greatest friend and greatest ally.

Middle East live: Netanyahu applauds Trump’s ‘bold’ ICC sanctions	Israeli PM thanks Trump for executive order; Amnesty chief says sanctions seek to ‘destroy what the international community has painstakingly constructed’ Hello, and welcome to our live coverage of developments in the Middle East. It’s nearly XY am in Gaza and Jerusalem and if you are just tuning in, there is plenty to catch up on. Rights activists have strongly criticised Donald Trump’s sanctioning of the international criminal court (ICC). The US president’s announcement, in which he claimed the court had targeted the US and its close ally, Israel, came two days after he declared the US would take over Gaza and envisioned the area as the -Riviera of the Middle East-. Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the ICC, which accuses the ICC of having -engaged in illegitimate and baseless actions- targeting the US and its -close ally- Israel. It said the court -abused its power- by issuing -baseless- arrest warrants targeting Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and its former defence minister, Yoav Gallant. Trump has doubled down on his proposal to -take ownership- of Gaza despite widespread opposition. In a Truth Social post, Trump said the Palestinian territory would be -turned over- to the US by Israel after it concludes its military offensive against Hamas. Netanyahu, who is in Washington, said it is -worth listening carefully- to Trump’s proposal. Globally, the proposal to relocate 2.3 million Palestinians to other countries has provoked outrage. Trump’s proposal would -squash- the ceasefire and -incite a return of fighting-, Egypt’s foreign ministry said. Russia called Trump’s proposal -counterproductive- and accused him of fuelling -tension in the region-. China’s foreign ministry said Beijing opposed the forced transfer of people in Gaza. Pakistan described Trump’s plan as -deeply troubling and unjust-, while Iran said it -categorically rejected and condemned- Trump’s proposal. US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Palestinians in Gaza are -going to have to live somewhere else in the interim-, describing Gaza as -not habitable- in comments that appeared to walk back on Trump’s proposal about transferring Palestinians permanently to neighbouring countries. Rubio will travel to Europe and the Middle East next week, a senior State Department official said Thursday. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, ordered the military to prepare plans to allow Palestinians -who wish to leave- Gaza to exit. Asked who should take the residents of Gaza, Katz said it should be countries who have opposed Israel’s military operations since the 7 October attacks, he said. He also claimed that Spain, Ireland, and Norway, who all last year recognised a Palestinian state, are -legally obligated to allow any Gaza resident to enter their territories-. In violation of a ceasefire deal, Israel said late on Thursday it had struck two sites in Lebanon that allegedly contained weapons of the Hezbollah group. Israeli forces -conducted a precise strike in Lebanese territory on two military sites that contained Hezbollah weapons, which were in violation of the ceasefire agreement,- the army said in a post on X. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) warned the agency faces an -existential threat- after Israel formally banned it from operating on its territory. Philippe Lazzarini also described Trump’s Gaza proposal as -totally unrealistic-, adding: -We are talking about forced displacement. Forced displacement is a crime, an international crime. It’s ethnic cleansing.- Human Rights Watch warned that Trump’s proposal could move the US -from being complicit in war crimes to direct perpetration of atrocities-. Forced or coerced displacement is a crime against humanity, illegal under the Geneva conventions, to which Israel and the US are signatories. -Governments should together make clear their strong opposition to Trump’s call for forced displacement in Gaza and take action to prevent further atrocities against the Palestinian people,- said HRW Middle East and North Africa director Lama Fakih. At least 47,583 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli attacks since October 2023, according to the Palestinian health ministry on Thursday. The ministry’s latest daily update also said that a total of 111,633 have now been injured. Israel informed the United Nations human rights council (UNHRC) that it is formally withdrawing from the body. Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said the decision was reached -in light of the ongoing and unrelenting institutional bias against Israel in the human rights council.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/07/middle-east-live-donald-trump-gaza-benjamin-netanyahu-icc-latest-news-updates	2025-02-06T22:33:43-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ef2ce4c2dfd01567cbd6b7325a4ffbfadd39632/0_191_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ebe76f0385018b48de6c2d179c98a0fd

US cedes ground to China with ‘self-inflicted wound’ of USAid shutdown, analysts say	Sudden suspension of aid funding a ‘perfect opportunity’ for Beijing to fill the gap and grow its own soft power Donald Trump’s shutdown of USAid has already had disastrous effects on humanitarian aid and development programmes around the world, but it has also ceded ground to the US’s chief rival, China, analysts have said. The result of the sudden 90-day suspension of USAid funding – which accounts for 40% of global foreign aid – has been chaos: employees locked out of offices, humanitarian shipments left to rot, and lifesaving assistance stopped. Around the world, development programmes previously assisted by the USAid are panicking, warning of disastrous risks of escalating famine, death and disease.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/07/donald-trump-usaid-shutdown-impact-china-relationship-funding	2025-02-06T20:30:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6fe6db214c9f90b535828ac31e05d615514331e/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c9e8013b82c0195c85288251ee642427

It’s a huge mistake for a centre-Right party to assume that a disgruntled conservative has -nowhere else to go-. That arrogant attitude cost the Liberal party in Australia dear in the 2022 election. In the UK they now have Reform to go to. These are the invariable default definitions trotted out. Yet the reality often falls short, and that creates a credibility deficit. The voting public will no longer accept the excuse that taxes would be higher under leftwing governments as a substitute for actual tax relief under conservative ones.

The money in question was payment for subscriptions to the news outlet from the entire federal government, not -payoffs- or even grants or other aid from USAid as rightwing accounts have claimed.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/06/trump-politico-usaid-subcriptions	2025-02-06T09:59:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f6fa79db64d3d6a24180146cb9cc943f3b0d0c8/402_383_1720_1032/master/1720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7b16c51c89e833d79f8a68d2e304f58a

Yet the announcement seems like yet another sign that the president, while sometimes distancing himself from the neoconservative foreign policies that entangled the US in Iraq and Afghanistan, is willing to pursue – or at least entertain pursuing – an undisguised US imperialism that has more in common with the expansionism of Teddy Roosevelt and Andrew Jackson, the 19th and early-20th century presidents associated with some of American’s most brazen and violent conquests.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/06/trump-gaza-netanyahu-imperialism-roosevelt-jackson	2025-02-06T04:00:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed4af8d716991a64907dcb1e479a01a9a3b39f3d/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2541b675309b8e197e9c4a67a16206a6

Thursday briefing: The outlandish plan to turn Gaza into a ‘riviera of the Middle East’	In today’s newsletter: Donald Trump’s proposal is an attempt to reshape political reality that has historical precedent, explains architect and researcher Eyal Weizman Good morning. Donald Trump’s suggestion that Palestinians should be forced out of Gaza so that it could be rebuilt as a US-run -Riviera of the Middle East- is so outlandish that many have returned to the reminder that we should beware of taking what he says too literally. And, it’s true, the comments don’t seem as if they came on the back of a detailed feasibility study; White House officials spent much of yesterday trying to walk his comments back. But it’s also true that his proposal, which if enacted would amount to an unambiguous case of ethnic cleansing, tells us something about who Trump understands to be the stakeholders in Gaza’s future: not Palestinian civilians, but the United States, Israel, and the contractors who could make it happen. And the idea has so delighted the Israeli right that it is easy to see how, even if no American soldier ever sets foot in Gaza, it creates the space for serious discussion of the same project by other means. UK economy | Bank of England policymakers are poised to cut interest rates and downgrade forecasts for economic growth, underlining the risks facing Rachel Reeves’s budget plans.

Middle East crisis live: White House walks back Trump’s Gaza ‘takeover’ comments in face of widespread international anger	Secretary of state Marco Rubio says Trump comments should not be seen as ‘hostile move’; Netanyahu says ‘remarkable idea’ should be pursued Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that there was nothing wrong in Donald Trump’s idea of displacing Palestinians from Gaza after the US president’s proposal drew international criticism. Rights groups have condemned as ethnic cleansing Trump’s suggestion the previous day that Palestinians in the territory should be permanently displaced, while also proposing a US takeover of Gaza. Defence secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon was prepared to look at -all options- when it comes to Gaza. Hegseth made the comments on Wednesday before meeting with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, reportedly said the US president does not want to put any American troops into Gaza. -Witkoff said that the president doesn’t want to put any troops into Gaza, and that he doesn’t want to spend any US money on Gaza,- the Republican senator for Missouri, Josh Hawley, said, according to the Washington Post. Peace through strength is a concept Israel shares with the United States, Netanyahu said. -The only way to get peace, and enduring peace, is by being very, very strong,- he said, according to a readout of the meeting. -And with our alliance and your support, including the decision … of supplying Israel the much-needed tools for our defense, we are a lot stronger than we’ve ever been.- The UN said forcible deportation of people from occupied territory is -strictly prohibited- under international law, while Human Rights Watch said the policy would be a -moral abomination-. Amnesty International condemned Donald Trump’s comments as -inflammatory, outrageous and shameful-. International law experts said it could amount to a war crime or crime against humanity. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Gaza was -an integral part of the State of Palestine- and that -we will not allow the rights of our people … to be infringed on-. The estimated death toll in Gaza since the start of Israeli operations in the territory after the 7 October attacks reached 47,552, according to the Palestinian ministry of health on Wednesday.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/06/middle-east-crisis-live-white-house-walks-back-trumps-gaza-takeover-comments-in-face-of-widespread-international-anger	2025-02-05T22:35:25-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff709adc79faf9b774aab35fd222c4c819b79682/0_71_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=88b64fbaed0db1dfaf351258124d9508

Cuny graduate school rolls back protections for pregnant students	Move comes amid Trump’s overturn of Title IX guidance, limiting schools’ liability in sexual misconduct cases A graduate school at the City University of New York (Cuny), a university with 25 colleges spread across New York City, has rolled back rules meant to protect the rights of pregnant students, the school said on Tuesday in an email obtained by the Guardian.

Trump’s plan to own Gaza a throwback to 19th-century imperialism	It does not seem to occur to US administration that to the rest of the world they seem to be advocating a second Nakba Donald Trump’s vision of Gaza as a US-administered Riviera stripped of Palestinians indulges the fantasies of Israel’s extremist right, but also, if taken seriously, builds on an expansionist foreign policy that Trump has articulated since he took on the presidency. The outlook is more akin to mid-19th century US imperial thinking than the era of isolationism his election appeared to herald. Indeed the one moment Benjamin Netanyahu did not look delighted at Tuesday’s joint press conference was when Trump, negotiating in real time, referred to the US as being opposed to Israeli ownership of Gaza.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/trumps-plan-to-own-gaza-chimes-of-19th-century-imperialism	2025-02-05T09:46:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82d0146aa21e3b8a3516520a688a31f39c1bd8a3/306_635_6183_3712/master/6183.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=edfea944c8380254a9d1d1d92ff53862

RFK Jr’s claim about Black people’s immune systems is ‘unscientific and terrifying’	Kennedy’s hearing signifies how close a man with medically racist beliefs is to becoming the US’s leading health official During Robert F Kennedy Jr’s Senate confirmation hearing on 30 January, Angela Alsobrooks, a Democratic senator from Maryland, pressed the nominee on his past claims that Black people have a stronger immune system than white people, and thereby should receive vaccines on a different schedule than them. -What different vaccine schedule would you say I should have received?- Alsobrooks, who is Black, asked the health secretary nominee. Kennedy then referenced a -series of studies- showing that -to particular antigens, Blacks have a much stronger reaction-. The exchange is cause for alarm for many, as it signified how close a man who holds medically racist beliefs was to becoming the country’s leading health official.
