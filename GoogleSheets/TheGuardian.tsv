Am-dram Alien documentary comes to TV as ‘unintentional pantomime’	Documentary about amateur theatre group’s take on classic horror film made available to wider audience For anyone who is weary of the usual feelgood festive films – Love Actually, Elf, Miracle on 34th Street and so on – a more offbeat offering involving a bunch of bus drivers and a joyfully amateur retelling of the space horror Alien may just appeal.

Fear and uncertainty in Golan Heights as Israeli troops drive deeper into Syria	On the high rocky plateau, the fall of Bashar al-Assad has sown complicated and contradictory emotions On the outskirts of the Druze village of Majdal Shams, high in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, a gate in the fence leads to the supposedly demilitarised buffer zone on the Syrian side. Known as -the Shouting Hill-, local Druze villagers have long gathered here to shout messages – sometimes even marriage proposals – to relatives and friends on the other side. On Wednesday, four days after Israeli troops seized control of the buffer zone as Syrian rebels took over in Damascus, there were no relatives waiting to receive messages. Instead, four-wheel drive vehicles and tanks continued to pour through the gate, joining the massed ranks of Israeli soldiers operating as far as the eye could see.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/11/golan-heights-israeli-troops-syria-assad	2024-12-11T07:00:28-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c955aa9421ffd2ee9d23f26987c9b82bdec16895/233_898_7610_4566/master/7610.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c87c7a32fbb4cab4b9c8c198107bacbb

Four new prisons to be built but space could still run out, minister warns – UK politics live	Demand rising faster than any supply ‘could possibly catch up with’, justice secretary says Good morning. Labour inherited many problems with public services when it took office, but few were worse than the prison overcrowding crisis. This was so dire that it prompted Rishi Sunak into holding an early election. With the Ministry of Justice just days away from ordering a fresh early release system (which would have been unpopular with voters), this was one of the main reasons for Sunak holding the election in July, not last autumn. Today, as part of the government’s response, Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, is announcing plans to create 14,000 prison places by 2031. PA Media sums up the plans here. The government has said it will build four new prisons within the next seven years in a bid to grip the overcrowding crisis. The Ministry of Justice promised to find a total of 14,000 cell spaces in jails by 2031. Demand is still rising faster than any supply could possibly catch up with. We’re very honest and transparent in the strategy itself that building alone is not enough because the demand is rising more quickly. The demand for prison places is actually 4,500 extra every single year. Even with the emergency measures that I’ve been forced to take, that’s 3,000 every year, we can’t get there just by building alone. That’s why I set up the sentencing review just a few weeks ago, because we need a longer term solution. We will run out, because even all of that new supply, with the increase in prison population that we will see as a result of that new supply, doesn’t help you with the rise in demand, because demand is still rising faster than any supply could possibly catch up with. I would say to trade unions and everybody else workers alike, that this is the start of that process, and of course, I would hope that they recognise that the government’s fiscal inheritance has been extremely difficult, and we do have to make sure that the books overall balance as well, and that pay is on a sustainable footing. This is the start of that process, and I wouldn’t want to get ahead of where we think the pay review bodies might ultimately make their recommendations.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/11/pmqs-live-uk-politics-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-labour-tories-prisons	2024-12-11T01:14:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/997382d299c58c12a28abdf98d3f4ed246eb762a/0_78_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9f4efc1f416ca28b0845cbe4c0548200

Wednesday briefing: Everything you wanted to know about the spending review (but were afraid to ask)	In today’s newsletter: All governments do them. But what exactly are they and how can you tell if they worked or not? Good morning. There are certain phrases in news stories about government, aren’t there, where your eyes glaze over like you’ve just wound down the window and asked someone for directions. Autumn statement; early day motion; fiscal rules; white paper; ping pong, weirdly. They’re definitely all very important, but it would be cruel to stop the average punter halfway through a news story and ask them for a crisp definition. Today’s case in point: the spending review. I mean, we all know what a spending review is, obviously – it’s when they review the spending. But it’s also one of the defining moments in the life of any government – and the one now being undertaken by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has been billed as the crucial first step in Labour’s plan to hit the -milestone- targets Keir Starmer set out last week, and on which he has said the government should be judged. UK news | Vodafone -unjustly enriched- itself at the expense of scores of vulnerable small business owners by slashing commissions to franchisees running high street stores, according to allegations filed on Tuesday in the high court. Vodafone denied any misconduct ahead of a £120m legal claim. Syria | Syria’s leading rebel group has named a new prime minister, Mohammad al-Bashir, to head the country’s transitional government. Meanwhile, Israel said it had carried out more than 480 strikes over the previous 48 hours against weapons stockpiles to keep them out of the hands of extremists. Courts in crisis | The head of the government’s sentencing review has said that specialist courts focused on breaking cycles of addiction could be rolled out across England and Wales. In an interview with the Guardian, David Gauke praised -very encouraging- pilots of intensive supervision courts. Iran | Women in Iran could face the death sentence or up to 15 years in prison if they defy new compulsory morality laws due to come into effect this week. Amnesty International said the laws could lead to the execution of women who send videos of themselves unveiled to media outside Iran or engage in peaceful activism. US news | The suspect in the shooting death of the UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson, will plead not guilty and fight extradition from Pennsylvania to New York, his lawyer said yesterday. Outside a court hearing, Luigi Mangione shouted: -This is completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people-. While some of these efforts have made notable savings for the public purse and improved civil service capability … they have often taken the form of discrete, temporary initiatives, and had less success embedding efficiency as a continuous process and culture across government. None, moreover, have led to a fundamental step-change in government’s approach to public spending.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/11/wednesday-briefing-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-the-spending-review-but-were-afraid-to-ask	2024-12-10T22:55:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acbf3cf5124d6ee5426f218535b250356225c7b2/1541_1138_1410_846/master/1410.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c6c015a5ea8f4d2a1aed2e65d0b2289
Middle East crisis live: rebel-backed Syrian interim prime minister urges ‘stability and calm’	Mohammed al-Bashir chairs cabinet meeting of new transitional government and will lead interim authority until 1 March Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the Middle East crisis. Syria’s new interim leader said it was time for -stability and calm- in the country as he announced he was taking charge of the country as caretaker prime minister with the backing of the former rebels who toppled President Bashar al-Assad three days ago. Israel says it has carried out more than 480 airstrikes targeting weapons stockpiles and strategic infrastructure in Syria over the past 48 hours. The IDF said the air force conducted the crewed aircraft missile strikes on Syrian military targets including weapons production sites in the cities of Damascus, Homs, Tartus, Latakia and Palmyra. It said 130 strikes were -during ground operations- and aimed at weapons depots, military structures, launchers and firing positions. The world -has nothing to fear- from the new Syrian regime, the leader of rebel group Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS) has told Sky News in what the network says are his first comments to a western media outlet since his organization toppled Bashar al-Assad on Sunday. Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, attempted to reassure foreign nations in his remarks and promised Syria -will be rebuilt-. Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow is -providing sanctuary- for deposed Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, having transported him to Moscow on Sunday -in the most secure way possible-. -He is secured, and it shows that Russia acts as required in such an extraordinary situation,- he told NBC News. The insurgent group that overthrew Bashar al-Assad’s government in Syria claims to have wrested control of the eastern city of Deir el-Zour after intense battles with the Kurdish-led, US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), AP reported. A member of the Islamic group Hayat al-Tahrir Sham (HTS) said in a recorded video that the group would sweep neighbourhoods to secure the city. The nearby city of Boukamal had also fallen to HTS, the person said, adding that Raqqa and Hasakah were subsequent targets. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 218 people were killed in three days of fighting between Turkish-backed forces and the SDF in Manbij, north-east of Damascus. Early on Wednesday, SDF commander Mazloum Abdi said the SDF and the Turkey-backed rebels had reached a ceasefire agreement in Manbij through US mediation. Outgoing US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has called for an -inclusive- political process in Syria, saying the US would eventually recognise a new government if it renounces terrorism, destroys chemical weapons stocks and protects the rights of minorities and women. -The Syrian people will decide the future of Syria. All nations should pledge to support an inclusive and transparent process and refrain from external interference,- Blinken said in a statement. The UN would consider taking the Syrian rebel group that toppled the regime of Bashar al-Assad off its designated terrorist list if it passes the key test of forming a truly inclusive transitional government, according to a senior official at the world body. Geir Pedersen, UN special envoy for Syria, held out the prospect of removing Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) from the organisation’s list of proscribed terrorist groups. But he said the group could not seek to govern Syria in the way that it had governed Idlib, the northern province where it was based and from where it led the military breakout that resulted in the sudden collapse of the Assad regime.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/11/middle-east-crisis-live-syria-interim-prime-minister-mohammed-al-bashir-israel-missile-strike	2024-12-10T22:22:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2aba93da7e562b3130a6d42999d2b0e873d2212f/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=93cd9536365899583a16f89118fa66a8

‘It’s beyond human scale’: AFP defends use of artificial intelligence to search seized phones and emails	Australian federal police says it has ‘no choice’ due to the vast amount of data examined in investigations The Australian federal police says it had -no choice- but to lean into using artificial intelligence and is increasingly using the technology to search seized phones and other devices, given the vast amount of data examined in investigations.

Nigel Farage, man of the people, welcomes his latest billionaire to Reform	Like our Nige, Nick Candy doesn’t appear to have any solutions to anything … but he does have very deep pockets Several Range Rovers with blacked out windows pulled up outside the TV studios in Westminster. Out stepped Theresa May. Awkward. If she’d known her arrival was going to coincide with a Reform party photo call, she’d have probably asked the driver to go round the block again. Just in case people jumped to conclusions. Not that there was much chance of anyone imagining that the Maybot was about to leave the Tory party and defect to Reform. But better safe than sorry. These are happy days for Nigel Farage. OK, so Donald Trump might have gone a little cold on him. The Donald’s apparatchiks have been letting it be known that the president-elect regards Nige as an eccentric fanboy, basking in the reflected glory. But back in the UK things are hunky dory.

Daniel Penny’s acquittal reveals ‘double standard’ about white vigilante crime	In longstanding pattern in the US, white killers are celebrated and Black victims denigrated, experts say On Monday, Daniel Penny, a 26-year-old white man, was acquitted of all charges related to the 1 May 2023 killing of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old unhoused Black man with severe mental illness, on a New York City subway train. Penny was charged with second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide after he choked Neely for nearly six minutes, causing his death. The Marine veteran claimed self-defense after an unarmed Neely made threats to passengers and complained of being hungry and thirsty, according to witness testimony. In a police interview following Neely’s death, Penny referred to Neely as -just a crackhead- who was -acting like a lunatic-. Experts say Penny’s acquittal fits into a longstanding pattern of how white vigilante crime is treated in the US, with white killers celebrated and Black victims denigrated.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/10/daniel-penny-acquittal-white-vigilante-crime	2024-12-10T08:52:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfef4ee7132bc9e11499a87cc961fbf9378b5d06/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ff49d2c99fb0cbd79babe1127f88a3b6

UK politics live: Stop using money on non-priority areas, Reeves tells ministers, as she launches spending review	Chancellor due to speak at hospital event this morning as cabinet ministers have been asked to seek 5% efficiency savings in their departments Good morning. Today is the launch of the spending review. And the prime minister has been writing about the process. Every secretary of state inherits dozens of projects and priorities from his or her predecessor, and a huge quantity of government activity is therefore being carried out even if it is no longer necessary or relevant. In one of my very first cabinets, I told them all to go through their budget lines and cut at least 5%. ‘It’s time to slaughter the sacred cows,- I said. Secretaries of state across government will need to allocate their budgets to ensure that government spending is focused on the prime minister’s Plan for Change, and that every pound of taxpayers’ money is spent well. The chancellor will work with departments to prioritise spending that supports the milestones to deliver the plan … In letters sent by the chief secretary to the Treasury, departments will be advised that where spending is not contributing to a priority, it should be stopped. Although some of these decisions will be difficult, the chancellor is clear that the public must have trust in the government that it is rooting out waste and that their taxes are being spent on their priorities.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/10/uk-politics-live-rachel-reeves-spending-review-keir-starmer-cyprus	2024-12-10T01:20:40-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70e097d272bf4431f4956eb3304cd01f4ccc7b76/0_553_7560_4535/master/7560.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4e5e6c22b0797325de99741e42407205

‘Miraculous’: Syrians in UK tell of shock, joy, hopes and fears after fall of Assad	Jubilation at the prospect of going home to a new Syria mixed with trepidation about what the future holds Before she fled Syria and came to the UK in 2016, Raya Homsi was told her fiance had been tortured to death in the Sednaya prison run by Bashar al-Assad’s regime. All she had to go on was the word of one person who said he had witnessed it.

Tuesday briefing: What happened when the doors of Syria’s most notorious prison were finally opened	In today’s newsletter: The Guardian’s William Christou was the first western journalist to gain access to Sednaya prison. He reflects on what he saw Good morning. Of all the horrific symbols of the deposed Assad regime, few carry the notoriety of Sednaya, the most feared node in the Syrian government’s repressive prison system. About 30,000 people were killed there between 2011 and 2020, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimated, more than in any other single location; for years, groups of 50 at a time were hanged in secret, once or twice a week. Many were still locked up there a couple of days ago, including women and children, in conditions so disorienting and dehumanising that some were unable to say their names. But early on Sunday, as the rebels swept into Damascus, the doors were opened, and they were freed.

Behind closed doors, Murdoch has been involved in a legal battle for control of the family’s media assets, pitching the mogul and Lachlan Murdoch, his political protege and heir apparent, against the patriarch’s three other oldest children.	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/09/murdoch-succession-case-rightwing-legacy	2024-12-09T15:45:39-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e745624b49bf5d0b51ac27fd4f33cf7a0248ba22/0_164_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=193c3518cf2839f26600dbb3a6491693

OpenAI makes AI video generator Sora publicly available in US	Firm announces tool that can create AI video clip based on user’s written prompts will be available to anyone in the US Anyone in the US can now use OpenAI’s artificial intelligence video generator, Sora, which the company announced on Monday would become publicly available. OpenAI first presented Sora in February, but it was only accessible to select artists, film-makers and safety testers. At multiple points on Monday, though, OpenAI’s website did not allow for new sign-ups for Sora, citing heavy traffic. Sora is known as a text-to-video generator, a tool that can create AI video clips based on a user’s written prompts. An example on OpenAI’s website has the prompt of -a wide, serene shot of a family of woolly mammoths in an open desert-.

The 87-year-old sporting great was hospitalised last Wednesday and spent time in intensive care with broken ribs and a broken wrist, Seven News reported. Dawn is an Australian living treasure – an icon of our sport – and we wish her a speedy, healthy and [full] recovery. If we’re asking people to identify with different flags … we are dividing our country unnecessarily … I think the fact is that we should stand up for who we are, for our values as a country which is what we should do in Australia. We should value and respect our heritage, and we should also speak a lot more about our migrant story, the incredible story of people who came here, particularly in the post-second world war period, with nothing, and have worked hard as trainees, as farmers, and they’ve educated their children.

Human rights for Syrians but perhaps not for Saudis in Labour’s Middle East	While David Lammy lauded the fall of Bashar al-Assad, Keir Starmer was having a love-in with Mohammed bin Salman Not that the foreign secretary was trying to take any of the credit for the collapse of the Assad regime, but without the UK standing firm then the dictator would have been around a lot longer. Just saying. Only maybe things weren’t entirely that simple. Because David Lammy had given an interview to Laura Kuenssberg back in September in which he said he had been talking enthusiastically to the Italians about their deal to send refugees back to Syria. So not quite the same as talking direct to Assad. But nearly so. By such threads are reputations made. Then to the known unknowns. The government would be cautious in its dealings with the rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. Who would have guessed? They would judge the new regime by its actions. But for now he was standing by the ordinary Syrians. They had a right to decide their own future democratically. And in Keir Starmer they had a man who would speak out against human rights abuses wherever he found them. Taking the Lead by John Crace is published by Little, Brown (£18.99).

Project 2025: the Trump picks with ties to ultra-rightwing policy manifesto	The president-elect has tried to distance himself from Project 2025, but several key choices have direct links to it On the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly disavowed Project 2025, saying he had -nothing to do- with the blueprint for a conservative presidency and didn’t know the people behind it. But as he starts to assemble his cabinet and White House staff, it seems likely he’ll get to know the people involved very well soon.

Will emergence of HTS in Syria raise level of global terrorism threats?	Intelligence chiefs have to decisively analyse the risk posed by group once affiliated to islamists al-Qaida When Sir Richard Moore, the head of MI6, warned in a speech given 10 days ago that he had -never seen the world in a more dangerous state- Syria was mentioned just once. The context was that jihadist terrorism was on the retreat in the country, but after the lightning success of the rebel offensive, questions will inevitably be asked again. Intelligence chiefs are now having to quickly reassess the triumphant Syrian rebels, and in particular, the leading group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), now designated as a terror organisation by the US and the UK. Once a Syrian offshoot of al-Qaida, HTS cut its affiliation in 2016 and under the leadership of Abu Mohammed al-Jolani the group has sought to project a moderate image as it has led the counter offensive from Idlib to Damascus, telling CNN in an interview with CNN he would respect Syrian minorities and -no one has the right to erase another group-.

In his first sit-down interview since winning the presidential election, Donald Trump made clear to NBC News on Sunday that he planned to upend an array of governing norms as soon as he gets into the White House.

Critics say his scheduling of 28 January primaries in solid Republican districts held by former congressman Matt Gaetz, who resigned during his ill-fated nomination for attorney general, and Mike Waltz, Trump’s pick for national security adviser, is a hasty political move designed purely to bolster speaker Mike Johnson’s fragile House majority as soon as possible.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/09/ron-desantis-republican-house-primaries	2024-12-09T04:00:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1e5867cd61739fd4f899453c80711a852d6c3d8/0_39_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=687a719a65247eae52be21b0a194d0be

UK politics live: McFadden says Labour will ‘rewire state’ with new culture for civil servants	Cabinet Office minister will say he wants staff to adopt the ‘test and learn mindset of Silicon Valley’ Good morning. Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch have both spoken about their desire to completely -rewire- the way the British state operates. Badenoch has not said much about how this might happen (although she has spoken about wanting the state to do less, implying not so much a rewiring of the state as a complete removal of some of the wiring instead). And Starmer has not given a detailed vision of what rewiring might involve either, but this morning Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister, will give a speech providing the answer, or at least one answer. As Eleni Courea reports in her overnight story, McFadden will say the government will ask officials managing public service delivery to operate as if they are running a tech startup. ‘Crack’ teams of problem solvers will be deployed to improve public services and support delivery of the Plan for Change. Made up of a mix of people working in partnership to drive change - with data and digital skills, policy officials, and frontline workers, they will be given the freedom to experiment and adapt - adopting the ‘test and learn’ mindset of Silicon Valley. Instead of writing more complicated policy papers and long strategy documents, the government will set the teams a challenge and empower them to experiment, innovate and try new things. Test it. Fix the problems. Change the design. Test it again. Tweak it again. And so on, and so on, for as long as you provide the service. Suddenly, the most important question isn’t, ‘How do we get this right the first time?’. It’s ‘How do we make this better by next Friday? That’s the test and learn mindset, and I’m keen to see where we can deploy it in government. Where we can make the state a little bit more like a start-up.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/09/uk-politics-live-pat-mcfadden-labour-civil-service-reform-rachel-reeves-eu-relationship	2024-12-09T01:07:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a55ea176fe656f47cb50ac18d01a3ada0f5f223/0_35_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=02cbf5435ee5704f6cea93791965ba6d

The signs were positive in her first few years in office: Hassan ended bans on newspapers and political rallies, and legislation that kept pregnant girls and young mothers out of school, all policies that Magufuli had endorsed.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/09/tanzania-opposition-laments-its-naivety-over-president-as-repression-intensifies	2024-12-08T22:00:16-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83249e238a7130703e9c514e0cd002c6065be46a/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0a50ee89b5959789fd3f152f805a29b0

Syria live: civil defence teams investigating ‘hidden underground cells’ at notorious Assad prison	Syria’s White Helmets send rescue teams to Sednaya prison; ousted president Bashar al-Assad has fled to Moscow, Russian media report As the brutal regime of Bashar al-Assad fell, the doors of the country’s notorious prisons have opened, including those of Sednaya, a facility described as a -human slaughterhouse-. Across the country prisoners, bewildered and exultant, have poured out of their cells. Syrian anti-government rebels declared they had ousted President Bashar al-Assad after seizing control of Damascus on Sunday, in an astonishing end to his family’s decades of autocratic rule after more than 13 years of civil war. The ousted Syrian president is now in Russia, according to a Kremlin source, where he has been granted asylum on -humanitarian grounds-. The United Nations security council will convene on Monday afternoon for an emergency closed door meeting on Syria in the aftermath of the ousted president fleeing the country. Thousands of Syrians have rallied across cities in Europe in the wake of the news, waving flags and barely able to contain their joy at Assad’s downfall. Similar celebrations have also been seen in Syrian embassies, including in Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur. As armed rebels swept cities across Syria, flinging open detention facilities where rights groups estimated that at least 100,000 people were considered missing or forcibly disappeared since 2011 at the hands of the state. This included the Sednaya military prison, a facility notorious as the site of particularly brutal and humiliating methods of torture. UN secretary-general António Guterres on Sunday praised the end of Syria’s -dictatorial regime- and called on the country to focus on rebuilding. Joe Biden said the sudden collapse of the Syrian government was a -fundamental act of justice- after decades of repression, but that it’s -a moment of risk and uncertainty- for the Middle East. The US Central Command said its forces conducted dozens of airstrikes on Islamic State targets in central Syria on Sunday. The US president also said it believes missing American journalist Austin Tice, who disappeared 12 years ago near the Syrian capital, is alive and -we think we can get him back-. Rebel commander Abu Mohammed al-Jolani said in a statement read on Syria’s state TV that there is no room for turning back. -The future is ours,- his statement said. Al-Jolani, commander of Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS), reportedly said that all state institutions would remain under the supervision of al-Assad’s prime minister until they were handed over officially. The Israeli military has issued a warning to five towns in southern Syria, calling on residents to stay at home -until further notice- due to ongoing combat in the area. Arab states will seek to avert the threat of a reignited Syrian civil war by starting an open dialogue with all the forces on the ground to ensure any transition is inclusive of all Syrians regardless of ethnicity, Qatar’s foreign ministry has said.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/09/syria-bashar-al-assad-asylum-russia-live-updates-blog	2024-12-08T21:43:25-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8efc08d5dcc85da9ef7026d8e252b963d3e1f99c/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=204c3d4c1aad8c7909d148d37ccf5248

Ex-president has not been pictured since he vowed to ‘crush’ rebels a week ago and his location is unclear The fate and whereabouts of former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad remained unclear on Sunday as his ally Russia, which had long sustained him in office, said he had resigned and departed the country. -As a result of negotiations between B. Assad and a number of participants in the armed conflict on the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic, he decided to resign from the presidency and left the country, giving instructions for a peaceful transfer of power,- Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement.

Syria’s rebels had strengths, but it was his regime’s weakness that undid Assad | Jason Burke	Corruption and incompetence in the army and successful outreach by the rebels left the troops with little to fight for When the rebels finally reached Bashar al-Assad’s sprawling palace in Damascus, the gates were open. There was no traffic on the floodlit highways leading into the vast estate, and apparently no defenders among the carefully tended trees. In the empty guardhouses, coats were still hung on the back of doors, so swiftly had the occupants fled. Asked by the Guardian early on Sunday morning what had happened to the tens of thousands of men of the armed forces, pro-government militias, intelligence services, police and others who had all been dedicated to the preservation of Assad’s rule, one veteran Damascus-based analyst gave a terse answer: -They have vanished.

Trump calls for ‘immediate ceasefire’ in Ukraine after meeting Zelenskyy	US president-elect claims Kyiv ‘would like to make a deal’ to end war with Russia and cites loss of ‘400,000 soldiers’ Donald Trump has called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, a day after meeting the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in Paris, claiming Kyiv -would like to make a deal- to end its war with Russia. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said both sides had suffered enormous losses in the war – which, he claimed on the US election campaign trail, he would be able to end -in 24 hours- if elected. Trump has already appointed the retired army general Keith Kellogg as his Russia and Ukraine envoy, tasked with ending the war.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/08/trump-calls-ceasefire-ukraine-casualty-figures	2024-12-08T07:08:30-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/017fbadd7c3f42acd183a6d4136ae74219f56826/0_159_3723_2233/master/3723.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6dd1aa8864b7f18e111a8a8e1c47bbdc

Hezbollah’s war with Israel left the Assad regime fatally exposed	With the fall of Damascus, Iran can longer deny that its political and military ‘axis of resistance’ has collapsed It was not a coincidence that the Syrian group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) began its push for the city of Aleppo on the same day that Israel and Hezbollah agreed a ceasefire to end the fighting in Lebanon. The domino effect set in motion by Hamas on 7 October 2023 is still rippling through the Middle East, this weekend resulting in the spectacular downfall of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. A country that suffered under a Ba’athist regime for 60 years, as well as 14 years of civil war, is celebrating hard-won freedoms as thousands of disappeared people pour out of Assad’s infamous prisons. What comes next in Syria, which still has to grapple with deep internal and sectarian problems, is uncertain. In Iran though, the picture is clearer. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei can no longer deny that Tehran’s political and military -axis of resistance- has collapsed.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/08/hezbollah-war-with-israel-left-the-assad-regime-syria-fatally-exposed	2024-12-08T06:41:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e427e5705e6de8c47ad59a3d3469f6dd32dd590/0_366_8640_5184/master/8640.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2f1d24e35f268f802e874e49b4f2bf9e

Syrian rebels say they have captured capital as Bashar al-Assad reported to have fled Damascus – live updates	Anti-regime forces declare Damascus ‘free’ of Assad as government forces withdraw presence Welcome back to our live coverage of the rebel offensive that seems to have been successful in toppling the Syrian government, led by longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad. Here are the latest developments: Rebel forces, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, in Damascus have declared the Syrian capital -free- of Assad as government forces withdraw their presence. In the capital’s central square, people climbed on top of tanks and cheered as they trampled on a toppled statue of Assad’s father, Hafez. The Syrian rebel coalition said it is continuing work to complete the transfer of power in Syria to a transitional governing body with full executive powers. Syrian prime minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said the government is ready to -extend its hand- to the opposition and hand over its functions to a transitional government. -I am in my house and I have not left, and this is because of my belonging to this country,- Jalili said. Syria’s army command notified officers on Sunday that Assad’s regime had ended, Reuters is reporting. But the Syrian army later said it was continuing operations against -terrorist groups- in the key cities of Hama and Homs and in Deraa countryside. Assad, who has ruled the country for nearly 25 years, has reportedly left Damascus by plane for an unknown destination. US president-elect Donald Trump said on Sunday that Assad had -fled his country- after losing the backing of Russia. -Assad is gone,- he said on his Truth Social platform. -His protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer.- Outgoing US President Joe Biden and his team were monitoring the -extraordinary events in Syria- and were in touch with regional partners, the White House said. As armed rebels swept cities across the country, they flung open detention facilities where rights groups estimated that at least 100,000 people were considered missing or forcibly disappeared since 2011 at the hands of the state. This included the Sednaya military prison, a facility notorious as the site of particularly brutal and humiliating methods of torture. Iraq has reportedly evacuated its embassy in Syria and moved staff to Lebanon, hours after rebels overthrew Assad and took control of the capital. Reasons behind the evacuation were not made public.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/08/syria-bashar-al-assad-damascus-rebels-latest-updates-live	2024-12-08T01:22:16-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d433e02565e9b5ded780243dc1428a8b16198400/0_213_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=70e4da8655e611220edf191384887c79

Many Democrats are ­convinced her ­campaign saved the party from an even worse result. To be fair, it achieved some real highs: she won the debate. But she never won the argument, at least not with the ­voters who mattered most. The US election triggered a scary deja vu moment for those of us who had watched the 2019 UK ­general ­election from behind our sofas, hands over our eyes. The Democrats lost votes with almost everyone, almost everywhere, but, like Labour in the -red wall-, most ­dramatically with traditional heartland ­voters: working-class, low-paid, non-­graduates. And, like Labour back in 2019, that lost connection with core voters had not happened overnight.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/dec/07/wokeness-patriotism-change-kamala-harris-defeat-labour	2024-12-07T12:00:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b833160f08bd79d3bfacf5ab69c523ff581966b/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6a07ce69f63b96111065952d70ef2ce1

A spike in applications for pension credit, which enables people to receive the winter fuel payments, also means that even some of those who qualify are having to wait up to 12 weeks to receive it because Whitehall has been -overwhelmed- with claims, the Observer has been told.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/dec/07/winter-fuel-crisis-one-million-elderly-already-skipping-meals-and-applications-system-overwhelmed	2024-12-07T10:00:30-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56a6d134b56d2a7bd862732b6d878bda07698d6f/0_204_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=767dbf1010663dce9817b901c008edb9

Andreessen’s co-founder, Ben Horowitz, initially supported Trump but flipped to Harris. $5.1m from Jan Koum, the founder of WhatsApp who made the bulk of his fortune when Facebook acquired the messaging app in 2014 for $19bn. $51.1m from the Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, who left the social media company in 2008 to start the workflow software company Asana. $17m from Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn. $11.7m from Chris Larsen, the billionaire chair of Ripple, a cryptocurrency company.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/07/campaign-spending-crypto-tech-influence	2024-12-07T02:00:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5c2be98ab1dda27fac7a069ce881f62891121ed/0_7_2820_1692/master/2820.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c71267572e061da085b8905c8d89ed4b

Trump defends Pete Hegseth as he announces more administration picks – live	President-elect says embattled defense secretary nominee ‘is doing very well’ and announces new role of ‘White House AI and crypto czar’ Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump announced a slew of new nominations for top administration officials last night, including ambassador to China, head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and a new role of -White House AI and crypto czar-. He also made clear he was sticking by his embattled nominee for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth. Writing on Truth Social this morning, Trump said Hegseth -is doing very well-, even though it remains unclear if key senators will support his nomination to lead the Pentagon. The former Fox News host has spent the past few days on Capitol Hill, trying to win over Republican lawmakers in spite of reports of his excessive drinking, financial mismanagement of two charities, and a sexual assault allegation. Back to the nominations Trump announced last night, former Georgia senator David Perdue will serve as ambassador to China, while tech entrepreneur and Elon Musk associate David Sacks has been appointed to the new crypto czar role – the latest sign that the Trump administration will be much friendlier to the digital asset industry than Joe Biden’s ever was. The US job market remains robust, according to just-released government data that showed the economy added 227,000 jobs in November, and the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%. Joe Biden will deliver remarks from the White House at the 6pm ET performance of -The Eyes of the World: From D-Day to VE Day-, which honors World War II veterans.

The long-winged seabird named Wisdom, a Laysan albatross, returned to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge at the north-western edge of the Hawaiian Archipelago and laid what experts estimate may be her 60th egg, the Pacific Region of the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service said in a Facebook post this week.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/06/worlds-oldest-known-wild-bird-lays-egg-wisdom-albatross	2024-12-06T05:56:01-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46f76fbcc8a7c43f5e1d6af42e109f624a1f657c/205_0_6150_3691/master/6150.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2aaa68ea48e31d52534ace8e32f5159e
Baltimore firefighters battle brushfire at wood recycling yard	Fire closes section of expressway, light rail line and roads and schools as more than 100 firefighters tackle blaze Firefighters were battling a huge, wind-driven brushfire at a Baltimore wood recycling yard that closed a section of the expressway into the city’s downtown, the neighboring light rail line and nearby roads and schools on Friday morning. Crews were called to the Camp Small yard, where large trees and logs are stacked about 30ft (about 9 meters) high, after 5pm on Thursday, the Baltimore city fire chief, James Wallace, said at a briefing.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/06/baltimore-brushfire-wood-recycling	2024-12-06T05:51:17-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/441039af19155568d18d7adaf32b4ad58240f247/21_0_2820_1692/master/2820.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3dd760d046c5cdc0fccba27b98ed74c7
It will take years to clear medical evacuations backlog in Gaza, says WHO	UN body highlights only 78 out of 12,000 patients recently requiring evacuation have managed to leave The World Health Organization is warning that the pace of medical evacuations of sick and wounded Palestinians out of Gaza, including several thousand children, is so slow that it will take five to 10 years to clear the backlog at the current rate.

K-pop and autocrats: jolt to democracy lays bare South Korea’s two sides	While some say political turmoil has harmed country’s cultural reputation, others say it proves resilience In the global battle for soft-power supremacy, a clear winner has emerged in recent years: South Korea. Spearheaded by the boyband phenomenon BTS, the Korean Wave has turned a country that few knew much about into a cultural behemoth. But just days ago, as anticipation grew over the start later this month of the second season of Squid Game – the first season of which is Netflix’s most-watched show – real-life dystopia intervened when the South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, announced he was imposing martial law to root out -anti-state forces- and overcome political opponents who were obstructing his policy agenda.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/06/k-pop-and-autocrats-jolt-to-democracy-lays-bare-south-korea-two-sides	2024-12-06T05:21:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/842f3ea3f397d391e9a3b97d1c1052af2b32c280/0_81_3805_2283/master/3805.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=93aa1697f954d6ed81a89b2fc314009f

Meet the Rees-Moggs: a bluffer’s guide to the family’s weirdness	Just in case you can’t bear to watch the former Tory MP’s new reality show, we equip you for it coming up in conversation Jacob Rees-Mogg’s new reality show may sound as appealing as flushing your entire head down a toilet. Yet Meet the Rees-Moggs (on Discovery+) is such a bewildering piece of television that it may well come up in conversation over the next few weeks. If that’s the case, here’s a handy bluffer’s guide to just how weird the former Tory MP and his family are. Jacob Rees-Mogg’s Somerset home is covered with portraits of Jacob Rees-Mogg. It is so heavily plastered with pictures of him that you will soon lose count. There’s a painting of him as an adolescent. There’s a painting of him mimicking Aaron Shikler’s John F Kennedy portrait. There’s a painting of him standing in front of another painting, which is quite Inception-y of him. The best one, though, is a painting of him that one of his six children is forced to stare at during trumpet practice. Jacob Rees-Mogg is a Greggs nut. Apparently, he says, he buys a ham and cheese baguette and a chocolate eclair for his lunch every day. He says this, however, during the election campaign and then never mentions it again after he loses his seat, so maybe it is simply a wrongheaded attempt to pander to the electorate. Jacob Rees-Mogg is a picky eater. Perhaps the Greggs infatuation is down to his bizarre eating habits. He doesn’t like yellow food, for example, and a member of his household staff points out: -He isn’t a fan of vegetables or onions or anything like that.- Jacob Rees-Mogg describes the same member of staff, a man named Shaun, as someone who -does everything that needs to be done in a busy household-. This includes -making our cider and looking after the Bentley-. His duties also appear to include scrubbing the words -posh twat- off election campaign posters and, in one instance, doing the -wanker- sign at a portrait of Robert Peel. Jacob Rees-Mogg sleeps completely still. As if he was in a tomb, he says. Chilling. Jacob Rees-Mogg quotes his election concession speech all the time. When he lost his seat this year, he quoted Chitty Chitty Bang Bang by saying: -From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success.- He also uses this exact phrase when his dog eats one of his daughter’s sausages off the floor. Jacob Rees-Mogg is sent into apoplexy by the notion of commuting badgers. During his post-election doldrums, and inspired by his daughter’s desire to emulate Carrie Johnson, he briefly entertains the idea of digging a duck pond in his garden. When the planning permission report points out that the pond might disrupt the path of commuting badgers, he throws a little tantrum and gives up. Jacob Rees-Mogg does not pack his own suitcases. Jacob Rees-Mogg has a private chapel. It contains some of his most prized possessions: a fragment of the true cross, a fragment of the crown of thorns and a piece of Thomas More’s hair shirt. It is illegal to buy and sell this sort of item, he says, but not necessarily illegal to buy and sell the containers that they happen to come in. What an unexpected wheeler dealer. Jacob Rees-Mogg is capable of emotion. But only briefly and only if you look hard enough. He doesn’t flinch when he loses his seat, nor does he flinch when the promise of becoming Conservative party chairman is snatched from him at the last minute. But when he Facetimes his daughter shortly after she has been sent to boarding school – something he struggled to adapt to as a child and she clearly isn’t thrilled about either – he very briefly clams up in a very repressed, English, privately educated way. Maybe, buried deep beneath the multiple self-parodic layers he’s constructed around himself, he does actually have a heart. Jacob Rees-Mogg makes his children dress in black tie for dinner on Saturday nights.	https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/dec/06/meet-the-rees-moggs-a-bluffers-guide-to-the-familys-weirdness	2024-12-06T05:00:56-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9655fe9bf50ad84df5b376eecdbe67822a255927/0_13_4240_2545/master/4240.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7cf5ab9cdc0ef0044b98c5c0c2b19376

Plus, how climate breakdown can still be avoided Good morning. The House has voted against publishing the ethics committee’s report into allegations of sexual misconduct and potential illegal activities by the former Florida Republican representative Matt Gaetz. On what grounds was it blocked? Gaetz resigned from the House on 13 November, when Trump picked him for attorney general – and the Mississippi Republican Michael Guest, the committee chair, said the panel’s investigative authority ended then. What will Trump do? His team is reportedly developing a peace proposal for Ukraine, sidelining its ambitions for Nato membership and potentially handing Russia significant territory.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/06/first-thing-house-republicans-vote-to-block-publication-of-matt-gaetz-ethics-report	2024-12-06T04:35:17-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd43d5e22f25a6612d3d86b3b24ba4704a5020a9/0_0_2739_1643/master/2739.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6782a4bcd09547b9f570b8bd8beb918b

It is unclear who might be sitting at the table, or what format the discussion will take. But at some point in the coming months, the incoming US administration will likely attempt to negotiate an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Donald Trump takes office in January and with his self-image as a great dealmaker boasted on the campaign trail that he could end the war in 24 hours.

Starmer vows to take on ‘blockers’ as Labour council says government housebuilding targets ‘impossible’ – UK politics live	The PM has said he wants 1.5 million homes to be built in England before the next election Good morning. Yesterday Keir Starmer committed the government to six -measurable milestones- – a mixture of some new targets and some existing ones, wrapped up in a package intended to show people that the government is focusing on things that will make a tangible difference to their lives. They are in a Plan for Change which is an implicit admission that the previous headline performance indicators that Starmer said he wanted to be judged by – his five pre-election missions, and his six -first steps for change- – were a bit woolly. One of the new milestones is: Building 1.5 million homes in England and fast-tracking planning decisions on at least 150 major economic infrastructure projects - more than the last 14 years combined. I feel that we are going to be on a collision course with Labour. And it’s not just Labour councils. It’s Liberal Democrats, it’s Conservatives, they’ve all said the same thing. Absolutely, absolutely, over these planning targets. They are absolutely impossible and unrealistic. I know, with trust in politics so low, the public are sceptical of promises made by politicians. And who can blame them, after years of inaction by successive Tory governments. But that can’t be an excuse for low expectations and easy ambitions, a culture that isn’t brave enough to even try for fear of failure. I know some councils have come out this week to challenge our plans for housing reform. I always knew there would be resistance to our planning reform. Let me say this — I won’t shy away from this argument. In fact, I welcome it. Where there are blockers putting the brakes on, it’s a sign you are delivering real change. And change is what the British people voted for this summer — a government that is willing to take on the obstacles and break down the barriers that prevent us from reaching our full potential.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/06/keir-starmer-labour-housebuilding-uk-politics-latest-news	2024-12-06T01:13:40-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b769606c766b22d9f90e8da165eb5801c36e5535/0_0_7179_4307/master/7179.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=914a57f4ae8552501a9e374169a50647

Middle East crisis live: thousands of people flee Homs in central Syria as rebel forces push on	Rebels have captured key cities of Aleppo and Hama, dealing blows to president Bashar al-Assad 14 years after protests erupted across Syria Thousands of people fled the central Syrian city of Homs overnight and into Friday morning, a war monitor and residents said, as rebel forces sought to push their lightning offensive against government forces further south. They have already captured the key cities of Aleppo in the north and Hama in the centre, dealing successive devastating blows to president Bashar al-Assad, nearly 14 years after protests against him erupted across Syria. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of sources in Syria, said 826 people, mostly combatants but also including 111 civilians, have been killed in the country since the violence erupted last week. It marks the most intense fighting since 2020 in the civil war sparked by the repression of pro-democracy protests in 2011. Iran says it conducted a successful space launch, the latest for its program the west alleges improves Tehran’s ballistic missile programme. Iran conducted the launch using its Simorgh programme, a satellite-carrying rocket that had seen a series of failed launches. The launch took place at Iran’s Imam Khomeini Spaceport in rural Semnan province. There was no immediate independent confirmation Friday the launch was successful. Iraqi foreign minister, Fuad Hussein, will meet his Syrian and Iranian counterparts on Friday to discuss the situation in Syria, the Iraqi state news agency said on Thursday. A Hamas official said on Thursday that international mediators have resumed negotiating with the militant group and Israel over a ceasefire in Gaza, and that he was hopeful a deal to end the 14-month war was within reach. Ceasefire negotiations were halted last month when Qatar suspended talks with mediators from Egypt and the US because of frustration over a lack of progress between Israel and Hamas. Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said that he plans to hold talks on Friday with Turkish and Iranian officials on the situation in Syria. On Thursday, Lavrov said Moscow was -very much concerned- with a recent escalation of violence in Syria.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/06/middle-east-crisis-thousands-people-flee-homs-central-syria-rebel-forces-israel-gaza-latest-updates	2024-12-05T23:41:45-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86a3cb871a504d070fc2604e46debbfaf928e9cc/0_298_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a01ab8deeda9eb1b49730b7d1b16936f

Pete Hegseth’s nomination hangs on key senator as more details of drinking emerge – US politics live	Senator Joni Ernst expected to be key to fate of Trump’s Pentagon pick; media reports say Hegseth faced HR investigation over Fox Christmas party antics Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, will be back once again on Capitol Hill today to try to convince Republican senators that he’s the right man to lead the Pentagon. Reports of excessive drinking, financial mismanagement and poor treatment of women, as well as a sexual assault allegation, have dogged his nomination over the past days, with several conservative lawmakers expressing doubts over approving him for the job. But the most important voice in determining his fate has not piped up yet: Iowa’s Republican senator Joni Ernst. The army veteran and sexual assault survivor met with Hegseth yesterday but said little publicly about their talk. Her views on him will be pivotal in determining whether the former Fox News host’s nomination advances, or goes the way of Matt Gaetz. Meanwhile, the New York Times has uncovered more details of incidents Hegseth was involved in while employed by the conservative network. These include another story of him drinking to excess, as well as an incident at a Christmas party eight years ago that led to an investigation from Fox News’s human resources department. We’ll see what Republican senators have to say about that throughout today. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be together in public again at 6pm ET to light the national Christmas tree outside the White House. The pair have not been seen together much since Harris lost last month’s presidential election to Trump. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are heading to the Capitol today to promote the Department of Government Efficiency, their unorthodox, Trump-sanctioned idea to cut spending and downsize Washington’s federal organs. The House committee investigating the attempted assassination of Trump will hear testimony from acting Secret Service director Ronald Rowe Jr, and will also mark up its final report.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/dec/05/trump-hegseth-defense-drinking-us-politics-latest-updates	2024-12-05T06:01:43-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b780f6d71d2b25177f08a1e727674413bdeb0c12/1160_481_3360_2016/master/3360.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dec94b935632b4c6c5acaa8a1f14ada4

Sake: Japan’s ‘divine gift’ given special status by Unesco	Rice wine enshrined as part of ‘cultural heritage of humanity’ Sake is perhaps more Japanese than the world-famous sushi.

Thursday briefing: What the martial law attempt means for South Korea’s future	In today’s newsletter: Yoon Suk Yeol’s shock declaration – and subsequent reversal – has sent South Korea into political chaos, and left their president facing impeachment Good morning. South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, is facing impeachment after he sent heavily armed forces into Seoul’s streets with his baffling and sudden declaration of martial law on Tuesday. The move stirred memories of past dictatorships in the country, moving thousands to come out on to the streets and protest, with the military powerless, or unwilling, to do anything about it. Opposition parties submitted an impeachment motion hours after parliament unanimously voted to cancel Yoon’s declaration, forcing him to lift martial law just six hours after it began. Impeaching Yoon requires the support of two-thirds of the national assembly and at least six of the nine constitutional court justices. The liberal opposition Democratic party holds a majority in the 300-seat parliament and has called for Yoon’s resignation. A vote on his impeachment could come as early as tomorrow. Today we’ll look at what happened and why. But first, here are the headlines.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/05/thursday-briefing-south-korea-martial-law-first-edition	2024-12-04T22:45:36-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4662818167d8e8775f4e37f88d6a87e40c498a6f/0_72_7432_4462/master/7432.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=073d3a77a2c1d730676487a67fb3f53d

Australia news live: Greens propose new national drug testing regime	The minor party have announced an election policy for the federal expansion of pill testing. Follow today’s news live The Greens’s new election policy for a federal expansion of pill testing would involve the creation of a new drug testing agency. The agency, housed within the federal department of health and aged care, would coordinate and run drug testing sites in capital cities and regional hubs as well as providing free testing services at Australian music festivals. At the moment the biggest danger facing young people using drugs at festivals isn’t the substance itself but a failure of government policy that doesn’t allow people to be able to check what is in that drug and access education and medical services when needed. We have a system designed to criminalise and stigmatise people who take drugs in our community which has led to tragic outcomes. It is time we listen to the community and the experts and implement common sense approaches to minimise harm and risk.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/dec/05/australia-news-live-greens-national-drug-testing-labor-climate-impact-coal-mines	2024-12-04T12:40:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/904a2361b7601c9b4f1175d56d70eab29f34ed37/0_30_2408_1444/master/2408.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d8a2b7351f39f01abec9441decf0635b

South Korea crisis live: President Yoon faces impeachment calls amid martial law outcry	Opposition Democratic party lawmakers call on Yoon Suk Yeol to resign immediately or they would seek his impeachment Welcome to our continuing live coverage of the political crisis in South Korea following President Yoon Suk Yeol’s sudden and short-lived declaration of military law on Tuesday night. Here is a quick summary of recent developments: President Yoon is facing mounting calls to step down after he declared martial law in a surprise, late-night address on Tuesday, a severe measure he said was necessary to safeguard the country’s liberal democracy from -anti-state forces- and -threats posed by North Korea-. Within hours Yoon had backtracked, saying that troops would return to their barracks and the order would be lifted after a cabinet meeting. The main opposition Democratic party has said it will attempt to impeach Yoon if he refuses to tender his resignation immediately. Even Yoon’s own aides have offered to resign -en masse-. Yoon’s martial law order included a six-point decree that banned political activities and parties, -false propaganda-, strikes and -gatherings that incite social unrest-. The order also brought all media outlets under the authority of martial law and directed all medical staff, including striking doctors, to return to work within 48 hours. The move was met with vociferous condemnation and widely defied. Despite the deployment of troops and helicopters on the roof of the parliament building, 190 lawmakers managed to enter the building and proceeded to unanimously vote to reject Yoon’s declaration and call for martial law to be lifted. On the streets, hundreds protested, and chanted for the president to be arrested. To successfully impeach Yoon, a two-thirds majority is required in the legislature. Opposition parties together control 192 of the 300 seats in the national assembly, so would need lawmakers from Yoon’s own party to join them. This the first time that martial law has been declared in South Korea in more than four decades, alarming allies. The United States, which stations nearly 30,000 troops in South Korea to protect it from the nuclear-armed North, initially voiced deep concern at the declaration, then relief that martial law was over. The UK Foreign Office’s minister for the Indo-Pacific, Catherine West, issued a statement, calling for -a peaceful resolution to the situation, in accordance with the law and the constitution of the Republic of Korea-. To many watching from outside, the sudden political chaos appears to have come out of nowhere. But inside South Korea, Democratic party lawmaker Kim Min-seok had warned in recent months that Yoon was gearing up to declare martial law. Korea analysts say concerns had grown after several key military positions, related to defence, counterintelligence, and information on North Korea had been filled by individuals who graduated from the same school as the president. Opposition figures such as Kim suggested these figures could play a critical role in enforcing martial law in a contingency.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/04/south-korea-crisis-live-blog-martial-law-yoon-suk-yeol-impeachment-calls	2024-12-03T19:52:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45dc0fd1dd347355fbb84390137de4ee4e30e270/0_48_7173_4306/master/7173.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a64466abf3d64dd83c8743a4d440650b

Spanish masterpiece resurfaces after being hidden for more than a century	Joaquín Sorolla’s Paris Boulevard was sold to a private collector in 1890 and disappeared from public view A painting by Joaquín Sorolla, the Spanish artist renowned for his mastery of light, is on public show for the first time since it disappeared after being sold to a private collector 134 years ago. Paris Boulevard, which was painted by Sorolla during a visit to the French capital between 1889 and 1890, shows a bustling cafe as dusk falls on the city.

White House defends Biden’s pardon as Trump hints at potential clemency for January 6 rioters – US politics live	Spokesperson says president feared political opponents would attack Hunter in future, while Trump speaks supportively about US Capitol attackers The White House said on Monday that president Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter in part to protect him from future persecution from political opponents, but his move drew fierce criticism, with some Democrats saying it undermined public trust in the rule of law. Biden, a Democrat whose term ends on 20 January when Republican president-elect Donald Trump takes office, signed an unconditional pardon for Hunter Biden on Sunday and said he believed his son had been selectively prosecuted and targeted unfairly by the president’s political opponents. Donald Trump seized on Hunter Biden’s pardon to drop one of his strongest hints yet that he intends to grant clemency to at least some of the instigators and participants of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by a mob trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat. -Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years?

Stalking victims to be told perpetrator’s identity, says Jess Phillips	Tougher guidance in England and Wales will also prevent convicted stalkers from contacting victims while in prison Victims of stalking will be given the right to know the identity of the person who is doing it, Jess Phillips, the UK safeguarding minister has said, as part of a wider look at whether legislation connected to the crime is fit for purpose. Under new guidance from the Home Office, police in England and Wales will be told to inform people if they uncover the identity of a stalker, for example one using a series of anonymous online identities.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/03/stalking-victims-to-be-told-perpetrator-identity-jess-phillips	2024-12-03T01:35:28-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed62014c7c961b8db1f006694778cbdf78439070/0_147_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=98d84be93fee1a0a8924e06b45dd4e9f
Jess Phillips announces measures to give stalking victims more protection – UK politics live	Minister for safeguarding unveils measures including ‘right to know’, ensuring police tell victims the identity of online stalkers as soon as they can Good morning. Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, was the government voice on the morning broadcast round. She says she is unveiling six measures to protect the victims of stalking, including -right to know- guidance intended to ensure that the police tell victims the identity of online stalkers as soon as they can. Speaking on Times Radio, Phillips said: I have been a victim of stalking, and I wasn’t told [the identity of the stalker]. I didn’t have the right to know. And in most of the cases of my stalkers, they made it clear who they were as part of their desire to control and frighten me. I’m afraid to say that I’ve had more than one in my life. This was a case raised by Nicola Thorp, where somebody had been stalking her over multiple identities online, and when they said the police told her that they’d found out who it was, they then told her that they couldn’t tell her who it was. And so everybody became her stalker – the person she was sat next to on the street – and already, when you’re living through something as harrowing as somebody stalking you and making you feel frightened and anxious, the idea that then you have to distrust all of the people around you as well just seems like a terrible added burden … and so that is what we’re going to eliminate.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/03/jess-phillips-stalking-protection-measures-violence-women-girls-labour-conservatives-uk-politics-latest-updates	2024-12-03T01:28:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96259a15387bf3a6c9e633b39aa1bed070ec3d51/0_458_7728_4637/master/7728.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=82f9db3d83ed556585d970da54199f2c

Tuesday briefing: Why Ireland bucked the trend for punishing incumbent governments	In today’s newsletter: After a general election, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil look set to retain power – how have two main, centre-right parties avoided the kicking seen elsewhere? Good morning. All over the western world, incumbent governments have been given a kicking over the cost of living crisis. But in the Irish election, where the counting of results concluded yesterday, it’s a very different story. Not long ago, Sinn Féin appeared on course to win the popular vote and become the leading party in a new coalition, but its support fell away badly earlier this year. Instead, Ireland’s traditionally dominant parties of the centre-right, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, appear to have it sown up again.

UK politics live: Labour under pressure over housing and waiting list targets	Health bosses reportedly concerned about government’s focus while council leaders are said to believe building targets are unrealistic Good morning. Keir Starmer is giving a speech on Thursday and you can tell that it is important because No 10 started briefing on what it is going to say in a news release to journalists sent out on Friday. He is going to announce a -plan for change- that will include -measurable milestones-. In the earlier briefing Keir Starmer said it would be -the most ambitious yet honest programme for government in a generation-. But hang on – hasn’t Starmer announced plenty of -measurable milestones- already? In 2023 he announced five missions, which he said were not just conventional performance targets but part of an attempt to make government more strategic and focused on the long term. The five headline missions all included sub-missions, so arguably there were around 26 targets or pledges in the document. Then, as the election approached, Labour simplified matter by announcing six first steps for change. Health bosses accept the need to focus on the government’s political priority but say ministers will need to accept trade-offs to achieve it. -If the priority is putting all the money into electives, what we will see is warzone A&amp;E departments and all sorts of other things being sidelined,- said an NHS source. -It will have a number of casualties, including mental health, community care and waits in A&amp;E.- Local councils have told the government its flagship plan to build 1.5m new homes in England over the next five years is -unrealistic- and -impossible to achieve-, the BBC can reveal. The vast majority of councils expressed concern about the plan in a consultation exercise carried out by Angela Rayner’s housing department earlier this year. Labour-run Broxtowe council in Nottinghamshire described the proposed changes as -very challenging, if not impossible to achieve-. South Tyneside, another Labour-run council, said the plans were -wholly unrealistic-, while the independent-run council in Central Bedfordshire, said the area would be left -absolutely swamped with growth that the infrastructure just can not support-.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/02/uk-politics-live-keir-starmer-nhs-waiting-lists-housebuilding	2024-12-02T01:26:47-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbbb3b129af7eddfb7bcae46eecfd7ac2802175c/0_138_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=689be9bcdd5019b7e3adb5768eb64183

Monday briefing: How the civil war in Syria reignited	In today’s newsletter: President Bashar al-Assad’s forces were driven from Aleppo over the weekend by a rebel offensive, forcing global attention to turn back to the country • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. Eight years ago, indiscriminate Russian airstrikes helped Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad’s forces drive rebels from Aleppo, the country’s second-largest city. Assad’s victory in Aleppo, once a symbolic stronghold of the Syrian rebellion, relied on a brutal -surrender or starve- strategy that killed thousands of civilians and forced many more to flee. It was seen as a turning point in the country’s civil war, which has largely been in a state of stalemate since 2020. But over the weekend, a stunning rebel offensive seized Aleppo again – leaving the Assad regime facing the greatest threat to its control in years. Yesterday, Syrian and Russian airstrikes pummeled opposition controlled areas in response. Whatever happens next, if the frozen conflict in Syria has become a -forgotten war- as attention has focused on Gaza and Ukraine, it will now be impossible to ignore. US politics | Joe Biden has issued -a full and unconditional- pardon to his son Hunter Biden covering convictions on federal gun and tax charges. Joe Biden, who has repeatedly said that he would not pardon Hunter or commute his sentence, said that his son had been -selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted-. Assisted dying | A new commission on palliative care has been set up to deliver better care for 100,000 people a year in the final stages of their lives. The commission – instituted after the parliamentary vote last week to legalise assisted dying – has been launched amid warnings of a postcode lottery in standards across the country. BBC | Outrage over Gregg Wallace’s alleged conduct has intensified after the MasterChef presenter dismissed his accusers as -middle-class women of a certain age-.

That would mean they will not be able to team up again with the two centre-right parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, which are poised to take the lion’s shares of seats in the 34th Dáil.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/01/irish-greens-face-virtual-wipeout-after-general-election-rout	2024-12-01T06:59:40-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dad8d0e1243b53e1729eb8022da8ef2cc82d6197/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a959ba61ea5e327ce980061092d1dafd

‘She is an eyewitness’- how Merkel’s ‘office manager’ played key role in memoir	Little-known Beate Baumann’s partnership with the former German chancellor goes back to 1992 In the opening of her autobiography, Freedom, Angela Merkel is clear: she couldn’t have written it without one key person. Neither her sister, Irene Kasner, warmly acknowledged at the close of her book for having helped bring -memories of my childhood and youth back to life-, nor her husband, Joachim Sauer, who she thanks for his constant support.

The streets surrounding the historic department store have become the unlikely latest front in the problem of e-bikes being dumped on thoroughfares, blocking pedestrians and causing disruption to disabled people, who are trying to navigate the already densely populated paths. Residents in Kensington ­complain that there are so many e-bikes being parked in some of the streets that they have difficulty leaving their multi-million-pound homes.

Labour urged to take immediate action on palliative care after MPs back assisted dying – UK politics live	Layla Moran, chair of the health and social care select committee said Wes Streeting should be taking a more proactive approach to the issue Liberal Democrat Layla Moran, chair of the health and social care select committee, voted for the assisted dying bill in the House of Commons yesterday. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, she said she has -long believed, especially in the cases of terminally ill adults, that they should have that choice at the end of life-. I’ve been moved by personal experiences, my best friend’s mother contracted cancer about 20 years ago and we lived in Belgium at the time. She started the process but in fact died before she was able to complete the legal part of the process because the cancer was so aggressive. I saw how taking back that little bit of control in her life was important to her. I was disappointed. I was expecting an announcement from Wes Streeting yesterday to say ‘look, we’ve heard and we are going to do something’ … immediate funding commitments and a view to making sure this is dealt with in the next year or two. I would argue that, whether this passes or not, that is one of the key messages that came out of the debate. Those who don’t want an assisted death and don’t want to take part in providing assisted dying can opt out of it, don’t have to do it, don’t choose to end their lives that way. So it offers everyone equal choice, whatever their religion.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/30/assisted-dying-bill-uk-politics-latest-news-kim-leadbeater-labour	2024-11-30T00:44:21-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3e77a13b9f797982fb881d688a8436474ad698c/0_131_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4ac8df8a0b38a1ed458e902b633ef390

Despite Donald Trump’s decisive victory in the presidential election, a political scientist who developed a model that correctly predicted his sweep of battleground states warns that voters have not necessarily given the president-elect a mandate to make radical changes.

Ukraine war live: Russian defence minister says ties with North Korea ‘expanding in all areas’ during visit	Andrei Belousov arrives in Pyongyang for political and military talks; Putin threatens Kyiv with hypersonic missile Photos released by Russia’s defence ministry showed Belousov walking alongside North Korean defense minister, No Kwang Chol, on a red carpet laid out at a Pyongyang airport. According to the AP, North Korean military officials were seen clapping under a banner that read: Complete support and solidarity with the fighting Russian army and people.- Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike Kyiv with Oreshnik missiles, an intermediate-range weapon that Moscow used against the city of Dnipro last week and that Putin has claimed cannot be shot down by any air defence system. It came after Moscow pummelled Ukraine’s energy grid in an attack that left a million people without power. Russia fired more than 90 missiles and about 100 drones during the barrage, according to Kyiv, with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy urging his allies to respond firmly to what he dubbed Russian -blackmail-. Putin said the fresh bombardment was a -response- to Ukrainian strikes on his territory with western missiles. Russian drone attacks on Ukraine injured at least eight people and damaged residential buildings in the capital Kyiv and in the southern Odesa region overnight, officials said on Friday. Ukraine’s air force said in a statement that, of 132 drones launched against the country overnight, it had downed 88 drones, while 41 were -lost-, likely due to electronic warfare, and one returned to the Russian territory. Georgian riot police deployed teargas and water cannon against demonstrators protesting a government decision to delay asking for EU accession, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reporters witnessed. Thousands rallied in the capital Tbilisi and cities across Georgia after prime minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, announced the decision amid a post-election crisis that saw the country’s president challenge the legitimacy of the newly elected parliament and government. Donald Trump’s plan to tap the retired US Lt Gen Keith Kellogg as US envoy to Ukraine and Russia has triggered renewed interest in a policy document he co-authored. It proposes ending the war by withdrawing weapons from Ukraine if it does not enter peace talks – and giving even more weapons to Ukraine if Russia does not do the same.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/29/ukraine-war-live-russian-defence-minister-north-korea-military-vladimir-putin-volodymyr-zelenskyy	2024-11-29T00:38:40-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f9c8a0edaf3f3d8e4e60246c774f905e2cab823/320_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eefa3c77b1f0aa0bb7734f86bcd0cc96

Weather tracker: Indonesia flash floods and landslides leave dozens dead	Rescuers in Sumatra search for people trapped in cars after landslide triggered by torrential rainfall Last week, torrential rainfall across Indonesia’s largest island, Sumatra, triggered flash floods and landslides, causing widespread destruction. Twenty people died earlier this week in four areas in North Sumatra province amid flash floods and landslides. On Thursday morning, another devastating landslide claimed seven more lives. This landslide struck the main access route between Medan, the provincial capital, and surrounding regions, burying vehicles – including a tourist bus – in mud, rocks, and trees. More than 10 people were injured as a result and rushed to the nearest hospital in Medan. Rescue efforts are continuing, with several vehicles still trapped in the debris. North Sumatra’s traffic director estimated that it may take up to two days to evacuate those affected. Flash floods and landslides are a frequent occurrence in Indonesia owing to seasonal rainfall from October to March, caused by the Asia-Australia monsoon circulation system. This phenomenon causes wind to blow from Asia to Australia, bringing increased water vapour and consequential rainfall to Indonesia. Teleconnections such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation can also influence rainfall patterns, with the likely upcoming La Niña phase expected to bring further extreme weather by the end of the year, intensifying the risk of flooding and landslides as sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean drop below average and easterly trade winds strengthen, pushing additional moisture into the region.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/29/weather-tracker-indonesia-flash-floods-landslides-dozens-dead-sumatra	2024-11-29T00:04:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96c6dd4a54edadd20fafb546714e2bed630c07f6/0_37_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5581eef7e0fca0ac384536017b49ef79

Canada’s federal government and the premiers of the 10 provinces have agreed to work together against a threat by the US president-elect, Donald Trump, to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian imports, with one official saying the country was already examining possible retaliatory measures. What are tariffs? A tariff is a tax on imports, or foreign goods brought into a country, and paid for by the importing companies. The way that tariffs work, in Trump’s mind, is that high tariffs will incentivize American companies to move their manufacturing from abroad to the US. What did political commentators have to say? Jeet Heer, a writer for the leftwing Nation magazine, said: -Is it too much to ask for a little humility and self-reflection from the people whose strategies failed badly?-	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/28/first-thing-canada-leaders-unite-against-trump-tariff-threat	2024-11-28T03:39:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e4c86eb4f584b05618114fac1cd05239d26ec49/0_154_8606_5167/master/8606.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a6abb2bf61144f53f7b8b02ca466fb24

The answer, the police have said, is a bit of both. They believed Khalife to be inept in many regards.

Net migration falling, latest figures expected to show, as Tories claim it is due to their visa rule changes – UK politics live	Kemi Badenoch gave speech on Wednesday referring to James Cleverly’s 2023 visa rule changes, while government says it is important to tackle causes of high migration Good morning. The latest immigration figures are out this morning, but the political debate about them has already started. They are expected to show net migration figures falling, and the Conservatives say that is because of decisions they took before the general election. They are referring to the sweeping changes to visa rules announced by James Cleverly in December last year. Kemi Badenoch deployed this line at the start of her speech on immigration yesterday, saying: Tomorrow, immigration figures will be released that should show a drop in net migration. This is because of the changes we made in the last year of the Conservative government. The figures we saw for 2023 were astonishing. They highlighted a big problem we must be honest about. Even if we see a decline in tomorrow’s data, the fact is immigration, both legal and illegal, is too high.

Middle East crisis live: Hezbollah says its hands are still ‘on the trigger’ amid uneasy ceasefire	Iran-backed Lebanese militia says it remains ‘fully equipped’ and will monitor Israel’s withdrawal In its first statement since a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah took effect on Wednesday, the Lebanese militia proclaimed -victory- without making any direct mention of the ceasefire. The militia said its fighters -remain fully equipped to deal with the aspirations and assaults of the Israeli enemy- and that its forces would monitor Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon -with their hands on the trigger-. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said the Lebanon ceasefire was the -first ray of hope- in the regional conflict after the -darkness of the past months-. -It is essential that those who signed the ceasefire commitment respect it in full,- Guterres said on Wednesday. He reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. In a sign of how volatile the situation remains, Israeli forces opened fire on a number of cars that attempted to enter what it said was a restricted area on Wednesday. Doubts over whether the ceasefire would hold were widespread on both sides. Supporters of Hezbollah, which has suffered heavy losses since October 2023, celebrated the group’s survival and waved its yellow and green flag across southern Beirut on Wednesday. Iran, Hezbollah’s ally, welcomed the end of Israel’s -aggression- in Lebanon. In Israel, the ceasefire has met a more mixed reaction where rightwingers and residents of Israel’s north have criticised the agreement. Dozens of people gathered outside the Israeli army’s headquarters in Tel Aviv on Tuesday night to protest against the ceasefire. The French government has claimed that Benjamin Netanyahu has immunity from arrest warrants issued by the international criminal court (ICC) for war crimes on the grounds that Israel is not an ICC member. The claim came soon after Netanyahu’s cabinet agreed to a French-backed ceasefire in Lebanon and is in contrast to Paris’s attitude towards last year’s ICC war crimes warrant issued against Vladimir Putin, another leader of a non-member country. Netanyahu said Israel had submitted to the ICC its intention to appeal against the arrest warrants, and demand a delay in their implementation. In a statement from his office, he said: -Should the ICC reject the appeal, this will underscore to Israel’s friends in the US and around the world how biased the ICC is against the state of Israel.- The ceasefire in Lebanon came after Israel launched the heaviest day of raids on Beirut, including a series of strikes in the city’s centre. At least 42 people were killed in Israeli strikes on Beirut and the south of Lebanon before the ceasefire began. Hezbollah also fired rockets into Israel, triggering air raid sirens. In Gaza, the death toll passed 44,282 on Wednesday. Gaza’s health ministry said an additional 104,880 Palestinians have been injured since October 2023. An Egyptian security delegation is reportedly expected to travel to Israel on Thursday to discuss a Gaza ceasefire deal. The US will renew a push for a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory, president Joe Biden said. At least 12 Palestinians, including children and women, were killed in an Israeli strike on a school in central Gaza City on Wednesday, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. A pregnant woman and two other Palestinians were killed in Israeli bombing in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza and Khan Younis in the south on Wednesday, Wafa reported. Two journalists were injured when Israeli forces -opened fire- on a group of journalists covering a border town of Khiam in south-east Lebanon on Wednesday, Lebanon’s National news agency said. A video journalist told AFP that he was shot at while reporting in Khiam and that it was clear that the group were journalists. The Biden administration is reportedly pushing ahead with a $680m arms sales package to Israel. The package includes thousands of joint direct attack munition kits (JDAMs) and hundreds of small-diameter bombs, Reuters reported.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/28/israel-gaza-lebanon-benjamin-netanyahu-hamas-hezbollah-middle-east-crisis-live-latest-news-updates	2024-11-28T00:25:25-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67ec4c3c7f7bfac7e41d7b87f56fbef518be533c/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9c6bb63a05c0d7b49bb26f2ff9fef0a3

Thursday briefing: The Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire brings respite – but for how long, and what comes next?	In today’s newsletter: Behind the celebratory scenes on the streets of Beirut lies a battered, divided country teetering on the brink of becoming a failed state • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. At 4am local time on Wednesday, a ceasefire began between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. By that time, some displaced residents of Lebanon’s devastated south were already on their way back, many of them wondering as they travelled whether the homes they had fled were still there. The pause in hostilities has been broadly welcomed in Lebanon, Israel and beyond, both for those who have been exiled on either side of the border and as a step towards regional stability. There are even some optimistic claims that it might help bring about a ceasefire in Gaza. But as the Lebanon ceasefire begins, a formidable task remains: the reconstruction of a shattered region of a country that is perilously close to being a failed state. Assisted dying | The former president of the supreme court, who ruled on the most high-profile assisted dying cases, has declared his support for the law change. David Neuberger’s intervention came as MPs backing the bill say they believe they have the numbers for Friday’s historic vote to pass. UK news | Police believe Mohamed Al Fayed may have raped and abused more than 111 women over nearly four decades, with his youngest victim said to have been 13 years old. The Metropolitan police said that five unnamed individuals were being investigated for facilitating the offences. Ukraine | Ukraine’s power infrastructure was -under massive enemy attack- on Thursday, the country’s energy minister said, after a nationwide air raid alert was declared due to incoming missiles. Weather | The third named storm of the autumn, Conall, has brought more disruption to the UK, with trains cancelled in parts of southern England on Wednesday and the Met Office warning of delays on roads and potential power cuts. Trade | Canada’s federal government and the premiers of the 10 provinces have agreed to work together against a threat by US president-elect Donald Trump to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian imports. Possible retaliatory measures are under consideration after Trump said one of his first executive orders would be a 25% tariff on all products from Canada and Mexico.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/28/thursday-briefing-the-israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-brings-respite-but-for-how-long-and-what-comes-next	2024-11-27T22:58:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4415f39c50a5e54a17beb436a69ded1b32f90a45/0_102_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b5cb5ca2a08d02921071436f7d206670
