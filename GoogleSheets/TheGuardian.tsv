London conference hears UK and Israeli criticism of conduct of Gaza war	Speakers at event call for commitment to a two-state solution and urge Labour government to do more Criticism of the Israeli government and calls for tolerance and a commitment to a two-state solution were the major themes of an event in London on Sunday organised by the left-leaning Israeli newspaper Haaretz. The conference, titled Israel After October 7th: Allied or Alone?, featured speakers from across Israeli and UK politics, academia and media. It served in part to show the extent to which some members of the Jewish diaspora have been traumatised not just by the horrors of 7 October but also the response of Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/28/uk-conference-israel-gaza-two-state-solution	2024-10-28T09:03:22-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/008adf04d774d4c3c183de86e20955b5ea5a7656/0_285_8556_5134/master/8556.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8a51199113de5bd3ffb75ad83f8f1eeb

A memo being promoted by Boris Epshteyn, a senior legal adviser to the former president, is urging him to dispense with the time-honoured convention – originally designed to protect national security – as an apparent means of packing a new administration with loyalists subordinate to him rather than the US government in general.

As CNN reported, between 2017 and 2021, such qualms did not stop McCormick overseeing an increase in Bridgewater’s Chinese holdings from $1.6m to $1.77bn. Nor, according to Bloomberg, did Bridgewater flinch from significant investments in companies that supply the Chinese military.

The German and French ambassadors to the UK, Miguel Berger and Hélène Duchêne, said international schools were distinct from British private schools because the option of transferring to the British state sector was not always realistic for their pupils.	https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/oct/28/vat-international-private-schools-hundreds-pupils-leave-uk	2024-10-28T03:08:44-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41e2d906600ae2c207dfc316aeb68f2028675adb/0_192_3240_1943/master/3240.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=32313621bf6ca6671901d527abd30a50

Starmer to set out ‘harsh’ reality of fiscal situation in speech – UK politics live	Prime minister will say government will ignore ‘populist chorus of easy answers’ as it is set to raise taxes and rewrite fiscal rules in this week’s budget Cabinet minister Pat McFadden has said there are -real reasons- to have optimism as the country approaches the first Labour budget for 14 years later this week. He stated that the government had -inherited a plan to decline, to reduce, investment- from Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government, and that the measures Labour were taking in the budget were -tough decisions- but the start of a turnaround. I think people should look for three things in the budget. Will it stabilize the country’s public finances and do so in a way that keeps our promises? It will Will it also start to turn around the public services and the NHS in particular. We will start that road with a combination of both investment and reform. This is not 1997, when the economy was decent but public services were on their knees. And it’s not 2010, where public services were strong, but the public finances were weak. These are unprecedented circumstances. And that’s before we even get to the long-term challenges ignored for 14 years: an economy riddled with weakness on productivity and investment, a state that needs urgent modernisation to face down the challenge of a volatile world. The Conservatives have raised the tax burden to a 70-year high. We will ensure taxes on working people are kept as low as possible. Labour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of income Tax, or VAT.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/28/keir-starmer-budget-harsh-light-fiscal-reality-uk-politics-live	2024-10-28T02:01:33-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71ec316594f542bce47db67efad8890907accb41/1138_0_1932_1159/master/1932.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a0b2f2f17585e73ff7cd41fe493bfc16

Middle East crisis live: Iranian military chief warns Israel of ‘bitter consequences’ over weekend’s airstrikes	Comments from commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps come as country mulls response to attacks Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing coverage of the Middle East crisis amid Israel’s ongoing wars on Lebanon and Gaza. The top commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has warned Israel it would face -bitter consequences- after its attack on Iranian military sites early on Saturday, according to local media reports. Israel’s parliament – the Knesset – is expected to vote on Monday on a pair of bills that, if passed, will make it impossible for the UN relief and works agency for Palestinians (Unrwa) to operate in Gaza and the West Bank. One of the bills seeks to ban Unrwa from operating within Israel’s sovereign territory, stating that the agency -shall not establish any representation, provide any services or conduct any activities within the territory of Israel-. This would lead to closure of the Unrwa headquarters in East Jerusalem and end visas for Unrwa staff. The measures look to have a cross-party majority of about 100 of the 120 members, despite widespread opposition from other countries, including most of Israel’s allies. At least three people were killed and two others injured by Israeli attacks on the Raml neighbourhood in the Lebanese city of Tyre, according to the country’s national news agency.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/28/israel-iran-gaza-lebanon-unrwa-middle-east-crisis-news	2024-10-28T00:47:30-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65650d9fef0c612592bb8d519482cd75fba18d3b/0_211_3185_1912/master/3185.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9aac3362c72b72728b3830a25183bcbc

‘A lot of fun’: will Trump’s rambling Joe Rogan interview rally young men?	Trump came across as old and unintelligent, but he was politically unscathed by a softball interview In an interview in which Donald Trump said that he wants to be -a whale psychologist-, made the case for replacing income tax with tariffs and praised Confederate general Robert E Lee as a -genius-, the most striking thing about the former president’s encounter with podcaster Joe Rogan wasn’t the content as much as the length. Over three hours, perhaps the longest ever campaign interview with a presidential candidate, Trump said very little that was factual but revealed a surprising amount about his disposition and his thinking should he return to office.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/trump-joe-rogan-interview-analysis	2024-10-26T13:00:36-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06bb70f45877500956afc4f921303b6ccacb43ad/0_19_910_546/master/910.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bad7fc6521dfaf7def17eacfd26a680d

Reeves: ‘My budget will match greatest economic moments in Labour history’	The chancellor says she will invest to reverse Tory decline, but stands accused of breaking party manifesto promises Labour will launch a new era of public and private investment in hospitals, schools, transport and energy as momentous as any in the party’s history in this week’s budget, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said. In an interview with the Observer before the first budget by a female chancellor, Reeves draws comparisons with Labour’s historic reform programmes begun in 1945 by Clement Attlee, in 1964 under Harold Wilson and in 1997 under Tony Blair.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/26/reeves-my-budget-will-match-greatest-economic-moments-in-labour-history	2024-10-26T12:03:28-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/274f6f28b0adaeae1527201fb854df6a1d6b685d/0_47_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2c29e6ee771263de1d4b425dd58c1a5b
Joe Biden says he hopes latest Israeli strike on Iran will end escalation	Iran’s military suggests it would prioritise an agreement to end fighting in Gaza and Lebanon over any retaliation The US President Joe Biden said on Saturday he hopes Israel’s latest strikes on Iran will mark the end of a months-long cycle of escalation, as his administration doubles down on efforts to reach a ceasefire deal for Gaza and Lebanon. -I hope this is the end,- he told reporters. Waves of fighter jets and drones bombed military sites across Iran in an hours-long barrage on Saturday, the first time Israel has openly attacked its erstwhile enemy after decades of shadow warfare.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/joe-biden-says-he-hopes-latest-israeli-strike-on-iran-will-end-escalation	2024-10-26T11:36:49-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1011878595ee87b80ad6ece1e88f1f0033a7e28/0_446_5629_3378/master/5629.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d36dbe442d2a59f7abfb3bfa769da421
Washington Post stirs up fury in liberal America over neutral election stance	Failure to endorse any US presidential candidate for first time in decades ‘undermines’ paper’s independence, say critics Widespread fury and shock ripped through liberal America over the weekend after news that the Washington Post, home of the Watergate scandal exposé, the paper that ran the Pentagon Papers, will not now endorse Kamala Harris for president. But angry responses were quickly replaced by two pressing questions: how did it happen, and how could readers best protest? At the centre of the storm is William Lewis, the British ­newspaperman who became Washington Post publisher and CEO in January. The 55-year-old north Londoner broke the decision to staff on Friday couched in terms that evoked the title’s traditions.	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/oct/26/washington-post-stirs-up-fury-in-liberal-america-over-neutral-election-stance	2024-10-26T11:29:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be501fe8fa57d3d84994830ffce63252cfb65315/0_108_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fce2437b712661d2195049261e988d14
Rachel Reeves has promised not to raise taxes, so how can she fill budget coffers?	Chancellor said to be planning measures including raising employer NI contributions and capital gains tax rates. We consider the likelihood of each and the potential for a row During the general election campaign, Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal studies repeatedly accused both main parties of indulging in a -conspiracy of silence- over their economic policies. Neither Labour nor the Tories would admit, he complained, that if they won they would have to announce huge tax rises or spending cuts to restore the public finances to anything resembling good health. On Wednesday, 118 days after Labour won the election, Rachel Reeves will prove Johnson right. In her first budget she will spell out plans to raise an eye-watering sum of about £40bn from tax rises and spending reductions to wipe the slate clean and to pump funds into public services. She will also confirm changes to debt rules that will release up to £50bn more to borrow for long-term investment in new national infrastructure.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/26/rachel-reeves-has-promised-not-to-raise-taxes-so-how-can-she-fill-budget-coffers	2024-10-26T11:06:01-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80b33b2ba8c5c52d788e0cedcd34a6f37e31fbfe/268_259_1454_872/master/1454.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cc58632d237536dc1b97524632e53312

Iran-Israel’s shadow war is out in the open and will only escalate unless causes addressed	Now face-to-face military confrontation on each other’s soil has been normalised For years, Israel and Iran have waged a -shadow war-, attacking each other indirectly using proxy forces, assassinations, informants, spies and hybrid, non-military covert means. Now this undeclared, largely silent war is undisguisedly out in the open. It’s become a shooting war, it’s noisy, it’s escalating, and there’s no end in sight. This is not to say Israel’s large-scale, three-wave air assault on Tehran and other targets inside Iran early on Saturday morning means the two enemies are now engaged in all-out conflict. This is not yet the full-scale, region-wide conflagration so many in the Middle East fear. That may be coming, but it’s still in the future.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/iran-israel-shadow-war-out-in-open	2024-10-26T09:38:32-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b3fedf835a460ca610bbec9979490678aadfdce/0_341_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42ddcd1c748fd082a18f90a3c46d6bf6

Washington Post cartoon team skewers paper’s decision not to make endorsement	Paper has been pilloried for what some call ‘anticipatory obedience’ in preparation of a new president next year The Washington Post’s cartoon team has taken a measure of revenge on the newspaper’s decision to avoid making a formal presidential endorsement with a dark formless image clearly designed to skewer the -Democracy Dies in Darkness- slogan that the outlet adopted during billionaire Jeff Bezos’s ownership. The image was published hours after it was revealed that Bezos, who has owned the paper since 2012, had pulled the plug on a prepared endorsement of Kamala Harris over Donald Trump in the 5 November election.	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/oct/26/washington-post-cartoon-team-presidential-endorsement	2024-10-26T09:26:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee22ff6e7bfe6aa69a84c84899a7ebc94ff80b52/0_139_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1eb1ef9eca2dce79c8c8dfcf1a22868f

Gunnar Schram, the police chief for Suðurnes, the region of Iceland’s Reykjanes peninsula that has erupted six times since last December, laughs at the question.

Trump’s final pitch to voters: retribution vows, vulgar rallies, fascist accusations	Former president, who recently called US a ‘a garbage can for the world’, has eyes on revenge in re-election campaign As the election nears, Donald Trump’s final message to voters is about revenge, with promises for retribution and rallies that are increasingly incoherent, vulgar and full of vitriol. And his last pitch is as dark and sinister as any he’s made while campaigning the last two years. The US is a -garbage can for the world-, he said at a Thursday rally in Arizona, where he railed against people coming into the country illegally and the Democrats, who Trump called incompetent and stupid.

Trump, Vance to travel to Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia; Harris to appear with Michelle Obama in Michigan – live	Candidates take their pitch to road as election looms, with celebrity endorsements and appearances Good morning, with just over a week left before election day, the race is nail-bitingly close. We’ll be bringing you the latest headlines and analysis today as the campaigns continue. This morning, we’re expecting Donald Trump to deliver remarks at a rally in Novi, Michigan, before traveling to State College, Pennsylvania. His running mate, JD Vance, will similarly speak in Atlanta, Georgia, before heading to Erie, Pennsylvania. In her first event of the campaign, Michelle Obama will hold a get-out-the-vote rally alongside Kamala Harris in Kalamazoo, Michigan. In Houston yesterday, Kamala Harris was joined on stage by superstar singer Beyoncé, congressman Colin Allred, musician Willie Nelson, actor Jessica Alba, several Texas-based OB-GYNs and families affected by the state’s abortion ban in what her campaign is calling their largest rally to date. Harris focused her remarks on the state’s abortion ban, which sparked a slew of abortion restrictions nationwide. Donald Trump’s rally in Traverse City, Michigan, was delayed several hours last night after the ex-president’s interview with podcast host Joe Rogan lasted three hours. Harris and Trump are tied at 48% each for the popular vote for the US presidential election, according to the final New York Times/Siena College national poll published on today. The Washington Post declined to endorse a presidential candidate for the first time since the 1980s. Some staffers and reporters have said the decision was allegedly made by the Post’s owner, billionaire Jeff Bezos.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/26/kamala-harris-donald-trump-us-elections-politics	2024-10-26T08:09:06-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77c55c980fa29051c69f6afdcf7fe2cb0d79be26/0_371_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c7468e7bd44a1df1531d61b35be792c

From Grenfell to Bloody Sunday, the UK government’s formal apologies	UK has resisted calls to apologise over slave trade or colonialism but has said sorry for other historical wrongs As leaders gathered at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) in the Pacific nation of Samoa this week, they hoped that the UK government and King Charles might use the summit as an opportunity to issue an apology for Britain’s colonial past and discuss reparatory justice. While their concerns were acknowledged, the UK stressed it would not pay reparations, and while Keir Starmer called the slave trade -abhorrent-, the government is yet to make a formal apology. King Charles acknowledged -painful aspects- of Britain’s past but stopped short of saying sorry.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/from-grenfell-to-bloody-sunday-government-formal-apologies-slavery-colonialism-reparations	2024-10-26T07:31:08-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a06eff770eff61688bf3ceacaef07a93485ad8bf/0_58_4448_2670/master/4448.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bab1689328c15090f78b5d6e4e70e41e

Trump says on Joe Rogan podcast his biggest White House mistake was hiring ‘disloyal people’	Three-hour long interview caused delay in ex-president’s arrival to Michigan rally, leaving attendees in cold for hours Donald Trump sat down for three hours on Friday with Joe Rogan, telling the US’s most-listened-to podcaster that the biggest mistake he made during his presidency was hiring -disloyal people-. Those comments – which also described -neocons-, or neoconservatives who generally aim to promote democracy, as -bad people- – came days after the Trump White House’s former chief of staff John Kelly said the Republican nominee in the 5 November election met the definition of a fascist. Kelly also said Trump had no understanding of the US constitution and made admiring statements about generals commanded by Adolf Hitler, whose regime systematically murdered 6 million Jews as part of the Holocaust during the second world war.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/trump-joe-rogan-podcast	2024-10-26T06:49:45-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eb2e549a423f570421e28d5b5104380fcd14c3a/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=310b3b7f231dbc7782048e0f99f7eaba

Burgers, avocados, cucumbers: why chefs can’t stop smashing their food	From peas to parsnips, food just tastes better after a pounding. Top cooks explain the year’s tastiest trend It started with meat – burgers, to be precise. But now the moment for -smashed- food has come for everything from brussels sprouts to cucumbers, tacos and toasties. In restaurants and kitchens across the UK, the sound of pounding can be heard as chefs and home cooks take rolling pins to their ingredients. The smash burger – flatter and more crispy than the non-smashed – has been growing in popularity. Last year, experts declared smashed peas on toast the new avocado on toast. On TikTok, smashed cucumber recipes racked up millions of views this summer. -It’s the word of the moment,- says Sami Harvey, executive chef at The Laundry in south London, where smashed roast squash is on the menu.	https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/oct/26/burgers-avocados-cucumbers-why-chefs-cant-stop-smashing-their-food	2024-10-26T06:09:52-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d2cd3b4fbb28bbf561f8a7db5a984b3e19daca8/0_1925_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a13440773c0670d37b8b8d86a3325600

Iran mocks Israel’s ‘weak’ attacks as hardliners call for reprisal	Political elite under pressure from variety of sources, with US urging it to step back from the brink • Middle East crisis – live updates The Iranian government has belittled the scale and effectiveness of the Israeli attack on its military sites, but hardliners in the parliament insisted that the attack breached Iranian red lines and requires a swift response, preferably at a time when Israel is already enmeshed in Lebanon and Gaza. The internal Iranian debate on how to respond to the long-awaited Israeli attack turns on whether to treat Israel’s breach of Iranian national sovereignty as too grave to be ignored, or instead to heed the advice coming from the region and from the US to acknowledge the relatively limited nature of the attack and to step back from the brink by not launching reprisals.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/iran-mocks-israel-attacks-weak-hardliners-reprisal	2024-10-26T05:30:11-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bcf1228ed5553452e1f8cf6e219d244d1d4256e/42_0_5603_3363/master/5603.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5e7ae89c98a7299eb5d1ed902f89a9d9

IDF strikes military sites in Iran: what we know so far	The IDF says it hit military targets in Iran in response to ‘continuous’ attacks on Israel. Here is everything we know so far Israel has struck military targets inside Iran in retaliatory attack that a senior US official described as -extensive but precise-. Iran said three sites were hit, and that -limited damage- was caused. Here is everything we know so far: Israel struck military sites in Iran early on Saturday, saying it was in response to -months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the state of Israel-. The move was widely expected after Tehran’s strikes on Israel earlier this month. Kan, the Israeli public broadcaster, said dozens of fighter jets were involved. The Israeli military said on Saturday morning it hit missile manufacturing sites and aerial defences in several areas inside Iran and had completed its -targeted- air attacks, and that its planes had safely returned home. Israel’s public broadcaster said three waves of strikes had been completed. The Israeli military said after its airstrikes: -If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond.- Two soldiers were killed in Saturday morning’s Israeli airstrikes on Iran, the official Iranian news agency IRNA reported. At least seven explosions were reported in the skies over the capital, Tehran, and nearby Karaj as well as the eastern city of Mashhad just after 2.30am local time on Saturday, as Israeli jets struck military targets in the country. Iran said its air defence system successfully countered Israel’s attacks on military targets in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam, with -limited damage- to some locations. A semi-official Iranian news agency vowed a -proportional reaction- to Israeli moves against Tehran. A senior Biden official said the strikes were -extensive-, -precise- and against military targets across Iran in order to deter future aggression. The official stressed that the US considered the operation to be an -end to the exchange of fire between Israel and Iran- and that the US had no involvement in the Israeli military operation. The US news outlet Axios reported on Saturday that US and Israeli officials assess that Iran will respond militarily but in a limited fashion. Iran and Iraq briefly suspended all flights after the Israeli strikes. Iran’s civil aviation authority later resumed flights from 9am (05.30 GMT) on Saturday. Iranian media initially appeared to downplay the airstrikes, noting that Tehran’s airport was operating normally. State TV reported several strong explosions heard around the capital, while the state news agency, IRNA, said there had been no casualties. There was no immediate official comment about the source of explosions, which Iranian news outlets reported were under investigation. Air defence systems were activated around the country. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) took the rare step of acknowledging the attack on Iran, in a statement that confirmed a decades-old shadow war between the enemy states has now firmly moved into the open. The IDF posted on X: -In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the state of Israel – right now the Israel Defense Forces is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran.- The attacks were widely expected as a retaliation to a missile barrage launched by Iran on 1 October that saw an estimated 180 ballistic missiles fired towards Tel Aviv and military bases, in an unprecedented direct altercation between the two regional enemy states.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-strikes-military-sites-in-iran-what-we-know-so-far	2024-10-25T23:31:58-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e4ca363c414e6a63cf28ca6ace0d8b6b1a07ca5/64_55_1454_873/master/1454.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=71447b9c6088abf77ffc414a46f5e4a8

‘Israel is trying to erase our presence’: Palestinians say ‘generals’ plan’ to clear north Gaza is under way	Many believe new offensive, along with tightening of siege, is following blueprint for removing remaining population Hospitals shelled, shelters set alight, men and boys separated from their families and taken away in military vehicles; a year into Israel-Hamas war, civilians clinging on in northern Gaza say the situation is worse than it has ever been. About 400,000 people have remained in Gaza City and surrounding towns since Israel cut the area off from the rest of the territory and issued evacuation orders. Some are unwilling to leave home, afraid they will never be allowed to return; others decided to stay put for the sake of elderly or disabled family members. Civilians have reported that the routes to the relative safety of the south are unsafe, citing sniper fire and detention by Israeli forces.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/israel-generals-plan-clear-north-gaza-palestinians	2024-10-25T21:00:22-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa36d6f6e3b0f022ddd3baa21d10ff870de9071a/0_147_4399_2640/master/4399.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=86555cdc4b81c9a4be46068c5619cde2

Middle East crisis live: Israel launches airstrikes on military targets in Iran	IDF spokesman says strikes are a response to ‘months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran’, as explosions are heard around Tehran and nearby city of Karaj Welcome to our continuing live coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. Here’s a snapshot of the latest news. Israel has launched direct airstrikes against Iran in a high-stakes retaliatory attack that could bring the Middle East closer to a regional war, drawing in the US. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had begun to launch -precise strikes on military targets in Iran- in response to -months of continuous attacks- from Iran against Israel. Iranian state TV reported several strong explosions heard around Tehran. There were no casualties, the state news agency IRNA said. There was no immediate official Iranian comment about the source of explosions, which Iranian news outlets reported were under investigation. A US official confirmed that Israel notified Washington before carrying out the strikes, and that the US had no involvement in Israel’s military operation. The White House said it understood Israel was conducting the strikes -as an exercise of self-defence-. Some of the blasts reportedly occurred near Imam Khomeni international airport. Iran’s Tasnim news agency said civilian flights were operating normally as of Friday morning. In Gaza, Israeli military strikes across the territory have killed at least 72 Palestinians since Thursday night, including strikes on residential areas in southern Gaza that killed 38 people, including 13 children from the same extended family, Palestinian health officials said. Gaza’s health ministry reported that dozens of people were wounded as Israeli airstrikes and shelling pounded the southern city of Khan Younis. Palestinians said the neighbourhood was hit with no warning. Israeli strikes on three houses in Beit Lahiya killed 25 people and wounded dozens more, medics said. Later on Friday, an Israeli airstrike killed nine people in Shati camp in Gaza City, medics said. The UN rights chief, Volker Türk, described Israel’s renewed assault on northern Gaza as the -darkest moment- of the year-long war on the territory so far. -We are facing what could amount to atrocity crimes, including potentially extending to crimes against humanity,- Türk said in a statement on Friday. Three journalists from the Hezbollah-affiliated TV stations Al Mayadeen and Al-Manar were killed and several others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on their press station in Hasbaya, southern Lebanon, early on Friday morning. The strikes hit a group of small chalets that 18 journalists from at least seven different media outlets – including Al Jazeera, Sky News Arabia and TRT – were staying in while covering the Israel-Hezbollah war in south Lebanon. Several cars with -Press- signs on them were parked in front of the site. Lebanon’s prime minister, Najib Mikati, said the attack was -deliberate- and -aims to terrorise the media to cover up crimes and destruction-. UN peacekeepers withdrew from a observation post in Zahajra town in south Lebanon on Tuesday after Israeli forces fired at it, the force said on Friday. Unifil added that the Israeli military has repeatedly demanded that its peacekeepers vacate its positions along the Blue Line and deliberately damaged camera, lighting and communications equipment at some of these positions. Two people were killed in a strike on Majd al-Krum in northern Israel, Israeli media said on Friday, following a statement from Hezbollah saying that it targeted the northern Israeli town of Karmiel with a large missile salvo. Lebanon’s transport minister, Ali Hamieh, said Israeli bombing put a second border crossing between the country and Syria out of service, leaving one official passage between the two nations operational. The UN refugee agency (Unhcr) warned that Israel’s overnight airstrike on the Jousieh crossing in Lebanon’s northern Bekaa area jeopardised the main escape route for people fleeing the conflict in Lebanon in search of refuge in Syria. More than half a million people, mostly Syrians, had crossed into Syrian territory since Israel began heavily striking Lebanon late last month, according to figures by the Lebanese authorities on Friday.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/26/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-airstrikes-iran-lebanon-gaza-hamas-hezbollah-latest-updates	2024-10-25T19:39:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b3fedf835a460ca610bbec9979490678aadfdce/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d26de4a579a3d819424f029f067e6210

‘Working people’ definition is work in progress for No 10	The phrase is commonly used by all parties but its meaning has come under scrutiny before next week’s budget It is a phrase that crops up 21 times in the Labour manifesto, 12 times in the Conservative manifesto, and has been used in the Commons more than 3,500 times in the last decade. So, surely everyone knows what -working people- are – don’t we? Perhaps not. In the buildup to next week’s budget there has been ever-increasing scrutiny and a parallel lack of clarity about what Labour’s manifesto commitment to not raise taxes on -working people- actually means in practice.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/25/working-people-definition-labour-starmer-budget	2024-10-25T06:57:33-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/232993376be96d271019d6c227774affd49cfe50/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=039f3de90a9149a09c64eaf6727bb43e

Labour MPs fear chancellor’s tough budget will bring new set of problems	Concerns from party that significant cuts to key departments will set damaging tone for new government When Rachel Reeves stands up in the Commons on Wednesday, her budget will end months of speculation, allowing the government to fully set out what it stands for. And that, some Labour MPs fear, might herald a whole new set of problems. For all the expectation management about a disastrous economic inheritance and the fabled £22bn fiscal black hole, the sheer lack of money and tight constraints over tax rises mean that however well Reeves presents her choices, many of them will be painful.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/25/labour-mps-chancellor-rachel-reeves-budget-problems	2024-10-25T06:15:52-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc253ee661ed82348f7bffac0963a3fe177f6e3a/0_22_4116_2470/master/4116.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e0fef309129e1482828b4ce11b998195
Stacey Williams says Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein ‘coordinated’ groping incident	Former model said of incident at Trump Tower in 1993: ‘I was rolled in there like a piece of meat in some kind of twisted game’ Former model Stacey Williams said she thought Donald Trump groped her to show off to her then boyfriend, the late financier and sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein, when the couple dropped by to visit him in Trump Tower in New York in 1993. In her first detailed, on-camera interview since discussing assault allegations with the Guardian, Williams late on Thursday told CNN that she recalled the former president and Epstein smiled at each other as the property mogul was feeling her up, which gave her the impression the entire incident was a -coordinated- game between the two men.

What did Obama say? He warned that just because Trump’s behavior is -goofy- doesn’t mean he isn’t dangerous. Who else was there? It was a star-studded event, including Samuel L Jackson, Spike Lee, Tyler Perry and Bruce Springsteen, who said Trump was running to be -an American tyrant-. Where else has he campaigned?

Harris holds rally with Obama while Trump calls US a ‘garbage can’ – US election live	Campaigning for presidential candidates continues with election less than two weeks away Good morning and welcome to the US election live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest from the campaign trail over the next couple of hours. We start with news that vice-president Kamala Harris appeared with Barack Obama for the first time, offering closing arguments targeting Black voters in Atlanta’s eastern suburbs, a vibrant, symbolic part of Georgia. The family of Amber Nicole Thurman, a Black 28-year-old mother who died just weeks after Georgia’s abortion ban went into effect, was in attendance at the Harris rally. Harris is expected to make another high profile appearance today, this time alongside Beyoncé in Houston, where the vice-president hopes to rally support for Senate candidate Colin Allred. Donald Trump rallied supporters in Tempe, Arizona, where he spoke alongside Senate candidate Kari Lake. Earlier in the day, Trump made news when he vowed that, if elected, he would immediately fire Jack Smith, the justice department special counsel who is prosecuting him for allegedly plotting to overturn the 2020 election and hide classified documents. Trump called the country a -garbage can- because of immigration policies under the Biden administration. -We’re like a garbage can, you know, it’s the first time I’ve ever said that,- Trump said in Tempe, the home of Arizona State University. -And every time I come up and talk about what they’ve done to our country, I get angry. First time I’ve ever said garbage can, but you know what, it’s a very accurate description.- Phoenix police arrested a man suspected of setting fire to a mailbox there, damaging mail-in ballots. The news comes just days after Tempe police arrested another man in connection with three shootings at Democratic party campaign offices in Tempe. An Arizona prosecutor said the second man had more than 120 guns and more than 250,000 rounds of ammunition in his home, leading law enforcement to believe he may have been planning a mass casualty event. Harris picked up the endorsement of two Republicans, one a former congressman from Michigan, the other a mayor in a pivotal county in Wisconsin. Joe Biden announced he will issue an apology for the US government’s role in forcing thousands of Indigenous American children to attend Indian boarding schools – a policy which has been widely recognized as an element of genocide. The news comes as Harris is trailing in the polls in Arizona, a state that Biden famously won in 2020, largely due to the support of Indigenous American voters. More than 29 million people have voted already in the 2024 election, at least partly driven by Republicans embracing early voting at Donald Trump’s direction. So far, Republicans have cast 32% of ballots, up from 27% at this point in 2020. Whereas Democrats have cast 42% of the votes, down from 47% at this point in the last presidential election.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/25/kamala-harris-donald-trump-us-election-politics-barack-obama	2024-10-25T02:38:05-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce815812c1d46e85c839f9dfb5ad05d437f0defa/0_232_6942_4164/master/6942.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3c03c48590bdb5c4a72e0279e59aef22

Middle East crisis live: media workers reportedly killed in Israeli airstrike; Blinken to meet Lebanese PM	Three people who worked for pro-Iran Al Mayadeen and Hezbollah-owned Al Manar, were directly targeted, according to Lebanese media Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Israel’s wars on Gaza and Lebanon. An Israeli airstrike early on Friday morning killed at least three media staff staying at a guesthouse where several other reporters were staying, Lebanese media reported. At least 17 people, nearly all women and children, have been killed in Israeli bombing of a school turned shelter in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip, medics in the territory have said. Another 42 people were injured in the strike in the overcrowded camp, according to nearby al-Awda hospital. Among the dead were 13 children under the age of 18 and three women, it said. The strike marked the latest Israeli bombing of a school sheltering displaced people across Gaza. Israel’s military said the school was being used as a Hamas command and control centre. As it braces for an expected retaliatory strike from Israel, Iran has ordered the armed forces to be prepared for war but also to try to avoid it, having witnessed the decimation of its allies in Lebanon and Gaza, the New York Times is reporting. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has ordered the military to devise multiple military plans for responding to an Israeli attack, the report says, citing four unnamed Iranian officials. The scope of any Iranian retaliation, they said, will largely depend on the severity of Israel’s attacks. Several Israeli strikes hit Beirut’s southern suburbs on Thursday, about half an hour after Israel issued evacuation warnings for the Hezbollah bastion after intense strikes the night before. In Beirut’s southern Choueifat Al-Amrousieh area, Israeli warplanes -destroyed two buildings and ignited a large fire, and black smoke covered the area,- according to the official national news agency. -The raid that targeted the Saint Therese area also caused the collapse of two buildings near the constitutional council.- Israel had earlier issued evacuation warnings for the Hezbollah bastion following intense assaults the night before. Israel’s military said it had killed a Hamas commander who took part in the 7 October 2023 assault on southern Israel and worked for the UN aid agency in the Gaza Strip. Unrwa confirmed the man, Mohammad Abu Itiwi, was a staff member and was killed on Wednesday. Unrwa said Itiwi’s name was included in a letter received from Israel in July that included a list of 100 staff members who were also allegedly members of armed groups, including Hamas, but that Israeli authorities had not provided more information supporting those allegations. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, warned Benjamin Netanyahu that -civilisation is not best defended by sowing barbarism ourselves-. Macron also vowed to help train 6,000 extra Lebanese official forces, and called for a ceasefire and an end to Israeli attacks on UN peacekeepers, as a conference in Paris raised $200m (£154m) for Lebanon’s official military and $800m in humanitarian aid for the country. Gaza’s civil defence agency said on Thursday that more than 770 Palestinians have been killed in the north of the territory since Israel launched a new offensive in northern Gaza on 6 October. The agency also said it had been forced to suspend operations in northern Gaza after what it called threats from the Israeli military to -bomb and kill- rescue crews working in Jabalia camp. Gaza’s health ministry said on Thursday that 42,847 Palestinians have been killed and 100,544 injured since Israel launched its war last year. An Israeli airstrike struck the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza on Thursday night, with Gaza’s civil defence agency estimating that 150 people – including women and children – were killed or injured, the Palestinian news agency, Wafa reported.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/25/israel-lebanon-gaza-hamas-hezbollah-middle-east-latest	2024-10-24T23:37:17-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d42d31766648a60a6352a2bc7488055657353b6a/0_14_5085_3051/master/5085.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72747df98a7b6ea60cdec7d7c24d919c
Proposed powers to exempt NT projects from environmental assessments criticised as ‘terrifying’ and ‘authoritarian’	The Labor opposition, conservationists and Indigenous groups have expressed shock at the move The newly elected Northern Territory government wants to grant itself sweeping new powers to exempt major projects from environmental assessments in a move described by conservationists and Indigenous groups as authoritarian and anti-democratic.

Macron opens conference aimed at finding to path to ceasefire in Lebanon	French president is hoping to rise about £300m in funds to address humanitarian crisis caused by Israeli bombing Emmanuel Macron has opened a conference in Paris in support of Lebanon, with the twin aims of raising about £300m in funds to address the mounting humanitarian crisis caused by Israeli bombing and finding a way to fill the security vacuum created by the chronic weakness of the Lebanese state. Most observers say Macron, the president of France, which has historical ties to Lebanon, is likely to have success with his first task, partly owing to donations expected to come from Sunni-majority Gulf states.

Starmer calms business fears over budget as Reeves prepares to announce debt rule change - UK politics live	PM tries to reassure businesses and investors in UK, while chancellor is in New York for IMF meeting Good morning. Officially Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, will unveil Labour’s first budget (and probably most important for the whole parliament) on Wednesday next week. But in practice budget announcements are now two-week news events, because the Treasury knows that it is bad idea to spook the markets with lots of surprises on the day and so this government, like past governments, has been engaged in elaborate pitch-rolling, ensuring that there are plenty of reports in advance giving a broad idea of what is coming. Not all the stories you might read this week about what will be in the budget will be accurate, or Treasury-sanctioned, but quite a lot of them are. One of the measures subject to a lot of pitch-rolling is the proposal to change the official definition of debt used in the government’s fiscal rules. Reeves has been hinting for a while that she will change this and today, at a meeting of the IMF in Washington, she will confirm this. This yardstick – which will replace public sector net debt – will take into account all the government’s financial assets and liabilities, including student loans and equity stakes in private companies, as well as funded pension schemes. This would give the chancellor room to increase borrowing for investment in long-term infrastructure … The chancellor has made clear, both in her conference speech and consequently about her desire to see more investment in the economy. It’s a matter of record that investors in the UK have previously said that UK investment levels are too low both in terms of public infrastructure and in terms of business investment more generally. Investors shouldn’t be worried about this budget. This government is prioritising growth. It’s unashamedly pro-business. You’ll have seen from the significant vote of confidence in the UK economy at the international investment summit that it is already the case that investors are responding positively to the government’s plans.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/24/labour-budget-keir-starmer-rachel-reeves-imf-uk-politics	2024-10-24T01:01:36-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acbf3cf5124d6ee5426f218535b250356225c7b2/1023_976_2520_1512/master/2520.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a299c3840fba512c1320c095db917cf9

Thursday briefing: How the state is failing children with special needs – and what it costs	In today’s newsletter: Despite a 58% increase in funding over a decade, there has been no improvement in outcomes, a new report reveals • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. The annual budget for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) in England now stands at £10.7bn, an increase of 58% in a decade. Despite that, there has been no improvement in outcomes, and many parents say that their children are being sold short. The need for services is so great against the backdrop of years of council cuts that two in five local authorities are at risk of effectively declaring bankruptcy by 2026. In other words: the system is somehow underfunded and financially ruinous at the same time, and failing the children it is supposed to support. That is the grim diagnosis contained in a report by the National Audit Office (NAO) published this morning, which warns that system-wide reforms are needed to keep councils afloat. And there is no doubt that the figures it contains are eye-watering. Budget | Rachel Reeves will announce at the International Monetary Fund a plan to change Britain’s debt rules that will open the door to more borrowing for long-term capital investment. After weeks of speculation, the change could release up to £50bn extra for infrastructure projects. France | Gisèle Pelicot, the French woman who has become a feminist hero for insisting that the rape trial of her ex-husband and 50 other men should be held in public, has told a court in southern France she was driven by her desire to change society and expose rape culture. She said: -I wanted all woman victims of rape … to say: Mrs Pelicot did it, we can do it too.- Police | The identities of armed police officers charged after opening fire at suspects are likely to stay secret in future unless they are convicted, the home secretary has announced. Yvette Cooper’s statement came after the acquittal of the Metropolitan police sergeant Martyn Blake for shooting dead Chris Kaba. US | A former model who says she met Donald Trump through the late sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein has accused the former president of groping and sexually touching her in an incident in Trump Tower in 1993. Trump’s presidential campaign called the allegation -unequivocally false-, calling it a fake story -contrived by the Harris campaign-. Dementia | Tens of thousands of dementia patients are to be enrolled in clinical trials designed to dramatically speed up the hunt for a cure, leading scientists have announced.

What does Elon Musk want from all this politicking?	The billionaire is pledging to give away $1m a day and campaigning hard – is deregulation the driving motivation? Over the weekend, Elon Musk pledged to give away $1m a day to registered voters in battleground states in the US who sign a petition by his America Pac in support of the first and second amendments. He awarded the first prize, a novelty check the size of a kitchen island, at a Pennsylvania rally on Saturday and the second on Sunday in Pittsburgh. He says he’ll keep doing it until the election on 5 November. The stunt is potentially illegal, experts say. After endorsing Donald Trump in July, Musk quickly founded America Pac and funded it with $75m. For the past several weeks, he’s been making multiple in-person campaign appearances per day, focusing especially on Pennsylvania, a swing state. These constant fights with the full alphabet of regulatory agencies has coincided with Musk making numerous public statements in favor of deregulation, as well as calling for a full-scale audit of the federal government. That idea has found purchase with Trump, who announced in September that he would launch a Musk-led government efficiency commission that would audit federal agencies for places to cut. Musk wants to call it the Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, invoking one of his favorite memes, an expressive shiba inu. Although the plan is vague on details and fails to address the obvious conflict of interest in Musk auditing the regulators that oversee his companies, both Trump and Musk have repeatedly brought up the idea of Musk holding some role in a potential Trump administration. During an appearance on Fox News earlier this week, Trump said that he would create a new position called ‘secretary of cost-cutting’ and appoint Musk. ‘He’s dying to do this,’ Trump said.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/23/what-does-elon-musk-want-us-elections	2024-10-23T00:00:03-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a008ee15efeca203901374fb954755061463d8f/0_365_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=26ed4c6e6e831452b8da44ac6138ac7f

Middle East crisis live: Israel says it killed Hezbollah’s presumed next leader	Israeli military says strikes in Beirut earlier this month killed Hashem Safieddine Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the Middle East conflict. Israel said on Tuesday a strike it carried out in Beirut three weeks ago killed Hashem Safieddine, the presumed successor to late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was also killed in an Israeli attack last month. Israel is weighing the use of private security contractors – possibly involving UK special forces veterans – to deliver aid to Gaza, as conditions in the north of the strip worsen dramatically, the Guardian has learned. At least three Israeli strikes targeted Beirut’s southern suburbs Tuesday evening, according to Lebanon’s official ANI news agency. Two of the strikes hit the Laylake district, near a stadium. The strikes came shortly after Israel’s military issued new evacuation warnings for residents in specific buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Lebanon’s health ministry on Tuesday revised upward the casualty toll from the Israeli strike near Beirut’s main government hospital on Monday to at least 18 people killed, including four children, and 60 wounded. Israeli jets hit a Hezbollah target close to the Rafik Hariri university hospital in Beirut but did not target the hospital and it was not affected by the strike, the Israeli military said on Tuesday. At least 63 people were killed in Israeli strikes on Lebanon over the past 24 hours, bringing the total death toll to 2,530, the Lebanese government said on Tuesday. It also said that more than 11,800 people had been wounded by Israeli strikes on Lebanon since October 2023. Seven Palestinian civilians were killed during Israeli artillery bombardment of a school sheltering displaced people in northern Gaza on Tuesday, Wafa, the Palestinian news agency reported, citing local sources. Separately, at least three Palestinians were killed and several wounded by an Israeli drone strike targeting a group of people in western Gaza City, the Anadolu news agency said. Palestinians under an Israeli siege in northern Gaza -are rapidly exhausting all available means for their survival-, the UN’s humanitarian office has warned. The UN’s office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (OCHA) accused Israel of denying its requests to deliver life-saving aid to northern Gaza, as well as of denying requests to help rescue dozens of people trapped under their collapsed homes in the Falouja area of the Jabalia refugee camp in the north. Lebanon will need $250m a month to help more than a million people displaced by Israeli attacks, its minister in charge of responding to the crisis said on Tuesday. Nasser Yassin told Reuters the government response, helped by local initiatives and international aid, only covered 20% of the needs of 1.3 million people. Keir Starmer has accused Vladimir Putin of disrupting food supplies to Gaza after British intelligence suggested Russia had stepped up its attacks on Ukrainian ports. Starmer said it was clear the Russian president was -willing to gamble on global food security- after several grain ships en route to developing countries were damaged by Russian strikes, and are believed to have delayed a vessel carrying vegetable oil destined for the World Food Programme in Palestine. The FBI is investigating the leak of a pair of highly classified intelligence documents describing Israel’s preparations for a retaliatory strike on Iran, the Washington Post reported. -The FBI is investigating the alleged leak of classified documents and working closely with our partners in the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community,- the FBI said in a statement.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/23/middle-east-israel-gaza-war-hamas-hezbollah-lebanon-hashem-safieddine	2024-10-22T23:30:04-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/247c6c01ba3ac010c267a31f8f972e654527847a/0_352_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5f0b21f57b2dd335e1e2865cca77dec6
Wednesday briefing: What reforms could actually solve the prison capacity crisis?	In today’s newsletter: With a sentencing review ordered and the crisis in the criminal justice system deepening, the government is tasked with finding solutions to what seems like an intractable problem • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. If the answer is -prison works-, it now seems that the most likely question is: what is a good example of a demonstrable policy failure where successive governments have nonetheless decided to stick with the status quo? England and Wales lock up more people than any other country in western Europe, with Scotland close behind; thanks largely to longer sentences, the prison population has doubled since 1993. But while crime has dropped considerably over that period, the same effect has been seen in countries that don’t lock up nearly so many people – and about 44% of freed prisoners are convicted again within a year. UK news | Police chiefs have asked the government to make it harder to prosecute officers after a sergeant was acquitted of the murder of Chris Kaba, in a move that drew immediate criticism from campaigners as a grant of -effective immunity-. It meanwhile emerged that Kaba had shot a man a few days before he was killed and was allegedly a core member of a south London gang. Middle East | Israel has confirmed the killing of the presumed next leader of Hezbollah in an airstrike on southern Beirut earlier in October. In a statement on Tuesday evening, the Israeli military said strikes in the suburb of Dahiyeh had killed Hashem Safieddine three weeks ago. Hezbollah has not yet commented. Water | Water companies in England could be banned from making a profit under plans for a complete overhaul of the system. The idea is one of several under consideration by a new commission amid public fury over sewage in rivers and mismanagement. US elections | Donald Trump has filed an extraordinary complaint against the UK’s Labour party, claiming that volunteers joining the Kamala Harris campaign are guilty of -blatant foreign interference-.

Police chiefs ask government to make it harder to prosecute officers after Chris Kaba shooting	Exclusive: Campaigners say calls to redraw rules are cynical attempt to secure ‘effective immunity’ for officers Police chiefs have formally asked the government to make it harder to investigate and prosecute officers after the fatal shooting of Chris Kaba led to a Scotland Yard sergeant being acquitted of murder, the Guardian has learned. Campaigners have criticised the move, saying calls to redraw the rules were a cynical attempt by police leaders to secure -effective immunity- for their officers. Making it harder for the Crown Prosecution Service to charge officers, with police chiefs proposing prosecutors would have to prove training or approved professional practice was not being followed before taking action. Changing the standard of proof required for a verdict of unlawful killing ahead of the inquest into Kaba expected as early as next year. Currently the ruling is made on a balance of probabilities, the civil standard. Police chiefs want it to be the criminal standard, which is beyond reasonable doubt. Making it harder to disprove a claim of self-defence in misconduct inquiries, by changing the standard to the higher criminal test, rather than the current civil test.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/22/police-chiefs-government-make-harder-prosecute-officers-after-chris-kaba-shooting	2024-10-22T12:11:22-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d730bf6e7be4a9221083ca13fa13c535245c83f8/0_190_4501_2700/master/4501.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=205d3bc02b89f5c105c837469813d4cc

Israel mulls using private security contractors to deliver aid to Gaza	Discussion about letting private firms bid for contracts comes before Knesset vote on banning UN relief agency from operating in Israel Israel is weighing the use of private security contractors – possibly involving UK special forces veterans – to deliver aid to Gaza, as conditions in the north of the strip worsen dramatically, the Guardian has learned.

First Thing: people killed and dozens injured in Israeli airstrike near Beirut hospital	Antony Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv for talks. Plus, Liz Cheney backs Kamala Harris on abortion Good morning. At least 13 people were killed and 57 injured in an Israeli airstrike on Monday near Hariri hospital, Beirut’s main government hospital, the health ministry said, revising upwards its initial death toll of four. What has the impact been on Lebanese civilians? Israel’s invasion of Lebanon, launched 1 October, has displaced more than 1.2 million people multiple times, according to Lebanese authorities. At least 2,483 people have been killed, according to the health ministry. What is the US doing? Secretary of state Antony Blinken has arrived in Tel Aviv, where he will meet Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Blinken is expected to stress the need for Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza and to discuss securing the release of the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza. As Israel’s most powerful ally and weapons supplier, the US has sent more than 10,000 highly destructive 2,000lb bombs and thousands of Hellfire missiles since the start of its war on Gaza. What did Cheney say? -I’m pro-life and I have been very troubled, deeply troubled by what I have watched happen in so many states since Dobbs … I have been troubled by the extent to which you have women who – as the vice-president said, in some cases have died – who can’t get medical treatment that they need because providers are worried about criminal liability.- What are the polls saying? The election is essentially deadlocked. Harris has small polling leads in Pennsylvania and Nevada, while Trump has small polling leads in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, but all are well within the margin of error and all the races in the all-important battleground states remain too close to call.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/22/first-thing-people-killed-and-dozens-injured-in-israeli-airstrike-near-beirut-hospital	2024-10-22T03:58:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2280bfe6bdd09577aa6b2b45edc8262e63fb4fd1/0_171_3656_2194/master/3656.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ab5be1f7e59fd9f2c17c0b640984a551

Donald Trump urges Christian voters to participate in 2024 election – US politics live	Republican candidate claims that Kamala Harris administration would restrict religious freedoms during event in North Carolina Good morning and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest from the campaign trail, with polling day now just two weeks away. We start with the news that Donald Trump has urged Christian voters on Monday to participate in the 2024 election, claiming that a Kamala Harris administration would restrict religious freedoms and casting himself as a protector of Christians. Liz Cheney, former Republican congresswoman and longtime opponent of abortion rights, condemned Republican bans on the procedure and urged conservatives on Monday to support Kamala Harris. Jill Biden acknowledged on Monday that her husband made -the right call- by stepping down from his run for re-election. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, said Elon Musk’s plan to give away $1m a day in support of Donald Trump is a reflection of a ticket with -no plan-. The Central Park Five sued Trump for defamation after he falsely said during the presidential debate that they had pleaded guilty to a brutal rape 35 years ago, despite the fact that they had their convictions overturned. A Republican county supervisor in Arizona who refused to certify the 2022 midterm election has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor.

David Gauke calls for end to ‘bidding war’ between parties as he is appointed to sentencing review – UK politics live	Former Conservative justice sectary to carry out review by Ministry of Justice considering alternatives to sending people to jail Paul Brand from ITV says, if the government thinks that, by getting David Gauke to carry out the sentencing review, they will get the Conservatives support for it, they will probably be disappointed. He has posted this on social media. Govt hopes by appointing Gauke - a former Tory Justice Sec (tho admittedly a centrist in today’s party) - they can get cross-party agreement on sentencing reform. But it’s likely Tory leadership candidates will say Labour being soft on criminals, and on the political debate goes. Prison works. It ensures that we are protected from murderers, muggers and rapists - and it makes many who are tempted to commit crime think twice ... This may mean that more people will go to prison. I do not flinch from that. We shall no longer judge the success of our system of justice by a fall in our prison population.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/22/david-gauke-sentencing-ministry-of-justice-shabana-mahmood-uk-politics-latest-updates	2024-10-22T01:32:47-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eace5e52f4c9fa1a919dc53041f53b527eb30bec/0_43_3942_2366/master/3942.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4857abccfdb2dc5392bfafeb5f3e54d1
Barbecue, kangaroo pies and Jimmy Barnes: Charles and Camilla go quintessentially Australian for final day of tour	The royals get on the tongs, banter with surf lifesavers and meet massive crowds at the Sydney Opera House Just as King Charles and Queen Camilla arrived at a barbecue picnic in western Sydney, the strains of the Jimmy Barnes anthem, Working Class Man, wafted mysteriously and humorously above the crowd.

Middle East crisis live: Air raid sirens sound in Tel Aviv after Hezbollah claims to have targeted Israeli city	Israeli military said about 20 rockets were fired with many intercepted; US secretary of state Antony Blinken due to land in Israel for talks Air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv on Tuesday after Hezbollah said it bombed the Nirit area in the city’s suburbs with missiles. The Israeli military said about 20 rockets were fired in the latest barrage from Lebanon – five toward central Israel and 15 toward the north, and that attempts were made to intercept them. The IDF said there were no immediate reports of injuries. Israel said late Monday it planned to carry out more strikes in Lebanon against a Hezbollah-run financial institution that it targeted the night before and which it says uses customers’ deposits to finance attacks against Israel. At least 15 branches of Al-Qard Al-Hasan were hit late Sunday in the southern neighbourhoods of Beirut, across southern Lebanon and in the eastern Bekaa valley, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. One strike flattened a nine-story building in Beirut with a branch inside it. There were reports that dozens of Palestinians, including children, were killed in attacks carried out by Israeli soldiers in the northern Gaza Strip. Among the casualties were at least 10 people killed in an Israeli attack on Jabalia Preparatory School in Al-Fawqa area, which was functioning as an Unrwa shelter for displaced people, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. Joe Biden’s administration remains -deeply concerned- about the leak of a pair of highly classified intelligence documents describing Israel’s preparations for a retaliatory strike on Iran, the White House has said. There is no indication that additional documents have been compromised and US officials have been in communication with Israeli counterparts about the leak, a spokesperson said. Iran warned the US would bear -full responsibility- in case of a retaliatory attack by Israel on the Islamic Republic, after US president Joe Biden indicated he was aware of Israeli plans to do so. Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, called Biden’s remarks -profoundly alarming and provocative-. The UN warned Monday that almost no aid is entering the besieged Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, where a two-week Israeli military campaign has killed hundreds of people and left thousands trapped. The heads of the United Nations World Food Programme and UN children’s agency Unicef, Catherine Russell and Cindy McCain, have privately appealed to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for help -alleviating the suffering of countless civilians- in Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon, according to a new letter. Up to 1,000 women and children needing medical care will shortly be evacuated from Gaza to Europe, the head of the World Health Organization’s Europe branch said. Israel, which is besieging the war-devastated Palestinian territory, -is committed to 1,000 more medical evacuations within the next months to the European Union,- Hans Kluge said. The US military has rushed its advanced anti-missile system to Israel and it is now -in place-, defence secretary Lloyd Austin said. THAAD, or the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, is a critical part of the US military’s layered air defence systems and adds to Israel’s already formidable anti-missile defences.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/22/middle-east-crisis-live-blog-news-updates-israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-palestine-hamas-hezbollah-war	2024-10-21T22:46:43-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b57afaa3d426bef6f42da1ae0cfd5409c2c2eb7a/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3b78b6a9c225ebd88b482eea3627bce1

Honest Bob Jenrick won’t sleep until everyone sees he’s the maddest person in the room | John Crace	The Tory leadership hopeful believes that if he shouts the same things a bit louder, everyone will eventually come round to his way of thinking You can only conclude that some politicians are simply untreatable. Their egotism and self-delusion so deeply engrained that reality never gets a look in. I give you Robert Jenrick. Exhibit A. He is a worthy successor to Liz Truss as one of the dimmest solipsists you could hope to meet. After trailing in a distant second in last week’s televised Q&amp;A, you’d have thought Honest Bob might have taken a day or two to regroup. After all, if the most Tory-friendly audience imaginable at GB News doesn’t much like you then most people would reasonably conclude they had a problem. If you can’t connect with the few remaining diehard Tory members, then your chances of appealing to the rest of the country are vanishingly small.

Can Democrats still win in rural states? Montana’s Senate race offers litmus test	Jon Tester is fighting to keep his Senate seat amid the prospect that Democrats like him are now facing political extinction in the state He was a young and little-known underdog. So Max Baucus, candidate for Congress, decided to trek 630 miles across Montana and listen to people talk about their problems. -As luck would have it, on the first day, I walked into a blizzard,- he recalls, pointing to a photo of his young self caked in snow. -It was cold! But the blizzard didn’t last that long.- Baucus shed 12lbs during that two and a half month journey in 1974. He also made friends.

Monday briefing: The Trump acolytes planning to interfere with November’s election	In today’s newsletter: From stacking election boards to purging voter rolls, we look at the tactics that could sway key states • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. With two weeks to go until the US presidential election, the race could hardly be closer. But when you’re next frantically obsessing over the odds, keep in mind: it may not be as simple as who most voters want to see in the Oval Office.

This time around, Republicans are a lot more organised in their efforts to influence the outcome – and as the Maga takeover of the GOP has rolled on over the past four years, election denialism has moved from the fringes to become a central tenet of the party.

But in the wake of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene, which left western North Carolina reeling from massive floods that swept away buildings, downed power lines, and left thousands of people stranded in their homes, life is anything but normal in this part of the Appalachians.

Bob Woodward’s new book War is a sober but alarming must-read	Watergate reporter says Trump is far worse than Nixon and ‘most reckless and impulsive president in American history’ The Middle East and Ukraine are ablaze, the US mired in turmoil. An octogenarian president recedes from view. The threat of a second Trump term hangs like the sword of Damocles. Fifty years ago, with Carl Bernstein, Bob Woodward captured Watergate and the downfall of Richard Nixon. Now, the US sits at an inflection point once again. Woodward’s fourth book at least in part about Donald Trump is a sober but alarming must-read. War depicts an administration under Joe Biden that is often behind the curve, at times captive to its own wishful thinking. The withdrawal from Afghanistan haunts. Trump mesmerizes. Yet as Woodward tells it, Biden and his team did clearly see the menace Russia posed. Unlike George W Bush, Biden did not need to gaze into Vladimir Putin’s blighted soul. Unlike Trump, he did not feel compelled to fluff his ego like a besotted fanboy. War is published in the US by Simon &amp; Schuster	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/oct/20/bob-woodward-book-war	2024-10-20T08:39:32-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/543127b86d2e6e66437eafb6b09c31c3dfc2b3cf/0_236_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=38da297af1bcf891fa6a88bb07df6cda

Harris kicks off birthday at Georgia church as Trump heads to McDonald’s in Pennsylvania – live	Candidates focus on rallying support from battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan Kamala Harris is delivering remarks at a service in New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in the Atlanta suburb of Stonecrest, Georgia. The crowd sang happy birthday when the Vice President, who turns 60 today, took the stage. Harris began her speech by turning the attention towards the ferry dock collapse on Georgia’s Sapelo Island, where at least seven people were killed during a fall celebration by the island’s tiny Gullah-Geechee community of Black slave descendants.

The sign in Biden’s hometown is the perfect fall 2024 welcome mat in this crucial swing state filled with voters whose economic anxiety or satisfaction will decide next month’s election.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/20/biden-harris-scranton-pennsylvania-economy	2024-10-20T03:00:41-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/456a011eeed048fa02414d5bdf4a0ec781367c07/0_0_2232_1336/master/2232.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a6f08cdfbb4ee2130b193ca541426d15

John Widdowson and Paul Smith went to town centres, ­community halls, Women’s Institute meetings. They handed the simple forms out to anyone who visited Sheffield University, where they were based.

As Silicon Valley eyes US election, beware Elon Musk and the tech bros with political nous | John Naughton	The owner of X is just one of many who may prefer Donald Trump to greater regulation under the Democrats Way back in the 1960s -the personal is political- was a powerful slogan capturing the reality of power dynamics within marriages. Today, an equally meaningful slogan might be that -the technological is political-, to reflect the way that a small number of global corporations have acquired political clout within liberal democracies. If anyone doubted that, then the recent appearance of Elon Musk alongside Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania provided useful confirmation of how technology has moved centre-stage in American politics. Musk may be a manchild with a bad tweeting habit, but he also owns the company that is providing internet connectivity to Ukrainian troops on the battlefield; and his rocket has been chosen by Nasa to be the vehicle to land the next Americans on the moon. There was a time when the tech industry wasn’t much interested in politics. It didn’t need to be because politics at the time wasn’t interested in it. Accordingly, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple grew to their gargantuan proportions in a remarkably permissive political environment. When democratic governments were not being dazzled by the technology, they were asleep at the wheel; and antitrust regulators had been captured by the legalistic doctrine peddled by Robert Bork and his enablers in the University of Chicago Law School – the doctrine that there was little wrong with corporate dominance unless it was harming consumers. The test for harm was price-gouging, and since Google’s and Facebook’s services were -free-, where was the harm, exactly? And though Amazon’s products weren’t free, the company was ruthlessly undercutting competitors’ prices and pandering to customers’ need for next-day delivery. Again: where was the harm in that?	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/20/as-silicon-valley-eyes-us-election-elon-musk-is-not-the-only-tech-bro-to-worry-about	2024-10-20T01:00:39-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09c3f9308b486f377d732d10df725dd895414885/0_82_2682_1609/master/2682.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=640012f560f9864d863482cefea207d8
Middle East crisis live: Israeli strike on Gaza residential building kills at least 73 people, officials say	Israel says number of dead exaggerated after strike on town of Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Israel’s wars on Gaza and Lebanon. In northern Gaza, an Israeli airstrike hit several houses and a multi-storey residential building in the town of Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza on Saturday night, killing at least 73 people, officials said. The US government is investigating an alleged leak about classified US intelligence on Israel’s strikes against Iran, CNN reports. CNN reports that the documents which date from 15 and 16 October started circulating on Friday on Telegram through an account called the Middle East Spectator. The investigation is also examining how the documents were obtained – including whether it was an intentional leak by a member of the US intelligence community or obtained by another method, like a hack – and whether any other intelligence information was compromised, the Associated Press reports. Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in the seaside town of Caesarea was hit by a drone on Saturday, causing superficial damage and no casualties. Neither Netanyahu nor his wife, Sara, were home at the time. -The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake,- Netanyahu said in a statement, vowing that Iran and its proxies would -pay a heavy price-. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, spoke to Benjamin Netanyahu after reports of an attempted drone attack on the Israeli prime minister’s holiday home in Saturday. According to a Downing Street spokesperson, Starmer told Netanyahu that he was alarmed to hear about what Netanyahu called an -assassination attempt- on his life. G7 defence ministers expressed their concern over Israel’s latest attacks on Unifil in Lebanon. The group, which has been meeting in Naples, Italy, said: -We are concerned by the latest events in Lebanon and the risk of further escalation. We express concern over all threats to Unifil’s security.- The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, spoke to his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, on Saturday, reviewing US forces’ -posture adjustments-. Those include the recent deployment of an anti-missile system to reinforce Israel’s defences against regional threats, the Pentagon said in a statement. The US would like to see Israel scale back some of its strikes in and around the Lebanese capital of Beirut, Austin said. -The number of civilian casualties have been far too high,- Austin told reporters at a G7 defence gathering in Naples. Two Israeli airstrikes targeted south Beirut early on Sunday, Lebanese state media reports. -Enemy (Israeli) airplanes carried out two strikes this morning on Beirut’s southern suburbs, one of them hitting a residential building in Haret Hreik- near a mosque and a hospital, the National news agency reported. There were no immediate details of casualties or property damage. The Israeli army ordered civilians located near buildings it claimed were -affiliated with Hezbollah- in two neighbourhoods in south Beirut to immediately evacuate early this morning.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/20/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-gaza-lebanon-hamas-netanyahu-latest-live-news	2024-10-20T00:29:09-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b246cf6581f8499c451f973d3456e1fb20d1cf9/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=613cba02debc4e5f1a60d3df3d10b555

Allegations suggest India is now part of the assassination club | Hannah Ellis-Petersen	Canada’s PM, Justin Trudeau, claims Indian diplomats are implicated in murders on Canadian soil A gruelling week for Indian diplomacy began with an explosive Canadian press conference on Monday. Senior Canadian police officials accused Indian diplomats of being involved in -criminal- activities on Canadian soil, ranging from homicide and targeted assassinations to extortion, intimidation and coercion against members of the Canadian Sikh community. They alleged that Indian diplomats – including the high commissioner himself – were implicated not only in the high profile killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh activist who was gunned down outside a gurdwara in a suburb of Vancouver last June, but also linked to other murders on Canadian soil. The diplomats had even worked with a gang run by India’s most notorious mob boss to get their dirty work done, they alleged.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/20/allegations-suggest-india-is-now-part-of-the-assassination-club	2024-10-19T22:00:37-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fb5fa7bd6db8392801321bfbfda4e3d9c1a5f32/0_167_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d4b7e576e858a906e4463df0c6f7c604

Rachel Reeves will tax businesses to plug £9bn black hole in NHS	The chancellor is set to announce a revenue-raising budget designed to reset Britain’s public finances Rachel Reeves is set to use one of the most pivotal budgets of recent times to call on businesses to pay more tax to help restore the NHS, amid warnings that the health service has been left with a £9bn hole in its finances. The chancellor is expected to stake her reputation on a tax-­raising budget designed as a reset of the public finances. She has already had to deal with cabinet skirmishes over funding unveiled alongside the statement. However, Reeves is understood to believe that the public will accept a multibillion-pound hike in business taxes if it is linked to repairing the health system’s finances.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/19/rachel-reeves-will-tax-businesses-to-plug-9bn-black-hole-in-nhs	2024-10-19T12:00:24-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8da36ccb3f8006b3475178b530ee3d3f1681b03/0_178_5392_3236/master/5392.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=aa16de82005a0f45e85df58260c1a743
Protecting the Green Triangle: experts warn of ‘irreversible’ groundwater decline	The groundwater system in western Victoria and south-east South Australia has begun to show signs of collapse, threatening the water security of SA’s second biggest city Some of the best-quality groundwater in Australia underlies the upper and lower south-east of South Australia and parts of south-western Victoria. But almost 200 years of draw down for agriculture, farming and domestic use has changed the surface drainage. Underground water in some areas has collapsed and water quality is deteriorating, putting at risk not only a fragile natural ecosystem but a $5bn regional economy.

Montana park ranger says Senate candidate Tim Sheehy lied about combat wound	Sheehy has claimed that he was wounded in Afghanistan, but ranger says he investigated accidental shooting in park in 2015 A former Montana park ranger has now publicly accused Tim Sheehy – a Republican running for a US Senate seat in the state – of lying about getting shot while at war in Afghanistan. In an interview with the Washington Post published on Friday, 67-year-old Kim Peach went on the record about how Sheehy – a former US navy seal – actually shot himself on a family trip in 2015 at Glacier national park.

This reflects how many in Israel feel about the death of a man responsible for the ­murder of 1,200 people, mostly civilians and their compatriots, but ­terrorism experts have long debated the ­efficacy of eliminating the ­leaders of violent extremist groups, with some suggesting the strategy is counter-productive.

Kamala Harris joined by Lizzo at campaign event; Donald Trump rallies in Pennsylvania – live	Vice-president is hosting a get-out-the-vote event in Detroit for the city’s first day of early voting, alongside Michigan-born rapper Lizzo Lizzo and Usher are just some of the prominent celibrities backing Harris against her rival Donald Trump. Earlier this week, Lizzo revealed that she voted early for Harris, and Usher said last month that he was endorsing Harris. This week, the campaign announced a fundraising sweepstakes to win tickets to an upcoming get-out-the-vote concert featuring -superstar musicians.- Harris questions whether Trump is -fit to do the job- of president again. She used a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Friday to seize on reports that Donald Trump had been canceling media interviews to question whether he has the stamina for a second presidency if voters choose him over her in November’s election. In the past week, Trump has gone further than ever in branding his political opponents -the enemy within- and talking about deploying the military against them. The latest polling figures seem to mirror such sharply polarised rhetoric, with the seven crucial swing states almost split down the middle in allegiance. Harris announced this week that if elected president, she would fully legalize adult recreational cannabis on the federal level – the first time a presidential nominee has taken such an unambiguous stance on ending cannabis prohibition. The pledge sets Harris apart from both her opponent and her predecessor. While Trump and Biden now support some level of cannabis legalization, Harris is the first to explicitly state that ending prohibition is a priority.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/19/kamala-harris-donald-trump-rallies-us-politics-elections	2024-10-19T07:59:40-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce16be42cc8302a17dca22c7419fdf1d5fffd09f/0_150_5364_3218/master/5364.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b30849521a7fb8875ce87a04aaaaf11d

Weight-loss drugs could be key in lowering US obesity rates – experts	Medications like Ozempic ‘transformed’ diabetes care because they improved health outcomes, say experts Obesity rates have decreased slightly in the US and while it’s too early to say whether the trend will hold and what’s causing the change, experts believe weight-loss drugs could be playing a role in continuing to lower obesity and reduce related health risks. These medications – Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and others – are called GLP-1 agonists, and they were originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes. But they also show great promise for treating obesity and other health conditions, like heart disease, kidney and liver issues, sleep apnea, asthma, Covid complications and cancer, among others.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/18/weight-loss-drugs-ozempic-obesity	2024-10-18T07:00:50-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/621da27f915cd0cccbaeb4b3057265e4c8fa1f77/0_217_4368_2620/master/4368.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3ec2caf7ea1f3bb1d3d4005cffccbc70

Walking with breaks might use more energy, but dogs can’t stand it	A new study finds that breaking up your exercise is more effective, but Tim Dowling remains to be convinced Let me start by saying that I am not looking for ways to be more tired. I’m tired enough. However, a new study suggesting that exercise punctuated by frequent breaks requires more energy than -steady-state- exertion has a certain counterintuitive attraction: I can exercise better by resting more. The results of the study, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, are striking. Volunteers on treadmills and stair climbers used 20-60% more oxygen when walking in bursts of 10-30 seconds than they did covering the same distance without stopping. This apparently has something to do with the sheer inefficiency of stop-start activity. -We found that when starting from rest, a significant amount of oxygen is consumed to start walking,- said the study’s author, Francesco Luciano. -We incur this cost regardless of whether we then walk for 10 or 30 seconds, so it proportionally weighs more for shorter rather than longer bouts.- Would this strategy, I wondered, work for me?	https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/18/walking-with-breaks-more-energy-exercise-dogs-tim-dowling	2024-10-18T06:38:19-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2154b83e148c53c640b06865626b9cb2a7c92e89/0_166_7918_4750/master/7918.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=60cd059363c40c58bfcf1b40860f46e9

Labour will reform benefits system to save £3bn, says minister – UK politics live	‘We will not go ahead with the Tory plan,’ Alison McGovern says, adding: ‘We will bring forward our own reforms’ Rachel Reeves will seek to make about £3bn of cuts to welfare over the next four years by restricting access to sickness benefits, it is understood, according to the PA news agency. The chancellor is expected to commit to the previous Tory government’s plans to save the sum by reforming work capability rules, as first reported by the Telegraph. We have always said that the work capability assessment is not working and needs to be reformed or replaced alongside a proper plan to support disabled people to work. We will deliver savings through our own reforms, including genuine support to help disabled people into work.- Like all departments, the Department for Work and Pensions has to make savings because we are in a terrible financial situation. To be clear, on that point we will bring forward our own reforms because the last 14 years have been a complete failure when it comes to employment.- We will not go ahead with the Tory plan because that was theirs. We will need to make savings like all departments, but we will bring forward our own reforms.- British foreign secretary David Lammy will meet his counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing on Friday to -challenge- China on sensitive issues like Russia’s war in Ukraine, as the two nations seek to rebuild frayed ties. Lammy is the first British cabinet minister to visit China since Labour prime minister Keir Starmer took office in July. Rachel Reeves is considering raising the tax on vaping products in her budget this month as figures show that a quarter of 11 to 15-year-olds in England have used e-cigarettes. The chancellor is looking at increasing the tax after a consultation carried out by the last Conservative government. The chancellor is taking action to ensure her budget plan for a multibillion-pound increase in government borrowing to fund infrastructure projects avoids a Liz Truss-style meltdown in financial markets. Ahead of her tax and spending event on 30 October, Reeves is convening on Friday the first meeting of a taskforce of leading City figures to advise on infrastructure projects. Kemi Badenoch has criticised a Conservative MP’s suggestion she could not head the Tories because she was too -preoccupied- with her children, saying -it isn’t always women who have parental responsibilities-. Stephen Flynn, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, has written to the prime minister urging him to intervene and stop the cuts in this year’s budget. He said, in a letter seen by the PA news agency, that Starmer must -listen to voters and your own cabinet colleagues: intervene now, overrule the chancellor and stop the cuts, or people in Scotland will never forgive the Labour party-. The Home Office has recruited 200 staff to clear a backlog of 23,300 modern slavery cases left by the last government, a minister has told the Guardian.

Small and lethal: adapted drones carrying explosives ‘hunt’ civilians in Kherson	Ukrainians face new airborne threat that has killed 24 civilians and injured hundreds more since July Sasha Ustenko has survived three attacks by the Russian drones that stalk the streets of Kherson carrying fragmentation grenades to drop on anything that moves. The first, in late July, targeted a parked police car in central Kherson just as Ustenko walked past, throwing him to the ground. The second, in mid-August, hit a drinking water tanker as he queued for supplies, killing the driver. Ustenko was concussed, and came round to see a man lying in a pool of blood. The third time, in late September, he heard the drone buzzing above and sprinted for shelter under the branches of a cherry tree. He hoped its leaves would hide him but the grenade tumbled through the canopy and landed barely a metre away.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/drones-carrying-explosives-stalk-streets-of-kherson-ukraine-russia	2024-10-17T22:00:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e618ab5f4ec88fb13da30e78b93d77a316b98f12/0_364_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5100da98ce3cf05675de7bf2a5f000c3

The expert committee’s reports are based on an analysis of anonymized cases, chosen for their implications for future euthanasia requests.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/canada-nonterminal-maid-assisted-death	2024-10-17T12:51:47-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9aa0b985d1e6a257ddd708a38c2ae33b291d6c1/0_44_4189_2514/master/4189.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d018d645e29bc07741fa1c22c45cfc95
Australia news live: NT lowers age of criminal responsibility to 10; royals due to arrive on wet Sydney evening	The new Country Liberal government fulfils election pledge on ‘fighting crime’. Follow today’s news live Children as young as 10 could face jail after the Northern Territory parliament last night passed a law to lower the age of criminal responsibility, Australian Associated Press reports. After the Territory recently became the first jurisdiction in Australia to raise the age to 12, the incoming government has moved quickly to return it to 10. We know reverting to a system where it is the judge’s discretion around what to do with a 10 and 11-year-old creates much better opportunities for authorities to intervene early in their lives. I feel sad for territory children, sad because we have a government who has taken a policy position that says ... in order to help you, we need to criminalise you first. Putting children into cells ... that is child abuse.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/oct/18/australia-news-live-northern-territory-lowers-age-of-criminal-responsibility-royal-tour-king-charles-queen-camilla	2024-10-17T12:38:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41d945c04969f6afda0e04b48c95abb912890eaa/0_41_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=32e3c7fe283d099f744ab18a3fe1d1f5
Russia wants to ‘create havoc’ if it is behind DHL fires, says air freight expert	Goal seems to be for people ‘to lose confidence in the system’, says Brandon Fried after devices found in Birmingham and Leipzig Russia is aiming to disrupt western confidence if it is proven to be behind an incendiary device plot that led to two parcels catching light at DHL sites in Birmingham and Leipzig in July, an expert has said. The dangerous packages are not thought to have been sophisticated but in both cases appear to have evaded security checks.

Killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar: what we know so far	The mastermind of the 7 October attack that triggered the current war in Gaza has been killed in a neighbourhood of Rafah Israel has killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in southern Gaza. Here is what we know so far: Israel’s military said it had killed Sinwar, who is seen as the architect of the 7 October attack in Israel, in Gaza. In a statement, the IDF said: -After completing the process of identifying the body, it can be confirmed that Yahya Sinwar was eliminated.- The statement came shortly after the Israeli foreign minister, Israel Katz, also said Sinwar had been killed. -Mass murderer Yahya Sinwar, who was responsible for the massacre and atrocities of 7 October, was killed today by IDF soldiers,- Katz said in a statement. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, described Sinwar’s death as -the beginning of the end- but warned the -task before us is not yet complete-. In a press conference, Netanyahu said Israel will continue to work until the end of the war. To the people of Israel, Netanyahu said that there are -a lot of challenges still facing us- and that -we have to remain resilient- and -stand firm on our ground and to continue to fight-. He added: -We will not stop the war. We will go into Rafah.- Hamas sources told Reuters that indications suggest Sinwar was killed in an Israeli operation in Gaza. There has been no public response from Hamas at the time of writing. Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, has commended the Israeli military, the Shin Bet intelligence agency, and the security services for the killing of Sinwar. In a post to X, Herzog described Sinwar as the -mastermind- behind the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel and for being -responsible for heinous acts of terrorism against Israeli civilians- for years. He added: -His evil endeavors were dedicated to terror, bloodshed, and destabilizing the Middle East.- In a statement, the Israeli prime minister’s office said that no hostages were believed to have been present at the site of the killing in the Gaza Strip, where Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said -three terrorists were eliminated-. Some in the defence establishment had believed that Sinwar was likely to have surrounded himself with human shields as he sought to evade Israeli troops. US president Joe Biden was briefed aboard Air Force One while heading to Germany. Biden, on his way to Berlin for talks with European leaders, was being kept abreast of developments on board the presidential plane, the official told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on condition of anonymity. Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has recently spoken with his US counterpart, defence secretary Lloyd Austin, according to a US official. The call came moments after Katz announced Sinwar was dead, the official said. According to CNN, Austin was passed a note about Sinwar’s death during a Nato meeting in Brussels earlier today. Israel’s Kan Radio reported that the Hamas leader was killed -by chance-, and not as a result of intelligence gathering. The station also said the bodies found at the site were found with large amounts of cash and fake IDs. Al-Majd, a Hamas-linked website that usually publishes about security issues, has urged Palestinians to wait for information about Sinwar from the group itself, reported Reuters.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/israel-says-hamas-chief-yahya-sinwar-is-dead-what-we-know-so-far	2024-10-17T10:45:40-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f782ace6410b3e4e2b809f30da49960631597f5f/0_109_7189_4314/master/7189.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=02f8e880bc45a7e82f86ff8a24f58f97
Yahya Sinwar: ruthless operator who plotted Hamas 7 October attack	Drawn into Islamist activism as a teenager, Sinwar spent 22 years in Israeli jails before return to frontline militancy Within days of the 7 October attacks last year, Israeli investigators had identified Yahya Sinwar, then the military leader of Hamas in Gaza, as the mastermind. To their increasing astonishment, they learned that not only had Sinwar conceived of what he called Operation al-Aqsa Flood but he had planned and organised the assault almost alone. Only a handful of close aides had been let in on the plans, some with only days to go before the attack, in which about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and 250 abducted, and which triggered an Israeli offensive that has so far killed 42,500 people, also mostly civilians, and left swaths of Gaza in ruins.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/yahya-sinwar-hamas-leader-profile	2024-10-17T10:41:44-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9582842e9507a4b51fe923d634d41fd1ee461497/0_128_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e9874518b6133191f6567fcdc4360912

As of July 2024, around 11,500 Lebanese nationals were believed to be in the US on nonimmigrant visas for business, tourism, temporary work or other opportunities, with California and Michigan hosting the most.

Death of Yahya Sinwar would be boost for Netanyahu but may not end war	Killing, if confirmed, will throw Hamas into disarray and give encouragement to Israeli military and political officials If Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas and mastermind of the 7 October attacks, is dead, the implications for the conflict in Gaza, for Israel’s other campaigns in Lebanon and the occupied West Bank, and for Israel’s domestic politics are significant. There will be the war – or wars – before the killing of the 62-year-old veteran militant and the war(s) after it. One of the biggest immediate impacts will obviously be on Hamas, which has now lost much of its top leadership. Already the head of its military wing in Gaza, Sinwar took charge of the organisation after Ismail Haniyeh, his predecessor, died in a bomb explosion in a government guesthouse in Tehran in July that was blamed on Israel. Other senior officials were killed in Beirut and in Gaza, where Israeli airstrikes successfully targeted military Hamas commanders such as Marwan Issa and Mohammed Deif.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/yahya-sinwar-hamas-gaza-netanyahu-israel-war	2024-10-17T08:49:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e8deff0de4401ad0243eb5c362a2c6e0fe61594/0_0_5339_3205/master/5339.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2523b1fd7b9ccb0a28b4398ed455a74c

Tories would do better with Jenrick as leader than Badenoch, poll suggests ahead of leadership hustings – UK politics live	Conservative leader candidates will take part in GB News hustings at 7pm Good morning. Members of the Conservative party have started getting their ballot papers for the leadership election, and this evening Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick will take part in what may be the only TV event of this stage of the contest – a hustings on GB News starting at 7pm. They won’t go head to head, but they each take questions for an hour. We will be covering it live (although a colleague will be at the helm, not me). Badenoch remains the bookmakers’ favourite, but Jenrick gets a boost today from Electoral Calculus polling, reported in the Telegraph, suggesting that the Tories would do better with him as leader. In his write-up, Charles Hymas says: Mr Jenrick, the former immigration minister, would win 50 extra seats if he was leader of the Tories compared with 30 seats that would be gained if Kemi Badenoch, his rival for the top job, was in charge of the party, according to the poll of nearly 6,300 people by Electoral Calculus … Under Mr Jenrick, the Conservatives would increase their number of seats from 121 to 178, with Labour falling from 412 to 311, the Liberal Democrats dropping from 72 to 58 and Reform rising from five to 24. That would place Labour 14 seats short of a majority.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/17/tory-leader-robert-jenrick-kemi-badenoch-labour-keir-starmer-uk-politics-latest-news	2024-10-17T01:06:46-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44db73d18caaf9dc2544bbfa5a2cf47a0bf499c1/222_0_4556_2734/master/4556.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4c9e3c2456670aec1a701a0b082cece5

Thursday briefing: The £40bn funding gap, £22bn ‘black hole’ and more tricky terms, explained	In today’s newsletter: Chancellor Rachel Reeves is painting a bleak picture ahead of the budget later this month. Here’s what all the jargon means • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. I’m really sorry about this, but today’s newsletter is about the extent of the -black hole- in the public finances and the government’s fiscal rules. I don’t like this any more than you do: I’d frankly rather be writing about whether King Conker is a cheat. But the budget is nearly upon us, and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has started talking about a £40bn funding gap, when you might have only just got used to being alarmed about the £22bn -black hole-. Several of today’s front pages carry reports of planned tax rises to balance the books; meanwhile, Reeves is planning to redefine debt to give herself more room for manoeuvre. If you have found yourself confused by this, congratulations on at least paying close enough attention to notice how knotty it all is. Music | Liam Payne, a former member of the boyband One Direction, has died after falling from a third-floor hotel room in Buenos Aires.

National security | Counter-terrorism police are investigating whether Russian spies planted an incendiary device on a plane to Britain that caught fire at a DHL warehouse in Birmingham in July, the Guardian can reveal. Investigators are examining possible links with a similar incident in Germany, also in July. Extremism | An international network of -race science- activists seeking to influence public debate with discredited ideas on race and eugenics has been operating with secret funding from a multimillionaire US tech entrepreneur. Seattle businessman Andrew Conru pulled his support after being approached by the Guardian. Asylum | Nearly 63,000 people who were waiting for their cases to be processed at the time of the general election are expected to be granted asylum after Labour dropped the Rwanda deportation scheme, an analysis has found. The Refugee Council said the asylum backlog was on track to be 59,000 cases lower at the start of 2025 after the processing of claims accelerated.

That just means debt should be falling by the last year of that period. That’s it. Think about what that means: it’s like saying on 1 January, right, I’m going to go on a diet this year, but I’m going to lose all the weight in December. Nobody would take you seriously if you said that, and economists from a broad spectrum think it’s stupid. Fiscal rules are there to look plausible, they are often broken when it comes to the crunch, and they rely on the public not really knowing what they mean.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/first-edition-22bn-black-hole-explained	2024-10-16T22:52:24-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/658f207c0266016d4d263565e87d75db6d9e0238/0_0_6912_4147/master/6912.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=66ce1ddbc8275fd7400cccd0683df2d5

Research by consultants Africa Practice and the advocacy non-profit Africa No Filter suggests that media portrayals, especially during elections when global coverage is heightened, focus disproportionately on conflict, corruption, poverty, disease and poor leadership, widening disparities between perceived and actual risks of investing in the continent, and creating a monolithic view of Africa.	https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/oct/17/media-stereotypes-africa-higher-interest-report-payments-on-sovereign-debt	2024-10-16T22:00:06-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d64974956dd271822b5cb1d993ff4414d0849c8b/0_104_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bc806f0d15081d75be1ea5ad8dc2a731

Iraq militias step up Israel attacks as Iran looks to junior proxies	Analysts suggest proxies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen fighting hidden conflict could be targets for Israel as it considers retaliation against Tehran Iran-linked militias in Iraq have launched about 40 attacks involving missiles, drones or rockets on Israel in the past two and a half weeks, the latest escalation in a largely clandestine proxy battle fought across a swath of the Middle East. The attacks began in October last year when the war in Gaza started, but data compiled by the Washington Institute, a US-based thinktank, shows a sharp increase in their pace after Israel killed the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an airstrike on 27 September.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/iraq-militias-step-up-israel-attacks-as-iran-looks-to-junior-proxies	2024-10-16T21:00:04-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65ef6ea1a20e9b829a9b97bf90077d2153608a34/0_256_5639_3384/master/5639.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4062f0678150ac56789d0d12dff226f9

Middle East crisis live: US military strikes Houthi targets in Yemen – Pentagon	US air force used B-2 bombers to target ‘five hardened underground weapons storage locations’ of Iran-backed Houthis, Pentagon says The US military has struck Houthi weapons storage facilities within Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, according to the Pentagon. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said the US military, including air force B-2 bombers, conducted precision strikes against five hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. The US has demanded proof on the ground that Israel does not have a policy of starvation in northern Gaza as it turned up the pressure on the Netanyahu government to allow more aid into the territory. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the security council on Wednesday at a meeting convened by France, UK and Algeria that such a policy -would not just be horrific and unacceptable- but also had -implications under international and US law-. The risk of cholera spreading in Lebanon is -very high-, the World Health Organization has warned, after a case of the acute and potentially deadly infection was detected in the conflict-hit country. The WHO highlighted the risk of cholera spreading among hundreds of thousands of people displaced since Israel escalated its campaign against Hezbollah. Israeli forces have stormed the Jazalone refugee camp in the West Bank and deployed teargas, Al Jazeera reports. A young girl was reportedly treated for breathing issues. Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said that there have been no conversations with any parties on a Gaza ceasefire for the last three to four weeks. -On the prospects of the negotiation … basically in the last three to four weeks, there is no conversation or engagement at all, and we are just moving in the same circle with the silence from all parties,- he said. Shaban al-Dalou, the 19-year-old Palestinian who was burned to death in his makeshift tent when Israel bombed the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital complex in Deir el-Balah on Monday, would have turned 20 today. -Losing him is an incredibly massive loss,- al-Dalou’s uncle, Mohammed al-Dalou said, adding: -He left a mountain of pain and memories.- Hezbollah said it targeted -at 6.50pm (1550 GMT) … the occupied town of Safed with a salvo of rockets- in -defence of Lebanon and its people-. The reported attack marks the third attack in 24 hours which Hezbollah said was a response to Israeli raids across Lebanon which have killed more than 2,300 people in recent weeks. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant on Wednesday, the Pentagon says, after Austin and secretary of state Antony Blinken jointly penned a letter earlier this week urging Israel to improve Gaza’s humanitarian situation.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/17/middle-east-crisis-live-updates-israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war	2024-10-16T20:00:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/753f1f32bef766f63bfaef60413eddd4c5f52f03/0_322_5359_3216/master/5359.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ae5ff4da9f669001bf11778ef1ebd0c

Skeleton crew: California driver nabbed for using plastic bag of bones as HOV lane passenger	CHP says carpool lanes should incentivize ridesharing for living humans, not replicas of the body’s support system Drivers looking to beat California’s endless traffic can use designated carpool lanes, provided they’ve got others in their car.

You instinctively know when they are being sincere and when they are bullshitting. When push comes to shove, they just aren’t as smart as they would like us to believe they are. They are inherently bad actors. The only people they ever fool are themselves. You know the form. We could all tell when Boris Johnson was lying. It was whenever his lips moved. But there are the odd moments when they are impossible to read. When no one can really be sure what is going on. Are they playing a sophisticated triple bluff? Or have they entered a parallel universe where they are so detached from reality that even they have no idea what they are doing? Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions was a case in point.

Elon Musk’s $75m puts him among largest Republican donors – US politics live	The Tesla CEO gave around $75m to his pro-Donald Trump spending group over a period of three months Elon Musk gave around $75 million to his pro-Donald Trump spending group in the span of three months, federal disclosures showed, underscoring how the billionaire has become crucial to the Republican candidate’s efforts to win the presidential election Reuters reports. America PAC, which is focused on turning out voters in closely contested states that could decide the election, spent around $72 million of that in the July-September period, according to disclosures filed to the Federal Election Commission. The first day of early voting in the battleground state of Georgia saw a record turnout, with 328,000 people casting a vote in person or by mail. This more than doubled the previous record of 136,000 set in 2020. Trump will launch a bus tour of north Carolina later today. The tour will travel across the state for three days before ending at the Wayne County Republican Party HQ on Friday. Early in-person voting begins tomorrow in the battleground state. Kamala Harris will return to the battleground state of Pennsylvania for another campaign event later today, after she visited Erie on Monday. She will then head to Wisconsin to visit Milwaukee, La Crosse and Green Bay on Thursday. Trump refused to say if he would commit to a peaceful transfer of power should he lose the 5 November election, in an interview with Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait. He claimed there had been a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election, despite his supporters’ violent attack on the Capitol on 6 January. He also doubled down on his promise to levy tariffs on all imports in a bid to boost American manufacturing. Economists say this policy would probably mean higher prices for consumers and anger US allies. Yesterday Harris defended her record as a prosecutor, pledged to decriminalise marijuana and push for police reform. She was aiming to shore up support among black men in an interview with radio host Charlamagne tha God. The Harris Victory Fund, the Democratic candidate’s ‘big-dollar fundraising committee’, raised $633m in the three months from 1 July to 30 September. This was over a third higher than the amount raised by Biden in the same period in 2020, the New York Times reported. President Joe Biden said Harris would -cut her own path- once she wins the 2024 election, as he hit the campaign trail to help win over sceptical voters three weeks before Election Day. -Kamala will take the country in her own direction, and that’s one of the most important differences in this election,- he said. -Kamala’s perspective on our problems will be fresh and new.

Keir Starmer to face PMQs as reports claim Treasury must fill ‘£40bn funding gap’ in budget – UK politics live	Sources say Rachel Reeves told cabinet colleagues yesterday the figure was much higher than previously estimated Good morning. Governments engage in expectation management, and the latest example is on the front page of the Financial Times this morning, where there is a story saying Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has identified a -£40bn funding gap- as she prepares the budget, which is happening a fortnight today. In their story George Parker and Sam Fleming report: UK chancellor Rachel Reeves has identified a £40bn funding gap ahead of her Budget in two weeks — far more than previously expected — as she prepares big tax rises to patch up the NHS. The figure represents the funding that Reeves needs to protect key government departments from real-terms spending cuts, cover the enduring impact of an annual £22bn overspend and build up a fiscal buffer for the remainder of the parliament. If we get tax rises on that scale [£40bn], that really would be extraordinary, I mean unprecedented. That would be tax rises sort of three times as big as George Osborne, for example, introduced back in 2010 in the depths of the aftermath of a financial crisis. But that said that, if you are as the government wanting to not just protect public services, but significantly increase spending on the health service and increase spending on other things in line with the size of the economy, yes, there is a very big hole in the public finances.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/16/keir-starmer-pmqs-treasury-budget-40bn-gap-rachel-reeves-uk-politics-live	2024-10-16T01:31:01-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36898fbb52dc46c781c524bbdee886fc4f7036c5/0_0_3255_1953/master/3255.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c59fd9260bbf4b222e834719ea1fe50

Who are the key New Labour figures in Keir Starmer’s government?	The PM is surrounded by Blairites, from Pat McFadden and Liz Kendall to Jacqui Smith and Jonathan Powell In the run-up to the general election, Keir Starmer was regularly compared to Tony Blair. When they were highlighted by the left, the parallels were often intended as insults. When they came from the Labour right, particularly after the landslide result, they were compliments. Starmer has mirrored Blair so far in his ruthlessness towards his own party, his efforts to build relationships with business and his pursuit of public service reform. But he is also more cautious, less seduced by glitz and more to the soft-left in his own views.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/15/who-are-the-key-new-labour-figures-in-keir-starmers-government	2024-10-15T11:12:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d68930ae43654386d246219f2ce593f320a1b4c/0_99_2416_1450/master/2416.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=07c7edfd954964b124d63e3a44cc756a

Middle East crisis live: UN peacekeepers ‘must never be targeted’; Netanyahu ‘won’t strike Iran nuclear facilities’	Security council says peacekeepers ‘must never be the target of an attack’; Israeli PM reportedly tells US he is willing to avoid strikes on oil or nuclear installations Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. The UN security council has expressed -strong concern- after several UN peacekeepers were wounded when they came under fire in southern Lebanon amid clashes between the Israeli military and Iran-backed Hezbollah militants. The council reiterated its support for the peacekeeping mission’s role in supporting regional security. Italy, Britain, France and Germany released a joint statement on Monday condemning Israel for repeatedly attacking UN peacekeepers. -These attacks must stop immediately,- they said, adding deliberate attacks were against international law. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez said there would be -no withdrawal- of the UN peacekeeping force from southern Lebanon after Israeli attacks and calls to leave. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Unifil’s work -is very important. It’s completely unacceptable attacking United Nations troops.- More than 20 people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Christian town in northern Lebanon on Monday, far from Hezbollah’s power centres in Beirut and the south and east of the country. The bombing struck Aitou, a Maronite village near the northern city of Tripoli, hit a small apartment building, killing 21 people according to the Lebanese Red Cross. The village’s mayor told Reuters that the building had been rented to families displaced by the war. It was also a particularly bloody 24 hours in the Gaza Strip. Four people were killed in an Israeli bombing of a hospital courtyard in central Gaza, another strike on a nearby school used as a shelter killed at least 20 people, and a drone strike killed five children playing on the street in al-Shati camp in Gaza City, according to local health authorities. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports of civilian casualties in the three incidents on Sunday and Monday. At least 42,289 Palestinians have been killed and 98,684 wounded in Israeli strikes since 7 October 2023, the Palestinian health ministry said on Monday. Netanyahu is examining a plan to seal off humanitarian aid to northern Gaza in an attempt to starve out Hamas, according to a report. The plan, proposed by a group of retired generals, would give Palestinians a week to leave the northern third of the Gaza Strip, including Gaza City, before declaring it a closed military zone. Those who remain would be considered combatants – meaning military regulations would allow troops to kill them – and denied food, water, medicine and fuel, according to a copy of the plan given to the Associated Press. The UN’s secretary-general, António Guterres, condemned the -large number of civilian casualties in the intensifying Israeli campaign in northern Gaza-, his spokesperson said on Monday. The UN chief -strongly urges all parties to the conflict to comply with international humanitarian law and emphasises that civilians must be respected and protected at all times,- spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said. Israeli forces shot dead two Palestinians in the northern West Bank city of Jenin on Monday, the Palestinian health ministry said. According to Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, one of the men was 17 years old. Four others were injured by Israeli fire during the raid, it said. Ireland’s foreign minister, Micheál Martin, accused Israel of trying to prevent the world from seeing what its troops are doing in Lebanon and Gaza, and of working to undermine the UN. Asked what Israel’s aim might be in demanding that UN peacekeepers leave their bases in Lebanon after a series of attacks, Martin said: -essentially to drive the eyes and ears out of south Lebanon and to give itself free rein-. Officials from the US’s main humanitarian agency attend daily meetings on an Israeli military base that also hosts a notorious prison for Palestinian detainees where torture reportedly runs rampant, the Guardian has learned.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/15/middle-east-crisis-live-un-peacekeepers-lebanon-israel-gaza-iran-netanyahu	2024-10-14T23:32:03-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd6c3e06cb86c75a8c2792d766bb6d82f7fe6ea7/0_140_4200_2521/master/4200.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d69d15e79bb8d9b976891fef34607998

With Israel expected to retaliate, it is not surprising US has announced it will deploy Thaad missile defence systems As Israel’s conflict with Hezbollah and Iran has escalated, it has begun to show a degree of vulnerability. A Hezbollah drone evaded Israel’s much vaunted air defences on Sunday and struck a military canteen when it was busy with soldiers eating dinner. Four were killed and 58 wounded, seven seriously, at a location 40 miles south of the Lebanese border. The drone that hit the canteen of the Golani base near Binyamina appears to have been part of a synchronised attack that allowed it to elude the country’s well organised air defences. Three drones flew from Lebanon over the Mediterranean, and though they were all initially spotted, and two shot down, the other was able to reach its target.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/14/attacks-by-hezbollah-and-iran-showed-a-degree-of-israeli-vulnerability-what-now	2024-10-14T10:53:55-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3e2a5edb9b1d6f5a99b7450b814f311377e3acf/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=de04f6ccd61b37912884258a24f74861
