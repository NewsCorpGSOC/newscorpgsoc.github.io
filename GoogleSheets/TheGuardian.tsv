Younger people at greater risk of heat-related deaths this century – study	New research estimates a 32% increase in deaths of people under 35 if greenhouse gases not radically cut Extreme heat fueled by the climate crisis is often viewed as primarily a problem for vulnerable segments of the population, such as elderly people. But it is people aged under 35 that are set to suffer the brunt of heat-related deaths as temperatures climb, new research has suggested. While older people are susceptible to heatwaves, they currently make up the bulk of cold-related deaths. As the world heats up, it will be younger people that will suffer disproportionately as the mortality burden shifts, with the new study estimating a 32% increase in deaths of people under 35 years old this century from heat if greenhouse gases emissions aren’t radically cut.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/06/young-adults-heat-related-deaths-climate-crisis	2024-12-06T11:00:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21ae0d10b6a47341f4dad01f77cbd31d2267a63f/0_71_5116_3069/master/5116.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b937bee7f65469fbded1626db3db7f9f

Your smoke detector may be at risk if solar power is turned off during sunny days to protect the grid, experts say	High voltage required to use Aemo’s emergency backstop is a bit like stopping a car by driving into a tree, Vince Garrone says This week’s call by the Australian Energy Market Operator for -emergency backstop- mechanisms to switch off rooftop solar systems brings safety risks, because the high voltages needed exceed the limits that many appliances have safely been tested for. That’s according to Vince Garrone, former power quality manager at Energex, Queensland’s biggest electricity distributor who called the situation ironic. Authorities, in using -brute force- to trip inverters, were creating the very high voltage conditions the device protection was designed to prevent.

Trump defends Pete Hegseth as he announces more administration picks – live	President-elect says embattled defense secretary nominee ‘is doing very well’ and announces new role of ‘White House AI and crypto czar’ Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump announced a slew of new nominations for top administration officials last night, including ambassador to China, head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and a new role of -White House AI and crypto czar-. He also made clear he was sticking by his embattled nominee for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth. Writing on Truth Social this morning, Trump said Hegseth -is doing very well-, even though it remains unclear if key senators will support his nomination to lead the Pentagon. The former Fox News host has spent the past few days on Capitol Hill, trying to win over Republican lawmakers in spite of reports of his excessive drinking, financial mismanagement of two charities, and a sexual assault allegation. Back to the nominations Trump announced last night, former Georgia senator David Perdue will serve as ambassador to China, while tech entrepreneur and Elon Musk associate David Sacks has been appointed to the new crypto czar role – the latest sign that the Trump administration will be much friendlier to the digital asset industry than Joe Biden’s ever was. The US job market remains robust, according to just-released government data that showed the economy added 227,000 jobs in November, and the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%. Joe Biden will deliver remarks from the White House at the 6pm ET performance of -The Eyes of the World: From D-Day to VE Day-, which honors World War II veterans.

Meet the Rees-Moggs: a bluffer’s guide to the family’s weirdness	Just in case you can’t bear to watch the former Tory MP’s new reality show, we equip you for it coming up in conversation Jacob Rees-Mogg’s new reality show may sound as appealing as flushing your entire head down a toilet. Yet Meet the Rees-Moggs (on Discovery+) is such a bewildering piece of television that it may well come up in conversation over the next few weeks. If that’s the case, here’s a handy bluffer’s guide to just how weird the former Tory MP and his family are. Jacob Rees-Mogg’s Somerset home is covered with portraits of Jacob Rees-Mogg. It is so heavily plastered with pictures of him that you will soon lose count. There’s a painting of him as an adolescent. There’s a painting of him mimicking Aaron Shikler’s John F Kennedy portrait. There’s a painting of him standing in front of another painting, which is quite Inception-y of him. The best one, though, is a painting of him that one of his six children is forced to stare at during trumpet practice. Jacob Rees-Mogg is a Greggs nut. Apparently, he says, he buys a ham and cheese baguette and a chocolate eclair for his lunch every day. He says this, however, during the election campaign and then never mentions it again after he loses his seat, so maybe it is simply a wrongheaded attempt to pander to the electorate. Jacob Rees-Mogg is a picky eater. Perhaps the Greggs infatuation is down to his bizarre eating habits. He doesn’t like yellow food, for example, and a member of his household staff points out: -He isn’t a fan of vegetables or onions or anything like that.- Jacob Rees-Mogg describes the same member of staff, a man named Shaun, as someone who -does everything that needs to be done in a busy household-. This includes -making our cider and looking after the Bentley-. His duties also appear to include scrubbing the words -posh twat- off election campaign posters and, in one instance, doing the -wanker- sign at a portrait of Robert Peel. Jacob Rees-Mogg sleeps completely still. As if he was in a tomb, he says. Chilling. Jacob Rees-Mogg quotes his election concession speech all the time. When he lost his seat this year, he quoted Chitty Chitty Bang Bang by saying: -From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success.- He also uses this exact phrase when his dog eats one of his daughter’s sausages off the floor. Jacob Rees-Mogg is sent into apoplexy by the notion of commuting badgers. During his post-election doldrums, and inspired by his daughter’s desire to emulate Carrie Johnson, he briefly entertains the idea of digging a duck pond in his garden. When the planning permission report points out that the pond might disrupt the path of commuting badgers, he throws a little tantrum and gives up. Jacob Rees-Mogg does not pack his own suitcases. Jacob Rees-Mogg has a private chapel. It contains some of his most prized possessions: a fragment of the true cross, a fragment of the crown of thorns and a piece of Thomas More’s hair shirt. It is illegal to buy and sell this sort of item, he says, but not necessarily illegal to buy and sell the containers that they happen to come in. What an unexpected wheeler dealer. Jacob Rees-Mogg is capable of emotion. But only briefly and only if you look hard enough. He doesn’t flinch when he loses his seat, nor does he flinch when the promise of becoming Conservative party chairman is snatched from him at the last minute. But when he Facetimes his daughter shortly after she has been sent to boarding school – something he struggled to adapt to as a child and she clearly isn’t thrilled about either – he very briefly clams up in a very repressed, English, privately educated way. Maybe, buried deep beneath the multiple self-parodic layers he’s constructed around himself, he does actually have a heart. Jacob Rees-Mogg makes his children dress in black tie for dinner on Saturday nights.	https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/dec/06/meet-the-rees-moggs-a-bluffers-guide-to-the-familys-weirdness	2024-12-06T05:00:56-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9655fe9bf50ad84df5b376eecdbe67822a255927/0_13_4240_2545/master/4240.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7cf5ab9cdc0ef0044b98c5c0c2b19376

Save Britain’s Heritage said national policy should consider the embedded carbon linked to a site when considering its future and prioritise reuse of historic buildings amid the climate crisis alongside issues such as preserving important architecture.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/dec/06/call-for-greener-planning-rules-after-m-and-s-london-redevelopment-given-go-ahead	2024-12-06T04:41:40-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/278b382e6b64b47652c4afa33baf569570f6229b/31_383_5438_3265/master/5438.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3ecbdf822a8a01a536355166616cf8b2
First Thing: House Republicans vote to block publication of Matt Gaetz ethics report	Chamber votes 206-198 against release of report into former Florida representative, who resigned from Congress last month. Plus, how climate breakdown can still be avoided Good morning. The House has voted against publishing the ethics committee’s report into allegations of sexual misconduct and potential illegal activities by the former Florida Republican representative Matt Gaetz. On what grounds was it blocked? Gaetz resigned from the House on 13 November, when Trump picked him for attorney general – and the Mississippi Republican Michael Guest, the committee chair, said the panel’s investigative authority ended then. What will Trump do? His team is reportedly developing a peace proposal for Ukraine, sidelining its ambitions for Nato membership and potentially handing Russia significant territory.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/06/first-thing-house-republicans-vote-to-block-publication-of-matt-gaetz-ethics-report	2024-12-06T04:35:17-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd43d5e22f25a6612d3d86b3b24ba4704a5020a9/0_0_2739_1643/master/2739.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6782a4bcd09547b9f570b8bd8beb918b
Russia and Ukraine warily wait for Trump transition … and subsequent peace talks	President-elect’s strategy on ending war is yet to emerge but interviews with Ukrainian officials and Russians suggest a compromise may be hard to find Nobody knows when the talks will happen, or in what city. It is unclear who might be sitting at the table, or what format the discussion will take. But at some point in the coming months, the incoming US administration will likely attempt to negotiate an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Donald Trump takes office in January and with his self-image as a great dealmaker boasted on the campaign trail that he could end the war in 24 hours. Last week Trump appointed the retired army general Keith Kellogg as his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, tasked primarily with ending the war.

Starmer vows to take on ‘blockers’ as Labour council says government housebuilding targets ‘impossible’ – UK politics live	The PM has said he wants 1.5 million homes to be built in England before the next election Good morning. Yesterday Keir Starmer committed the government to six -measurable milestones- – a mixture of some new targets and some existing ones, wrapped up in a package intended to show people that the government is focusing on things that will make a tangible difference to their lives. They are in a Plan for Change which is an implicit admission that the previous headline performance indicators that Starmer said he wanted to be judged by – his five pre-election missions, and his six -first steps for change- – were a bit woolly. One of the new milestones is: Building 1.5 million homes in England and fast-tracking planning decisions on at least 150 major economic infrastructure projects - more than the last 14 years combined. I feel that we are going to be on a collision course with Labour. And it’s not just Labour councils. It’s Liberal Democrats, it’s Conservatives, they’ve all said the same thing. Absolutely, absolutely, over these planning targets. They are absolutely impossible and unrealistic. I know, with trust in politics so low, the public are sceptical of promises made by politicians. And who can blame them, after years of inaction by successive Tory governments. But that can’t be an excuse for low expectations and easy ambitions, a culture that isn’t brave enough to even try for fear of failure. I know some councils have come out this week to challenge our plans for housing reform. I always knew there would be resistance to our planning reform. Let me say this — I won’t shy away from this argument. In fact, I welcome it. Where there are blockers putting the brakes on, it’s a sign you are delivering real change. And change is what the British people voted for this summer — a government that is willing to take on the obstacles and break down the barriers that prevent us from reaching our full potential.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/06/keir-starmer-labour-housebuilding-uk-politics-latest-news	2024-12-06T01:13:40-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b769606c766b22d9f90e8da165eb5801c36e5535/0_0_7179_4307/master/7179.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=914a57f4ae8552501a9e374169a50647

Middle East crisis live: thousands of people flee Homs in central Syria as rebel forces push on	Rebels have captured key cities of Aleppo and Hama, dealing blows to president Bashar al-Assad 14 years after protests erupted across Syria Thousands of people fled the central Syrian city of Homs overnight and into Friday morning, a war monitor and residents said, as rebel forces sought to push their lightning offensive against government forces further south. They have already captured the key cities of Aleppo in the north and Hama in the centre, dealing successive devastating blows to president Bashar al-Assad, nearly 14 years after protests against him erupted across Syria. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of sources in Syria, said 826 people, mostly combatants but also including 111 civilians, have been killed in the country since the violence erupted last week. It marks the most intense fighting since 2020 in the civil war sparked by the repression of pro-democracy protests in 2011. Iran says it conducted a successful space launch, the latest for its program the west alleges improves Tehran’s ballistic missile programme. Iran conducted the launch using its Simorgh programme, a satellite-carrying rocket that had seen a series of failed launches. The launch took place at Iran’s Imam Khomeini Spaceport in rural Semnan province. There was no immediate independent confirmation Friday the launch was successful. Iraqi foreign minister, Fuad Hussein, will meet his Syrian and Iranian counterparts on Friday to discuss the situation in Syria, the Iraqi state news agency said on Thursday. A Hamas official said on Thursday that international mediators have resumed negotiating with the militant group and Israel over a ceasefire in Gaza, and that he was hopeful a deal to end the 14-month war was within reach. Ceasefire negotiations were halted last month when Qatar suspended talks with mediators from Egypt and the US because of frustration over a lack of progress between Israel and Hamas. Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said that he plans to hold talks on Friday with Turkish and Iranian officials on the situation in Syria. On Thursday, Lavrov said Moscow was -very much concerned- with a recent escalation of violence in Syria.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/06/middle-east-crisis-thousands-people-flee-homs-central-syria-rebel-forces-israel-gaza-latest-updates	2024-12-05T23:41:45-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86a3cb871a504d070fc2604e46debbfaf928e9cc/0_298_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a01ab8deeda9eb1b49730b7d1b16936f

Pete Hegseth’s nomination hangs on key senator as more details of drinking emerge – US politics live	Senator Joni Ernst expected to be key to fate of Trump’s Pentagon pick; media reports say Hegseth faced HR investigation over Fox Christmas party antics Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, will be back once again on Capitol Hill today to try to convince Republican senators that he’s the right man to lead the Pentagon. Reports of excessive drinking, financial mismanagement and poor treatment of women, as well as a sexual assault allegation, have dogged his nomination over the past days, with several conservative lawmakers expressing doubts over approving him for the job. But the most important voice in determining his fate has not piped up yet: Iowa’s Republican senator Joni Ernst. The army veteran and sexual assault survivor met with Hegseth yesterday but said little publicly about their talk. Her views on him will be pivotal in determining whether the former Fox News host’s nomination advances, or goes the way of Matt Gaetz. Meanwhile, the New York Times has uncovered more details of incidents Hegseth was involved in while employed by the conservative network. These include another story of him drinking to excess, as well as an incident at a Christmas party eight years ago that led to an investigation from Fox News’s human resources department. We’ll see what Republican senators have to say about that throughout today. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be together in public again at 6pm ET to light the national Christmas tree outside the White House. The pair have not been seen together much since Harris lost last month’s presidential election to Trump. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are heading to the Capitol today to promote the Department of Government Efficiency, their unorthodox, Trump-sanctioned idea to cut spending and downsize Washington’s federal organs. The House committee investigating the attempted assassination of Trump will hear testimony from acting Secret Service director Ronald Rowe Jr, and will also mark up its final report.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/dec/05/trump-hegseth-defense-drinking-us-politics-latest-updates	2024-12-05T06:01:43-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b780f6d71d2b25177f08a1e727674413bdeb0c12/1160_481_3360_2016/master/3360.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dec94b935632b4c6c5acaa8a1f14ada4

Twenty Minnesota ballots went missing in key race that hinges on 14 votes	Race for state house seat, which will determine whether Republicans win control of chamber, separated by 14 votes Twenty ballots went missing in a Minnesota precinct this November, the type of error that would typically result in an internal investigation but not receive much public attention. But the implications are much greater right now, as the race for the district’s state house seat is separated by 14 votes, and that seat will determine whether Republicans win control of the chamber. The missing ballots, which were probably the result of human error, were never counted.

Thursday briefing: What the martial law attempt means for South Korea’s future	In today’s newsletter: Yoon Suk Yeol’s shock declaration – and subsequent reversal – has sent South Korea into political chaos, and left their president facing impeachment Good morning. South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, is facing impeachment after he sent heavily armed forces into Seoul’s streets with his baffling and sudden declaration of martial law on Tuesday. The move stirred memories of past dictatorships in the country, moving thousands to come out on to the streets and protest, with the military powerless, or unwilling, to do anything about it. Opposition parties submitted an impeachment motion hours after parliament unanimously voted to cancel Yoon’s declaration, forcing him to lift martial law just six hours after it began. Impeaching Yoon requires the support of two-thirds of the national assembly and at least six of the nine constitutional court justices. The liberal opposition Democratic party holds a majority in the 300-seat parliament and has called for Yoon’s resignation. A vote on his impeachment could come as early as tomorrow. Today we’ll look at what happened and why. But first, here are the headlines.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/05/thursday-briefing-south-korea-martial-law-first-edition	2024-12-04T22:45:36-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4662818167d8e8775f4e37f88d6a87e40c498a6f/0_72_7432_4462/master/7432.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=073d3a77a2c1d730676487a67fb3f53d

Australia news live: Greens propose new national drug testing regime	The minor party have announced an election policy for the federal expansion of pill testing. Follow today’s news live The Greens’s new election policy for a federal expansion of pill testing would involve the creation of a new drug testing agency. The agency, housed within the federal department of health and aged care, would coordinate and run drug testing sites in capital cities and regional hubs as well as providing free testing services at Australian music festivals. At the moment the biggest danger facing young people using drugs at festivals isn’t the substance itself but a failure of government policy that doesn’t allow people to be able to check what is in that drug and access education and medical services when needed. We have a system designed to criminalise and stigmatise people who take drugs in our community which has led to tragic outcomes. It is time we listen to the community and the experts and implement common sense approaches to minimise harm and risk.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/dec/05/australia-news-live-greens-national-drug-testing-labor-climate-impact-coal-mines	2024-12-04T12:40:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/904a2361b7601c9b4f1175d56d70eab29f34ed37/0_30_2408_1444/master/2408.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d8a2b7351f39f01abec9441decf0635b

South Korea crisis live: President Yoon faces impeachment calls amid martial law outcry	Opposition Democratic party lawmakers call on Yoon Suk Yeol to resign immediately or they would seek his impeachment Welcome to our continuing live coverage of the political crisis in South Korea following President Yoon Suk Yeol’s sudden and short-lived declaration of military law on Tuesday night. Here is a quick summary of recent developments: President Yoon is facing mounting calls to step down after he declared martial law in a surprise, late-night address on Tuesday, a severe measure he said was necessary to safeguard the country’s liberal democracy from -anti-state forces- and -threats posed by North Korea-. Within hours Yoon had backtracked, saying that troops would return to their barracks and the order would be lifted after a cabinet meeting. The main opposition Democratic party has said it will attempt to impeach Yoon if he refuses to tender his resignation immediately. Even Yoon’s own aides have offered to resign -en masse-. Yoon’s martial law order included a six-point decree that banned political activities and parties, -false propaganda-, strikes and -gatherings that incite social unrest-. The order also brought all media outlets under the authority of martial law and directed all medical staff, including striking doctors, to return to work within 48 hours. The move was met with vociferous condemnation and widely defied. Despite the deployment of troops and helicopters on the roof of the parliament building, 190 lawmakers managed to enter the building and proceeded to unanimously vote to reject Yoon’s declaration and call for martial law to be lifted. On the streets, hundreds protested, and chanted for the president to be arrested. To successfully impeach Yoon, a two-thirds majority is required in the legislature. Opposition parties together control 192 of the 300 seats in the national assembly, so would need lawmakers from Yoon’s own party to join them. This the first time that martial law has been declared in South Korea in more than four decades, alarming allies. The United States, which stations nearly 30,000 troops in South Korea to protect it from the nuclear-armed North, initially voiced deep concern at the declaration, then relief that martial law was over. The UK Foreign Office’s minister for the Indo-Pacific, Catherine West, issued a statement, calling for -a peaceful resolution to the situation, in accordance with the law and the constitution of the Republic of Korea-. To many watching from outside, the sudden political chaos appears to have come out of nowhere. But inside South Korea, Democratic party lawmaker Kim Min-seok had warned in recent months that Yoon was gearing up to declare martial law.

More than 90% of people caught with small amounts of illicit drugs criminalised in NSW despite diversion reforms	Exclusive: Police used discretion to divert just 6.9% of people caught with personal use quantities of drugs from criminal justice system, data shows A New South Wales government program that gives police discretion to divert people found with small quantities of illicit drugs away from the courts has only been extended to 6.9% of people caught, including just 2.6% of those who are Indigenous. The major reform by the Minns government came into effect in February this year and was flagged by the attorney general, Michael Daley, as a way to treat drug use as a health issue rather than a criminal one.

White House defends Biden’s pardon as Trump hints at potential clemency for January 6 rioters – US politics live	Spokesperson says president feared political opponents would attack Hunter in future, while Trump speaks supportively about US Capitol attackers The White House said on Monday that president Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter in part to protect him from future persecution from political opponents, but his move drew fierce criticism, with some Democrats saying it undermined public trust in the rule of law. Biden, a Democrat whose term ends on 20 January when Republican president-elect Donald Trump takes office, signed an unconditional pardon for Hunter Biden on Sunday and said he believed his son had been selectively prosecuted and targeted unfairly by the president’s political opponents. Donald Trump seized on Hunter Biden’s pardon to drop one of his strongest hints yet that he intends to grant clemency to at least some of the instigators and participants of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by a mob trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat. -Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years?

Stalking victims to be told perpetrator’s identity, says Jess Phillips	Tougher guidance in England and Wales will also prevent convicted stalkers from contacting victims while in prison Victims of stalking will be given the right to know the identity of the person who is doing it, Jess Phillips, the UK safeguarding minister has said, as part of a wider look at whether legislation connected to the crime is fit for purpose. Under new guidance from the Home Office, police in England and Wales will be told to inform people if they uncover the identity of a stalker, for example one using a series of anonymous online identities.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/03/stalking-victims-to-be-told-perpetrator-identity-jess-phillips	2024-12-03T01:35:28-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed62014c7c961b8db1f006694778cbdf78439070/0_147_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=98d84be93fee1a0a8924e06b45dd4e9f
Jess Phillips announces measures to give stalking victims more protection – UK politics live	Minister for safeguarding unveils measures including ‘right to know’, ensuring police tell victims the identity of online stalkers as soon as they can Good morning. Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, was the government voice on the morning broadcast round. She says she is unveiling six measures to protect the victims of stalking, including -right to know- guidance intended to ensure that the police tell victims the identity of online stalkers as soon as they can. Speaking on Times Radio, Phillips said: I have been a victim of stalking, and I wasn’t told [the identity of the stalker]. I didn’t have the right to know. And in most of the cases of my stalkers, they made it clear who they were as part of their desire to control and frighten me. I’m afraid to say that I’ve had more than one in my life. This was a case raised by Nicola Thorp, where somebody had been stalking her over multiple identities online, and when they said the police told her that they’d found out who it was, they then told her that they couldn’t tell her who it was. And so everybody became her stalker – the person she was sat next to on the street – and already, when you’re living through something as harrowing as somebody stalking you and making you feel frightened and anxious, the idea that then you have to distrust all of the people around you as well just seems like a terrible added burden … and so that is what we’re going to eliminate.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/03/jess-phillips-stalking-protection-measures-violence-women-girls-labour-conservatives-uk-politics-latest-updates	2024-12-03T01:28:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96259a15387bf3a6c9e633b39aa1bed070ec3d51/0_458_7728_4637/master/7728.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=82f9db3d83ed556585d970da54199f2c

Middle East crisis live: ceasefire on edge after deadly Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon	Nine people reported killed as military hits Hezbollah targets while the Iran-backed group fires on IDF positions Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. The ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah is looking increasingly fragile after both sides exchanged fire and accused each other of violating the US-brokered truce less than a week after it came into force. US president-elect Donald Trump demanded the immediate release of Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza, saying that if they are not freed before he is sworn into office for a second term there will be -hell to pay- A wave of airstrikes pummelled hospitals and neighbourhoods in the rebel-held region of Idlib in northern Syria as Islamist insurgents continued to battle forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad after the militants’ lightning assault on Aleppo. At least 18 people were killed and 35 injured, White Helmets civil defence forces based in Idlib said Iranian-backed Iraqi militias crossed into eastern Syria overnight in an attempt to shore up struggling forces loyal to Damascus, battling an insurgency that has swept much of the country’s north-west as Islamist militants seized control of Aleppo. The crisis in Syria is the result of President Bashar al-Assad’s refusal to engage in political dialogue with the opposition, and not external interventions, the Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, said after meeting his Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araghchi, for emergency talks in Ankara The Hamas-led health authority in Gaza has said at least 44,466 Palestinians were killed and 105,358 wounded since Israel’s military offensive on Gaza began after the 7 October 2023 surprise attack inside Israel	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/03/middle-east-crisis-live-ceasefire-israel-lebanon-syria-gaza	2024-12-02T23:49:16-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0bdeef30f484b8e22e91bf998ae25090d6e8689/0_118_4653_2792/master/4653.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=373ad9bb663d4d191a8bb3a28429b192
Tuesday briefing: Why Ireland bucked the trend for punishing incumbent governments	In today’s newsletter: After a general election, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil look set to retain power – how have two main, centre-right parties avoided the kicking seen elsewhere? Good morning. All over the western world, incumbent governments have been given a kicking over the cost of living crisis. But in the Irish election, where the counting of results concluded yesterday, it’s a very different story. Not long ago, Sinn Féin appeared on course to win the popular vote and become the leading party in a new coalition, but its support fell away badly earlier this year. Instead, Ireland’s traditionally dominant parties of the centre-right, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, appear to have it sown up again. Cybercrime | The UK is underestimating the severity of the online threat it faces from hostile states and criminal gangs, the country’s cybersecurity chief will warn on Tuesday. Richard Horne, the head of GCHQ’s National Cyber Security Centre, will cite a trebling of -severe- incidents amid Russian and Chinese aggression. Foreign policy | Keir Starmer has -utterly rejected- the idea that the UK must choose between the United States and Europe when Donald Trump comes to power. In a major foreign policy speech in London, Starmer said the UK would -never turn away- from the US but would continue to -reset- the relationship with Europe. US news | Donald Trump seized on Hunter Biden’s pardon to drop one of his strongest hints yet that he intends to grant clemency to at least some of the instigators and participants of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by a mob trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat. Syria | Iranian-backed Iraqi militias have crossed into eastern Syria in an attempt to shore up struggling forces loyal to Damascus. They are battling an insurgency that has swept much of the country’s north-west as Islamist militants seized control of Aleppo. Television | Gregg Wallace has apologised for dismissing those who have accused him of inappropriate behaviour as -middle-class women of a certain age-. His remarks came after No 10 condemned his initial remarks as -misogynistic-, and as pressure mounted on the BBC to stop broadcasting Wallace’s programmes. Migration is a really difficult issue for them. Sinn Féin are unusual in that they are a leftwing nationalist party. Typically, nationalist parties tend to be on the right and nativist … happy to redistribute money but only to people of a given nationality. Sinn Féin, on the other hand, have quite a socialist economic agenda, which is at odds with that.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/03/tuesday-briefing-why-ireland-bucked-the-trend-for-punishing-incumbent-governments	2024-12-02T22:59:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfc98e3a415b70517e169b3fc2641766d2d4ed08/0_53_7279_4370/master/7279.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c20cc44e86f67b846d8c46b63ccb2312

Moana 2 brought in a tidal wave of moviegoers over the Thanksgiving Day weekend, setting records with $221m in ticket sales, according to studio estimates. That, combined with Wicked and Gladiator II, made for an unprecedented weekend in cinemas. Expectations had been high for Disney’s Moana 2, but the film’s five-day opening set a new record for Thanksgiving weekend. (The previous best was $125m for Frozen 2 in its second week of release in 2019.)

Families and doctors grappling with a crisis that has claimed about 900,000 lives say the move may signal that a second Trump administration will finally get serious about tackling the flow of fentanyl into the US. But they also warn that much more needs to be done to reduce demand for opioids and to rein in the power of the pharmaceutical industry which created the epidemic.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/02/trump-tarrifs-anti-opioid-groups	2024-12-02T04:00:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/405ac68c781d877ebe5f77c81e177736d81708d4/0_74_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0e453f86b6cf390a88aa03e9605886f7

How did Republicans respond? Donald Trump called the decision -such an abuse and miscarriage of justice-. Trump, too, has used executive authority to help a relative – he pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner in 2020. How will Canada secure its border?

UK politics live: Labour under pressure over housing and waiting list targets	Health bosses reportedly concerned about government’s focus while council leaders are said to believe building targets are unrealistic Good morning. Keir Starmer is giving a speech on Thursday and you can tell that it is important because No 10 started briefing on what it is going to say in a news release to journalists sent out on Friday. He is going to announce a -plan for change- that will include -measurable milestones-. In the earlier briefing Keir Starmer said it would be -the most ambitious yet honest programme for government in a generation-. But hang on – hasn’t Starmer announced plenty of -measurable milestones- already? In 2023 he announced five missions, which he said were not just conventional performance targets but part of an attempt to make government more strategic and focused on the long term. The five headline missions all included sub-missions, so arguably there were around 26 targets or pledges in the document. Then, as the election approached, Labour simplified matter by announcing six first steps for change. Health bosses accept the need to focus on the government’s political priority but say ministers will need to accept trade-offs to achieve it. -If the priority is putting all the money into electives, what we will see is warzone A&amp;E departments and all sorts of other things being sidelined,- said an NHS source. -It will have a number of casualties, including mental health, community care and waits in A&amp;E.- Local councils have told the government its flagship plan to build 1.5m new homes in England over the next five years is -unrealistic- and -impossible to achieve-, the BBC can reveal. The vast majority of councils expressed concern about the plan in a consultation exercise carried out by Angela Rayner’s housing department earlier this year. Labour-run Broxtowe council in Nottinghamshire described the proposed changes as -very challenging, if not impossible to achieve-. South Tyneside, another Labour-run council, said the plans were -wholly unrealistic-, while the independent-run council in Central Bedfordshire, said the area would be left -absolutely swamped with growth that the infrastructure just can not support-.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/02/uk-politics-live-keir-starmer-nhs-waiting-lists-housebuilding	2024-12-02T01:26:47-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbbb3b129af7eddfb7bcae46eecfd7ac2802175c/0_138_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=689be9bcdd5019b7e3adb5768eb64183

Monday briefing: How the civil war in Syria reignited	In today’s newsletter: President Bashar al-Assad’s forces were driven from Aleppo over the weekend by a rebel offensive, forcing global attention to turn back to the country • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. Eight years ago, indiscriminate Russian airstrikes helped Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad’s forces drive rebels from Aleppo, the country’s second-largest city. Assad’s victory in Aleppo, once a symbolic stronghold of the Syrian rebellion, relied on a brutal -surrender or starve- strategy that killed thousands of civilians and forced many more to flee. It was seen as a turning point in the country’s civil war, which has largely been in a state of stalemate since 2020. But over the weekend, a stunning rebel offensive seized Aleppo again – leaving the Assad regime facing the greatest threat to its control in years. Yesterday, Syrian and Russian airstrikes pummeled opposition controlled areas in response. Whatever happens next, if the frozen conflict in Syria has become a -forgotten war- as attention has focused on Gaza and Ukraine, it will now be impossible to ignore. US politics | Joe Biden has issued -a full and unconditional- pardon to his son Hunter Biden covering convictions on federal gun and tax charges.

Conspiracy theorist Kash Patel, Trump’s pick to lead FBI, faces Senate blowback	‘Deep state’ critic who has threatened to shut down agency’s headquarters could face tough confirmation battle Donald Trump’s plan to nominate as FBI director the -deep state- conspiracy theorist Kash Patel, a virulent critic of the bureau who has threatened to fire its top echelons and shut down the agency’s headquarters, is facing blowback in Congress as US senators begin to flex their muscles ahead of a contentious confirmation process. Politicians from both main parties took to the Sunday talk shows to express starkly divergent views on Patel, whom Trump announced on Saturday as his pick to lead the most powerful law enforcement agency in the US. The move is dependent on the incumbent FBI chief, Christopher Wray, who Trump himself placed in the job in 2017, either being fired or resigning.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/01/kash-patel-trump-fbi-pick	2024-12-01T10:44:53-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2e7f69f14632dcf1825677e8152d6ca7be0e674/0_199_4676_2807/master/4676.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7c4dbc9957ca0fa552a428350dac94ed

Ex Harrods director says Mohamed Al Fayed used cash bribes to ‘control’ staff	Jon Brilliant says Al Fayed created a culture of fear at the business to ‘mask’ his abusive behaviour A former Harrods director has claimed he was handed envelopes of cash by Mohamed Al Fayed as part of the billionaire’s plan to control and manipulate senior management and cover up alleged incidents of sexual abuse. Jon Brilliant, who worked in Al Fayed’s private office for 18 months, claimed his former boss would sack those he could not control.

Labour urged to take immediate action on palliative care after MPs back assisted dying – UK politics live	Layla Moran, chair of the health and social care select committee said Wes Streeting should be taking a more proactive approach to the issue Liberal Democrat Layla Moran, chair of the health and social care select committee, voted for the assisted dying bill in the House of Commons yesterday. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, she said she has -long believed, especially in the cases of terminally ill adults, that they should have that choice at the end of life-. I’ve been moved by personal experiences, my best friend’s mother contracted cancer about 20 years ago and we lived in Belgium at the time. She started the process but in fact died before she was able to complete the legal part of the process because the cancer was so aggressive. I saw how taking back that little bit of control in her life was important to her. I was disappointed. I was expecting an announcement from Wes Streeting yesterday to say ‘look, we’ve heard and we are going to do something’ … immediate funding commitments and a view to making sure this is dealt with in the next year or two. I would argue that, whether this passes or not, that is one of the key messages that came out of the debate. Those who don’t want an assisted death and don’t want to take part in providing assisted dying can opt out of it, don’t have to do it, don’t choose to end their lives that way. So it offers everyone equal choice, whatever their religion.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/30/assisted-dying-bill-uk-politics-latest-news-kim-leadbeater-labour	2024-11-30T00:44:21-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3e77a13b9f797982fb881d688a8436474ad698c/0_131_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4ac8df8a0b38a1ed458e902b633ef390

Tesla owners turn against Musk: ‘I’m embarrassed driving this car around’	The electric car brand was once a liberal favourite – but the CEO’s embrace of Trump has led to an angry backlash As Elon Musk has embraced Donald Trump and various far-right conspiracy theories, he has left behind an aghast cohort of Tesla owners who suddenly feel embarrassed by their own cars. Many of them are now publicly displaying their dismay at Musk on their vehicles.

Ukraine war live: Russian defence minister says ties with North Korea ‘expanding in all areas’ during visit	Andrei Belousov arrives in Pyongyang for political and military talks; Putin threatens Kyiv with hypersonic missile Photos released by Russia’s defence ministry showed Belousov walking alongside North Korean defense minister, No Kwang Chol, on a red carpet laid out at a Pyongyang airport. According to the AP, North Korean military officials were seen clapping under a banner that read: Complete support and solidarity with the fighting Russian army and people.- Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike Kyiv with Oreshnik missiles, an intermediate-range weapon that Moscow used against the city of Dnipro last week and that Putin has claimed cannot be shot down by any air defence system. It came after Moscow pummelled Ukraine’s energy grid in an attack that left a million people without power. Russia fired more than 90 missiles and about 100 drones during the barrage, according to Kyiv, with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy urging his allies to respond firmly to what he dubbed Russian -blackmail-. Putin said the fresh bombardment was a -response- to Ukrainian strikes on his territory with western missiles. Russian drone attacks on Ukraine injured at least eight people and damaged residential buildings in the capital Kyiv and in the southern Odesa region overnight, officials said on Friday. Ukraine’s air force said in a statement that, of 132 drones launched against the country overnight, it had downed 88 drones, while 41 were -lost-, likely due to electronic warfare, and one returned to the Russian territory. Georgian riot police deployed teargas and water cannon against demonstrators protesting a government decision to delay asking for EU accession, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reporters witnessed. Thousands rallied in the capital Tbilisi and cities across Georgia after prime minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, announced the decision amid a post-election crisis that saw the country’s president challenge the legitimacy of the newly elected parliament and government. Donald Trump’s plan to tap the retired US Lt Gen Keith Kellogg as US envoy to Ukraine and Russia has triggered renewed interest in a policy document he co-authored. It proposes ending the war by withdrawing weapons from Ukraine if it does not enter peace talks – and giving even more weapons to Ukraine if Russia does not do the same.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/29/ukraine-war-live-russian-defence-minister-north-korea-military-vladimir-putin-volodymyr-zelenskyy	2024-11-29T00:38:40-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f9c8a0edaf3f3d8e4e60246c774f905e2cab823/320_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eefa3c77b1f0aa0bb7734f86bcd0cc96

Weather tracker: Indonesia flash floods and landslides leave dozens dead	Rescuers in Sumatra search for people trapped in cars after landslide triggered by torrential rainfall Last week, torrential rainfall across Indonesia’s largest island, Sumatra, triggered flash floods and landslides, causing widespread destruction. Twenty people died earlier this week in four areas in North Sumatra province amid flash floods and landslides. On Thursday morning, another devastating landslide claimed seven more lives. This landslide struck the main access route between Medan, the provincial capital, and surrounding regions, burying vehicles – including a tourist bus – in mud, rocks, and trees. More than 10 people were injured as a result and rushed to the nearest hospital in Medan. Rescue efforts are continuing, with several vehicles still trapped in the debris. North Sumatra’s traffic director estimated that it may take up to two days to evacuate those affected. Flash floods and landslides are a frequent occurrence in Indonesia owing to seasonal rainfall from October to March, caused by the Asia-Australia monsoon circulation system. This phenomenon causes wind to blow from Asia to Australia, bringing increased water vapour and consequential rainfall to Indonesia. Teleconnections such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation can also influence rainfall patterns, with the likely upcoming La Niña phase expected to bring further extreme weather by the end of the year, intensifying the risk of flooding and landslides as sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean drop below average and easterly trade winds strengthen, pushing additional moisture into the region.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/29/weather-tracker-indonesia-flash-floods-landslides-dozens-dead-sumatra	2024-11-29T00:04:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96c6dd4a54edadd20fafb546714e2bed630c07f6/0_37_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5581eef7e0fca0ac384536017b49ef79

First Thing: Canada leaders agree to unite against Trump tariff threat	Deputy PM says ‘we need to be smart, strong and united’. Plus: plastic lobbyists in rear-guard action • Don’t already get First Thing in your inbox? Sign up here Good morning. Canada’s federal government and the premiers of the 10 provinces have agreed to work together against a threat by the US president-elect, Donald Trump, to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian imports, with one official saying the country was already examining possible retaliatory measures. What are tariffs? A tariff is a tax on imports, or foreign goods brought into a country, and paid for by the importing companies. The way that tariffs work, in Trump’s mind, is that high tariffs will incentivize American companies to move their manufacturing from abroad to the US. What did political commentators have to say? Jeet Heer, a writer for the leftwing Nation magazine, said: -Is it too much to ask for a little humility and self-reflection from the people whose strategies failed badly?-	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/28/first-thing-canada-leaders-unite-against-trump-tariff-threat	2024-11-28T03:39:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e4c86eb4f584b05618114fac1cd05239d26ec49/0_154_8606_5167/master/8606.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a6abb2bf61144f53f7b8b02ca466fb24
Daniel Khalife: a fantasist or a player in the world of spies?	The young man who escaped Wandsworth prison offered a mixed picture of ineptitude and threat, according to police At the heart of the Daniel Khalife trial has been the question: is he an amateurish fantasist who convinced himself he was playing a game of chess with spies, or a consequential character in the global world of espionage? The answer, the police have said, is a bit of both. They believed Khalife to be inept in many regards. Khalife’s own barrister, Gul Nawaz Hussain KC, said he was -hapless- and -sometimes bordering on the slapstick- – more Scooby-Doo than 007.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/28/daniel-khalife-a-fantasist-or-a-player-in-the-world-of-spies	2024-11-28T03:15:55-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70d9286b9ae1df4d1c28a8a40f61d5b33c96c8ed/0_30_2443_1465/master/2443.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b00b4025b5739ae2b213bc03f7404185

Net migration falling, latest figures expected to show, as Tories claim it is due to their visa rule changes – UK politics live	Kemi Badenoch gave speech on Wednesday referring to James Cleverly’s 2023 visa rule changes, while government says it is important to tackle causes of high migration Good morning. The latest immigration figures are out this morning, but the political debate about them has already started. They are expected to show net migration figures falling, and the Conservatives say that is because of decisions they took before the general election. They are referring to the sweeping changes to visa rules announced by James Cleverly in December last year. Kemi Badenoch deployed this line at the start of her speech on immigration yesterday, saying: Tomorrow, immigration figures will be released that should show a drop in net migration. This is because of the changes we made in the last year of the Conservative government. The figures we saw for 2023 were astonishing. They highlighted a big problem we must be honest about. Even if we see a decline in tomorrow’s data, the fact is immigration, both legal and illegal, is too high. We want to see net migration coming down, but we have to do so in a way that is tackling the causes of net migration, because if much of net migration has been driven by recruiting workers from overseas, you also have to look at what the impact on the economy would be.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/28/figures-net-migration-expected-falling-conservatives-labour-uk-politics-latest-updates	2024-11-28T01:03:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70649bde267d16e1958aae6630b191bf22f59c17/0_331_5693_3418/master/5693.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c42318f385f554a258bbf49cc5210a1d

Middle East crisis live: Hezbollah says its hands are still ‘on the trigger’ amid uneasy ceasefire	Iran-backed Lebanese militia says it remains ‘fully equipped’ and will monitor Israel’s withdrawal In its first statement since a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah took effect on Wednesday, the Lebanese militia proclaimed -victory- without making any direct mention of the ceasefire. The militia said its fighters -remain fully equipped to deal with the aspirations and assaults of the Israeli enemy- and that its forces would monitor Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon -with their hands on the trigger-. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said the Lebanon ceasefire was the -first ray of hope- in the regional conflict after the -darkness of the past months-. -It is essential that those who signed the ceasefire commitment respect it in full,- Guterres said on Wednesday. He reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. In a sign of how volatile the situation remains, Israeli forces opened fire on a number of cars that attempted to enter what it said was a restricted area on Wednesday. Doubts over whether the ceasefire would hold were widespread on both sides. Supporters of Hezbollah, which has suffered heavy losses since October 2023, celebrated the group’s survival and waved its yellow and green flag across southern Beirut on Wednesday. Iran, Hezbollah’s ally, welcomed the end of Israel’s -aggression- in Lebanon. In Israel, the ceasefire has met a more mixed reaction where rightwingers and residents of Israel’s north have criticised the agreement. Dozens of people gathered outside the Israeli army’s headquarters in Tel Aviv on Tuesday night to protest against the ceasefire. The French government has claimed that Benjamin Netanyahu has immunity from arrest warrants issued by the international criminal court (ICC) for war crimes on the grounds that Israel is not an ICC member. The claim came soon after Netanyahu’s cabinet agreed to a French-backed ceasefire in Lebanon and is in contrast to Paris’s attitude towards last year’s ICC war crimes warrant issued against Vladimir Putin, another leader of a non-member country. Netanyahu said Israel had submitted to the ICC its intention to appeal against the arrest warrants, and demand a delay in their implementation. In a statement from his office, he said: -Should the ICC reject the appeal, this will underscore to Israel’s friends in the US and around the world how biased the ICC is against the state of Israel.- The ceasefire in Lebanon came after Israel launched the heaviest day of raids on Beirut, including a series of strikes in the city’s centre. At least 42 people were killed in Israeli strikes on Beirut and the south of Lebanon before the ceasefire began. Hezbollah also fired rockets into Israel, triggering air raid sirens. In Gaza, the death toll passed 44,282 on Wednesday. Gaza’s health ministry said an additional 104,880 Palestinians have been injured since October 2023. An Egyptian security delegation is reportedly expected to travel to Israel on Thursday to discuss a Gaza ceasefire deal. The US will renew a push for a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory, president Joe Biden said. At least 12 Palestinians, including children and women, were killed in an Israeli strike on a school in central Gaza City on Wednesday, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. A pregnant woman and two other Palestinians were killed in Israeli bombing in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza and Khan Younis in the south on Wednesday, Wafa reported. Two journalists were injured when Israeli forces -opened fire- on a group of journalists covering a border town of Khiam in south-east Lebanon on Wednesday, Lebanon’s National news agency said. A video journalist told AFP that he was shot at while reporting in Khiam and that it was clear that the group were journalists. The Biden administration is reportedly pushing ahead with a $680m arms sales package to Israel. The package includes thousands of joint direct attack munition kits (JDAMs) and hundreds of small-diameter bombs, Reuters reported.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/28/israel-gaza-lebanon-benjamin-netanyahu-hamas-hezbollah-middle-east-crisis-live-latest-news-updates	2024-11-28T00:25:25-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67ec4c3c7f7bfac7e41d7b87f56fbef518be533c/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9c6bb63a05c0d7b49bb26f2ff9fef0a3

Thursday briefing: The Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire brings respite – but for how long, and what comes next?	In today’s newsletter: Behind the celebratory scenes on the streets of Beirut lies a battered, divided country teetering on the brink of becoming a failed state • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. At 4am local time on Wednesday, a ceasefire began between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. By that time, some displaced residents of Lebanon’s devastated south were already on their way back, many of them wondering as they travelled whether the homes they had fled were still there. The pause in hostilities has been broadly welcomed in Lebanon, Israel and beyond, both for those who have been exiled on either side of the border and as a step towards regional stability. There are even some optimistic claims that it might help bring about a ceasefire in Gaza. But as the Lebanon ceasefire begins, a formidable task remains: the reconstruction of a shattered region of a country that is perilously close to being a failed state.

A contract for facial recognition software, worth up to £20m, was put up for grabs last week by a police procurement body set up by the Home Office, reigniting concerns about -mass biometric surveillance-. The Department for Work and Pensions has been using generative AI to read more than 20,000 documents a day to -understand and summarise correspondence- after which the full information is then shared with officials for decision-making. It has automated systems for detecting fraud and error in universal credit claims, and AI assists agents working on personal independence payment claims by summarising evidence. This autumn, DWP started deploying basic AI tools in jobcentres, allowing work coaches to ask questions about universal credit guidance in an attempt to improve the effectiveness of conversations with jobseekers. The Home Office deploys an AI-powered immigration enforcement system, which critics call a -robo-caseworker-. An algorithm is involved in shaping decisions, including returning people to their home countries. The government describes it as a -rules-based- rather than AI system, as it does not involve machine-learning from data. It says it brings efficiencies by prioritising work, but that a human remains responsible for each decision. The system is being used amid a rising caseload of asylum seekers who are subject to removal action, now at about 41,000 people. Several police forces use facial recognition software to track down suspected criminals with the help of artificial intelligence. These have included the Metropolitan police, South Wales police and Essex police. Critics have warned that such software -will transform the streets of Britain into hi-tech police line-ups-, but supporters say it catches criminal suspects and the data of innocent passersby is not stored. NHS England has a £330m contract with Palantir to create a huge new data platform. The deal with the US company that builds AI-enabled digital infrastructure and is led by Donald Trump backer Peter Thiel has sparked concerns about patient privacy, although Palantir says its customers retain full control of the data. An AI chatbot is being trialled to help people navigate the sprawling gov.uk government website. It has been built by the government’s digital service using OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology. Redbox, another AI chatbot for use by civil servants in Downing Street and other government departments, has also been deployed to allow officials to quickly delve into secure government papers and get rapid summaries and tailored briefings.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/uk-government-failing-to-list-use-of-ai-on-mandatory-register	2024-11-27T22:00:35-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdbafee376c2dcd8d17cdcaadfcffac973ec621c/0_130_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b86a5381c13f58ac5e5531798a62b005

‘Stay true to yourself and hit post’: a flashy, absurd night at Australia’s TikTok awards	More than 3m votes were cast for this year’s awards, which went heavy on T-shirt guns and brand activations, but stayed quiet on the government’s proposed social media ban Between them, the Australian online personalities who took the stage at the annual TikTok awards on Wednesday have more than 100 million followers – but if you’re over the age of 30, you probably haven’t heard of any of them. About 3.4m public votes were cast for this year’s TikTok awards, which honour the top creators in categories like beauty, fitness, food, comedy and music. Just about everyone at the invite-only event found fame in a particular niche. Among the online stars in attendance were a quartet of brothers who perform highly choreographed dances in public (160,000 followers), a gay couple who constantly redecorate their home (3.4m followers), and a woman who has built her following on having very long hair (The Aussie Rapunzel, 1.3m followers). Another woman has amassed 1.5m followers by posting videos where she asks strangers if they are currently on their period. These are people who are regularly stopped on the street by fans, and who have so many followers they can make their living from brand deals.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/australia-tiktok-awards-recap-jojo-siwa-winners	2024-11-27T20:44:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd1a50c626698da54310da7f63971dfecb231ea0/772_328_2213_1328/master/2213.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cd04932d7a46bea25abf46b54561b560

Trump transition process raises ‘concerns about corruption’, top senator says – US politics live	US senator Elizabeth Warren says transition agreement between Trump team and White House fails to answer key questions about FBI vetting and security The MOU was supposed to be signed weeks ago, before the election. Trump has already indicated he will sidestep standard transition processes, including, The Guardian has reported, by issuing security clearances to appointees without requiring FBI background checks. In refusing to sign a transition agreement with the DOJ regarding FBI background checks, the incoming Trump administration stands to forgo access to classified information from Biden administration officials. Lawmakers have already raised concerns about key Trump appointees avoiding the standard security clearance process – which will likely arise during senate confirmation hearings early next year. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the incoming Trump and outgoing Biden administrations outlining some terms of the transfer of power departs from the norm in a few key ways, which is raising eyebrows on Washington. The Trump team said the transition will be privately funded and will not utilize -government buildings or technology [...] and will operate as a self-sufficient organization.- Susie Wiles, Trump’s incoming chief of staff said the transition team -has an existing ethics plan-, which she said would be uploaded to the General Services Administration website. Warren called Trump’s use of private funds -nothing more than a ploy for well-connected Trump insiders to line their pockets while pretending to save taxpayers money.- She expressed -concerns of corruption-. There is a fresh flurry of Trump appointments. Among those announced last night were John Phelan, an investor and Trump campaign donor, as his pick for secretary of the Navy, and Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford University health researcher who opposed Covid-19 lockdowns, to head the National Institutes of Health.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/27/donald-trump-transition-us-politics-updates	2024-11-27T06:24:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd455029b6f71b0400472eea9f342ffda3b2158/0_195_3528_2119/master/3528.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b41aa2fb0d8488ba1e6028215148d2e2

‘An emotional wrench’: Smithfield traders absorb news that market is to close	Stunned workers at London meat market first established in 1133 say closure will mean end of a way of life The junction at Cowcross Street marks the place where for centuries cattle were driven daily to London’s Smithfield Market. Nearby Cock Lane is another street name linked to the meat and poultry trade centred here since the 12th century, although some accounts attribute its origin to it being the only licensed place for sex work in the medieval city. Soon these will be among the last vestiges of a truly historic site that was central to London life, feeding the city’s people, dispensing justice as a place of public execution and even, in a shameful chapter from the early 19th century, providing a place where a man wishing to avoid a costly divorce could sell his wife.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/27/an-emotional-wrench-smithfield-traders-absorb-news-that-market-is-to-close	2024-11-27T05:39:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c5c7abf6f9f701e6d903e84f599d65f9dba9df6/0_274_8192_4915/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b8d8322282156a6d159627b801d9a6a7

First Thing: Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire in Lebanon takes effect	Reports of cars heading south inside Lebanon despite Israeli army warning. Plus, record South Korea snowfall Good morning. A highly anticipated ceasefire aimed at ending the 14-month-old war between Israel and Hezbollah officially came into effect early this morning, hours after Joe Biden hailed the -historic- moment. The ceasefire began at 4am in Lebanon after the heaviest day of raids on Beirut, including a series of strikes in the city’s centre, since Israel stepped up its air campaign in Lebanon in late September before sending in ground troops. What does the ceasefire stipulate? The resolution calls for the withdrawal of Hezbollah fighters north of the Litani River – about 18 miles from the Lebanon-Israel border – and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon. What other views does Bhattacharya hold? He has questioned the safety of vaccines, testified against the effectiveness of face masks, and argued that NIH officials should not be involved with scientific policy.

Elusive deer spotted wearing high-vis jacket in Canada: ‘Who is responsible?’	‘Double takes’ as British Columbia mountain community tries to figure out how local animal came to don neon jacket In a town of fewer than 1,000 people, it can be hard to keep a secret. And yet no one in McBride, a mountain community in British Columbia, can figure out how a local deer came to be wearing a zipped-up high-visibility jacket – or why the day-glo-clad cervid has been so hard to track down. The mystery began on Sunday, when Andrea Arnold was driving along the snowy outskirts of McBride on Sunday and witnessed a sight so baffling she slowed her vehicle to a crawl.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/27/deer-high-visibility-jacket-british-columbia	2024-11-27T03:00:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcee92c2b86cfb92aeb86a9cbd1d6447188713f6/0_705_2479_1488/master/2479.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1aa82b637abdba6452c9d20363eaad47

Liz Truss opposes assisted dying bill saying NHS should be ‘protecting lives, not ending them’ – UK politics live	The Telegraph, which first reported Truss’s stance, also said Theresa May and Boris Johnson were against the bill Good morning. We have got PMQs later, which means party politics will probably dominate for much of the day in the chamber, but increasingly MPs are preoccupied with a free vote, non-partisan matter, the vote on the assisted dying bill on Friday. This morning there are at least two interesting developments on that story. Three former Conservative prime ministers are all opposed to the bill, the Telegraph is reporting. The paper has a quote from Liz Truss who says: It is wrong in principle: organs of the state like the NHS and the judicial system should be protecting lives, not ending them. No doubt, as we have seen in Canada, vulnerable people would be put under appalling pressure to end their lives early. The law would be ripe for being exploited by the unscrupulous. MPs should vote this terrible Bill down and instead focus on improving health services. Added to Gordon Brown’s intervention last week, that makes four former PMs opposed to a change in the law. There’s still no word from Rishi Sunak, David Cameron, Tony Blair or John Major … or really from Keir Starmer, for that matter. Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP who has tabled the private member’s bill being debated on Friday, has criticised the MPs who have called for the bill to be voted down to allow time for a full policy review. Four Labour backbenchers are among the seven MPs who have tabled an amendment to this effect. The amendment does not oppose assisted dying in principle. In an interview with the Today programme this morning, Leadbeater said the amendment was -disappointing- because, if passed, it would stop the Commons voting on the substance of the bill. She explained: The route of the private member’s bill is absolutely the right route for taking this legislation through. That means that there can be a free vote by all MPs. It is not a government bill. The government has a neutral position on this and, sadly, the amendment that a handful of MPs have put forward is disappointing in that the public clearly want this debate to take place, and I think we’ve got responsibilities as parliamentarians to make sure that that debate does take place. In terms of time and scrutiny, look, this is not a new debate. This debate has been going on for decades. It’s been going on, as you quite rightly said, particularly in recent years, in no short part to due to high-profile campaigners like Esther Rantzen. But I think we can already see from what’s happened in the last few months, this bill will receive more scrutiny and more discussion and more debate, probably, than any piece of legislation.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/27/pmqs-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-assisted-dying-bill-liz-truss-labour-tories	2024-11-27T01:20:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ac03c9aaf03f4cfbc7d96d74ae5b39629faec31/0_119_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a3d29f36ef9f4f4da03a138da0b229a1

Storm Bert brought heavy rain, gale-force winds and snow across the country last weekend, overwhelming flood defences already described as being in disrepair. Parts of south Wales and south-west England, where a month of rain pummelled sodden towns and villages, fared particularly badly. Middle East | A highly anticipated ceasefire aimed at ending the 14-month-old war between Israel and Hezbollah officially came into effect early on Wednesday morning, hours after Joe Biden hailed the -historic- agreement. The ceasefire officially began at 4am in Lebanon after the heaviest day of raids on Beirut by Israel including a series of strikes in the city centre. Health | Plans to end the deepening crisis in access to NHS dental care are failing, leaving patients unable to get treatment, according to a warning from the National Audit Office. A pledge to provide an extra 1.5m treatments in England this year is in disarray amid falls in both the number of dentists doing NHS work and people receiving help from them. Russia | Russia said it was expelling a British diplomat for alleged spying as tensions between London and Moscow rose after Ukraine starting using British weapons to strike deeper into Russia. The Kremlin has also banned cabinet ministers including Angela Rayner, Yvette Cooper and Rachel Reeves from entering the country under sanctions announced by Moscow’s foreign affairs ministry.

Trump’s return raises questions over future of CIA’s Russian recruitment drive	Intelligence agency has been trying to entice Russians disaffected by invasion of Ukraine but president-elect is likely to want to make an ally of Kremlin For the past three years, the CIA has run an unusually bold outreach programme. It targeted Russians within the country’s government and security services, attempting to turn them into double agents. Slickly produced recruitment videos portrayed cooperation with the US secret agency as the patriotic choice for officials disaffected with Vladimir Putin’s regime and the war in Ukraine. The videos ended with instructions on how to contact the CIA in a secure manner.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/27/trumps-return-raises-questions-over-future-of-cia-russian-recruitment-drive	2024-11-26T21:00:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a5c8800847c763e5fd556ae500a873d38d05d9f/0_0_6304_3783/master/6304.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f97db5a01361a7b47f09da2e89342c8e

Activists slam Biden for pardoning turkeys, not those on federal death row	Advocates against death penalty note president has spared no one from death row but it’s not too late to ‘cement legacy’ Advocates against the death penalty took aim with blistering irony at Joe Biden for pardoning two more Thanksgiving turkeys on Monday – reaching a total of eight fowl reprieved during his presidency – while he has failed to use his powers to grant clemency to anyone on federal death row awaiting execution. -Biden’s days left in office are limited, but it’s not too late for him to spare everyone from federal death row (and cement his legacy for the better),- the Prison Policy Initiative, a group campaigning to end mass incarceration, said in a post on Instagram.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/26/biden-turkey-pardon-federal-death-row-activists	2024-11-26T03:00:14-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2afd530bc023d4fab9b01130fd5cb5258005b45/0_295_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=db0df4122e0f847f9699814b2fb90bc8
Trump adviser accused of seeking payments from would-be cabinet nominees	Boris Epshteyn accused of asking potential administration nominees to pay monthly fee for lobbying president-elect Internal rivalries spilled into public view on Monday as Boris Epshteyn, a top adviser to Donald Trump, found himself at the center of an ouster effort over accusations he asked potential administration nominees to pay monthly consulting fees in exchange for lobbying for them to the president-elect. The maelstrom engulfing Epshteyn suggested that barely 20 days since Trump won the election, the knife-fight culture of the first Trump presidency, in which bitter aides took any opportunity to remove rivals, had returned.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/25/trump-camp-rivalry-boris-epshteyn	2024-11-26T02:57:43-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/670ed51b5d3e91580b81686a820278663f12f9bb/121_62_1538_924/master/1538.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9f74ad09740b6d589f603252f292aaba

Trump officials to receive immediate clearances and easier FBI vetting	Exclusive: president-elect’s team planning for background checks to occur only after administration takes over bureau Donald Trump’s transition team is planning for all cabinet picks to receive sweeping security clearances from the president-elect and only face FBI background checks after the incoming administration takes over the bureau and its own officials are installed in key positions, according to people familiar with the matter. The move appears to mean that Trump’s team will continue to skirt FBI vetting and may not receive classified briefings until Trump is sworn in on 20 January and unilaterally grant sweeping security clearances across the administration.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/26/trump-transition-team-fbi-security-clearances-background-checks	2024-11-26T02:00:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29fff354dd5a1c363e0e62758e9a430d5bce794c/0_206_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fc321fdf6cbddcab715b9a3014857431

Keir Starmer’s jobs plan won’t work because Labour are ducking tough welfare decisions, Tories claim – UK politics live	PM set to unveil what government calls 'biggest employment reforms in generation’ as Tories say he is not making tough calls on sickness and benefits Good morning. Today the government is unveiling what it is calling, in the headline on its overnight press release, the -biggest employment reforms in a generation-. The reforms are intended to tackle the fact that Britain is the only major economy where the employment rate has fallen over the last five years, largely because more people are out of work due to long-term ill health. A white paper called Get Britain Working is being published later, and Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, is due to make a statement in the Commons later. In its overnight briefing, the Department for Work and Pensions has already flagged up numerous initiatives which are in the white paper. Overall, the focus seems to be more carrot than stick. -Our reforms put an end to the culture of blaming and shaming people who for too long haven’t been getting the support they need to get back to work,- Keir Starmer says. But quite a lot of key decisions have been postponed, and at this point it is hard to assess quite how significant, or effective, these meaures will turn out to be. The history of welfare reform is littered with announcements that don’t quite live up to -biggest in a generation- hype. From the broken NHS, flatlining economy, and the millions of people left unemployed and trapped in an inactivity spiral – this government inherited a country that simply isn’t working. But today we’ve set out a plan to fix this. A plan that tackles the biggest drivers of unemployment and inactivity and gives young people their future back through real, meaningful change instead of empty rhetoric and sticking plaster politics. We’re overhauling jobcentres to make them fit for the modern age. We’re giving young people the skills and opportunities they need to prepare them for the jobs of the future. We’re fixing the NHS so people get the treatment and mental health support they desperately need to be able to get back to work. We’re working with businesses and employers to better support people with disabilities and health conditions to stay and progress in work, and it doesn’t stop there. This latest announcement shows that Labour are not prepared to take the tough but necessary choices to bring down the benefits bill. There is no attempt to match the £12bn in welfare savings we promised in our manifesto. They have even dodged the difficult decisions on sickness benefits, which are needed to make the welfare system sustainable in the long term.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/26/keir-starmer-labour-tory-jobs-plan-latest-politics-news-live	2024-11-26T01:12:29-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/396526c1795bdd6274c80e27394d70ceef3e46fb/1710_861_2386_1432/master/2386.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5729f894b4741f76313b9342987af6ed
Russia-Ukraine war live: record number of Russian drones fired overnight	Ukraine’s military shoots down 76 out of 188 weapons with Kyiv coming under attack and critical infrastructure hit in Ternopil Welcome to our coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine with the news that Russia has fired 188 drones into Ukraine, the highest number in a single night. Ukraine’s military said on Tuesday it shot down 76 of the weapons, adding it lost track of 96 of the drones, likely due to active electronic warfare, and five drones headed towards Belarus. The British foreign secretary has said the UK is not sending troops into Ukraine, after Le Monde reported on Monday that France and the UK are -not ruling out- such a move. When he was asked about the report in an interview, David Lammy said the UK’s position had not changed. -We are very clear that we stand ready and continue to support the Ukrainians with training particularly, but there has been a longstanding position that we are not committing UK troops to the theatre of action,- he told newspapers La Repubblica, Le Monde and Die Welt at the G7 foreign ministers’ meeting in Italy. Russian forces are advancing in Ukraine at the fastest rate since the early days of the 2022 invasion, taking an area half the size of Greater London over the past month, analysts and war bloggers say. The war is entering what some Russian and western officials say could be its most dangerous phase after Moscow’s forces made some of their biggest territorial gains. -Russia has set new weekly and monthly records for the size of the occupied territory in Ukraine,- independent Russian news group Agentstvo said in a report. The Russian army captured almost 235 sq km (91 sq miles) in Ukraine over the past week, a weekly record for 2024, it said. Ambassadors from Ukraine and Nato’s 32 members will meet on Tuesday in Brussels over Russia’s firing last week of an experimental hypersonic intermediate-range missile. Russia on Thursday carried out a strike on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro which President Vladimir Putin said was a test of its new Oreshnik missile. But, according to the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency, expectations are low for any major results from the consultations on Tuesday afternoon at the alliance’s Brussels headquarters. The most that is expected is a reiteration of Nato’s earlier insistence that Moscow’s deployment of the new weaponry will not -deter Nato allies from supporting Ukraine-. A new Nato mission located in Wiesbaden will take over the coordination of western military aid for Ukraine in January, Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said on Monday. The setting up of NSATU – Nato Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine – has been months in the planning and is widely seen as an effort to safeguard the aid mechanism against interference by Donald Trump. Europeans will step up military support for Ukraine, Pistorius pledged, after talks in Berlin with his British, French, Italian and Polish counterparts. -Our target must be to enable Ukraine to act out of a position of strength,- Pistorius said after hosting a meeting of the five leading nations in European defence.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-record-russian-drones-ukraine-kyiv-nato	2024-11-26T00:44:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c85b1351e1c2e49101a28111624134ea7c2207e/0_210_4220_2533/master/4220.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4a1a5ce9f8438d445a72e6272b9f7736

Tuesday briefing: Why everyone’s suddenly worked up about ‘non-crime hate incidents’	In today’s newsletter: A police visit to a Daily Telegraph columnist about a tweet unleashed a barrage of coverage – but the story is more complicated than it appears • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. A journalist visited by police over an erroneous tweet. A barber accused of racism over a dodgy haircut. And someone in Warwickshire reported for refusing to shake hands. These are some of the examples cited in recent days in an escalating media storm over -non-crime hate incidents- recorded by police. The problem, frequently laid at the door of the woke mob, is so catastrophically vexing that former Conservative MEP and Daily Telegraph columnist Daniel Hannan declared it evidence of -the bleak reality of our DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] police state-. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, has now said that the police should apply a -common sense and consistent approach-, an apparent nod to the criticisms of how the system works. And there are some reasonable objections to the status quo. But there are also important reasons for its existence that have very little to do with haircuts or handshakes. Unemployment | Teenagers will get training at the Premier League, Royal Shakespeare Company and Channel 4 in a government drive to get hundreds of thousands into jobs or education. The scheme is part of a suite of changes to the welfare system and out-of-work support being announced today. US politics | Donald Trump said on Monday he would sign an executive order imposing a 25% US tariff on products from Mexico and Canada. He said the tariffs would only be lifted if Mexico and Canada clamp down on migrants and illegal drugs crossing the border, and promised an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports. Storm Bert | Forecasters, environment officials and politicians have been criticised over the warnings issued before Storm Bert and the fitness of flood defences to cope with increasingly common extreme weather. The Met Office defended its work, saying that the storm was -well forecast, 48 hours in advance-. Regulation | Britain’s financial sector watchdog is -incompetent at best, dishonest at worst-, according to a damning report by MPs and Lords which called for a big shake-up. An examination of the Financial Conduct Authority found -very significant shortcomings- after a series of financial scandals. Health | Weight-loss drugs can reduce the risk of worsening kidney function, kidney failure and dying from kidney disease by a fifth, according to a study. Compared with placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists like Ozempic reduced the risk of kidney failure by 16% and the worsening of kidney function by 22%, Victim-led hate reporting has had significant and important positive impacts for police, and communities, in diagnosing harm, extremism, and failing integration or community-cohesion efforts … We all know that recording rules can be complex, but they should not be a concern to a victim at their time of distress.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/26/tuesday-briefing-why-everyones-suddenly-worked-up-about-non-crime-hate-incidents	2024-11-25T22:57:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39ed9cf6cf7349a2cc382a02b9c05af036683716/0_4_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2b19407d555432baa586b9a44ca5a829

First Thing: Amazon workers in 20 countries to protest or strike on Black Friday	Organizers demand better workers’ rights and climate action. Plus, Israeli killing of journalists in Lebanon could be war crime, experts say Good morning. Thousands of Amazon workers are expected to protest or strike in more than 20 countries during Black Friday and Cyber Monday to agitate for better workers’ rights and climate action. What are organizers saying? Christy Hoffman, the general secretary of UNI Global Union, said: -Amazon’s relentless pursuit of profit comes at a cost to workers, the environment and democracy.- Amanda Gearing, a senior organiser at GMB, said: -Amazon represents everything that is broken about [the UK’s] economy. Insecure work, poverty wages and often unsafe working conditions.- How has Amazon responded? A spokesperson said -we’re always listening and looking at ways to improve- but insisted -we remain proud of the competitive pay, comprehensive benefits, and engaging, safe work experience we provide our teams-. What’s the humanitarian toll of the war? After the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed 1,200 people and during which 250 were taken hostage, Israel has bombarded the territory with airstrikes and a ground invasion. Infrastructure has been decimated, the population displaced multiple times and brought close to starvation, and more than 44,000 people have been killed, according to Gaza health officials, with the UN Human Rights Office verifying nearly 70% were women and children. The death toll is understood to be an underestimate, with the UN estimating in May 2024 that more than 10,000 people’s bodies were under the rubble.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/25/first-thing-amazon-workers-in-20-countries-to-protest-or-strike-on-black-friday	2024-11-25T03:01:38-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/790030147e5024cf1e7fdea590366841b7bfae61/0_385_5500_3299/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a0933849f1e1972a00ff4f787b068303

UK politics live: vote on assisted dying bill impossible to predict, says minister	Jess Phillips says ‘we do not know how this vote is going to go’ with the views of many MPs still unclear Good morning. There is plenty happening today. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, and Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, at both speaking at the CBI conference, where the CBI chief executive Rain Newton-Smith is warning about the impact of the budget on business. Keir Starmer is hosting a meeting at Downing Street about plans to protect women from spiking. -My government was elected on a pledge to take back our streets, and we will never achieve this if women and girls do not feel safe at night,- he says. There will be tributes to John Prescott in the Commons this afternoon. But one issue is going to dominate the week, the vote on the assisted dying bill on Friday, and already that is a big topic of discussion. Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, has been giving interviews this morning and she told the Today programme this morning she is finding it impossible to predict if the bill will pass the second reading vote. She said: We do not know how this vote is going to go. I literally couldn’t call it for you at the moment … Each week I think a different thing. Last week I thought it wouldn’t [pass]. This week I think it might. Honestly, I’ve learned over the years not to try and second guess parliament. I should underline that these figures are *not* a prediction of the vote, but an interesting look at the direction MPs are leaning With 291 MPs not stating a view at the time of writing, the vote very easily could go either way A source close to the MPs campaigning in favour of legalisation told The Telegraph: -If all the MPs who have said they support the Bill turn out and vote for it, then it will pass.- She will make the decision about how she votes on assisted dying on a matter of conscience, just exactly like I will. How she comes to that and what moral code she uses to come to that will be exactly the same as the moral code that I use to come to that decision as well … I think that Shabana is making a decision on what she thinks is best for her constituents, like every constituency MP.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/25/uk-politics-live-assisted-dying-bill-labour-conservatives-starmer-reeves-badenoch	2024-11-25T01:02:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d467eb782da585015bad5c7cb58331d66ab8cd1/0_260_2939_1763/master/2939.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a11de454bc86f97a38da1c55828781f1

Follow today’s news live The government has rejected the Greens’ latest compromise offer to pass the Help to Buy housing bill, continuing the long-running stand-off into the parliament’s final week for 2024. Government sources said the Greens’ demands would be variously unlawful, unhelpful or require spending Labor saw as wasteful. The government is now challenging the Greens to back the Help to Buy bill anyway, still not budging on any demands – with a final vote in the Senate scheduled for tomorrow. Clare O’Neill has today said: This continuous charade from the Greens has to stop. You get the distinct impression the Greens want Australians to continue to be in housing distress, so Adam Bandt can try to harvest those grievances into votes. It’s the crassest form of politics there is, straight out of the Peter Dutton playbook. The Greens are offering Labor an opportunity to announce the construction of 25,000 social and affordable homes, helping over 60,000 people into affordable homes in the middle of a housing crisis, why on earth would Labor block that? Consistently throughout this Parliament, the Greens have blocked and delayed action on the housing crisis, looking for every excuse to vote down legislation which is clearly good for the country.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/nov/25/australia-politics-live-labor-coalition-greens-housing-help-to-buy-question-time-peter-dutton-anthony-albanese-social-media	2024-11-24T12:26:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/860d8e54cd799726e1431f63866e805a23c75a1e/0_139_4168_2501/master/4168.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42d0ed196ec56acae48079aeecf51245

Russia-Ukraine war live: French foreign minister says there should be ‘no red lines’ in supporting Ukraine	Jean-Noël Barrot says western allies should not put any limits on support for Ukraine against Russia but does not confirm if French weapons have been used Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, has told the BBC in an interview that western allies should not put any limits on support for Ukraine against Russia, and -not set and express red lines-. Ukraine’s air defence units destroyed more than 10 Russia drones that were targeting Kyiv in an overnight drone attack, Ukraine’s military said on Sunday. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries as a result of the attack. -The UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) were flying in different directions towards Kyiv,- Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, said. -The air raid alert in the city lasted for more than three hours.- Ukraine’s air defences downed 50 of 73 Russian drones launched overnight, the Ukrainian military said this morning. In a post on Telegram, the air force said it lost track of 19 drones and four more are still in the air. Russia’s air defence systems destroyed 34 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 27 over the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, Russia’s defence ministry said. Russian media is reporting that colonel general Gennady Anashkin, the commander of the southern grouping, had been removed from his command, for giving misleading reports about the progress of the war. There has been no official confirmation from the Russian ministry of defence. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan will discuss the latest developments in the war with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, on Monday during his visit to Ankara, a Turkish official. They are expected to discuss the removal of defence procurement obstacles between Nato allies and the military alliance’s joint fight against terrorism. Ukraine has lost over 40% of the territory in Russia’s Kursk region that it rapidly seized in a surprise incursion in August as Russian forces have mounted waves of counter-assaults, a senior Ukrainian military source told Reuters. The source, who is on Ukraine’s general staff, said Russia had deployed about 59,000 troops to the Kursk region since Kyiv’s forces swept in and advanced swiftly, catching Moscow unprepared two and a half years into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. -At most, we controlled about 1,376 square kilometres (531 square miles), now of course this territory is smaller. The enemy is increasing its counterattacks,- the source said.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/24/russia-ukraine-war-live-french-foreign-minister-says-there-should-be-no-red-lines-in-supporting-ukraine	2024-11-24T00:41:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae7e93f0855289bd2d1364edf46721258b04a834/0_73_2347_1409/master/2347.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=224cbf28411e15721ea87fac5ed84634

Trump depends on the EU and UK to act as peacemakers more than he thinks	The US doesn’t need to spend more on Ukraine.

What does he really mean when he promises to -build a wall-? When he pledges to end the Russo-Ukrainian war in one day? His supporters say they don’t take him literally but seriously – but who decides what -serious- is? The very ambiguity can be part of Trump’s appeal. There’s something exhilarating in the sense one is in an exclusive negotiation with the president to define reality.

Revealed: Home Office ‘completely lost grip’ at notorious Manston asylum centre	Court documents contain admissions by officials that they were unable to control the situation at the Kent facility where 18,000 asylum seekers were illegally detained Home Office officials have admitted that -we completely lost our grip- on the situation at a notorious asylum processing centre that led to 18,000 people being unlawfully detained in horrific conditions.

Arrest warrants for Israeli leaders marks pivotal moment in international law | Beth McKernan	Charges against Israeli prime minister and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant mark first time western-affiliated leaders have been targeted for war crimes The international criminal court’s decision to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders over the war in Gaza has been welcomed by Palestinians as a landmark moment in their decade-long fight to challenge the Israeli occupation through international institutions.

The melting snow and the heavy rain could lead to localised flooding in places but the wettest spots would be Wales, in the south-west, particularly over south-facing hills, that’s where we’re likely to see gales and certainly the risk of impacts from wind as well as from rain.-	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2024/nov/23/storm-bert-live-met-office-warns-of-multiple-hazard-event-with-snow-ice-and-flood-warnings-for-uk	2024-11-23T00:46:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af6585a2b86765fbb14dff4162ed98fbd8ddcbfd/1287_588_6699_4019/master/6699.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a3ac29646c33507f9fac7ef17c13c40a

Will the Ukraine missile crisis change the course of the war?	While Putin conducts his missile diplomacy, restrictions around the use of long-range weapons may help Kyiv In Kyiv, as autumn turns fast turns to winter, Ukrainians in the government describe a vacuum before the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House on 20 January that will be filled by more war as both sides jockey for advantage. -Trump has said he wants to end the war within 24 hours. Nobody is more interested in this topic than Ukraine,- a senior official told the Guardian. -But the problem is, for the moment, everything is just speculation. Will it be the first peace plan, the second plan, the first variant, the 10th variant?- they said. Ukraine is in -a difficult but not catastrophic position- and has little choice but to fight on and perhaps show Trump that backing Kyiv is not a losing bet.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/23/will-the-ukraine-missile-crisis-change-the-course-of-the-war	2024-11-23T00:00:36-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc03c281adec9310608cc2445492310cff4a450f/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7522a6632c4cb9142ce72387141a21f7

Dua Lipa’s pickle drink is latest twist in growing appreciation for ‘dirty’ cocktails	Brine from pickled onions, beetroot, pickles and even oysters is now a fixture on bar menus across the UK If Donald Trump has ruined Diet Coke for you, perhaps the answer is following Dua Lipa’s lead. In a now viral video, the pop star empties the best part of a can of it into a cup filled with ice. To this she adds the brine from a tub of pickles, followed by the brine from a tub of jalapeños. Using both hands, she sips it like it’s hot chocolate. It may seem like the latest in a series of drinks-based social experiments that only the most successful and famous can get us to try (see Tom Hanks’ Diet Cokagne, or Diet Coke and champagne). But in truth it seems the singer is on to something. Over the past few months, when it comes to cocktails, there’s been a notable uptick in all things salty and filthy.	https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/23/dua-lipa-new-drink-shows-growing-trend-for-dirty-cocktails	2024-11-22T22:00:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd475e516355aa8781ee59c19269c490c6bdbd80/0_196_6700_4020/master/6700.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=acd6f326695aa45638a6286303caed71
