Trump’s order targeting pro-Palestinian protests mirrors rightwing blueprint	New fact sheet bears similarity to Heritage Foundation’s Project Esther, which aims to quash US support of Palestine Critics warn that a new executive order from Donald Trump’s administration purporting to -combat antisemitism-, and a corresponding fact sheet suggesting deporting international students who protest Israel, could chill political speech on campuses.

Dogged by a catalogue of eyebrow-raising past statements about Russia, Ukraine and Bashar al-Assad, accusations of parroting Kremlin talking points, and a lack of experience in intelligence (not even having sat on a relevant congressional committee), Gabbard was always a counterintuitive choice to sit atop the 18 US spy agencies and their roughly 70,000 employees.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/01/tulsi-gabbard-edward-snowden	2025-02-01T06:00:46-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/327085081fb9288632cdf9c59c8f25c3429a7995/0_103_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dbb16fe05385974d991cedf3fb665dd2
Portland police chief apologizes to mass shooting victims falsely said to be armed	Investigation first published by the Guardian proved volunteers at 2022 Black Lives Matter protest were unarmed The chief of police in Portland, Oregon, acknowledged this week that the force had misled the public about a deadly attack on traffic-safety volunteers before a Black Lives Matter protest in 2022, by wrongly telling the media that the gunman had been confronted by -armed protesters-. In fact, as a visual investigation by the research group Forensic Architecture first published by the Guardian last year showed, the traffic-safety volunteers at the 19 February 2022 protest were unarmed, and trying to de-escalate the rightwing gunman when he opened fire.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/01/portland-police-chief-apologizes	2025-02-01T06:00:45-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13229d7788d2cd14a13b646e47a19e93a09df1ff/0_92_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e5a65e42cb2fd09d2c93d3439faa6974

‘Vicious cycle’: far-right parties across Europe are inspiring imitators	Hardline agendas, especially on immigration, are copied by mainstream conservatives in vain effort to win back votes Far-right parties could become the largest force on the right in Europe within a decade, experts have said, as mainstream conservative parties look to copy their hardline agendas, especially on immigration, in a vain effort to win back votes. Germany’s conservatives last week sparked fury when their leader, Friedrich Merz, the country’s likely next chancellor, broke a longstanding pledge by relying on far-right votes to adopt a non-binding motion urging a drastic immigration crackdown. The leader of Alternative für Deutschland, Alice Weidel, hailed -a historic day for Germany- as the Bundestag, for the first time in its history, passed a vote with the backing of her party, which is second in the polls weeks before this month’s elections.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/01/vicious-cycle-far-right-parties-across-europe-are-inspiring-imitators	2025-02-01T05:23:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4915bc32566be05f06e4d18bcc20b5a5fc357434/0_407_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4bacd9be57590359b3fb0dbc2cebcff1

Trump baselessly blames ‘diversity’ and Democrats for deadly DC plane crash | First Thing	Sixty-seven people die in deadliest US air tragedy since 2001. Plus, Israeli-Hamas deal leads to release of eight hostages and 110 prisoners Good morning. Donald Trump used the plane crash in Washington DC to attack his political enemies, claiming Democrats were responsible for declining standards in air traffic control and that the disaster -could have been- caused by diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies at the Federal Aviation Administration. What details have emerged about the passengers? As many as 14 figure skaters and coaches were onboard the plane, as well as other Americans and citizens of several other countries. How did Democrats respond to Trump’s rant? Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic House minority leader, said Trump used the collision to -peddle lies, conspiracy theories, and attack people of color and women without any basis whatsoever-. He continued: -Have you no respect for the families whose lives have been turned upside down?- What is the death toll of the war? At least 47,460 people have been killed in the Israeli offensive, according to Gaza health officials, but a study published in the Lancet says the true number is about 41% higher. How many hostages have been released?

Tory bid to celebrate Brexit anniversary marred by spat between Badenoch and Patel over party’s migration record – UK politics live	Kemi Badenoch issues rebuke to Priti Patel after former home secretary defends rise in migration since Brexit Good morning. It is five years to the day since the UK left the European Union. Despite complaints from some of the pro-Brexit papers, Keir Starmer and the government are not planning anything today to mark the occasion – which is not surprising because polling suggests only 11% of the population believe that it has been a success, and most people know think that, when voters followed the advice of Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Nigel Farage, they made a mistake. Still, in some parts of British politics Brexit has long ceased being a policy option, and become more of a cult, and some supporters of Brexit have been marking the anniversary with statements defending the policy. But, in the Conservative party, that has all gone a bit haywire. Five years ago today, the Conservatives honoured the democratic will of the British people and Got Brexit Done. Since then, our country has reaped the benefits—securing new trade deals with dynamic, fast-growing markets across the world and reclaiming sovereignty from Brussels. This has allowed us to reform or revoke 2,500 EU laws, ensuring Britain’s future is shaped by our own parliament.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/31/brexit-politics-tory-kemi-badenoch-priti-patel-keir-starmer-live-latest-news	2025-01-31T01:29:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f249e0eab725ff7f432527f7c52516c5a820164/33_459_2315_1389/master/2315.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e01c6fb84ff41eec33067680e6ee257f

The Bureau of Investigative Journalism has previously uncovered a host of failings in the government’s handling of outbreaks of drug-resistant salmonella, particularly that linked to supermarket chicken from Poland. Illnesses connected to the outbreaks – which also affected eggs – peaked at different points between 2020 and 2024, while border checks that were supposed to be in place post-Brexit were being repeatedly delayed.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/31/delays-to-post-brexit-border-checks-diseased-chicken-uk	2025-01-31T01:27:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2532e2d438c6dcf85049779fbbdd10fd55db9d2/0_229_4689_2813/master/4689.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eea0a65fe02408ed0e738babb43d79a5

Washington DC plane crash live: flight data and cockpit voice recorders recovered, officials say	National Transportation Safety Board announces recorders are now at a lab for evaluation; operation to recover bodies continues Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Wednesday’s night’s collision between a regional passenger jet and a military helicopter near Washington DC’s Reagan airport. The flight data and cockpit voice recorders have been recovered from the American Airlines flight, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has announced, and they are now at the NTSB’s labs for evaluation. With the 67 people aboard both the American Airlines flight and the army Black Hawk helicopter all presumed dead, the collision is being called -the deadliest aviation disaster- in the US since 2001. At least 28 bodies have been recovered from the Potomac River, with recovery operations ongoing. A day before Wednesday night’s midair collision near Reagan airport, a different jet there had to abort its landing and make a second approach after a helicopter appeared near its flight path, the Washington Post reported. The US army saw an increase in very serious aviation incidents during the last fiscal year, with 15 flight and two ground incidents that resulted in deaths of service members, destruction of aircraft, or more than $2.5m in damage to the airframe, the Associated Press reported, Donald Trump and members of his administration claimed, without evidence, that diversity efforts at the FAA under the Biden and Obama administration could be to blame for the crash, with Trump specifically claiming that the FAA had been accused of being -too white,- and suggesting efforts to hire Americans with disabilities were irresponsible. Trump signed an executive order that rolls back diversity initiatives to stop -woke policies- in federal aviation.

Israel-Gaza war live: three Israeli and five Thai hostages to be released under ceasefire deal	Israel will reportedly free 110 Palestinian prisoners in exchange; Unrwa likely to close in face of Israeli ban Three Israeli hostages are to be released on Thursday under the terms of the ceasefire deal with Hamas have been named as Arbel Yehoud, 29, Agam Berger, 20, and Gadi Mozes, 80. Five Thai nationals will also be released, although their names have not been publicly released. In exchange, Israel will free 110 Palestinian prisoners, including 30 minors, according to NGO the Palestinian Prisoners’ Club. The main UN agency serving Palestinians in the occupied territories, including Gaza, looks set to be shut down on Thursday as Israel defied widespread international support for the agency in a move Unrwa predicted would -sabotage Gaza’s recovery and political transition-. Ahmed al-Sharaa, the former leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist rebel group which led the military operation to topple Bashar al-Assad last month, has been appointed president of Syria for a -transitional period-. Al-Qaida’s affiliate group in Syria, Hurras al-Din, has announced its dissolution just weeks after the regime of Bashar al-Assad was toppled by Islamist group HTS. US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff visited Gaza on Wednesday, then met with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The US envoy met with Netanyahu alone for more than two hours, an Israeli official said, before they were joined by other ministers. An Israeli government spokesperson and the White House official declined to provide any details on Witkoff’s visit to Gaza, which Israel’s public broadcaster Kan said included an inspection of the Netzarim corridor. An Israeli airstrike on Wednesday killed at least 10 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said, in an attack which the Israeli military said targeted armed militants. The airstrike was in the area of Tubas, in the northern West Bank, the Palestinian Red Crescent said. Turkey on Wednesday condemned an Israeli strike that killed three of its citizens who attempted to illegally cross from Lebanon to Israel. -It has been learned that the three Turkish citizens, with whom contact had been lost while attempting to cross illegally from Lebanon to Israel, lost their lives as a result of an Israeli airstrike in the region,- the foreign ministry said in a statement. Egypt’s president rejected on Wednesday a suggestion by President Donald Trump that Palestinians from the war-torn Gaza Strip be moved to neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, saying it would undermine the idea of an independent Palestinian state and that an influx of refugees could destabilise his country. In his first public comments on Trump’s suggestion, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said -there are historical rights that cannot be ignored- and called the idea -an injustice- to which Egypt would not be party. The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Mirjana Spoljaric, told the UN general assembly that -respect for international humanitarian law is in crisis- and -threatening the very humanity that these laws seek to preserve-, citing the situations Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank. The official death toll in Gaza since Israel launched its war on the territory after the 7 October attacks now stands at 47,417, according to the territory’s ministry of health. In its latest daily update, the ministry added that the latest figure for people injured was 111,571.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/30/israel-gaza-war-live-israel-thai-hostages-palestinian-prisoners-unrwa-ceasefire-latest-news	2025-01-29T23:56:53-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/257b3c0b5961f0d9a9d4e90e0a1e21ab07b9af53/0_106_7524_4514/master/7524.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0ce654e2fd485ba569fbcbd0d77a1f5a

Trump repeats false claim that US sends condoms to Gaza	Claim was first made in press conference, prompting Fox host to say condoms were also being used to bomb Israel Speaking at the White House on Wednesday, Donald Trump boasted that his administration had -stopped $50m being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas-, doubling down on a claim first made by his press secretary which appears to be contradicted by the facts. As the Guardian reported on Tuesday, a comprehensive report issued in September by the US Agency for International Development (USAid), not a penny of the $60.8m in contraceptive and condom shipments funded by the US in the past year went to Gaza. In fact, the accounting shows, there were no condoms sent to any part of the Middle East, and just one small shipment, $45,680 in oral and injectable contraceptives, was sent to the region, all of it distributed to the government of Jordan.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/trump-condoms-gaza	2025-01-29T14:00:24-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92b42eb45b1dbe07f920f3d17a9dd77304fd3108/681_251_4094_2457/master/4094.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=af701592f6c502cf2c383ae8e2139795

Trump moves to gut government by offering to buy out 3m federal workers | First Thing	Memo says aim is to retain only those employees who are ‘reliable, loyal, trustworthy’. Plus, 85% of Greenlanders reject US advances Good morning. The Trump administration has offered buyouts to almost all of the roughly 3 million people who work for the US government if they leave their jobs by 6 February in exchange for seven months’ salary, as the White House attempts to gut the civil service. What are the details? The email had the same subject line – -Fork in the road- – as one sent by Elon Musk to employees at Twitter in 2022 when he bought the social media platform. It asked interested workers to reply with the word -Resign-. How did the employees’ union react? The American Federation of Government Employees denounced the offer. It said it was an effort to pressure workers who are not considered loyal to the new administration to leave their jobs – which could cause upheaval in federal programs. What do we know about the death toll so far? Local officials counting casualties into hospital tents said at least 38 were feared dead while other officials and doctors have given death tolls ranging from 15 to 50.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/first-thing-trump-moves-to-gut-government-by-offering-to-buy-out-3m-federal-workers	2025-01-29T04:21:59-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d257fbebf1ad95256ab043fdfe15c3aeea51df0/0_2_4001_2400/master/4001.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=425e446bdc554dc41dc5d5344619ea40

And no wonder, because she is hoping that it will do almost as much work, politically at least, as a budget. Although she has not had to unravel the mega, £25bn tax raising package she announced in October, it suppressed business confidence more than she expected and there now seems to be a Westminster consensus that she included a bit too much gloom powder in the cake mix.

Wednesday briefing: The problems, perils and precedent of ‘cleaning out’ Gaza	In today’s newsletter: After Donald Trump’s remarks, renewed alarm about what will follow the first phase of the ceasefire Good morning. Donald Trump presented his proposal as one rooted in a concern for the safety of Palestinians: it was time to find many of the residents of Gaza somewhere else to live. -I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing at a different location where they can maybe live in peace for a change,- he said. -You’re talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing and say: ‘You know, it’s over.’- That was more than stream of consciousness: Trump doubled down on his comments on Monday. But the idea of -cleaning out- Gaza is not welcomed by the Palestinians who live there – or the countries that Trump has in mind as their new home. And if they were to be forced to leave after Gaza was devastated by the Israeli military, it would appear to be a clear case of ethnic cleansing.

Louvre’s decision to move Mona Lisa is a misguided act of snobbery	Crowds give life to the Paris museum and the painting is a silent, compelling mystery at the heart of the hubbub What a wonderful headache for a museum to have. The Louvre in Paris gets so many visitors it is taking drastic measures to cope, which include moving its most famous treasure to a dedicated space where fans can visit without entering the main museum at all. It will no longer suck the oxygen from other art. Nearly 9 million visitors a year stream through the Louvre and it’s believed 80% of them are looking for Leonardo da Vinci’s portrait of Lisa Gherardini del Giocondo, better known as La Gioconde, better still as the Mona Lisa. I’m worried the Louvre is trying to solve a problem that is not really a problem. Ask Britain’s museums if high visitor numbers are a bad thing: they still haven’t recovered their pre-pandemic crowds. The decision, dramatically announced by Emmanuel Macron, to move the Mona Lisa to a special hygienically isolated gallery where les idiots who flock to take selfies in front of it won’t bother more cultured visitors who wish to study art in a hushed atmosphere, is a misguided act of snobbery. It may ruin the Louvre’s ecosystem as a place where high art becomes popular culture.	https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jan/28/louvres-decision-to-move-mona-lisa-is-a-misguided-act-of-snobbery	2025-01-28T11:57:34-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce1fdb682db5613f2299e7e4efa91b547ee881f7/0_118_5447_3268/master/5447.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a807182f6370aeb60ad606bd4207cc88

Middle East crisis live: Netanyahu planning to meet Trump next week as US president repeats aim to move Palestinians from Gaza	Israeli prime minister could visit White House as soon as next week, making him the first foreign leader to meet Trump since his inauguration Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the latest events in the Middle East. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is planning to meet US President Donald Trump in Washington as early as next week, according to reports, as hundreds of thousands of Palestinian people made their way back into northern Gaza on Monday. US secretary of state Marco Rubio held a call with Jordan’s King Abdullah on Monday, two days after a suggestion by Donald Trump that Jordan and Egypt should take more Palestinians from Gaza. -The Secretary and King Abdullah discussed implementation of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, the release of hostages, and creating a pathway for security and stability in the region,- the state department said in a statement. Trump’s weekend remarks were not mentioned. Lebanese officials say firing by Israeli troops has killed two people and injured 17 in the second day of deadly protests in southern Lebanon. Residents displaced by the 14-month war between Israel and Hezbollah on Monday again attempted to return to villages where Israeli troops remain. On Sunday, 24 people were killed and more than 130 injured when Israeli troops fired at protesters. Israel said on Monday that it had arrested two Israelis suspected of spying for Iran, including one accused of handing the country classified information obtained during his military service. Tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem were set to lose education, healthcare and other services provided by UN agency Unrwa as an Israeli ban on the organisation takes effect on Thursday. Eight of the 26 hostages yet to be released under the first phase of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas are dead, Israel has confirmed. A Hamas delegation has arrived in Cairo to discuss the implementation of the Gaza ceasefire deal, the group said in a statement. The EU’s foreign ministers have agreed to a -roadmap- to ease current sanctions on Syria, a move welcomed by the country’s government.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/28/israel-gaza-netanyahu-trump-hamas-palestinians-middle-east-latest-live-news	2025-01-27T23:33:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64dff35b74022795939d2f256cd5875dbb0fbc4e/0_62_3360_2016/master/3360.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9c64645370c6e3fa95d70b4b52f99896
Tuesday briefing: How an unknown Chinese startup wiped $593bn from the value of an AI giant	In today’s newsletter: the US had a huge head start on artificial intelligence – but now a low-cost rival from Hangzhou has turned the industry on its head Good morning. Since the emergence of ChatGPT, OpenAI’s groundbreaking artificial intelligence tool, American companies have appeared to have a huge head start in the development of the most significant technology of its generation. But now a small Chinese rival has emerged that appears to match what OpenAI and the other US giants can do at a much lower cost, and without the same hunger for computing power that has made the chip manufacturer Nvidia the most valuable company in the world. The result was a stunning collapse in the value of Big Tech stocks yesterday – and a $593bn fall in the value of Nvidia, the biggest in the US stock market’s history. Gaza ceasefire | Tens of thousands of Palestinians flooded back into northern Gaza on Monday after Israel opened military checkpoints that had divided the strip for more than a year, ending a forced exile from homes and loved ones that many feared could become permanent. UK security | Hindu nationalism, misogyny and the -manosphere- have been identified as breeding grounds for extremism in a leaked government report commissioned after last summer’s riots. The -rapid analytical sprint- also dismissed claims of -two-tier policing- as a -rightwing extremist narrative-. Auschwitz | Elderly former inmates of Auschwitz gathered for perhaps the final time on the 80th anniversary of the concentration camp’s liberation. In remarks at the event, four survivors warned world leaders against the danger of rising antisemitism. Roman Abramovich | An offshore scheme appears to have helped companies owned by the billionaire Roman Abramovich avoid duties potentially amounting to tens of millions of dollars. Abramovich’s lawyers denied he had knowledge of or was personally responsible for any alleged tax evasion. Local government | Bristol city council could become the first local authority in England to collect black rubbish bins only once every four weeks.

Australia’s road toll hits 12-year high as pedestrian and cyclist fatalities rise	Government figures show 1,300 people died on the roads last year in a worsening trend not seen since the 1960s Australia’s roads are getting deadlier, as a four-year period of surging fatalities marks a trend of increasing danger not recorded since the 1960s, before seatbelts were compulsory.

Open (your wallet) wide: Australians pay more for dental care than most OECD countries	Australia ranks well when it comes to total dental care expenditure. But a closer look at the numbers reveals that trips to the dentist are a luxury many people can’t afford Australia spent $11.1bn on dental care in 2021–2022, ranking it sixth out of 31 OECD countries for per capita expenditure. At first glance, that statistic seems pretty good. Dig deeper?

Peter Dutton’s boilerplate campaign video is most interesting for what it omits	The shots of sharing cuppas with constituents and laughing with his kids skates over the details of his ‘small family business’ Election season officially begins when the prime minister drives in the back of C1 to visit the governor general – but its unofficial commencement is when leaders start releasing soft-focus profile videos with their log cabin story, surrounded by family and backed by twinkling music. For an opposition leader especially, whose contributions can often be overshadowed by the prime minister whose job they covet, the productions – often short yet packed with meaning – are a vital chance to re-introduce or repackage themselves to a public who might not know much about them.

How Australia’s ‘unfair’ dental system – and the way $1.3bn is spent – is driving inequality and leaving millions of people behind	Half of all government spending on dental care goes to private insurance rebates – meaning those without often skip treatment until things get worse Patients bear the brunt of dentist fees. But of the $1.3bn the federal government spends on the nation’s teeth, more than half goes to subsidising the uptake of private health insurance. The inequality of Australia’s dental care system can be seen in the numbers, says Peter Breadon, the health program director at the Grattan Institute.

More than half Gen Z think authoritarian leader better for UK than democracy, poll suggests – UK politics live	Polling finds 52% of Gen Z thought UK would be better place if ‘strong leader did not have to bother with parliament and elections’ Good morning. It is Holocaust memorial day, and the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, and the Westminster politics news is relatively light this morning because broadcasters have been focusing on these events. No 10 did not even have a minister doing a morning interview round. Jakub Krupa, who recently took over writing the Guadian Europe live blog, is covering all the relevant events here. The big Westminster news yesterday was the fact that Keir Starmer and Donald Trump have had their first conversation since the inauguration. They spoke for 45 minutes, after Trump gave a peculiar -very good person- (for a liberal) endorsement of Starmer to reporters on Air Force One. (It was slightly patronising – -he’s done a very good job thus far- – but, from the No 10 point of view, a lot more welcome than what gets said when the president is in ‘bad Trump’ mode.)

Israel insists it is going ahead with Unrwa ban – what it may mean for Palestinians	UN agency ordered to vacate HQ by Thursday – just as aid is being increased to Gaza after ceasefire Israel has insisted it will not back down over its plan to close down the Gaza operations of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa), the UN relief agency for Palestinians, even though critics say the move will jeopardise urgent humanitarian aid efforts. Israel has ordered the UN agency to vacate its headquarters in East Jerusalem by Thursday, after the Israeli Knesset passed a law on 28 October banning its operations in Israel and the Palestinian territories. It has not yet said how it will implement a related law ending all Israeli government cooperation with Unwra, which could come into force on the same day and strangle its operations in the West Bank and Gaza.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/27/israel-insists-it-is-going-ahead-with-unrwa-ban-what-it-may-mean-for-palestinians	2025-01-27T01:34:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adff4b9663f772eb7daf31c395a32157b48f48d6/0_252_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7c97c99e527485eb0dc1d4dfac83f3b0

Auschwitz survivors return to camp as they and world leaders mark 80th anniversary of its liberation – live	Holocaust survivors return for memorial ceremony on 80th anniversary of liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp Europe and the world will commemorate the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the former Nazi German concentration and extermination camp Auschwitz today, putting the increasingly chaotic global politics on pause for a brief moment to reflect on the darkest moments of our history. But in a growingly polarised and aggressive world, the ceremony will also for many be a call for action and renewal of our collective memory. As the last survivors inevitably fade away, many fear that we risk forgetting the horrors of the Holocaust and the founding pledge on which Europe built the postwar order: never again.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/27/auschwitz-survivors-memorial-holocaust-ceremony-europe-latest-live-news	2025-01-26T23:58:38-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89f50104138212d073298c77cbe2846058250e28/0_137_8192_4915/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=59847bca5d2b5ba82446454a51f2b778
Monday briefing: What if the climate crisis makes disaster insurance unaffordable?	In today’s newsletter: The Los Angeles wildfires highlighted the immense challenges faced by the insurance industry amid the escalating risks of the climate crisis. Are there any potential solutions for homeowners? Good morning. If the Los Angeles wildfires are bracing evidence of the general threat posed by the climate crisis, they have also brought home a specific problem: how can you make the insurance system work when the risks are so high? That is not a question limited to California, or to the United States: the insurance industry has rated the climate crisis as the biggest threat to its future four years in a row, a very concrete riposte to those politicians who continue to question the reality of global heating. It is impossible to know whether a specific weather event like storm Éowyn in the UK has been caused by climate change – but we know that they, and the damage they leave in their wake, are only going to get more frequent. Israel-Gaza war | Donald Trump’s proposal that large numbers of Palestinians should leave Gaza to -just clean out- the whole strip has been rejected by US allies in the region. Trump’s intervention came as a deal was reached to allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza and release a civilian hostage who Israel said should have been freed already. Heathrow | Rachel Reeves has given her heaviest hint yet that she will back a third runway at Heathrow airport, arguing that she is willing to make difficult decisions while pursuing economic growth. Campaigners have warned that the move would be a severe setback for the UK’s climate commitments. Southport attack | Prevent’s assessment of the danger posed by Axel Rudakubana followed policy at the time, an official review will find – but it will criticise the scheme for rejecting extra help to tackle his interest in violence. The review of the way three referrals were handled before Rudakubana committed an atrocity in Southport is due to be published this week. AI | Ministers have shut down or dropped at least half a dozen artificial intelligence prototypes intended for the welfare system, the Guardian has learned, in a sign of the headwinds facing Keir Starmer’s effort to increase government efficiency. Belarus | Alexander Lukashenko is set to win a seventh five-year term as Belarusian president with 87.6% of the vote in Sunday’s election, according to an exit poll. The US and the EU said in the run-up to the election that it could not be free or fair because independent media are banned and all leading opposition figures have been jailed or forced to flee abroad.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/27/monday-briefing-will-the-climate-crisis-kill-off-disaster-insurance	2025-01-26T22:51:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03add73c9b2af5547f821b444886c401681ebea9/0_431_7914_4749/master/7914.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=15f15fd168fde2e4ce4975bea0ff8a4a

Workers who were considered to be on the frontline during the pandemic have seen no change to their working hours or shift patterns in recent years, according to research by Timewise, a social enterprise that helps businesses with flexible working policies.

Middle East live: Palestinians start to return to homes in north Gaza after Israeli hostage deal reached	Israel said it would stop blocking Palestinians from travelling north after agreement reached with Hamas on release of Israeli civilian Arbel Yehoud Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Middle East. Displaced Palestinians are expected to begin returning to their homes in northern Gaza on Monday, two days later than scheduled, after an agreement was reached between Israel and Hamas to release a civilian Israeli hostage. Israeli forces opened fire on people trying to return to their homes, killing at least 22 people, including a Lebanese soldier and six women, and injuring 124 amid a dispute with Lebanon over a ceasefire agreement. Israel said it would not allow civilians to return to southern Lebanon, and accused the Lebanese army of violating key commitments under the ceasefire deal. Videos showed tense face-offs between Israeli soldiers and tanks and Lebanese crowds waving banners and chanting slogans. The White House said late on Sunday that Israel and Lebanon had agreed to extend the deadline for Israeli troops to depart southern Lebanon until 18 February. Israeli prime minister Netanyahu said on Friday that the Lebanese state had not yet -fully enforced- a deal to secure the south, meant to ensure that Hezbollah withdrew beyond the Litani River. -To ‘clean’ Gaza immediately after the war would in fact be a continuation of the war, through the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people,- said Hassan Jabareen, the director of Palestinian rights group Adalah. Omer Shatz, a lecturer in international law at Sciences Po Paris and international criminal court (ICC) counsel, said Trump’s comments were a -call for ethnic cleansing- that echoed calls from extremist Israeli politicians and public figures dating to the start of the war. The US president had said Palestinians could move to countries including Jordan, which already hosts more than 2.7 million Palestinian refugees, and Egypt. -I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing at a different location where they can maybe live in peace for a change,- Trump told reporters on Air Force One. -You’re talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing and say: ‘You know, it’s over.’-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/27/middle-east-live-israel-palestinians-gaza-return-hostage-deal	2025-01-26T21:23:57-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9717d811a094a62121d4330ae7a7ffcf25495566/0_0_8064_4838/master/8064.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=216157cdf94d97c5b4ef80914283038b

Australia news live: Minns condemns vandalism of NSW police monument; Victorians brace for searing heat	Police launch investigation over defacement of wall of remembrance in the Domain. Follow today’s news live Peter Dutton says Holocaust education an important mission In his statement for International Holocaust Day, Peter Dutton, the opposition leader, drew parallels between current anti-semitism and the Holocaust. The weight of history will be especially felt by survivors and their families this International Holocaust Remembrance Day with 2025 marking the 80th Anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau. In the magnitude of anti-Semitism which is plaguing Western democracies today – including Australia – many citizens who have read about the history and horrors of the Holocaust have, for the first time, grasped how that catastrophe eventuated. They have seen, with their own eyes, a type of hate that, if left unchecked, unleashes greater evils. Educating Australians about atrocities of the Holocaust and the October 7 attacks is an important mission that deserves support. By gaining awareness of the persecution and atrocities committed against Jews, Australians will have a better understanding of why there is no place for antisemitism in our community. It was a pitiless and unrelenting act of cruelty that was long in the planning, cold in its calculation, and carried out on a scale that falls across the decades like a terrible shadow. The devastation felt when witnessing the horror, destruction and brutality inflicted by Hamas on October 7 is reminiscent of the dark and painful stories of the past. For the Australian Jewish community, those are the stories of their families. We embraced the Jewish community then, and we embrace you now. Tragically, we are not yet free of antisemitism. It stands in vile opposition to all we are as a nation and all that we have built - together - over generations. We will not tolerate it in any form. It has no place in our nation, and we will combat it with the full force of our laws and with total commitment from every level of government.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/jan/27/australia-news-live-chris-minns-police-victoria-melbourne-heatwave-antisemitism-holocaust-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-election-campaign	2025-01-26T12:36:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4df95bbd39d6732418f9ce4664dad230b74cdf77/612_45_2959_1775/master/2959.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=de858cb9e0b9306e309c79e90c8d7e4a

The framing of the shrew: California students photograph mammal never caught on film	Three young scientists set traps to capture and film species of special concern in move that can help conserve the shrew In a 7,000ft-high marshy spot in the cold, rugged eastern Sierra mountains, two groups of mammals scurried around at night. One was going about their normal nocturnal routine of hunting worms. The other was hoping for a glimpse of an elusive creature: the Mount Lyell shrew, the only known California mammal never photographed alive. The three young student scientists faced a tight timeline. They baited 150 pitfall traps – small cups dug into the earth to catch wandering creatures – with cat food and mealworms and monitored them across a 600ft area, checking each trap every two hours for any signs of their goal. They slept no more than two hours at a time. Shrews have such a fast metabolism that they die in traps quickly, one of the reasons this species had never been photographed or studied live.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/26/mount-lyell-shrew-california-photograph	2025-01-26T09:43:13-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/290d1f56a6b048b829ce818933cd13f74e098059/0_731_2914_1749/master/2914.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5890e19466a34d400bc20d7cb73033f1

People losing faith with democracy, economic shocks and environmental breakdowns are some of the potential triggers for a decline or collapse in social cohesion, the thinktank said. One warning sign of democracy being undermined is a lack of public trust in institutions, so it commissioned a survey of 2,000 adults by Opinium, which found 63% believe the very rich have too much influence on UK politics, ­compared to 40% for businesses and ­religious organisations, and 38% for ­international organisations, such as the EU and UN.	https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2025/jan/25/nearly-two-thirds-of-britons-say-very-rich-have-too-much-influence-on-politics	2025-01-25T08:23:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b190b7c4d605519a4c9b9425f9cd47b9c9ae251/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25b46cf185d4a9de713cdd02e94c9dcf

Britain’s response to Russian ‘spy ship’ is game of political messaging – for now	Deteriorating security environment and incidents in Baltic have forced military reassessment in northern Europe Submarines normally operate in secret, lurking in the deep. So when the British defence secretary, John Healey, authorised a Royal Navy Astute-class attack sub to surface close to the Russian -spy ship- Yantar south of Cornwall in November, it was unusual enough. What was even more notable, however, was that the minister went on to tell the House of Commons on Wednesday what he had done. It was, Healey said, conducted -strictly as a deterrent measure-, as was his decision to accuse the Kremlin of spying on the location of undersea communication and utility cables that connect Britain to the world.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/24/britain-russian-spy-ship-response-political-messaging	2025-01-23T22:00:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02c418d56f91cb671ee7e605f90e7e3d9bc12ed9/438_375_2231_1339/master/2231.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d3856ffd78c4f1e03be381ee626aad1f

Inquest exposes poor leadership, insufficient testing at aged care home that saw 19 Covid deaths in 2020	Deadly wave of Covid that hit Sydney’s Newmarch House made more severe by organisational failings, coroner says Some of the 19 deaths during a 2020 Covid-19 outbreak at a NSW aged-care home could have been avoided had proper testing for the virus been implemented, a coronial inquest has found. Poor leadership, insufficient communication and staff shortages were highlighted in coroner Derek Lee’s review of the deaths from a wave of the virus that swept through Sydney’s Newmarch House. If universal testing of staff had been performed once the outbreak had begun, and timelier reporting of results had allowed for cases of Covid-19 to be identified more readily, it would likely have reduced the extent and severity of the outbreak; Frontline management at Newmarch House did not clearly understand the chain of command and did not get effective support from Anglicare senior executives. -Consequently, Anglicare did not demonstrate adequate leadership and governance during the course of the outbreak-, Lee said; There was a lack of clarity at Newmarch House as to who, if anyone, bore ultimate responsibility for clinical decision-making; Anglicare did not give residents’ families enough specific information about their loved one, and in some cases it was inaccurate or understated the seriousness of what was occurring; During the initial stages of the outbreak there was a -significant deficiency- in the number of staff available which -meant that infection control and the care provided to residents was gravely jeopardised-.

UK will not accept EU offer to join pan-European customs union ‘at present time’, minister says – UK politics live	Housing minister shoots down idea floated by Maroš Šefčovič designed to help reset UK-EU discussions Good morning. The government is obsessed with finding any levers it can that might promote growth. At Davos yesterday Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, was asked if growth was even more important than promoting net zero, and she replied: -Well if [growth is] the number one mission it’s obviously the most important thing.- Today the government is announcing potentially significant plans that could limit the scope of judicial review applications to hold back growth. Pippa Crerar, Kiran Stacey and Sandra Laville have the details here. Economists argue that an obvious move to promote growth would be to have close trade links with the EU. But the government has ruled out rejoining the single market or the custom union (let alone rejoining the EU proper – which is still largely a taboo proposal in most parts of UK politics). And today a minister has ruled out an EU proposal for the UK to join, not the customs union, but a customs union with the EU. Šefčovič referred to the idea of the UK joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM). These are common rules that allow parts, ingredients and materials for manufacturing supply chains to be sourced from across dozens of countries in Europe and North Africa to be used in tariff-free trade. We’re not seeking to participate in that particular arrangement. I think in general the government’s been very clear … we do want a closer relationship with our European partners, both in trading terms, but also, importantly … in terms of security and defense cooperation, where we need to work far more closely. So absolutely, yes, we do want a closer relationship.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/23/keir-starmer-eu-sadiq-khan-latest-live-politics-news	2025-01-23T01:28:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9bddca2b2830e514cc80df9cdacbccd2233cb74/0_98_5552_3331/master/5552.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9267462122b06c19f2bbf9085fa48f19
Trump suggests it was a mistake for Biden not to pardon himself – US politics live	US president says his predecessor gave ‘everybody pardons’ but says it is a ‘sad thing’ he didn’t give himself one Donald Trump has described attacks on police officers at the US Capitol on January 6 2021 as -very minor incidents- as he sought to defend his decision to pardon the insurrectionists. The US president hinted that those who put him through -four years of hell- via criminal prosecutions should themselves be investigated, adding ominously that his predecessor, Joe Biden, made a mistake by not pardoning himself. Most of the people were absolutely innocent. OK. But forgetting all about that, these people have served, horribly, a long time. It would be very, very cumbersome to go and look – you know how many people we’re talking about? 1,500 people.- This guy went around giving everybody pardons. And you know, the funny thing, maybe the sad thing, is he didn’t give himself a pardon. And if you look at it, it all had to do with him.- Joe Biden has very bad advisers. Somebody advised Joe Biden to give pardons to everybody but him.- Donald Trump has described attacks on police officers at the US Capitol on January 6 2021 as -very minor incidents- as he sought to defend his decision to pardon the insurrectionists. Those pardoned include more than 250 people who were convicted of assault charges, some having attacked police with makeshift weapons such as flagpoles, a hockey stick and a crutch. Trump also used the prime-time Fox News interview to discuss his barrage of executive orders, dismiss security concerns over Chinese-owned app TikTok (-Is it that important for China to be spying on young people, on young kids watching crazy videos?-) and discuss the possibility of cutting off federal funds to so-called -sanctuary cities- that shield undocumented immigrants from federal detention requests. On Thursday, Trump will speak remotely at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, delivering his first major speech to global business and political leaders. He is due to give a speech and engage in a dialogue at 11am US Eastern Time (4pm GMT), according to the meeting schedule. It is not clear what he will discuss. The new US presidential envoy for special missions has pushed back against Nato chief, Mark Rutte’s talk at the World Economic Forum about Ukraine joining Nato, pointing out many members of the alliance aren’t paying their -fair share- already. Richard Grenell, appointed by Trump in December, said it is -pretty shocking- that so many foreign ministers in Europe, and so many US politicians, did not try to stop the Russia-Ukraine war, and criticised Biden’s handling of the situation.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/23/donald-trump-pardons-january-6-us-president-joe-biden-jd-vance-republicans-live-news	2025-01-23T00:42:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5fcf45c541301d81dc486432ff09d991a9e5b5f/196_30_1282_769/master/1282.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=db34cd3853a8542998b1b626bcb60c4f

Thursday briefing: With a new wave of violence, the West Bank is on edge	In today’s newsletter: As Israeli security forces launch an operation in the city of Jenin and violence by settlers escalates, Emma Graham-Harrison explains what happens next Good morning. A few days after a ceasefire brought at least temporary relief to Gaza, violence erupted in the occupied West Bank. On Tuesday, the Israeli military launched what was described as an extensive raid in the city of Jenin, a day after Israeli settlers attacked Palestinians, setting vehicles and property ablaze in a violent rampage that left at least one person dead. Two Israeli were arrested even though dozens of armed settlers were involved in the rioting. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, condemned the attacks, but it is evident that extremist settlers feel emboldened by government policies and ministers who back their agenda.

Scheduled to hold a press conference in western Sydney on Tuesday morning, he rerouted to the city’s east instead, visiting the site of the attack and then holding a press conference with the New South Wales premier, Chris Minns.

‘Forever chemicals’ ban criticised as NSW community airs its long-held contamination concerns	Cost of fixing PFAS pollution should be borne by manufacturers and polluters, not governments and consumers, expert will tell Senate inquiry A water quality expert has called on the Australian government to expand a planned ban of certain PFAS as a Senate committee heard concerns from a New South Wales community affected by chemical contamination. PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), a group of several thousand synthetic compounds, are found in a wide variety of products including waterproof fabrics, food packaging, hygiene products and firefighting foam. They are sometimes referred to as -forever chemicals- because they are slow to break down and persist in the environment for extended periods.

California prepares for possible new fires as winds create conditions for ‘explosive growth’	Gusts could peak at 70 mph (113 kph) along the coast and 100 mph (160 kph) in the mountains and foothills Winds picked up on Tuesday in southern California and at least a couple of new wildfires broke out as firefighters remained on alert in extreme fire weather, two weeks after two major blazes started that are still burning in the Los Angeles area. The fresh high winds – that are coming amid still bone-dry conditions – mark the end of a break in dangerous high fire-risk conditions that have allowed the beleaguered city’s fire-fighters to largely contain the disastrous blazes that have burnt thousands of homes.

This is what Philp told Times Radio. I think it’s just important the inquiry looks at all of this, gets to the truth both about what happened beforehand, but critically also the government’s response afterwards, and what they knew when and whether they should have put more information into the public domain. It appears they withheld information about the perpetrator, potentially, on CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] advice.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/21/keir-starmer-southport-attack-labour-uk-politics-latest-news-updates	2025-01-21T00:21:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9154b4f97662079de3231fec085aa206026cab2a/2694_724_2768_1661/master/2768.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b5b3c0a3308fa68cb973870899b753f9

Trump inauguration live: president pardons January 6 rioters and exits Paris climate agreement in slew of executive orders	On his first day on office the US president sought to undo much of Joe Biden’s legacy, also vowing to ‘unleash’ oil and gas drilling and revoking birthright citizenship Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Donald Trump’s inauguration and first day in office. Immediately after his swearing-in ceremony on Monday the new US president set into motion a slew of executive orders seeking to make good on his campaign promises and undo the legacy of his predecessor Joe Biden, including the pardoning of January 6 defendant and a crackdown on immigration to the US. Trump pardoned about 1,500 January 6 defendants facing prosecution for their role in the 2021 storming of the US capitol. Among those pardoned is Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the Proud Boys, who was sentenced to 22 years in prison on seditious conspiracy charges. Trump also commuted the sentence of Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the Oath Keepers militia, who had been sentenced to 18 years in prison on sedition charges. He also signed an executive order seeking to revoke birthright citizenship – automatic citizenship for people born in the US – for the children of undocumented immigrants. Birthright citizenship is protected by the 14th amendment and the order will almost certainly be challenged in court. One order declared a -national emergency- at the southern border, paving the way to send US troops to the area and another that designated drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. He signed an executive order to, for a second time, withdraw the US from the Paris climate accords. He also declared a national energy emergency as part of a barrage of pro-fossil fuel actions and efforts to -unleash- already booming US energy production. Another order will remove the US from the World Health Organization (WHO). -World Health ripped us off, everybody rips off the United States. It’s not going to happen any more,- Trump said at the signing. The withdrawal of the US would dramatically cut funding from the global public health organization. He issued an executive order requiring federal agencies revoke the use of -gender- and -gender identity- and instead use a binary definition of -sex- in implementing policy – including in issuing passports, a move that LGBTQ+ rights groups have vowed to challenge in court. Another order reclassified thousands of federal employees as political hires, making it much easier for them to be fired. Key aides to Trump have called for mass government firings. Project 2025 made attacks on the deep or administrative state a core part of Trump’s second term. One order renamed the 617,800 sq mile Gulf of Mexico and Alaska’s 20,000ft Denali. The Gulf of Mexico will be renamed the Gulf of America, and Denali, the highest mountain in North America, will revert to Mount McKinley, which it was called before Barack Obama changed the name in 2015. The order will have no bearing on what names are used internationally. Trump also signed an executive order temporarily delaying the enforcement of a federal ban on TikTok for at least 75 days. -I guess I have a warm spot for TikTok that I didn’t have originally,- Trump said at the White House.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/21/donald-trump-inauguration-presidency-executive-orders-pardons-day-two-live-blog	2025-01-20T21:06:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cda7d9b277d8c23917d91e7d6e219ba656aa0705/0_34_4637_2783/master/4637.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c586e722261b4b85725e5119914c76b6

Freezing rain dampens mood in Washington ahead of Trump’s inauguration – photo essay	Photographer Jordan Gale documents preparations for 60th presidential inauguration, showing a US poised and polarised between hope and fear Washington is a city on edge. Concrete barriers, unscalable steel fencing and security checkpoints dot the map. In a climate of simmering political violence, and after a divisive election campaign in which he survived two assassination attempts, Donald Trump is returning to an anxious capital where more than nine in 10 voters broke for his opponent, Kamala Harris. A city of tradition and ritual will seek to accommodate the most unconventional of presidents, bringing thousands of Trump’s supporters into direct contact with the residents who feel a sense of foreboding and dread. Trump will take the oath of office under the magnificent dome of the Capitol Rotunda on Monday due to forecasts of intense cold weather, upending months of meticulous planning for a massive outdoor event with crowds sprawling down the National Mall. The swearing-in was last moved indoors in 1985, when Ronald Reagan began his second term.

Protesters who stormed a Seoul court at the weekend may not have worn animal skins, but the similarities are striking They arrived intent on causing mayhem. The political figurehead they supported had, they said, been the victim of a grave injustice at the hands of the establishment. The ringleaders had soon broken through security cordons, armed with fire extinguishers, steel pipes and police shields, smashing windows and gaining entry to a government building, leaving destruction worth an estimated £400,000 in their wake. The scene of the riot was not the US Capitol building on 6 January 2021, and the mobs attempting to overturn the rule of law had swapped animal skins and bald eagle masks for hooded down jackets and face masks. But the similarities between Maga ideologues’ attempts to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election, and the far-right protesters who stormed the Seoul Western district court building this weekend in support of the impeached South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, are hard to ignore.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/20/has-south-korea-just-witnessed-its-own-january-6-moment	2025-01-20T04:42:41-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2a6e7cce0737b6f9e49c28e95f364b84edfb5b1/0_398_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=011161c3ec07022572ec05c53efd8714

Plus, billionaire wealth grew $2tn in 2024 Good morning. The United States braces for a new era of disruption and division on Monday with Donald Trump scheduled to be sworn in as its 47th president, promising a blitz of executive orders and radical shake-up of the global order. What did Trump promise yesterday? -We’re going to stop the invasion of our borders … We’re going to unlock the liquid gold that’s right under our feet … We’re going to bring back law and order to our cities … We’re going to get radical woke ideology the hell out of our military.- How are some assessing the Biden administration?

On Sunday, three women held hostage by Hamas in tunnels beneath Gaza – Emily Damari, 28, Romi Gonen, 24 and Doron Steinbrecher, 31 – were released and reunited with their mothers.

The delay meant a further 13 people were killed, Palestinian health authorities said.

Alaska to resume ‘barbaric’ shooting of bears and wolves from helicopters	Renewed program would allow hunters to eliminate up to 80% of the animals on 20,000 acres of state land Alaska is set to resume the aerial gunning of bears and wolves as a population control measure aimed at boosting caribou and moose herd numbers, even as the state’s own evaluation of the practice cast doubt on its effectiveness. The renewed program would allow hunters to eliminate up to 80% of the animals on 20,000 acres of state land. Environmental groups opposed to what they label a -barbaric- practice of shooting wildlife from helicopters is more about sport than scientific practice in part because hunters want caribou populations to increase because they are trophy animals.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/alaska-aerial-gunning-bears-wolves	2025-01-20T04:00:01-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b54e773f36d682e29ee03ac6542d2ae3a33cb44d/109_715_2142_1285/master/2142.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1c0d86a4fb6dd411a622a0875b80e6b8

CNN defamation case foreshadows Trump media crackdown, experts say	Contractor Zachary Young wins damages over Afghanistan story in trial notable for prosecution’s aggressive stance A combative defamation trial in Florida, involving CNN and a former US security contractor in Afghanistan, is providing a roadmap for a crackdown on media independence during the second Trump administration, experts believe. The case was already unusual because CNN chose to defend itself and risk millions in damages, while other media giants such as ABC News and the Washington Post have opted to back down in the face of threats of persecution from the incoming president. Ultimately, after 18 hours of deliberation, the jury found that CNN defamed the contractor and awarded Zachary Young $4m in lost business and $1m in personal damages.	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jan/20/cnn-defamation-trial	2025-01-20T03:00:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b773cd83540a325b05e2522361377a6ab8a21d11/0_48_3754_2253/master/3754.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=080bd0d5a48c0a1e998188ba7afd6d02
US will want Chagos Islands deal reversed, Trump’s ex-national security adviser suggests – UK politics live	Westminster is preparing for Donald Trump’s second term ahead of the US president’s inauguration in Washington Good morning. Donald Trump becomes president of the United States for the second time today and in Westminster, as across the rest of the word, supporters are giddy with excitement, while opponents feel this is a moment for epoch-defining dread. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader and Britain’s leading Trump evangelist, has got so carried away that he has told an interviewer he thinks there is a 20/25% chance that he could be prime minister by the time Trump leaves office (January 2029). It’s not impossible; but few other people would put his chances as high as one in four. Most people in Labour politics, privately at least, regard Trump with horror, but the government has to work with him and Keir Starmer, who has invested a lot of effort in trying to establish a decent personal relationship with the new president, has issued a statement sending Trump his -warmest congratulations- on his inauguration. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, was on the Today programme this morning and, when asked if he he had changed his mind about Trump since the days when he used to denounce him in the strongest possible terms, he said his approach to foreign policy was grounded in -progressive realism-, taking the world as it is. He went on to praise the Trump he met when he and Starmer had dinner with him in New York in September last year. The Donald Trump I met … had incredible grace, generosity, very keen to be a good host, very funny, very, very, very friendly, very warm, I have to say, about the UK, our royal family, Scotland, his relationship with Scotland, his mother. That was the Donald Trump I found. There was a survey this week – 70% of the world welcomed Donald Trump coming to power, 70% of the world, much of that worried about authoritarian actors, actually quite like the fact that Donald Trump keeps them guessing. I think surrendering the Chagos Islands, or putting the Chagos Islands in a situation where they can easily be coerced, by the Chinese Communist Party for example, I hope it’s a position that we see reversed here by Donald Trump, and by the UK government. The Pentagon, the State Department and the White House under the last administration pored through this deal. There was an interagency process, [they] said it was a good deal. It’s right and proper that the new administration is able to consider it. But having gone through the deal in detail, it’s the right deal to keep the global community safe, and I emphasize the importance of that military base and those assets on Diego Garcia that we’ve been working together with with the United States now for all of my lifetime.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/20/us-chagos-islands-deal-david-lammy-uk-politics-live-news-updates	2025-01-20T01:35:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a4433649573bce788cf9c32bd2b31c3554b67db/423_483_5895_3537/master/5895.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ba4684d22839eb21aa9a5cad6a952472

South Australia proposes law for bigger garages to stop street parking being ‘overrun’ with SUVs	Plan sparks debate about use of urban space, housing costs and investment in public transport amid climate crisis South Australia is proposing laws that will force developers to build bigger garages in new homes, in an effort to stop cars too big for standard off-street parking from crowding suburban streets. Under the plan, which is still in the consultation process, residential car park sizes will have to be half a metre wider and 60cm longer to accommodate big cars and dual-cab utes. The size of a single car park, under the proposed changes, would be 3.5m wide and 6m long.

Ninety Palestinians released by Israel as Gaza ceasefire enters second day – live	Palestinian detainees greeted with joy in West Bank after earlier release of three Israeli hostages on Sunday Hello and welcome to our live coverage of major developments in the Israel-Gaza war after a long-awaited ceasefire in Gaza came into effect on Sunday. In the hours since, hostage and prisoner exchanges have been carried out on both sides. Ninety Palestinian prisoners were released early on Monday as part of the ceasefire deal. Those freed from Israeli prisons included 69 women and 21 teenage boys from the West Bank and Jerusalem, according to Hamas. The prisoners, most of whom were freed from Ofer prison in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, were welcomed by thousands of people celebrating. It followed the release of three Israeli women held hostage by Hamas in tunnels beneath Gaza, ending a protracted ordeal that began with their violent abduction by Hamas on 7 October 2023. Among those released was joint British national Emily Damari, 28, who was freed alongside Romi Gonen, 24 and Doron Steinbrecher, 31. The women have been reunited with their mothers after being handed over by International Committee for the Red Cross. The three are in a -stable condition- and will be monitored for a few days, according to a news conference at Sheba Medical Center in Tel Aviv. A member of the hospital staff, Professor Itai Pessach, said: -I’m happy to report that they are in stable condition. That allows us and them to focus on what is the most important thing for now – reuniting with the families.- As the fighting ceased, hundreds of aid trucks queued to enter Gaza to deliver supplies to its 2.3 million residents, 90% of whom have been displaced by the conflict, many multiple times. The World Health Organization says it is ready to pour much-needed aid into Gaza during the Israel-Hamas truce, but that it would need -systematic access- across the territory to do so. Much of the Gaza Strip’s health infrastructure has been destroyed by the more than year-long war. The first phase of the truce took effect after a three-hour delay during which Israeli warplanes and artillery pounded the Gaza Strip. The last-minute blitz killed 13 people, Palestinian health authorities said. Israel claimed it had struck terrorists although Al Jazeera reported that at least two missiles hit a family travelling on a donkey cart as they tried to return home. Thousands of displaced Palestinians have started to return home, many to destroyed buildings and homes in ruins. There is no detailed plan in place to govern Gaza after the war, much less rebuild it. Nine in 10 homes have been destroyed as well as schools, hospitals, shops, mosques and cemeteries. Under the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which is to last 42 days, the militant group has agreed to release 33 hostages including children, women (including female soldiers) and men aged over 50, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli jails. In the second phase, the remaining living hostages are due to be sent back and a corresponding ratio of Palestinian prisoners will be freed, and Israel will completely withdraw from the territory. The specifics are subject to further negotiations, which are due to start 16 days into the first phase. The third phase will address the exchange of bodies of deceased hostages and Hamas members, and a reconstruction plan for Gaza will be launched. Arrangements for future governance of the strip remain hazy.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/20/israel-gaza-ceasefire-live-blog-updates-hostages-palestinian-detainees-released	2025-01-19T21:27:29-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e198aaf878d9a84788c00737a1f113e58142c15c/0_0_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5fad60e65bf5ad363352bf7980fe0284
