Winter storm across US south disrupts travel and closes schools	Flight cancellations pile up and state officials warn of dangerous roads Saturday with biting cold and wet snow Flight cancellations piled up and state officials warned of continuing dangerous roads Saturday in the wake of a winter storm that closed schools and disrupted travel across parts of the southern US. A storm that brought biting cold and wet snow to the south was moving out to sea off the east coast Saturday, leaving behind a forecast of snow showers in the Appalachian mountains and New England. But temperatures are expected to plunge after sundown Saturday in the south, raising the risk that melting snow will refreeze, turning roadways treacherous and glazed with ice.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/11/winter-storm-us-south	2025-01-11T11:17:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b15b1e6b3bd3360a66d79869cf43f63122335c2/0_428_6419_3851/master/6419.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e93de2533f3ce2e89286027598ec5187

UK can be ‘AI sweet spot’: Starmer’s tech minister on regulation, Musk, and free speech	Technology secretary Peter Kyle has the task of making Britain a leading player in the AI revolution, but says economic growth will not come at the cost of online safety With the NHS still struggling, a prisons crisis still teetering and Britain’s borrowing costs soaring, there are few easy jobs going in Keir Starmer’s cabinet at present. But even in such difficult times, the task of convincing Silicon Valley’s finest to help make Britain a leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution – all while one leading tech boss uses the Labour government as a regular punching bag and others ostentatiously move closer to Donald Trump – is among the most challenging.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/11/uk-can-be-ai-sweet-spot-starmers-tech-minister-on-regulation-musk-and-free-speech	2025-01-11T10:59:39-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab50db8c2b0e3db9e611233289da0b93e765091/0_164_4927_2957/master/4927.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e05cc22b47952e3c1787001b90ac1cf0

Silicon Valley’s tycoons are bending the knee to Trump | Blake Montgomery	In 2017, Silicon Valley rebuked Trump’s travel ban. Today, it has reversed course and is bending over backwards with displays of deference to Trump On 28 January 2017, I rushed to the San Francisco international airport (SFO). Like elsewhere in the US that night, demonstrations were growing against a travel ban Donald Trump had issued against visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries. The night was chillier than normal, and I had not brought an adequate jacket. Luckily, the train to the airport was warm, full to the brim with jittery, talkative protesters. The airport itself was a rowdy scene: cabs and Ubers stalled as angry protesters blocked the roads, meters still running; demonstrators in hijabs prayed on their protest signs in baggage claim as others shouted at any arriving flyer coming for their luggage. Trump was the most outrageous man in America then, his election a shock to a wide swath of the world. After a few hours, whispers of a $150bn face floated through the crowd: Sergey Brin, creator and co-founder of Google, was there. At the time, he was the president of Google’s parent company Alphabet, which also owns YouTube. The effect was thrilling: one of the richest and most powerful men in the world was registering his discontent with Trump by bodily joining a protest against him. Brin, a native of Moscow who arrived in the US at the age of six, said he came to SFO that night -because I’m a refugee-. It was a personal rebuke of Trump, the consummate nativist.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/11/trump-silicon-valley	2025-01-11T05:00:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad0153854745673e2dce46a20cefa32880506b81/0_203_3071_1844/master/3071.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=95226bc01dd29236a9c07c20d61c0535

California fires live: progress made against some LA blazes but thickening smoke prompts ‘health emergency’	Palisades and Eaton fires start coming under control as fierce winds ease but forecasters predict another red flag warning for Monday Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the California wildfires that have devastated six neighborhoods of Los Angeles county, killed at least 11 people and damaged or destroyed more than 12,000 structures. Firefighters finally started gaining control over two major wildfires on the eastern and western flanks of Los Angeles on Friday as fierce winds that supercharged the fires for days eased. The Palisades fire, at 21,317 acres and 8% containment The Eaton fire, at 13,690 acres and 3% containment The Kenneth fire, at 1,052 acres and 50% containment The Hurst fire, at 771 acres and 37% containment The Lidia fire, at 395 acres and 98% containment The Archer fire, at 19 acres and 0% containment Six deaths have been confirmed in the Eaton fire and five in the Palisades. As family members have been alerted to the loss of their loved ones, six of the victims have been publicly identified. Law enforcement officials expect the death toll to rise once weather and fire conditions allow cadaver dogs and detectives into the burn zones. Conditions in the Los Angeles area were forecast to improve through the weekend, with sustained winds slowing to about 20mph (32km/h), gusting between 35-50mph, according to the National Weather Service, a respite from recent wind gusts of 80mph. -It’s not as gusty, so that should help firefighters,- NWS meteorologist Allison Santorelli said, adding that conditions were still critical with low humidity and dry vegetation. Forecasters predicted another red flag warning would be issued for Monday. Fire chief Kristin Crowley criticised city officials over water supply issues and budget cuts that she says hindered her department’s ability to fight the Palisades fire. The water supply has become a focal point, with California governor Gavin Newsom calling for an investigation into the shortage. Newsom has invited Donald Trump to visit the state and tour the the LA wildfires’ devastation. Trump visited the state six years ago in the wake of the Camp fire, the most destructive fire in California history, which hit the town of Paradise. The state of California issued a one-year moratorium preventing insurance companies from canceling or refusing to renew home policies in zip codes impacted by the Palisades and Eaton fires. Fire agencies are investigating whether Southern California Edison’s utility infrastructure sparked a brush fire that is still burning in a Los Angeles suburb, SCE said on Friday, adding no determination has been made. SCE, a unit of US utility Edison International, said in a filing to its regulators that a downed conductor was discovered at a tower associated with its Eagle Rock – Sylmar 220 kV circuit. -SCE does not know whether the damage observed occurred before or after the start of the fire,- it said.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/11/california-fires-la-fires-live-updates-latest-news	2025-01-10T23:16:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80c17a89ee8f6bb37c80659a71ead40b9cf18c8b/0_274_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bcc8f27f6817807d5c7e350012d223d7

Los Angeles officials expect the death toll from the wildfires in the county to continue to rise, as workers comb through incinerated neighborhoods with cadaver dogs. How big are the fires? The Palisades fire is 8,085 hectares and just 6% contained; Eaton is 5,540 hectares and not contained at all; Kenneth is 405 hectares and 35% contained; Hurst, 312 hectares and 37%; Lidia, 141 hectares and 60%.

Kenya court rules that criminalising attempted suicide is unconstitutional	The judgment has been welcomed as an important shift in perceptions by human rights and mental health groups A Kenyan judge has declared as unconstitutional sections of the country’s laws that criminalise attempted suicide. In a landmark ruling on Thursday, Judge Lawrence Mugambi of the country’s high court stated that section 226 of the penal code contradicts the constitution by punishing those with mental health issues over which they may have little or no control. While the constitution says in article 43 that a person has the right to the -highest attainable standard of health-, criminal law states that -any person who attempts to kill himself is guilty of a misdemeanour and is subject to imprisonment of up to two years, a fine, or both-, with the minimum age of prosecution for the offence set at eight years old.	https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jan/10/kenya-court-rules-that-criminalising-attempted-suicide-is-unconstitutional	2025-01-10T03:32:46-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f151e2de9768b827721edcfc8cbc805ae4abde5/0_0_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=30da1b56d6237d0798bcd1bfb92d5e2d

Labour has worked very hard to ‘restore economic credibility’, minister says – UK politics live	Culture secretary Lisa Nandy defends chancellor amid economic turbulence Culture secretary Lisa Nandy has said she believes that the Labour government is still -on track- with its ambition for the UK to be -the fastest growing economy in Europe.- Conceding that the budget decision to increase national insurance contributions on employers was -a difficult one for many companies-, she told listeners of the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the government was not going back to the -bad old days- of Tory budgets. She said: We inherited an economy where it was hard to see who had confidence, both to invest, and particularly for consumers to be able to feel that they could spend, given the huge fluctuations that we’d seen, particularly after the Liz Truss/Kwasi Kwarteng mini-budget. The chancellor has been absolutely clear that we are not going back to those bad old days. We have had two interest rate cuts since she became chancellor, and we have worked very hard to restore economic credibility. We are not only confident that we’re on track, but the OECD is confident that we’re on track to become the fastest growing economy in Europe.

US supreme court to hear arguments in TikTok ban-or-sale case	Latest battle over whether to ban the app will force justices to weigh importance of security with freedom of speech The US supreme court will hear oral arguments over the fate of TikTok on Friday. It’s the latest battle in the long war over whether to ban the tremendously popular social media app in the US – and will force the justices to weigh the importance of national security with the freedom of speech. TikTok and its parent company, Chinese-based ByteDance, asked the supreme court to review the case after a lower court ruled last month to uphold a law to ban the app in the US. That ban is scheduled to go into effect on 19 January, unless ByteDance sells TikTok’s assets to a non-Chinese company.

LA fires live updates: at least seven deaths as California wildfires rage and crews battle new fire	Palisades, Kenneth, Eaton fires remain uncontrolled as Los Angeles officials say ‘historic winds’ and extensive droughts have created the ‘perfect storm’ Hello, and welcome to our live coverage of the wildfires in California, where some of the worst blazes in the region’s history have ravaged homes and reduced entire neighbourhoods to ash. I’m Petra Stock. It’s approaching 8pm in Los Angeles and here is a recap of what you need to know. The Palisades fire, at 19,978 acres and 6% containment The Eaton fire, at 13,690 acres and 0% containment The Kenneth fire, at 960 acres and 0% containment The Hurst fire, at 671 acres and 10% containment The Lidia fire, at 348 acres and 60% containment Seven people have died, and more than 10,000 structures have burned, in the Palisades and Eaton fires. Five deaths have been confirmed in the Eaton fire and two in the Palisades. The Palisades fire, which had remained 0% contained since it broke out Tuesday, was 6% contained by 6pm Thursday. A new fire, now called the Kenneth fire, sparked around 3:34pm and quickly ballooned to 960 acres. President Joe Biden has announced that the federal government would pay for 100% of the firefighting needs for the next 180 days. Law enforcement officials are working to issue a curfew for affected burn zones in Los Angeles, in order to combat looting, though it is unclear when it will go into effect. Vice-president Kamala Harris canceled a trip to Singapore, Bahrain and Germany shortly after President Biden canceled a trip to Italy in order to more closely monitor the fires. The California prison system has now deployed nearly 800 incarcerated firefighters to fight the devastating blazes.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/10/la-fires-live-updates-california-los-angeles-wildfires-fire-map-latest-news	2025-01-09T19:36:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91a838607c4536aa6b71519444bdc53cae9d3f72/0_3_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=50d72be040640e281f7eb9279c77eb4b

He implemented a travel ban that caused chaos at airports, leaving families, students and scholars stranded. He also attempted to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program, which shields hundreds of thousands of people brought to the country as children from deportation and imposed a -zero-tolerance- at the US-Mexico border that led to the separation of thousands of families.

David Lammy says Trump’s rhetoric can be ‘destabilising’ but threat to invade Greenland won’t happen – UK politics live	Foreign secretary says Trump’s comments should be understood as reflection of his concerns about Arctic security Good morning. For the first time in six months, David Lammy, the foreign secretary, was put up by No 10 to do the morning broadcast interview round – ahead of a speech he is giving later. At PMQs yesterday, perhaps surprisingly, Keir Starmer was not asked about Donald Trump’s suggestion that he might invade Greenland, an autonomous territory that belongs to Denmark. The French and German governments have both condemned Trump’s comments. But, in an interview with the Today programme, Lammy was rather more diplomatic. Lammy said that, although Trump’s language could be -destabilising-, he did not always do what he threatened. Asked about Trump’s comments, Lammy said: I think that we know from Donald Trump’s first term that the intensity of his rhetoric, and the unpredictability sometimes of what he says, can be destabilising. He did it with Nato. But in fact, in practice, he sent more troops to Europe under his administration. He sent the first Javelins [anti-tank weapons] and weapons to Ukraine under his administration. Lammy said that Trump would not use military force to seize Greenland – despite suggesting he might. Asked if the UK should be following France and Germany in saying this would be unacceptable, Lammy replied: Let’s be serious … It’s not going to happen because no Nato allies have gone to war since the birth of Nato which Ernest Bevin, my great predecessor, was part of. Lammy said Trump’s comments should be understood as reflection of his concerns about Arctic security. He explained: Here, I suspect on Greenland, what he’s targeting is his concerns about Russia and China in the Arctic, his concerns about national economic security. He recognises, I’m sure, that in the end, Greenland today is a Kingdom of Denmark. There is a debate in Greenland about their own self determination. But behind it, I think, are his concerns about the Arctic. Of course, the US has troops and a base on Greenland. So it has got a stake in that Arctic region.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/09/uk-politics-labour-conservatives-david-lammy-trump-greenland-latest-updates	2025-01-09T01:13:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22c61051e995e1dc39b88c1bf75d8429f40446ab/98_492_4419_2652/master/4419.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=23e73b51fa9dbc1a4a372ae644056b11

UK weather: warnings remain in force across country as temperatures to fall as low as -20C	Snow, ice and fog yellow weather warnings remain in force across the UK as snow and sleet cause disruption to transport On Wednesday, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) extended its cold weather health alert for all of England until Sunday. Amber alerts have been extended and will now run until 12 January, meaning a rise in deaths is likely, the agency said. Dr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at the UKHSA, said: We are extending the duration of our cold health alert, since the Met Office are forecasting that the low temperatures we are seeing will continue further into this week, with snow and icy conditions likely to persist. This weather can have a serious impact on the health of some people, including those aged 65 and over and those with pre-existing health conditions, and it is therefore vital that we continue to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are most vulnerable.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2025/jan/09/uk-weather-warnings-snow-ice-sleet-temperatures-fall-transport	2025-01-09T00:40:17-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/108791f99685f0633a60fa0980490f310618e416/0_259_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2c93450e81ae58897127a8551b264b02

California fires live: Los Angeles fighting largest blaze in its history amid water and firefighting shortages	Palisades fire grows to more than 15,000 acres as Eaton and Hurst fires also gain in size; Biden directs DoD to deploy extra firefighters to tackle flames About 1.5 million residents are without power in southern California, with nearly a million of them in Los Angeles County, according to PowerOutage.us, as wildfires continue to rage across the region. The Palisades fire, which is the most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles’ history, has increased in size yet again – now encompassing 15,832 acres. At least two people were killed in the Eaton fire, north of Pasadena which has grown to 10,600 acres and has destroyed more than 100 structures. There have also been -a number of significant injuries-, fire officials said, and -tens of thousands of homes- are affected. About 32,500 residents were under evacuation orders, a drop from the more than 50,000 residents evacuated overnight. The Palisades fire, west of Los Angeles, has grown to 11,802 acres and destroyed more than 1,000 structures, making it the most destructive fire in the city’s history. About 37,000 residents are under evacuation orders. The Hurst fire, in the San Fernando Valley, is close to 500 acres after erupting on Tuesday night. More than 3,000 residents have been ordered to evacuate the area in Sylmar. All Los Angeles fire department air operations in the Palisades have resumed after being grounded due to extreme weather conditions. LAFD helicopters are back to dropping water and hundreds of firefighters continue to be on the scene to help respond to the Palisades fire and Hurst fire, said LA’s mayor, Karen Bass. More than 400,000 power customers were without power, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us. Another 440,000 customers could face similar shutoffs depending on weather conditions. Officials are urging residents across the region to conserve water so there is enough for firefighters to use. Demand was so high that three tanks emptied by Wednesday morning, causing some fire hydrants to dry out. California governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on Tuesday. President Joe Biden warned the recovery -is going to take time- as he attended a briefing with Newsom at a Santa Monica fire station. President-elect Donald Trump blamed Newsom’s environmental policies for the fires.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/08/california-los-angeles-fires-live-updates	2025-01-08T13:58:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea29802fba69f1cf43c2ff2d7beae28d6d1dff47/0_368_5561_3339/master/5561.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d9f68d22674127ce7c46e1ba3c13387b

Biden may preemptively pardon Liz Cheney, Anthony Fauci, after Trump’s threats of revenge – US politics live	Biden confirms he may still opt to protect Trump’s enemies from prosecution, while Trump scrambles to halt sentencing in criminal business fraud case Good morning, US politics blog readers. Joe Biden is in his final days in office, and still has a few pieces of unfinished business to deal with before he hands power to Donald Trump on 20 January. One of them is deciding whether to issue preemptive pardons to political enemies of the incoming president, such as former congresswoman Liz Cheney or Anthony Fauci, who spearheaded the fight against Covid-19 in Trump’s first term. In an interview with USA Today published today – a rare, final sit-down interview by a president who spent much of his term avoiding the press – Biden confirmed he may still opt to protect Trump’s enemies from prosecution, and signaled he would decide based on who the president-elect appoints to top roles in his administration. Meanwhile, Trump is scrambling to halt the sentencing in his criminal business fraud case that is scheduled to take place in a Manhattan court on Friday. Reuters reports that his attorneys have asked the US supreme court to intervene to pause the proceedings, though the New York judge presiding over the case has signaled he is unlikely to sentence the president-elect to jail time. We will let you if the nation’s highest court responds. Trump will this evening trek to Capitol Hill for a strategy meeting with the Republican senators tasked with enacting his administration’s priorities, ranging from mass deportations to extending tax cuts enacted during his first term. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the rightwing Georgia congresswoman, says she will introduce legislation to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the -Gulf of America-, as Trump proposed at a rambling press conference yesterday.

Trump’s appointments signal which Project 2025 goals he might advance first	Plans to stretch the law to favor Trump and drive out dissenting voices are expected to begin immediately Despite disavowing Project 2025 on the campaign trail and the people involved with creating it, Donald Trump has now tapped numerous people tied to the project for key roles in his administration as he prepares to advance some of its main goals. He acknowledged in December that he agreed with some parts of the project, but didn’t say which, claiming he didn’t read it and didn’t have any part in it. -They have some things that are very conservative and very good. They have other things that I don’t like,- he told Time magazine. He also said he thought it was -inappropriate- that the project was released ahead of the election and could have derailed his win because -they had some pretty ridiculous things in there-.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/08/trump-project-2025	2025-01-08T04:00:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cdb0cf8427e42572a0c5f648bbe90f9b508761f/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e88ec1b06a431f0e83a161e2b1761e9b
Republican v Republican: can Trump play peacemaker within his own party?	The president-elect’s intervention in Mike Johnson’s speakership win was a sign of his power over the party – but it was only the first test of many Donald Trump to the rescue. With Mike Johnson’s bid for re-election as speaker of the House of Representatives teetering, the US president-elect interrupted a golf game to talk by phone to two Republican holdouts. In short order the art of the deal prevailed: Johnson won on the first ballot.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/08/trump-johnson-musk-republican	2025-01-08T04:00:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbb24f4703ab6b0f794ef0c64283da33ada7ba39/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7ad1526e24a3a6be522c7476d5470c62

First Thing: More than 1,400 firefighters tackle ‘unprecedented’ California fires	Tens of thousands of people evacuated in southern California as winds whip blazes. Plus, the rise in ‘flaking’ out of social plans Good morning. California has deployed more than 1,400 firefighters in its attempts to quell the -unprecedented- wildfires that have ripped through the state’s south, said the California governor, Gavin Newsom. The fires, which have been fueled by a windstorm, have forced tens of thousands to evacuate their homes, including in affluent neighborhoods in Los Angeles. What are the Santa Ana winds? They’re common during the winter months in southern California, and have driven many of the state’s worst fires. They cause a drop in humidity, driving up fire risk, particularly as many areas already face drought.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/08/first-thing-more-than-1400-firefighters-deployed-to-tackle-unprecedented-california-fires	2025-01-08T03:20:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6604d61cfc10924c8032158011338a571d63ada/0_331_4788_2873/master/4788.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0e597fd8a451cc36aa88f1e1ad8f9ba0
Malawi sees influx of refugees from post-election violence in Mozambique	Marauding gangs and political unrest since October’s polls have driven thousands of Mozambicans across the border into Malawi, despite its drought, food and fuel shortages On a sunny Saturday afternoon, Manase Madia, 50, shows his Mozambican identity card. Once a sign of pride, he does not know what to believe in any more. Over the past few weeks he has seen houses being burned down, and shops and businesses looted, including his own. He now fears for his family, which has scattered in fear. At a community ground where officials are processing new arrivals before being transferred to a shelter, Madia is one of about 13,000 people who have crossed into Malawi in the past two months, seeking refuge from post-election violence in Mozambique. The arrival of the refugees, albeit in smaller numbers, is reminiscent for people here of the civil war when almost a million Mozambicans sought refuge in the neighbouring southern African nation in the 1980s and early 1990s.	https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jan/08/malawi-sees-influx-of-refugees-from-post-election-violence-in-mozambique	2025-01-08T03:02:59-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80d7b27e8a4d387686361b8e8cc8c41f73312040/422_0_1875_1125/master/1875.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1b523995f15bee171cf50963f7f2e5b4

Emilia Pérez, directed by Jacques Audiard, has been largely praised by international critics, though some noted it risked trivialising extremely sensitive issues.

Top Tory claims Elon Musk ‘may have saved humanity’ as Starmer attacks Badenoch over child safety – UK politics live	Prime minister says if Tories vote for amendment on children’s wellbeing bill, it will show ‘they are more interested in retweets than children’s safety’ as shadow business secretary praises Musk Good morning. Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch will be in the Commons today for the first PMQs of 2025 and the Tory calls for national inquiry into grooming gangs will continue to be near the top of the news agenda. That is because Badenoch is pushing for a vote on the children’s wellbeing and schools bill that would block the legislation and call on the government to set up an inquiry instead. The inquiry element is a procedural red herring because the Conservatives would have voted against the bill anyway. But, if the Speaker does allow a vote on the Tory reasoned amendment, Badenoch will be able to launch a social media campaign accusing Labour of voting against a grooming gang inquiry. The Conservatives are opposed to the bill primarily because it will restrict some of the freedoms enjoyed by academies. But the legislation also contains safeguarding measures that have widespread support, and Starmer has given an interview to the Daily Mirror saying that, if the Tories vote for their amendment, it will show they are more interested in retweets than children’s safety. He told the paper: I would implore any right-thinking Tory MP to vote for the bill because [the Conservative reasoned amendment] would kill the bill, this would kill the legislation. It would kill the provisions for a unique identifying number that will stop children falling through the cracks … No MP should be voting down children’s safeguarding measures. It’s shocking they are even thinking about this as a tactic. It’s the elevation of the desire for retweets over any real interest in the safeguarding of children. The @elonmusk purchase of X may have saved humanity. With X becoming a true freedom of speech platform, the common ground of public opinion is no longer determined by a left-leaning elite.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/08/conservatives-elon-musk-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-child-safety-pmqs-uk-politics-latest-updates	2025-01-08T01:41:29-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e40c507446dd3da2bfcb442b9e4d40b96ddd0146/0_246_7536_4522/master/7536.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6408a15555e5a791a04e82278b6fb357

A fresh weather warning is set to come into force as it is revealed that 300 properties have flooded across England since New Year’s Eve, reports the PA news agency. Dozens of people have been rescued by firefighters across Leicestershire since Monday, Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service said. Homeowners on Belton Road in Loughborough were stranded on the first floor of their semi-detached houses on Tuesday after rising water from the nearby Grand Union canal flooded the street. Patients have been urged to attend A&amp;E alone as NHS hospitals grapple with high demand amid rising flu cases. Several NHS trusts declared critical incidents due to -exceptionally high demands- in emergency departments. Hundreds of schools were closed across the UK on Tuesday, with road and rail links blocked. Manchester, Bristol and Liverpool John Lennon airports were forced to suspend flights because of the conditions. The RAC said Monday was the busiest day for breakdowns this winter.

Wednesday briefing: What Elon Musk’s focus on grooming gangs reveals about alt-right online discourse	In today’s newsletter: The owner of X, who previously said ‘civil war is inevitable’ in Britain, has stoked online unrest with incendiary comments about the UK Good morning. What is a news story in the UK? Whatever Elon Musk says it is. That is the conclusion you might draw, anyway, from the influence of the billionaire Trump adviser’s posts on X claiming that -a quarter-million little girls were – still are – being systematically raped by migrant gangs in Britain-, and demanding a new public inquiry into historic child sexual exploitation in Oldham, Rotherham, Rochdale and elsewhere. There is no reliable basis for the quarter-million figure. In any case, Prof Alexis Jay, the chair of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse in England and Wales that looked extensively at grooming gang scandals and published a series of recommendations in 2022, said yesterday that -we’ve had enough of inquiries, consultations and discussions-, and urged the government to instead implement more of her proposals. But the political energy is still around the idea of a new inquiry as some sort of panacea, and the Conservatives will try to force a vote on one in parliament today. Social media | Meta will get rid of factcheckers, -dramatically reduce the amount of censorship- and recommend more political content on Facebook and Instagram, founder Mark Zuckerberg has said. The suite of changes was met with dismay by critics, who described them as -a full bending of the knee to Trump-. British army | Afghans who were killed by members of the SAS in Afghanistan were described dismissively as having been -flat packed-, according to a former member of the elite force’s sister unit. The soldier, known only as N1799, was giving evidence to an inquiry into the deaths of 80 civilians in Helmand province. California | A fast-moving wildfire erupted in Los Angeles on Tuesday, quickly consuming nearly 3,000 acres and destroying homes in an affluent community along the Pacific Ocean. Amid a significant windstorm across much of southern California, a second unrelated blaze also forced evacuations in a different part of Los Angeles. France | Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of France’s far-right National Front party, who sent shock waves through the country when he made it to the second round of the presidential election in 2002, has died at 96. Drugs | Ketamine could be reclassified as a class A drug by the Home Office after illegal use reached record levels last year. Ministers are seeking -expert advice- on reclassification – it is currently a class B substance – after an estimated 299,000 people reported use of the drug in 2024.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/08/wednesday-briefing-what-elon-musks-focus-on-grooming-gangs-reveals-about-alt-right-online-discourse	2025-01-07T22:52:36-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e5573231a4bfc5fd11849cc4f48a2b5e07932c9/0_94_5665_3400/master/5665.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ac294ec52d863e7a55d44ee0a98d699f

Trump moves to block report on election interference and classified documents cases – US politics live	President-elect’s lawyers ask attorney general to stop release of outgoing special counsel Jack Smith’s report Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump may be less than two weeks away from returning to the White House, but his lawyers are keeping busy with motions to frustrate the final developments in his lingering criminal cases. Yesterday, they asked New York judge Juan Merchan to delay the president-elect’s sentencing on the 34 felony business fraud charges he was convicted of last year, but their motion was denied and the hearing is expected to take place on Friday. The case, brought by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, was the only one of Trump’s four criminal indictments to go to trial before his election victory in November. His prosecution in Georgia for allegedly meddling in the state’s election result four years ago has stalled, likely permanently, while special counsel Jack Smith dropped the charges he brought against Trump for allegedly hiding classified documents, and plotting to overturn the 2020 election. However, justice department regulations mandate that Smith release a report at the end of his investigations, which could bring to light damaging evidence about Trump’s actions. Late yesterday, the president-elect’s attorneys asked outgoing attorney general Merrick Garland to prevent the report’s completion. We’ll let you know if Garland makes his response known today. Donald Trump Jr is scheduled to arrive in Greenland today, the massive island that his father has talked about the United States buying from Denmark. We’ll see how that visit goes. Jimmy Carter will lie in state at the US Capitol today, with Kamala Harris laying a wreath on his casket and eulogizing him at 4.30pm ET.

Plus, Trudeau to resign as Canadian prime minister Good morning. Congress certified Donald Trump’s presidential election victory yesterday in an event heavy with symbolism, four years to the day since he incited a violent mob in attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat. What were November’s final results? Trump won the electoral college by 312 to 226, and the popular vote by a margin of about 2.5m. What did Harris say yesterday? -I do believe very strongly that America’s democracy is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it,- she told reporters. -Otherwise, it is very fragile, and it will not be able to withstand moments of crisis. And today, America’s democracy stood.- The president, Joe Biden, wrote an op-ed urging Americans not to forget the Capitol attack. What do we know about the quake’s ferocity? The US Geological Survey said the earthquake was centred in the Tibet region at a depth of about 10km (6 miles). It measured the tremor at a magnitude of 7.1, while China recorded it as 6.8.

Child abuse inquiry chair attacks ‘politicisation’ of issue and says new investigation would delay reforms – UK politics live	Prof Alexis Jay says ‘many people, sometimes in a very uninformed way, have waded into the argument’ over whether a further inquiry was needed Good morning. Keir Starmer is basking in praise from liberal, progressive Britain today for the way he hit back at calls for a new inquiry into child sexual abuse scandals, and the way they are being driven by inflammatory and false claims by Elon Musk and other rightwingers on X. But Tory Britain has yet to be persuaded, and the rightwing papers are promoting the Conservative party’s (very dubious) claim that Starmer was smearing anyone opposed to child rape as far-right. This morning Prof Alexis Jay stepped into this argument. As the main chair of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA), the eight-year, all-encompassing inquiry into child sexual abuse in Britain, she has as much authority on this subject as anyone. Today she clearly came out against calls from Musk, Reform UK, the Tories and others for a new national inquiry focusing specifically on rape or grooming gangs. No, I don’t agree with that, in the sense of requiring further and more detailed national inquiries into child sexual exploitation. We have learned quite a lot from those reviews that have already been undertaken. I think that the time has passed for more inquiries. We’ve had enough of inquiries, consultations and discussions, and especially for those victims and survivors who’ve had the courage to come forward … They clearly want action, and we have set out what action is required, and people should just get on with it, locally and nationally. I would not attribute that to everyone, but I’ve certainly been very unhappy about the politicisation of child sexual exploitation and child sexual abuse in the way that many people, sometimes in a very uninformed way, have waded into the argument.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/07/child-abuse-grooming-gangs-elon-musk-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live-updates	2025-01-07T01:14:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/981d9fd4f58f51b0473b6ae2ce0d6ada5159dc1e/0_301_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=85d64bd110195bb1473385fe74ccc762

Tuesday briefing: How Britain has coped with an Arctic blast	In today’s newsletter: Widespread flooding, snow and power outages have left thousands of households and travellers facing the aftermath of a cold snap – with more disruption to come Good morning. British winters have grown markedly milder over the past century: analysis has shown that the average UK winter has gotten 1C warmer and 15% wetter in the last century. Last February was the warmest in recorded history. There have been fewer and fewer snow days and the Met Office found that ground frost periods are three weeks shorter compared to the 1970s. Canada | Justin Trudeau has said he will step down as Canada’s prime minister. His resignation throws open the doors to a fierce political battle to be the country’s next leader, with polls showing the Liberals losing badly to the official opposition Conservatives. Child sexual exploitation | Keir Starmer has condemned Elon Musk’s increasingly erratic attacks on the government, suggesting that his -lies and misinformation- on grooming gangs were amplifying the -poison- of the far right. Ministers meanwhile promised to implement a key demand of a 2022 child sex abuse inquiry so that professionals who do not report claims of abuse will be sanctioned. US politics | The US Congress certified Donald Trump’s presidential election victory on Monday, in an event heavy with symbolism four years to the day since he incited a violent mob to disrupt a similar ceremony. Kamala Harris presided over a joint Senate and House of Representatives session to validate the result. Foster care | The UK is facing a fostering crisis where retiring carers are not being replaced by younger people, while the number of children entering care homes is rising, a charity has warned. The decline in foster carers is due to the impact of the pandemic, the costof living crisis, biological children staying at home for longer, spare rooms being used as home offices and changing family situations, Barnardo’s children’s charity said. Tibet | A magnitude 6.8 earthquake has struck near one of Tibet’s holiest cities, the China Earthquake Networks Centre has said, killing 53 people, injuring 62 and damaging buildings around Shigatse, according to state media.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/07/tuesday-briefing-how-britain-has-coped-with-an-arctic-blast	2025-01-06T22:34:35-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99894d56e5d340c61cd130ff0b7d0d2f538e2dea/0_366_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d3bb5fa4c5ed304567b96230e54ab9b7

Congress to certify Trump’s election win four years after insurrection – US politics live	Senate and House to convene in joint session to certify results four years after Trump’s supporters stormed Capitol Good morning, US politics blog readers. It is January 6, the legally designated day when the Senate and House of Representatives convene in a joint session to certify the results of the presidential election – in this case, Donald Trump’s victory two months ago. Today’s meeting comes four years after the then-president’s supporters stormed the Capitol after he addressed them outside the White House, a historic attack that Trump’s successor, Joe Biden, tried and ultimately failed to have him prosecuted over. There’s no sign that a repeat of those events will take place this year. Washington DC is socked in by a snowstorm that’s snarled roads across parts of the east coast and midwest, the Capitol is under heavy guard, and, unlike the Republicans who in 2021 tried to used procedural moves to block Biden from taking office, no congressional Democrats have signaled plans to object to Trump’s re-election during the session. The session is set to begin at 1pm ET, with Kamala Harris presiding in her role as president of the Senate. Once Trump’s victory is certified, it will clear the way for his inauguration two weeks from today, on 20 January. Trump on Sunday said he will support efforts by Republicans in Congress to pass one massive piece of legislation that will enact many of his campaign promises, including better fortifying the country’s borders and removing taxes on tips. There had been some debate among the GOP over whether to split those priorities up into separate bills, but with that decided (for now), expect Republicans to spend the next several months getting that legislation through Congress. Biden wrote on opinion piece for the Washington Post, in which he encouraged Americans not to forget the insurrection that took place four years ago today. Seven US states in the midwest and east coast have declared emergencies as a big winter storm blows through.

Convicted January 6 rioters anticipate Trump pardons four years after US Capitol attack | First Thing	‘We’re excited that we have our country back,’ one convicted man said. Plus, Adrien Brody wins Golden Globe for The Brutalist Good morning. Once back in power, Donald Trump has promised he will pardon people prosecuted over the assault on the Capitol four years ago today. Carried out by a mob of Trump’s supporters after he had addressed them outside the White House, the 6 January 2021 attack brought political violence into the halls of Congress and has been linked to nine deaths among police and rioters. How many have been charged? The justice department has charged more than 1,500 people, nearly 600 of whom have faced felony charges of assaulting or impeding law enforcement. How popular would the move be? For all the enthusiasm among Trump’s supporters, a December poll from Monmouth University found that 61% of respondents would disapprove of Trump pardoning people convicted of attacking the Capitol. What do we know about the attack? Jabber’s truck displayed an IS flag. A rifle he used in the shootout was bought privately from someone who did not know what he had planned. Officials said Jabbar – who wore body armor and a helmet – had fashioned a homemade device meant to suppress the noise of gunshots fired by the rifle. What do authorities believe about the motive? Indications suggest Jabbar fell into extremism after marital and financial woes.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/06/first-thing-convicted-january-6-rioters-anticipate-trump-pardon-us-capitol-attack	2025-01-06T02:46:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21466ef563ff78864d7783feecef3d3b336ce875/0_185_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ee0ba5980be86089357d585b859fe2ec

Firms that donated to Republican party avoided tariffs in Trump first term – study	President-elect has threatened to levy tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China, which can burden businesses With Donald Trump threatening to impose steep tariffs upon his return to office this month, US firms are bracing for impact. But an analysis of Trump’s last presidency identified one way to boost their chances of avoiding the levies: donating to the Republican party. While the initial stage of the president-elect’s tariff agenda is designed to hit America’s largest trading partners – Canada, Mexico and China – it is US firms that pick up the bill, paying duties imposed on the goods they buy from these markets. Such additional costs can prove devastating.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/06/trump-tariffs-republican-donations	2025-01-06T02:00:43-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/008731910b7066d93141ccba925061f5f888ca5d/0_273_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4447918e7479436fc771650f4f56aa07
Starmer expected to defend his record on rape gangs in Q&A after health reform speech – UK politics live updates	No 10 has previously said little about inflammatory claims from Elon Musk but issue likely to dominate questions today after major speech on NHS Good morning. Prime ministers like to focus on what they think is important and there are few issues more important in the UK than the state of the NHS. On his first proper day back at work after the Christmas holidays, Keir Starmer is giving a speech on this, and Andrew Gregory has previewed it here. I’ll be covering the speech, and reaction to it, in detail as the day goes on. The prime minister is expected to respond to [Musk’s claim that he was -complict in the rape of Britain-] on Monday as he holds a major press conference about his plans to cut NHS waiting lists. He is expected to say that he gave the -green light- to prosecuting paedophile gangs in Rochdale in 2013 and highlight the fact he introduced reforms to the way the Crown Prosecution Service handles child abuse cases. He also introduced a national network of specialist prosecutors to look into child abuse and sexual exploitation. The prime minister is also likely to issue a forthright defence of Phillips and the work she has done in tackling violence against women and girls. Both Labour and the Tories have said that Musk’s comments about Phillips are inaccurate.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/06/uk-politics-keir-starmer-nhs-reforms-grooming-gangs-live-updates	2025-01-06T01:20:24-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ae393f5f38e1c3309c50db504b7e49eb5bf8712/0_207_7240_4344/master/7240.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ae773775e7c949e11cdc684cb138c271
Middle East crisis live: Israel and Hamas wrangle over potential ceasefire and hostage deal	Disagreements over deal continue as Palestinian officials say more than 100 people died over the weekend due to Israeli bombardments Israel and Hamas are wrangling over the details of a potential deal to halt Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip and return hostages home, as Palestinian officials said intensified Israeli bombardments had killed more than 100 people over the weekend. A Hamas official said the group had approved a list of 34 Israeli hostages to be returned as part of a deal that could eventually lead to a ceasefire, Reuters reported. But Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office swiftly issued a statement on Sunday saying Hamas had not provided such a list. Israeli military airstrikes continued throughout the Gaza Strip on Sunday, with an airstrike killing five people in a house in the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza and another killing four in Jabalia in the territory’s north, Gaza health officials said. Later in the day, an airstrike hit a police station in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, killing five people, medics said. It was not immediately clear if all the people who were killed were police officers. At nightfall, medics said an Israeli airstrike had killed three people in Bureij camp in central Gaza, bringing Sunday’s death toll to 17. Two Palestinians, including a 17-year-old boy, were killed by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank on Sunday, according to the Palestinian Fatah party and the Palestinian health ministry. Palestinian media said Israeli forces opened fire on the home of a 37-year-old man in a town south of Jenin. The health ministry said the 17-year-old was killed in an Israeli raid in Askar camp in Nablus. The Israeli military said its forces killed an armed militant in the West Bank, confiscated weapons and dismantled an explosives manufacturing laboratory. Separately, it said it was looking into reports that a 17-year-old was killed. Social order in Gaza is likely to collapse further if Israel goes ahead with its threat this month to end all cooperation with the UN refugee agency for Palestinians (Unrwa), Louise Wateridge, its senior emergency officer, has warned. Gunmen opened fire on vehicles, including a passenger bus, on Monday near a village in the occupied West Bank, killing three people and injuring at least seven others, the Israeli military and emergency services said. -Paramedics have confirmed the deaths of three victims, including two women and a man,- emergency service provider Magen David Adom said, while the military reported that troops were -pursuing the terrorists- who carried out the attack near the village of Al-Funduq. Antony Blinken will meet his European counterparts Thursday in Rome on Syria, as the west looks to engage the new Islamist-led leadership. Blinken would -meet with European counterparts to advocate for a peaceful, inclusive, Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political transition-, a state department statement said as he visited Seoul on Monday. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike last year while inside the militant group’s war operations room, according to new details on Sunday disclosed by a senior Hezbollah security official, the Associated Press reports. -His eminence [Nasrallah] used to lead the battle and war from this location,- Wafiq Safa told a news conference on Sunday near the site where Nasrallah was killed. A series of Israeli airstrikes flattened several buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs on 27 September last year, killing Nasrallah.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/06/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-hamas-potential-ceasefire-hostage-deal	2025-01-06T00:35:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0052fde5a74082653f33e9a3d98220081e145a08/0_183_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e0c0dcb1664b6b87dc40d3ecfcf3284c

Ukraine waits for Trump the dealmaker to broker end of Putin’s war | Shaun Walker in Kyiv	The US president-elect’s policy on the conflict may prove decisive, but appeasing both sides will be a challenge A new year in Ukraine began in much the same way as the old one finished: with deadly Russian drone attacks across the country. In Kyiv, one person was killed and at least six others were injured in the first few hours of 2025. It is Ukraine’s third new year since Russia’s invasion. If 2023 began with hopes high that Ukrainian battlefield gains would push Russia back and lead to an outright victory, by the start of 2024 the Ukrainian army and population were already settled in for the long haul and had few illusions about a quick victory.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/04/ukraine-dealmaker-trump-putin-war-russia-zelenskyy	2025-01-04T08:29:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55c732ceca99894ff00b099c7f3d6427a9aac999/0_26_4418_2651/master/4418.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=78a1b857311b088c22bdd6b74798b492

First Thing: Arrest of South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol fails amid security force standoff	Anti-corruption officials say they were blocked by 200 presidential personnel. Plus, FBI says New Orleans terror suspect acted alone Good morning. South Korea’s political crisis took a dramatic turn on Friday when investigators were forced to abandon an attempt to arrest the impeached president, Yoon Suk Yeol, after a tense standoff with his security forces. What are the details of Friday’s standoff? Local media reports said anti-corruption officials – who are leading a joint team of police and prosecutors – entered the compound to find themselves blocked by troops under the control of the presidential security service. What happened on 3 December? Yoon declared martial law in an attempt to root out what he described as -anti-state, pro-North Korean- forces – a reference to opposition MPs in the national assembly. He did not provide any evidence for those claims, however. He was forced to lift the order six hours later after lawmakers forced their way past troops into the parliament building to vote it down. What do we know about the New Orleans attack suspect? It’s understood Jabbar was born and raised in Texas, served in the US army 2007-2015, and in 2022 was $27,000 behind on house payments, he said in court documents. Jabbar’s brother told AP that in recent months he’d isolated himself. Why didn’t steel bollards stop the attack? Seven years ago, officials began installing barriers at intersections in the French Quarter of the city. But the steel bollards were in the process of being replaced over New Year’s Eve.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/03/first-thing-arrest-of-south-korean-president-yoon-suk-yeol-fails-amid-security-force-standoff	2025-01-03T02:32:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa19edbf0482114c05b6dac6818d0ae662ff4005/0_0_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=37343acafc9f657f0c3d835c4b097dc5

Streeting defends pace of plans for adult social care reform – UK politics live	Ministers to launch historic commission to reform ‘failing’ system amid warnings the NHS risks being overwhelmed Wes Streeting has set out overnight for the Guardian his view on the new Labour government’s proposal for adult social care reform. The health secretary wrote: By 2050, there will be 4 million more people aged 65+ in England than today. If we do nothing, real social care costs are expected to nearly double by 2038, compared with 2018 numbers. Many more people will be left without the care they need, the burdens will fall on the health service and our NHS will be overwhelmed. We can’t keep paying a heavier and heavier price for failure. Our NHS can’t afford to keep bearing a heavier burden. We can’t afford not to act. Labour took a lot of flak in the general election campaign for not spelling out in more detail our plans for a National Care Service. I was honest about the reason why – general election campaigns are where plans for social care go to die. If anyone is going to help us to break the cycle of bad politics, knock heads together, and forge the national consensus I think we need on social care, it is Louise Casey. And that work will begin in April. It will report initially next year. And within three years I hope we will have built the consensus we need to build a national care service fit to meet the challenges for older and disabled people in the 21st century.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/03/wes-streeting-adult-social-care-reform-elon-musk-uk-politics-live-updates	2025-01-03T01:12:38-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1de800d53bf6061d31c375d7b1b4a6347a48125/0_304_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=70f8f898159a73578eb8d97244c6d434

Why supporters of South Korea’s impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol are flying US flags	The prominence of the US flag at conservative rallies reflects a complex intersection of religion, politics and identity that defines South Korea’s far-right movement As investigators attempted to arrest president Yoon Suk Yeol on Friday morning, his supporters gathered outside the presidential residence waving two national flags: the South Korean Taegukgi alongside the American Stars and Stripes. To outsiders, the unexpected combination may seem baffling. But to Yoon’s supporters, America represents more than an ally: it’s a perceived ideal. The symbolism of the US flag is a declaration of a broader cultural and spiritual order they believe is under threat.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/03/why-yoon-suk-yeol-supporters-us-flags-south-korea-ntwnfb	2025-01-02T20:40:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce546d01b34aa9fa6ce9034fe5c53d6d2316c5c0/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c05cf41e7304cecbece60acc911dd0a2

The question New Orleans investigators hope to answer: will there be another attack?	The FBI says the attacker acted alone, but links to Islamic State mean further violence can’t be ruled out As investigators examine the terrorist attack in New Orleans on Wednesday, they will be hoping to answer three questions: who was responsible? How was the attack executed? And why? All will be vital to answering the most pressing question of all: will there be another attack in the immediate hours or days to come? Their first priority will have been to identify the attacker. The FBI has said it believes Shamsud-Din Jabbar, the 42-year-old who drove a pickup truck into a crowd celebrating the new year, acted alone. He hired a vehicle, procured an assault rifle, as well as body armour and ammunition. He also fabricated what appeared to be several pipe bombs containing plastic explosives, which he may have pre-positioned to target police.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/02/the-question-new-orleans-investigators-hope-to-answer-will-there-be-another-attack	2025-01-02T09:35:41-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0f1e097fd9c32615a175d2239bdd7b52175f4c4/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ee642f1606deacdaf9cb135a9bbf45a2

Automatic voter registration may be an answer to UK’s troubling turnout gap	Experts say evidence from abroad shows AVR is effective – and it’s one of several proposals to try to boost voting A healthy democracy depends on people participating in it. In the UK, the proportion of people doing so is falling. Voter turnout in general elections stayed above 70% from 1945 through to 1997, hitting more than 80% in 1950 and 1951. But it collapsed to 59.4% when Tony Blair won his second term in 2001, and though it rose again between 2010 and 2019, it has not reached the 70% mark since 1997. In the 2024 election, turnout fell to 59.7%. The decline has been acute enough to trigger concern among Labour officials. Before July, the Guardian revealed they were drawing up plans to introduce automatic voter registration (AVR). In the election, when it came around, just 52% of adults living in the UK exercised their right to vote – the lowest proportion since universal suffrage was introduced. Crucially, this statistic counts all adults eligible to vote in the UK, not just those registered on the electoral roll.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/01/automatic-voter-registration-uk-turnout-gap-elections	2025-01-01T09:26:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53be2671a1f2793c6ebd77c914bd06516bd643fe/0_0_4122_2474/master/4122.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=00501a5a13da57650ec21cb5180ac23a

Cause of South Korea plane crash unclear as officials focus on bird strikes	Experts say bird strikes are relatively common and should not have been enough to cause landing gear failure No one knows for certain what caused Jeju Air flight 7C2216 to crash, killing all but two of its 181 passengers and crew.

Aviation officials focused on bird strikes – and, to a lesser extent, the weather – as the most probable cause, even as some experts said the relatively common phenomenon would not have been enough to cause a catastrophic failure of the landing gear.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/29/cause-of-south-korea-plane-crash-unclear-bird-strikes-landing-gear	2024-12-29T08:37:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/995c199518186f55d2d7edfcfc7d2c207dc08f43/0_202_5336_3203/master/5336.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fb472537199ef5f4e3ca9da26bbdc933

South Korea plane crash: all except two are presumed dead on Jeju Air flight carrying 181 people, say authorities – live updates	South Korea facing worst domestic civil aviation disaster after Boeing 737-800 with 175 passengers and six crew skidded off runway and hit wall at Muan airport Dozens are feared dead after a plane skidded off the runway while attempting a landing without landing gear at Muan international airport in South Korea on Sunday morning The exact casualty figures have not yet been tallied, though authorities are provisionally reporting that 28 people are believed to have died, according to news agency Newsis. Fire officials have warned that given the severe damage to the aircraft, the number of casualties could rise. Jeju Air flight 2216 from Bangkok to Muan was carrying 181 people – 175 passengers and six crew – when it came down, skidded along the runway and hit fencing and a wall around the perimeter before catching fire. Rescues are underway, with two people brought out of the wreckage so far. Emergency services are continuing their search operation. The Boeing 737-800 may have suffered a bird strike that caused the landing gear to fail, according news agency Yonhap. The flight had reportedly attempted one landing before being forced to -go-around- when the landing gear failed to lower normally. South Korea’s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, has ordered -all available equipment and personnel to be mobilised- for the rescue operations at Muan international airport in the country’s south-west and is heading to the crash site, about 300km from the capital, Seoul. The pilot of Jeju Air flight 2216 from Bangkok appeared to be attempting a belly landing after the plane’s landing gear failed to deploy properly, Yonhap is reporting.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/29/south-korea-plane-crash-casualties-reported-after-jeju-air-flight-veers-off-runway-at-muan-airport-live-updates	2024-12-29T01:09:56-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/470559518cf35b65bd8d6e9b828d563f02a1f00d/0_117_1400_840/master/1400.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=001b79d0ae7302e544233bafa7723932
