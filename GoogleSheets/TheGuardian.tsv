‘She is an eyewitness’- how Merkel’s ‘office manager’ played key role in memoir	Little-known Beate Baumann’s partnership with the former German chancellor goes back to 1992 In the opening of her autobiography, Freedom, Angela Merkel is clear: she couldn’t have written it without one key person. Neither her sister, Irene Kasner, warmly acknowledged at the close of her book for having helped bring -memories of my childhood and youth back to life-, nor her husband, Joachim Sauer, who she thanks for his constant support. The individual without whom one of the most highly anticipated political memoirs in years might not have happened is Beate Baumann. The 61-year-old has worked at Merkel’s side for over 30 years, having first been recruited by her as an office manager. When Merkel retired in 2021, Baumann, it was understood, would continue by her side, but from now on under the revised title of -political adviser of the out-of-service German chancellor-.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/01/angela-merkel-how-office-manager-played-key-role-in-autobiography-germany	2024-12-01T00:52:57-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c68d7796565a357dfce7269f4f116c7d2b3889cf/0_0_3903_2342/master/3903.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d8469777df028a6fe85c4ff7f9709178

Labour urged to take immediate action on palliative care after MPs back assisted dying – UK politics live	Layla Moran, chair of the health and social care select committee said Wes Streeting should be taking a more proactive approach to the issue Liberal Democrat Layla Moran, chair of the health and social care select committee, voted for the assisted dying bill in the House of Commons yesterday. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, she said she has -long believed, especially in the cases of terminally ill adults, that they should have that choice at the end of life-. I’ve been moved by personal experiences, my best friend’s mother contracted cancer about 20 years ago and we lived in Belgium at the time. She started the process but in fact died before she was able to complete the legal part of the process because the cancer was so aggressive. I saw how taking back that little bit of control in her life was important to her. I was disappointed. I was expecting an announcement from Wes Streeting yesterday to say ‘look, we’ve heard and we are going to do something’ … immediate funding commitments and a view to making sure this is dealt with in the next year or two. I would argue that, whether this passes or not, that is one of the key messages that came out of the debate. Those who don’t want an assisted death and don’t want to take part in providing assisted dying can opt out of it, don’t have to do it, don’t choose to end their lives that way. So it offers everyone equal choice, whatever their religion.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/30/assisted-dying-bill-uk-politics-latest-news-kim-leadbeater-labour	2024-11-30T00:44:21-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3e77a13b9f797982fb881d688a8436474ad698c/0_131_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4ac8df8a0b38a1ed458e902b633ef390

Ukraine war live: Russian defence minister says ties with North Korea ‘expanding in all areas’ during visit	Andrei Belousov arrives in Pyongyang for political and military talks; Putin threatens Kyiv with hypersonic missile Photos released by Russia’s defence ministry showed Belousov walking alongside North Korean defense minister, No Kwang Chol, on a red carpet laid out at a Pyongyang airport. According to the AP, North Korean military officials were seen clapping under a banner that read: Complete support and solidarity with the fighting Russian army and people.- Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike Kyiv with Oreshnik missiles, an intermediate-range weapon that Moscow used against the city of Dnipro last week and that Putin has claimed cannot be shot down by any air defence system. It came after Moscow pummelled Ukraine’s energy grid in an attack that left a million people without power. Russia fired more than 90 missiles and about 100 drones during the barrage, according to Kyiv, with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy urging his allies to respond firmly to what he dubbed Russian -blackmail-. Putin said the fresh bombardment was a -response- to Ukrainian strikes on his territory with western missiles. Russian drone attacks on Ukraine injured at least eight people and damaged residential buildings in the capital Kyiv and in the southern Odesa region overnight, officials said on Friday. Ukraine’s air force said in a statement that, of 132 drones launched against the country overnight, it had downed 88 drones, while 41 were -lost-, likely due to electronic warfare, and one returned to the Russian territory. Georgian riot police deployed teargas and water cannon against demonstrators protesting a government decision to delay asking for EU accession, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reporters witnessed. Thousands rallied in the capital Tbilisi and cities across Georgia after prime minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, announced the decision amid a post-election crisis that saw the country’s president challenge the legitimacy of the newly elected parliament and government. Donald Trump’s plan to tap the retired US Lt Gen Keith Kellogg as US envoy to Ukraine and Russia has triggered renewed interest in a policy document he co-authored. It proposes ending the war by withdrawing weapons from Ukraine if it does not enter peace talks – and giving even more weapons to Ukraine if Russia does not do the same.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/29/ukraine-war-live-russian-defence-minister-north-korea-military-vladimir-putin-volodymyr-zelenskyy	2024-11-29T00:38:40-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f9c8a0edaf3f3d8e4e60246c774f905e2cab823/320_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eefa3c77b1f0aa0bb7734f86bcd0cc96

Weather tracker: Indonesia flash floods and landslides leave dozens dead	Rescuers in Sumatra search for people trapped in cars after landslide triggered by torrential rainfall Last week, torrential rainfall across Indonesia’s largest island, Sumatra, triggered flash floods and landslides, causing widespread destruction. Twenty people died earlier this week in four areas in North Sumatra province amid flash floods and landslides. On Thursday morning, another devastating landslide claimed seven more lives. This landslide struck the main access route between Medan, the provincial capital, and surrounding regions, burying vehicles – including a tourist bus – in mud, rocks, and trees. More than 10 people were injured as a result and rushed to the nearest hospital in Medan. Rescue efforts are continuing, with several vehicles still trapped in the debris. North Sumatra’s traffic director estimated that it may take up to two days to evacuate those affected. Flash floods and landslides are a frequent occurrence in Indonesia owing to seasonal rainfall from October to March, caused by the Asia-Australia monsoon circulation system. This phenomenon causes wind to blow from Asia to Australia, bringing increased water vapour and consequential rainfall to Indonesia. Teleconnections such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation can also influence rainfall patterns, with the likely upcoming La Niña phase expected to bring further extreme weather by the end of the year, intensifying the risk of flooding and landslides as sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean drop below average and easterly trade winds strengthen, pushing additional moisture into the region.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/29/weather-tracker-indonesia-flash-floods-landslides-dozens-dead-sumatra	2024-11-29T00:04:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96c6dd4a54edadd20fafb546714e2bed630c07f6/0_37_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5581eef7e0fca0ac384536017b49ef79

Canada’s federal government and the premiers of the 10 provinces have agreed to work together against a threat by the US president-elect, Donald Trump, to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian imports, with one official saying the country was already examining possible retaliatory measures. What are tariffs? A tariff is a tax on imports, or foreign goods brought into a country, and paid for by the importing companies. The way that tariffs work, in Trump’s mind, is that high tariffs will incentivize American companies to move their manufacturing from abroad to the US. What did political commentators have to say?

The young man who escaped Wandsworth prison offered a mixed picture of ineptitude and threat, according to police At the heart of the Daniel Khalife trial has been the question: is he an amateurish fantasist who convinced himself he was playing a game of chess with spies, or a consequential character in the global world of espionage? The answer, the police have said, is a bit of both. They believed Khalife to be inept in many regards. Khalife’s own barrister, Gul Nawaz Hussain KC, said he was -hapless- and -sometimes bordering on the slapstick- – more Scooby-Doo than 007.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/28/daniel-khalife-a-fantasist-or-a-player-in-the-world-of-spies	2024-11-28T03:15:55-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70d9286b9ae1df4d1c28a8a40f61d5b33c96c8ed/0_30_2443_1465/master/2443.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b00b4025b5739ae2b213bc03f7404185

Net migration falling, latest figures expected to show, as Tories claim it is due to their visa rule changes – UK politics live	Kemi Badenoch gave speech on Wednesday referring to James Cleverly’s 2023 visa rule changes, while government says it is important to tackle causes of high migration Good morning. The latest immigration figures are out this morning, but the political debate about them has already started. They are expected to show net migration figures falling, and the Conservatives say that is because of decisions they took before the general election. They are referring to the sweeping changes to visa rules announced by James Cleverly in December last year. Kemi Badenoch deployed this line at the start of her speech on immigration yesterday, saying: Tomorrow, immigration figures will be released that should show a drop in net migration. This is because of the changes we made in the last year of the Conservative government. The figures we saw for 2023 were astonishing. They highlighted a big problem we must be honest about. Even if we see a decline in tomorrow’s data, the fact is immigration, both legal and illegal, is too high. We want to see net migration coming down, but we have to do so in a way that is tackling the causes of net migration, because if much of net migration has been driven by recruiting workers from overseas, you also have to look at what the impact on the economy would be.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/28/figures-net-migration-expected-falling-conservatives-labour-uk-politics-latest-updates	2024-11-28T01:03:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70649bde267d16e1958aae6630b191bf22f59c17/0_331_5693_3418/master/5693.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c42318f385f554a258bbf49cc5210a1d

Middle East crisis live: Hezbollah says its hands are still ‘on the trigger’ amid uneasy ceasefire	Iran-backed Lebanese militia says it remains ‘fully equipped’ and will monitor Israel’s withdrawal In its first statement since a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah took effect on Wednesday, the Lebanese militia proclaimed -victory- without making any direct mention of the ceasefire. The militia said its fighters -remain fully equipped to deal with the aspirations and assaults of the Israeli enemy- and that its forces would monitor Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon -with their hands on the trigger-. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said the Lebanon ceasefire was the -first ray of hope- in the regional conflict after the -darkness of the past months-. -It is essential that those who signed the ceasefire commitment respect it in full,- Guterres said on Wednesday. He reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. In a sign of how volatile the situation remains, Israeli forces opened fire on a number of cars that attempted to enter what it said was a restricted area on Wednesday. Doubts over whether the ceasefire would hold were widespread on both sides. Supporters of Hezbollah, which has suffered heavy losses since October 2023, celebrated the group’s survival and waved its yellow and green flag across southern Beirut on Wednesday. Iran, Hezbollah’s ally, welcomed the end of Israel’s -aggression- in Lebanon. In Israel, the ceasefire has met a more mixed reaction where rightwingers and residents of Israel’s north have criticised the agreement. Dozens of people gathered outside the Israeli army’s headquarters in Tel Aviv on Tuesday night to protest against the ceasefire. The French government has claimed that Benjamin Netanyahu has immunity from arrest warrants issued by the international criminal court (ICC) for war crimes on the grounds that Israel is not an ICC member. The claim came soon after Netanyahu’s cabinet agreed to a French-backed ceasefire in Lebanon and is in contrast to Paris’s attitude towards last year’s ICC war crimes warrant issued against Vladimir Putin, another leader of a non-member country. Netanyahu said Israel had submitted to the ICC its intention to appeal against the arrest warrants, and demand a delay in their implementation. In a statement from his office, he said: -Should the ICC reject the appeal, this will underscore to Israel’s friends in the US and around the world how biased the ICC is against the state of Israel.- The ceasefire in Lebanon came after Israel launched the heaviest day of raids on Beirut, including a series of strikes in the city’s centre. At least 42 people were killed in Israeli strikes on Beirut and the south of Lebanon before the ceasefire began. Hezbollah also fired rockets into Israel, triggering air raid sirens. In Gaza, the death toll passed 44,282 on Wednesday. Gaza’s health ministry said an additional 104,880 Palestinians have been injured since October 2023. An Egyptian security delegation is reportedly expected to travel to Israel on Thursday to discuss a Gaza ceasefire deal. The US will renew a push for a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory, president Joe Biden said. At least 12 Palestinians, including children and women, were killed in an Israeli strike on a school in central Gaza City on Wednesday, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. A pregnant woman and two other Palestinians were killed in Israeli bombing in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza and Khan Younis in the south on Wednesday, Wafa reported. Two journalists were injured when Israeli forces -opened fire- on a group of journalists covering a border town of Khiam in south-east Lebanon on Wednesday, Lebanon’s National news agency said. A video journalist told AFP that he was shot at while reporting in Khiam and that it was clear that the group were journalists. The Biden administration is reportedly pushing ahead with a $680m arms sales package to Israel. The package includes thousands of joint direct attack munition kits (JDAMs) and hundreds of small-diameter bombs, Reuters reported.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/28/israel-gaza-lebanon-benjamin-netanyahu-hamas-hezbollah-middle-east-crisis-live-latest-news-updates	2024-11-28T00:25:25-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67ec4c3c7f7bfac7e41d7b87f56fbef518be533c/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9c6bb63a05c0d7b49bb26f2ff9fef0a3

Thursday briefing: The Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire brings respite – but for how long, and what comes next?	In today’s newsletter: Behind the celebratory scenes on the streets of Beirut lies a battered, divided country teetering on the brink of becoming a failed state • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. At 4am local time on Wednesday, a ceasefire began between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. By that time, some displaced residents of Lebanon’s devastated south were already on their way back, many of them wondering as they travelled whether the homes they had fled were still there. The pause in hostilities has been broadly welcomed in Lebanon, Israel and beyond, both for those who have been exiled on either side of the border and as a step towards regional stability. There are even some optimistic claims that it might help bring about a ceasefire in Gaza. But as the Lebanon ceasefire begins, a formidable task remains: the reconstruction of a shattered region of a country that is perilously close to being a failed state. Assisted dying | The former president of the supreme court, who ruled on the most high-profile assisted dying cases, has declared his support for the law change.

UK government failing to list use of AI on mandatory register	Technology secretary admits Whitehall departments are not being transparent over way they use AI and algorithms Not a single Whitehall department has registered the use of artificial intelligence systems since the government said it would become mandatory, prompting warnings that the public sector is -flying blind- about the deployment of algorithmic technology affecting millions of lives. AI is already being used by government to inform decisions on everything from benefit payments to immigration enforcement, and records show public bodies have awarded dozens of contracts for AI and algorithmic services. A contract for facial recognition software, worth up to £20m, was put up for grabs last week by a police procurement body set up by the Home Office, reigniting concerns about -mass biometric surveillance-. The Department for Work and Pensions has been using generative AI to read more than 20,000 documents a day to -understand and summarise correspondence- after which the full information is then shared with officials for decision-making. It has automated systems for detecting fraud and error in universal credit claims, and AI assists agents working on personal independence payment claims by summarising evidence. This autumn, DWP started deploying basic AI tools in jobcentres, allowing work coaches to ask questions about universal credit guidance in an attempt to improve the effectiveness of conversations with jobseekers. The Home Office deploys an AI-powered immigration enforcement system, which critics call a -robo-caseworker-. An algorithm is involved in shaping decisions, including returning people to their home countries. The government describes it as a -rules-based- rather than AI system, as it does not involve machine-learning from data. It says it brings efficiencies by prioritising work, but that a human remains responsible for each decision. The system is being used amid a rising caseload of asylum seekers who are subject to removal action, now at about 41,000 people. Several police forces use facial recognition software to track down suspected criminals with the help of artificial intelligence. These have included the Metropolitan police, South Wales police and Essex police. Critics have warned that such software -will transform the streets of Britain into hi-tech police line-ups-, but supporters say it catches criminal suspects and the data of innocent passersby is not stored. NHS England has a £330m contract with Palantir to create a huge new data platform. The deal with the US company that builds AI-enabled digital infrastructure and is led by Donald Trump backer Peter Thiel has sparked concerns about patient privacy, although Palantir says its customers retain full control of the data. An AI chatbot is being trialled to help people navigate the sprawling gov.uk government website. It has been built by the government’s digital service using OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology. Redbox, another AI chatbot for use by civil servants in Downing Street and other government departments, has also been deployed to allow officials to quickly delve into secure government papers and get rapid summaries and tailored briefings.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/uk-government-failing-to-list-use-of-ai-on-mandatory-register	2024-11-27T22:00:35-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdbafee376c2dcd8d17cdcaadfcffac973ec621c/0_130_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b86a5381c13f58ac5e5531798a62b005

‘Stay true to yourself and hit post’: a flashy, absurd night at Australia’s TikTok awards	More than 3m votes were cast for this year’s awards, which went heavy on T-shirt guns and brand activations, but stayed quiet on the government’s proposed social media ban Between them, the Australian online personalities who took the stage at the annual TikTok awards on Wednesday have more than 100 million followers – but if you’re over the age of 30, you probably haven’t heard of any of them. About 3.4m public votes were cast for this year’s TikTok awards, which honour the top creators in categories like beauty, fitness, food, comedy and music. Just about everyone at the invite-only event found fame in a particular niche.

Peace is shaky at best, as Israel will still strike targets in Lebanon and a power transition looms in the US The Biden administration has claimed the long-awaited ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel as a diplomatic triumph achieved under tremendous pressure during a lame-duck period with a hostile Donald Trump administration waiting in the wings. Speaking from a lectern in the Rose Garden of the White House, Joe Biden called the result -historic- and said that it -reminds us that peace is possible-. It would return civilians to their homes, he said, and had -determined this conflict will not be just another cycle of violence-.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/27/biden-hezbollah-israel-ceasefire	2024-11-27T11:39:45-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fc681c60d7bb3216b060a17971a478bf9dd6906/0_18_5940_3565/master/5940.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b0c4c61399c95946afdfe79cff089292

Follow today’s news live Good morning and welcome to our live blog from Canberra on what promises to be a very busy day in Parliament House. I’m Martin Farrer, bringing you the best of our overnight stories before Emily Wind gears up to helm the day’s coverage. The Albanese government is going to try pushing 37 bills through the Senate today as the session heads towards a frantic conclusion.

We’re reporting exclusively this morning that the government has all but abandoned its contentious plan to increase the tax on superannuation balances over $3m.

Trump transition process raises ‘concerns about corruption’, top senator says – US politics live	US senator Elizabeth Warren says transition agreement between Trump team and White House fails to answer key questions about FBI vetting and security The MOU was supposed to be signed weeks ago, before the election. Trump has already indicated he will sidestep standard transition processes, including, The Guardian has reported, by issuing security clearances to appointees without requiring FBI background checks. In refusing to sign a transition agreement with the DOJ regarding FBI background checks, the incoming Trump administration stands to forgo access to classified information from Biden administration officials. Lawmakers have already raised concerns about key Trump appointees avoiding the standard security clearance process – which will likely arise during senate confirmation hearings early next year. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the incoming Trump and outgoing Biden administrations outlining some terms of the transfer of power departs from the norm in a few key ways, which is raising eyebrows on Washington. The Trump team said the transition will be privately funded and will not utilize -government buildings or technology [...] and will operate as a self-sufficient organization.- Susie Wiles, Trump’s incoming chief of staff said the transition team -has an existing ethics plan-, which she said would be uploaded to the General Services Administration website. Warren called Trump’s use of private funds -nothing more than a ploy for well-connected Trump insiders to line their pockets while pretending to save taxpayers money.- She expressed -concerns of corruption-. There is a fresh flurry of Trump appointments. Among those announced last night were John Phelan, an investor and Trump campaign donor, as his pick for secretary of the Navy, and Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford University health researcher who opposed Covid-19 lockdowns, to head the National Institutes of Health.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/27/donald-trump-transition-us-politics-updates	2024-11-27T06:24:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd455029b6f71b0400472eea9f342ffda3b2158/0_195_3528_2119/master/3528.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b41aa2fb0d8488ba1e6028215148d2e2

‘An emotional wrench’: Smithfield traders absorb news that market is to close	Stunned workers at London meat market first established in 1133 say closure will mean end of a way of life The junction at Cowcross Street marks the place where for centuries cattle were driven daily to London’s Smithfield Market. Nearby Cock Lane is another street name linked to the meat and poultry trade centred here since the 12th century, although some accounts attribute its origin to it being the only licensed place for sex work in the medieval city. Soon these will be among the last vestiges of a truly historic site that was central to London life, feeding the city’s people, dispensing justice as a place of public execution and even, in a shameful chapter from the early 19th century, providing a place where a man wishing to avoid a costly divorce could sell his wife.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/27/an-emotional-wrench-smithfield-traders-absorb-news-that-market-is-to-close	2024-11-27T05:39:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c5c7abf6f9f701e6d903e84f599d65f9dba9df6/0_274_8192_4915/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b8d8322282156a6d159627b801d9a6a7

First Thing: Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire in Lebanon takes effect	Reports of cars heading south inside Lebanon despite Israeli army warning. Plus, record South Korea snowfall Good morning. A highly anticipated ceasefire aimed at ending the 14-month-old war between Israel and Hezbollah officially came into effect early this morning, hours after Joe Biden hailed the -historic- moment. The ceasefire began at 4am in Lebanon after the heaviest day of raids on Beirut, including a series of strikes in the city’s centre, since Israel stepped up its air campaign in Lebanon in late September before sending in ground troops. What does the ceasefire stipulate? The resolution calls for the withdrawal of Hezbollah fighters north of the Litani River – about 18 miles from the Lebanon-Israel border – and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon. What other views does Bhattacharya hold? He has questioned the safety of vaccines, testified against the effectiveness of face masks, and argued that NIH officials should not be involved with scientific policy.

Liz Truss opposes assisted dying bill saying NHS should be ‘protecting lives, not ending them’ – UK politics live	The Telegraph, which first reported Truss’s stance, also said Theresa May and Boris Johnson were against the bill Good morning. We have got PMQs later, which means party politics will probably dominate for much of the day in the chamber, but increasingly MPs are preoccupied with a free vote, non-partisan matter, the vote on the assisted dying bill on Friday. This morning there are at least two interesting developments on that story. Three former Conservative prime ministers are all opposed to the bill, the Telegraph is reporting. The paper has a quote from Liz Truss who says: It is wrong in principle: organs of the state like the NHS and the judicial system should be protecting lives, not ending them. No doubt, as we have seen in Canada, vulnerable people would be put under appalling pressure to end their lives early. The law would be ripe for being exploited by the unscrupulous. MPs should vote this terrible Bill down and instead focus on improving health services. Added to Gordon Brown’s intervention last week, that makes four former PMs opposed to a change in the law. There’s still no word from Rishi Sunak, David Cameron, Tony Blair or John Major … or really from Keir Starmer, for that matter. Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP who has tabled the private member’s bill being debated on Friday, has criticised the MPs who have called for the bill to be voted down to allow time for a full policy review. Four Labour backbenchers are among the seven MPs who have tabled an amendment to this effect. The amendment does not oppose assisted dying in principle. In an interview with the Today programme this morning, Leadbeater said the amendment was -disappointing- because, if passed, it would stop the Commons voting on the substance of the bill. She explained: The route of the private member’s bill is absolutely the right route for taking this legislation through. That means that there can be a free vote by all MPs. It is not a government bill. The government has a neutral position on this and, sadly, the amendment that a handful of MPs have put forward is disappointing in that the public clearly want this debate to take place, and I think we’ve got responsibilities as parliamentarians to make sure that that debate does take place. In terms of time and scrutiny, look, this is not a new debate. This debate has been going on for decades. It’s been going on, as you quite rightly said, particularly in recent years, in no short part to due to high-profile campaigners like Esther Rantzen. But I think we can already see from what’s happened in the last few months, this bill will receive more scrutiny and more discussion and more debate, probably, than any piece of legislation.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/27/pmqs-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-assisted-dying-bill-liz-truss-labour-tories	2024-11-27T01:20:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ac03c9aaf03f4cfbc7d96d74ae5b39629faec31/0_119_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a3d29f36ef9f4f4da03a138da0b229a1

Wednesday briefing: Why was the UK so poorly prepared for extreme flooding?

Storm Bert brought heavy rain, gale-force winds and snow across the country last weekend, overwhelming flood defences already described as being in disrepair. Parts of south Wales and south-west England, where a month of rain pummelled sodden towns and villages, fared particularly badly. Middle East | A highly anticipated ceasefire aimed at ending the 14-month-old war between Israel and Hezbollah officially came into effect early on Wednesday morning, hours after Joe Biden hailed the -historic- agreement. The ceasefire officially began at 4am in Lebanon after the heaviest day of raids on Beirut by Israel including a series of strikes in the city centre. Health | Plans to end the deepening crisis in access to NHS dental care are failing, leaving patients unable to get treatment, according to a warning from the National Audit Office. A pledge to provide an extra 1.5m treatments in England this year is in disarray amid falls in both the number of dentists doing NHS work and people receiving help from them. Russia | Russia said it was expelling a British diplomat for alleged spying as tensions between London and Moscow rose after Ukraine starting using British weapons to strike deeper into Russia. The Kremlin has also banned cabinet ministers including Angela Rayner, Yvette Cooper and Rachel Reeves from entering the country under sanctions announced by Moscow’s foreign affairs ministry. World | Keir Starmer’s national security adviser is to travel to Washington as the UK government tries to persuade Donald Trump not to rip up the Chagos Islands agreement. Business | The owner of Vauxhall has plans to close its van factory at Luton, in a decision that will put 1,100 jobs at risk of cuts or moving location. Stellantis will shift van production to another factory at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, blaming the UK’s economic conditions and the government’s zero-emission vehicle mandate.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/27/wednesday-briefing-first-edition-storm-bert-flooding	2024-11-26T22:42:25-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a824a434c7779b0b36b24ca00d12ff3d1ba0ad26/0_716_6727_4038/master/6727.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=415f56cca9194ae4e82152964a32c1dd

The conflict began 13 months ago when the powerful Lebanese militia began firing rockets and shells at Israel a day after the Palestinian group Hamas attacked Israel, triggering the Gaza war.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/26/what-would-a-ceasefire-between-israel-and-hezbollah-entail-and-would-it-be-successful	2024-11-26T06:06:57-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55e4cc8457d6ee02fb2875adbd634801eabf6e58/0_357_5351_3211/master/5351.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=24bced41077d08c9afdbd3cb34bf4780

Trump’s picks to reward top donors who helped him win, watchdogs say	President-elect taps allies to roll back rules and cut taxes in ‘nakedly transactional’ ploy critics call ‘unprecedented’ Donald Trump has quickly tapped big donors and political allies for top posts to roll back environmental and health regulations, cut taxes and government spending in ways that will benefit key backers, say government watchdogs. Armed with blueprints to expand presidential power in aggressive ways and backed by a bevy of billionaire donors and ultra loyalists who helped him win, the president-elect’s transactional style of awarding powerful posts to backers such as X owner Elon Musk, or allies of others such as fracking mogul Harold Hamm, is seen as -unprecedented-, and will likely boost their bottom lines, say critics.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/26/trump-administration-loyalists-donors	2024-11-26T06:00:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/883561e09f5fca99223b4525a278aaebd1311842/0_9_7610_4569/master/7610.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=75e0b63a821f5271b48f9221f72bb9b3
Albanese government says Australia on target to reduce emissions – but campaigners say they could do more	Departmental analysis includes contentious measurements, but climate minister says government is cleaning up after ‘decade of denial, delay, dysfunction and utter neglect’ The Australian government will claim it is on track to meet its legislated 43% emissions reduction target by 2030 after a departmental analysis found it had improved its position over the past year. The government said annual emissions projections, based on an assessment of government policies and other trends, suggest national climate pollution would be at least 42.6% less than 2005 levels by the end of the decade, compared with 37% last year. The forecast included the impact of an underwriting scheme for new large-scale renewable energy and batteries, and vehicle efficiency standards that from next year require auto companies to start selling more zero and low-emissions cars.

Keir Starmer’s jobs plan won’t work because Labour are ducking tough welfare decisions, Tories claim – UK politics live	PM set to unveil what government calls 'biggest employment reforms in generation’ as Tories say he is not making tough calls on sickness and benefits Good morning. Today the government is unveiling what it is calling, in the headline on its overnight press release, the -biggest employment reforms in a generation-. The reforms are intended to tackle the fact that Britain is the only major economy where the employment rate has fallen over the last five years, largely because more people are out of work due to long-term ill health. A white paper called Get Britain Working is being published later, and Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, is due to make a statement in the Commons later. In its overnight briefing, the Department for Work and Pensions has already flagged up numerous initiatives which are in the white paper. Overall, the focus seems to be more carrot than stick. -Our reforms put an end to the culture of blaming and shaming people who for too long haven’t been getting the support they need to get back to work,- Keir Starmer says. But quite a lot of key decisions have been postponed, and at this point it is hard to assess quite how significant, or effective, these meaures will turn out to be. The history of welfare reform is littered with announcements that don’t quite live up to -biggest in a generation- hype. From the broken NHS, flatlining economy, and the millions of people left unemployed and trapped in an inactivity spiral – this government inherited a country that simply isn’t working. But today we’ve set out a plan to fix this. A plan that tackles the biggest drivers of unemployment and inactivity and gives young people their future back through real, meaningful change instead of empty rhetoric and sticking plaster politics. We’re overhauling jobcentres to make them fit for the modern age. We’re giving young people the skills and opportunities they need to prepare them for the jobs of the future. We’re fixing the NHS so people get the treatment and mental health support they desperately need to be able to get back to work. We’re working with businesses and employers to better support people with disabilities and health conditions to stay and progress in work, and it doesn’t stop there. This latest announcement shows that Labour are not prepared to take the tough but necessary choices to bring down the benefits bill. There is no attempt to match the £12bn in welfare savings we promised in our manifesto. They have even dodged the difficult decisions on sickness benefits, which are needed to make the welfare system sustainable in the long term.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/26/keir-starmer-labour-tory-jobs-plan-latest-politics-news-live	2024-11-26T01:12:29-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/396526c1795bdd6274c80e27394d70ceef3e46fb/1710_861_2386_1432/master/2386.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5729f894b4741f76313b9342987af6ed
Russia-Ukraine war live: record number of Russian drones fired overnight	Ukraine’s military shoots down 76 out of 188 weapons with Kyiv coming under attack and critical infrastructure hit in Ternopil Welcome to our coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine with the news that Russia has fired 188 drones into Ukraine, the highest number in a single night. Ukraine’s military said on Tuesday it shot down 76 of the weapons, adding it lost track of 96 of the drones, likely due to active electronic warfare, and five drones headed towards Belarus. The British foreign secretary has said the UK is not sending troops into Ukraine, after Le Monde reported on Monday that France and the UK are -not ruling out- such a move. When he was asked about the report in an interview, David Lammy said the UK’s position had not changed. -We are very clear that we stand ready and continue to support the Ukrainians with training particularly, but there has been a longstanding position that we are not committing UK troops to the theatre of action,- he told newspapers La Repubblica, Le Monde and Die Welt at the G7 foreign ministers’ meeting in Italy. Russian forces are advancing in Ukraine at the fastest rate since the early days of the 2022 invasion, taking an area half the size of Greater London over the past month, analysts and war bloggers say. The war is entering what some Russian and western officials say could be its most dangerous phase after Moscow’s forces made some of their biggest territorial gains. -Russia has set new weekly and monthly records for the size of the occupied territory in Ukraine,- independent Russian news group Agentstvo said in a report. The Russian army captured almost 235 sq km (91 sq miles) in Ukraine over the past week, a weekly record for 2024, it said. Ambassadors from Ukraine and Nato’s 32 members will meet on Tuesday in Brussels over Russia’s firing last week of an experimental hypersonic intermediate-range missile. Russia on Thursday carried out a strike on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro which President Vladimir Putin said was a test of its new Oreshnik missile. But, according to the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency, expectations are low for any major results from the consultations on Tuesday afternoon at the alliance’s Brussels headquarters. The most that is expected is a reiteration of Nato’s earlier insistence that Moscow’s deployment of the new weaponry will not -deter Nato allies from supporting Ukraine-. A new Nato mission located in Wiesbaden will take over the coordination of western military aid for Ukraine in January, Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said on Monday. The setting up of NSATU – Nato Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine – has been months in the planning and is widely seen as an effort to safeguard the aid mechanism against interference by Donald Trump. Europeans will step up military support for Ukraine, Pistorius pledged, after talks in Berlin with his British, French, Italian and Polish counterparts. -Our target must be to enable Ukraine to act out of a position of strength,- Pistorius said after hosting a meeting of the five leading nations in European defence.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-record-russian-drones-ukraine-kyiv-nato	2024-11-26T00:44:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c85b1351e1c2e49101a28111624134ea7c2207e/0_210_4220_2533/master/4220.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4a1a5ce9f8438d445a72e6272b9f7736

Tuesday briefing: Why everyone’s suddenly worked up about ‘non-crime hate incidents’	In today’s newsletter: A police visit to a Daily Telegraph columnist about a tweet unleashed a barrage of coverage – but the story is more complicated than it appears • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. A journalist visited by police over an erroneous tweet. A barber accused of racism over a dodgy haircut. And someone in Warwickshire reported for refusing to shake hands. These are some of the examples cited in recent days in an escalating media storm over -non-crime hate incidents- recorded by police. The problem, frequently laid at the door of the woke mob, is so catastrophically vexing that former Conservative MEP and Daily Telegraph columnist Daniel Hannan declared it evidence of -the bleak reality of our DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] police state-. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, has now said that the police should apply a -common sense and consistent approach-, an apparent nod to the criticisms of how the system works. And there are some reasonable objections to the status quo. But there are also important reasons for its existence that have very little to do with haircuts or handshakes. Unemployment | Teenagers will get training at the Premier League, Royal Shakespeare Company and Channel 4 in a government drive to get hundreds of thousands into jobs or education. The scheme is part of a suite of changes to the welfare system and out-of-work support being announced today. US politics | Donald Trump said on Monday he would sign an executive order imposing a 25% US tariff on products from Mexico and Canada. He said the tariffs would only be lifted if Mexico and Canada clamp down on migrants and illegal drugs crossing the border, and promised an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports. Storm Bert | Forecasters, environment officials and politicians have been criticised over the warnings issued before Storm Bert and the fitness of flood defences to cope with increasingly common extreme weather. The Met Office defended its work, saying that the storm was -well forecast, 48 hours in advance-. Regulation | Britain’s financial sector watchdog is -incompetent at best, dishonest at worst-, according to a damning report by MPs and Lords which called for a big shake-up. An examination of the Financial Conduct Authority found -very significant shortcomings- after a series of financial scandals. Health | Weight-loss drugs can reduce the risk of worsening kidney function, kidney failure and dying from kidney disease by a fifth, according to a study. Compared with placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists like Ozempic reduced the risk of kidney failure by 16% and the worsening of kidney function by 22%, Victim-led hate reporting has had significant and important positive impacts for police, and communities, in diagnosing harm, extremism, and failing integration or community-cohesion efforts … We all know that recording rules can be complex, but they should not be a concern to a victim at their time of distress.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/26/tuesday-briefing-why-everyones-suddenly-worked-up-about-non-crime-hate-incidents	2024-11-25T22:57:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39ed9cf6cf7349a2cc382a02b9c05af036683716/0_4_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2b19407d555432baa586b9a44ca5a829

Iranian artist Maryam Tafakory wins the 2024 Film London Jarman award	Tafakory’s blend of reality and fiction is ‘a compelling exploration of displacement, memory and resistance’ according to the judging panel Iranian artist Maryam Tafakory has won this year’s Film London Jarman award, which recognises British excellence in the field of moving image. Tafakory took the £10,000 prize for her work, which combines found footage with the cinematic traditions of post-revolutionary Iran. Her 2020 film Irani Bag used a split-screen technique to show how handbags were often deployed in films as stand-ins for human touch. The censorship of intimacy is a theme through Tafakory’s work – from the abstract, non-linear narrative film Nazarbazi (2022) to the following year’s Mast-del, which explored a forbidden relationship between two women.	https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/25/iranian-artist-maryam-tafakory-wins-the-2024-film-london-jarman-award	2024-11-25T11:20:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a948b07a344f7ff2751a4c249d319e03f8359e84/0_271_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e3def5acedb17b382c0968370968895b

UK politics live: vote on assisted dying bill impossible to predict, says minister	Jess Phillips says ‘we do not know how this vote is going to go’ with the views of many MPs still unclear Good morning. There is plenty happening today. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, and Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, at both speaking at the CBI conference, where the CBI chief executive Rain Newton-Smith is warning about the impact of the budget on business. Keir Starmer is hosting a meeting at Downing Street about plans to protect women from spiking. -My government was elected on a pledge to take back our streets, and we will never achieve this if women and girls do not feel safe at night,- he says. There will be tributes to John Prescott in the Commons this afternoon. But one issue is going to dominate the week, the vote on the assisted dying bill on Friday, and already that is a big topic of discussion. Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, has been giving interviews this morning and she told the Today programme this morning she is finding it impossible to predict if the bill will pass the second reading vote. She said: We do not know how this vote is going to go. I literally couldn’t call it for you at the moment … Each week I think a different thing. Last week I thought it wouldn’t [pass]. This week I think it might. Honestly, I’ve learned over the years not to try and second guess parliament. I should underline that these figures are *not* a prediction of the vote, but an interesting look at the direction MPs are leaning With 291 MPs not stating a view at the time of writing, the vote very easily could go either way A source close to the MPs campaigning in favour of legalisation told The Telegraph: -If all the MPs who have said they support the Bill turn out and vote for it, then it will pass.- She will make the decision about how she votes on assisted dying on a matter of conscience, just exactly like I will. How she comes to that and what moral code she uses to come to that will be exactly the same as the moral code that I use to come to that decision as well … I think that Shabana is making a decision on what she thinks is best for her constituents, like every constituency MP.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/25/uk-politics-live-assisted-dying-bill-labour-conservatives-starmer-reeves-badenoch	2024-11-25T01:02:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d467eb782da585015bad5c7cb58331d66ab8cd1/0_260_2939_1763/master/2939.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a11de454bc86f97a38da1c55828781f1

Follow today’s news live The government has rejected the Greens’ latest compromise offer to pass the Help to Buy housing bill, continuing the long-running stand-off into the parliament’s final week for 2024. Government sources said the Greens’ demands would be variously unlawful, unhelpful or require spending Labor saw as wasteful. The government is now challenging the Greens to back the Help to Buy bill anyway, still not budging on any demands – with a final vote in the Senate scheduled for tomorrow. Clare O’Neill has today said: This continuous charade from the Greens has to stop. You get the distinct impression the Greens want Australians to continue to be in housing distress, so Adam Bandt can try to harvest those grievances into votes. It’s the crassest form of politics there is, straight out of the Peter Dutton playbook. The Greens are offering Labor an opportunity to announce the construction of 25,000 social and affordable homes, helping over 60,000 people into affordable homes in the middle of a housing crisis, why on earth would Labor block that? Consistently throughout this Parliament, the Greens have blocked and delayed action on the housing crisis, looking for every excuse to vote down legislation which is clearly good for the country.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/nov/25/australia-politics-live-labor-coalition-greens-housing-help-to-buy-question-time-peter-dutton-anthony-albanese-social-media	2024-11-24T12:26:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/860d8e54cd799726e1431f63866e805a23c75a1e/0_139_4168_2501/master/4168.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42d0ed196ec56acae48079aeecf51245

Iranian minister to meet European counterparts after talks on nuclear deal collapse	Meeting comes amid fears Middle East tensions will lead Iran to redouble its efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, will meet his European counterparts in Geneva on Friday after the collapse of a deal last week that would have seen Iran limit its uranium enrichment to 60% purity, just below the threshold to make nuclear weapons. The offer was regarded by Iran as a first step to rebuilding confidence between Tehran and the west over what it insists is its civilian nuclear programme.

Russia-Ukraine war live: French foreign minister says there should be ‘no red lines’ in supporting Ukraine	Jean-Noël Barrot says western allies should not put any limits on support for Ukraine against Russia but does not confirm if French weapons have been used Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, has told the BBC in an interview that western allies should not put any limits on support for Ukraine against Russia, and -not set and express red lines-. Ukraine’s air defence units destroyed more than 10 Russia drones that were targeting Kyiv in an overnight drone attack, Ukraine’s military said on Sunday. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries as a result of the attack. -The UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) were flying in different directions towards Kyiv,- Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, said. -The air raid alert in the city lasted for more than three hours.- Ukraine’s air defences downed 50 of 73 Russian drones launched overnight, the Ukrainian military said this morning. In a post on Telegram, the air force said it lost track of 19 drones and four more are still in the air. Russia’s air defence systems destroyed 34 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 27 over the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, Russia’s defence ministry said. Russian media is reporting that colonel general Gennady Anashkin, the commander of the southern grouping, had been removed from his command, for giving misleading reports about the progress of the war. There has been no official confirmation from the Russian ministry of defence. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan will discuss the latest developments in the war with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, on Monday during his visit to Ankara, a Turkish official. They are expected to discuss the removal of defence procurement obstacles between Nato allies and the military alliance’s joint fight against terrorism. Ukraine has lost over 40% of the territory in Russia’s Kursk region that it rapidly seized in a surprise incursion in August as Russian forces have mounted waves of counter-assaults, a senior Ukrainian military source told Reuters. The source, who is on Ukraine’s general staff, said Russia had deployed about 59,000 troops to the Kursk region since Kyiv’s forces swept in and advanced swiftly, catching Moscow unprepared two and a half years into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. -At most, we controlled about 1,376 square kilometres (531 square miles), now of course this territory is smaller.

Why it was such a joy to interview John Prescott and discover his sweet, sad soul	The former deputy prime minister, who died this week, spoke freely and didn’t care what journalists thought of him – he was everything today’s guarded politicians are not One of the bad things that comes with being a middle-aged interviewer, as opposed to a younger one, is the tendency to complain loudly that people in public life used to be so much less controlled, so much more wild and free and apt to say the wrong (the interesting) thing. No one likes a nostalgist, after all. But in the case of politicians, I’m afraid there’s no getting away from it. In 2024, unbridled they aren’t. Every word is rehearsed.

Storm Bert live: Met Office warns of ‘multiple hazard event’ with snow, ice and flood warnings for UK	Met Office says UK will see as much as 20 to 40cm of snow over hills, accompanied by strong winds New national severe weather warnings have been issued for the weekend by the Met Office as Storm Bert has begun to make an impact with snow closing roads and strong rains and winds expected to cause further travel disruption and potential flooding. Weather warnings and 16 flood alerts have come into effect across the UK, as the Met Office described the forecasted weather as a -multiple hazard event- due to Storm Bert binging with it snow, ice, heavy rain and gale force winds. We’ll see two to four hours of heavy snow across parts of northern England and Scotland during Saturday morning. This snow will accumulate thick and fast, with five to 10cm at lower levels and as much as 20 to 40cm over hills accompanied by strong winds. You can expect blizzards over hills across northern England and Scotland, atrocious conditions for travelling and going over the hills and also the risk of power interruptions because of snow build up on power lines. The melting snow and the heavy rain could lead to localised flooding in places but the wettest spots would be Wales, in the south-west, particularly over south-facing hills, that’s where we’re likely to see gales and certainly the risk of impacts from wind as well as from rain.-	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2024/nov/23/storm-bert-live-met-office-warns-of-multiple-hazard-event-with-snow-ice-and-flood-warnings-for-uk	2024-11-23T00:46:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af6585a2b86765fbb14dff4162ed98fbd8ddcbfd/1287_588_6699_4019/master/6699.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a3ac29646c33507f9fac7ef17c13c40a

Dua Lipa’s pickle drink is latest twist in growing appreciation for ‘dirty’ cocktails	Brine from pickled onions, beetroot, pickles and even oysters is now a fixture on bar menus across the UK If Donald Trump has ruined Diet Coke for you, perhaps the answer is following Dua Lipa’s lead. In a now viral video, the pop star empties the best part of a can of it into a cup filled with ice. To this she adds the brine from a tub of pickles, followed by the brine from a tub of jalapeños. Using both hands, she sips it like it’s hot chocolate. It may seem like the latest in a series of drinks-based social experiments that only the most successful and famous can get us to try (see Tom Hanks’ Diet Cokagne, or Diet Coke and champagne). But in truth it seems the singer is on to something. Over the past few months, when it comes to cocktails, there’s been a notable uptick in all things salty and filthy.	https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/23/dua-lipa-new-drink-shows-growing-trend-for-dirty-cocktails	2024-11-22T22:00:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd475e516355aa8781ee59c19269c490c6bdbd80/0_196_6700_4020/master/6700.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=acd6f326695aa45638a6286303caed71

I said, ‘You what?’ ‘He sits there with a stopwatch’. I have no idea if this is true but he says, ‘He’s worked out that in this season you have had this amount of screen time and if it were a title race you are only a few points off where he is’. So the guy says, ‘So watch yourself’. Next thing I know, I was dragged into [executive producer] Jon Bentley’s office. He said, ‘Sit down.

That same week, a former student in another city killed eight people and injured 17 others on a stabbing spree at a vocational college.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/22/china-deals-with-violence-amid-revenge-against-society-attacks	2024-11-22T05:03:01-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2482dcbbfd4e0b6001148c28b4d1cbb9ed5e4729/0_202_6101_3661/master/6101.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72da69fb84598ee224d12ddf29dcfae3

It is home to an impeccably preserved medieval castle built by Henry II to see off dissenting barons and, for much of the 20th century, the rugged seafront was sealed off and used as a top-secret military testing site, prompting rumours about death rays and UFO sightings. Now, the area may have another claim to fame: the home of the UK’s most expensive mince pie.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/22/ill-be-making-my-own-uks-most-expensive-mince-pie-divides-opinion	2024-11-22T04:29:57-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c522aa17925f5b8c77ced9b974f6146fdbb38ff2/0_229_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fdfa27a6cdbb234d2723c59769ae96cf

First Thing: ICC seeks Netanyahu’s arrest over allegations of ‘war crimes and crimes against humanity’	The international criminal court also issued arrest warrants for Israel’s Yoav Gallant and Hamas’s Mohammed Deif. Plus, Trump picks Bondi for attorney general after Gaetz withdraws Good morning. The international criminal court has issued arrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the country’s former defense minister Yoav Gallant and the Hamas military leader Mohammed Deif – over allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity. What did the chamber say? There are -reasonable grounds to believe that both individuals intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival, including food, water, and medicine and medical supplies, as well as fuel and electricity-. What does it mean? The court has no police force, so we’re unlikely to see them standing trial anytime soon, but the ruling holds strong moral weight. Netanyahu and Gallant are at risk of arrest if they travel to any of the 124 countries that signed the Rome statute establishing the court. What was the reaction? The move was broadly welcomed by human rights groups. But Joe Biden said it was -outrageous- and Netanyahu’s office called it -antisemitic-. Why has Trump picked Bondi? It is likely to be because of loyalty. She became a fierce defender of his candidacy in 2016, helped with Trump’s legal defense during his first impeachment trial, parroted claims that the 2020 election was stolen, and continued working as a surrogate through the 2024 campaign when she attended Trump’s criminal trial in New York.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/22/first-thing-icc-seeks-netanyahu-arrest-over-allegations-of-war-crimes-and-crimes-against-humanity	2024-11-22T03:28:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4add4f8dc13b7472d9c4fd7eddefeb3ec963e7a3/107_82_3699_2220/master/3699.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4b9ac694b081574800d9826ce9d9c28c

Russia-Ukraine war live: Nato says Moscow’s strike with new ballistic missile won’t alter course of war	Alliance accuses Russia of seeking to intimidate Kyiv’s allies while Volodymyr Zelenskyy calls attack a ‘severe escalation’ Russia fired an -experimental- ballistic missile at the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Thursday in what the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called -a clear and severe escalation- of the 33-month-old war. Vladimir Putin said the strike was -a response to US plans to produce and deploy intermediate and short-range missiles-. The Russian president also threatened further attacks, saying Moscow -had the right- to strike western countries that provided Kyiv with weapons used against Russian targets. The new ballistic missile was part of a wider salvo of nine missiles fired from the Astrakhan region of Russia in the early hours of Thursday. Six of the missiles were intercepted by Ukraine’s air force but the new ballistic missile was not stopped. The missile was said to have hit -without consequences-, Ukraine’s air force said, though it added that complete information about victims had yet to be received. Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for strong worldwide condemnation on the strike, describing it as a major step-up in the -scale and brutality- of the war. The Ukrainian president said the attack was -yet more proof that Russia has no interest in peace-, adding that a -response is needed. Pressure is needed. Russia must be forced into real peace, which can only be achieved through strength-. US and UK sources indicated they believed the missile was an experimental, nuclear-capable, intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), which has a theoretical range of below 3,420 miles (5,500km). That is enough to reach Europe from where it was fired in south-western Russia, but not the US. UN secretary general António Guterres’s spokesperson said Russia’s use of the new ballistic missile was -yet another concerning and worrying development. -All of this [is] going in the wrong direction,- Stéphane Dujarric said as he called on all parties to de-escalate the conflict and -to protect civilians, not hit civilian targets or critical civilian infrastructure-. Russian strikes killed at least two people in the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Sumy, the acting mayor said on Friday. -Several massive explosions occurred in Sumy,- Artem Kobzar said on Telegram. He said air defences were still working as of just before 6am local time and warned residents to stay away from windows. The Sumy regional military administration said a residential neighbourhood had been struck by a Russian drone, adding that rescue operations were under way. It confirmed the two deaths and said 12 people had been injured. Russia’s defence ministry said on Thursday that its forces had captured the eastern Ukrainian village of Dalne in the Donetsk region, a focal point of their advance. Ukraine’s general staff made no acknowledgment of Dalne being in Russian hands. The Ukrainian military’s late report mentioned the village as one of seven in an area where Russian forces had tried to pierce Ukrainian defences 26 times over the previous 24 hours. It said 10 of 16 armed clashes in the area continued. Ukraine’s parliament postponed a sitting due to have taken place on Friday out of security concerns, public broadcaster Suspilne reported, quoting sources. It said the order told members to keep their families out of Kyiv’s government district and quoted parliamentarians as saying that, for the moment, the next sitting was not scheduled until December.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-nato-says-moscows-strike-with-new-ballistic-missile-wont-alter-course-of-war	2024-11-21T23:14:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ef13efa7069f9e9b00c0da95bea9d10016df5dd/0_343_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cbe5f3b6484782c8d56edba2ce8726e5

Putin’s Ukraine missile a warning to west before second age of Trump	The current escalations will set a new status quo for life under Trump – what does the US president have planned? Like Chekhov’s gun coming off the wall in Act V, it was probably only a matter of time before Vladimir Putin launched an experimental, nuclear-capable ballistic missile into Ukraine. It is hardly a coincidence that his decision comes as the war approaches a likely endgame, with both sides jockeying for position ahead of negotiations in the shadow of Donald Trump. Neither Ukraine nor Russia quite knows what Trump will do when he takes office in January. But the escalations taking place now will set a new status quo for the day he becomes president, at which point Trump’s options range from hard-nosed horse-trading to simply throwing Ukraine under the bus.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/22/russia-ukraine-war-ballistic-missile-warning	2024-11-21T23:00:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c67d0e8f7c62dfd56a8250326c690ea2797bab8a/0_0_4264_2559/master/4264.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fb6c21a99ef4b6de9ad8352e52543686

Why Trump’s racism isn’t an issue – or enough of one – for some voters of color	Experts warn assuming minority groups will reject a racist candidate ignores nuance, particularly on the economy Since Donald Trump won the 2024 US presidential election, many have publicly speculated why people of color – with whom Trump made some gains – would vote for a racist candidate. Throughout his campaign, Trump and his supporters spouted a series of racist remarks aimed at Black and Latino people, immigrants at large, and other marginalized groups. He also promised to utilize the military to carry out mass deportations, ban sanctuary cities, and escalate attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts at the federal level. Swaths of non-white voters still supported Trump at the ballot box. And though this sort of data can vary in reliability, experts agree that Trump made inroads among some minorities despite his bigoted comments.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/21/trump-racism-people-of-color-voters	2024-11-21T04:00:46-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/448e72ad6327532d6ac267545e4bb6a3aab5f10a/0_239_7151_4293/master/7151.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fce34a53ca683eeab5fe35f0bb3cd99a

Captain Tom’s family personally benefited from charity they founded, report finds	Watchdog’s highly critical inquiry finds Hannah and Colin Ingram-Moore culpable of ‘serious and repeated’ misconduct The family of the NHS charities fundraiser Captain Sir Tom Moore personally benefited from the charity set up in his name through a series of lucrative deals worth more than £1m, the charities watchdog has ruled in a highly critical report. A Charity Commission inquiry concluded the late Captain Tom’s daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore and her husband, Colin Ingram-Moore, were culpable of -serious and repeated- instances of misconduct, mismanagement and failures of integrity. Hannah Ingram-Moore -initiated the process to secure her appointment as chief executive- of the charity, suggesting she should be paid a salary of £150,000. The charity proposed paying her £100,000 but this was blocked by the commission and she was eventually hired on £85,000. Hannah Ingram-Moore received £18,000 from Virgin Media in September 2021 to judge its Local Legends awards when she was chief executive of the foundation. This was unauthorised and a conflict of interest, and there was no evidence it was undertaken, as she claimed, in a personal capacity. The Ingram-Moores used the charity’s name inappropriately and for their private benefit in a planning application to build a private spa pool in the grounds of their family home. The building was subsequently demolished.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/21/captain-tom-family-personally-benefited-from-charity-they-founded-report-finds	2024-11-20T16:01:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a199706325dfe0f3cdeb507f9f1139a0feeee087/331_321_5436_3260/master/5436.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=215abd0735ed73f3a3dd8faa1720dbfb

US embassy in Kyiv closes over threat of ‘significant attack’ | First Thing	It comes as the Kremlin rules out a ‘freeze’ in the conflict. Plus, 204 industrial farming lobbyists attend Cop29 Good morning. The US embassy in Kyiv closed on Wednesday because of a potential significant air attack. -Out of an abundance of caution, the embassy will be closed, and embassy employees are being instructed to shelter in place,- the consular service said. Why has Biden approved missiles and landmines now? The US feels these measures are necessary for Ukraine to keep fighting, and commensurate with Russia’s deployment of North Korean troops. About 10,900 North Korean soldiers in Kursk have been fighting in elite Russian airborne and marine units, according to a lawmaker on the intelligence committee of the South Korean parliament. Biden is also acting before Donald Trump returns to the White House and potentially seeks negotiations. How many aid trucks is Israel letting cross the border? So far in November, Israel says it has allowed in an average of 88 trucks a day, a fraction of the 600 a day that aid agencies say are necessary to meet basic needs. In the northern third of Gaza, where Israeli forces are waging a weeks-long offensive that has killed hundreds of people and displaced tens of thousands, famine conditions may have already set in, experts say. How have food prices changed? The market fluctuates, but before the war a sack of flour cost 40 shekels ($10.68) and milk powder cost 30 shekels. Now, in the center and south of the strip, where most of the population has fled, prices have reached 375 shekels ($100.17) and 300 shekels respectively – if supplies can be found.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/20/first-thing-us-embassy-in-kyiv-closes-over-threat-of-significant-attack	2024-11-20T04:57:19-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb67648d8d32f17acd8b81f4c2fb201e3748b272/0_0_5280_3168/master/5280.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=713dbbde9e13a850a279747fdc96a528

Tories attack BBC for questioning farming lobby’s inheritance tax claims – UK politics live	Row over issue continues with questions likely at PMQs as Angela Rayner faces shadow minister Alex Burghart Good morning. Keir Starmer is travelling back from the G20 summit in Brazil, but he won’t be in the Commons in time for PMQs, and so Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, will be taking questions on his behalf. In line with recent practice, Kemi Badenoch, the new Conservative leader, won’t go up against a deputy, and she will miss the session too. The Tories don’t have a deputy leader, but Badenoch is getting Alex Burghart, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, to stand in for her. The PM might not be answering, but that does not mean the questions get any easier. The situation in Ukraine is looking increasingly perilous, inflation is going up, and figures out yesterday have reignited the row about the government’s decision to cut the winter fuel payment. But the Conservatives may also want to ask about farmers, and the plan to extend inheritance tax to some farms. Traditonally the Tories have liked to think of themselves as a pro-countryside, pro-farming party, and they will have been reassured by the fact that, when they lined up alongside farmers at yesterday’s rally, they did not just have Jeremy Clarkson with them; the Liberal Democrats, the Green party, Greenpeace and even Just Stop Oil were on the farmers’ side too. The job of BBC Verify is to do exactly that but they’ve failed on their own terms. The government is refusing to say how many family farms are subject to their tax raid, only offering partial and out of date statistics which fail to account for the full scale of their reforms.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/20/farming-inheritance-tax-keir-starmer-angela-rayner-uk-politics-live	2024-11-20T01:44:02-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0774110c90ff048eeab77dffc60468e91ca2bf9/0_196_5336_3202/master/5336.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0970ed2bb8d59fca26e47cfbc887fd36

Russia-Ukraine war live: Biden to provide antipersonnel landmines for Ukraine – reports	Move comes as Putin lowers threshold for use of nuclear weapons; North Korean troops have participated in battle, South Korea says The US embassy in Kyiv has received -specific information- of a potential significant air attack on Wednesday and will be closed, the US Department of State Consular Affairs said in a post on X. It recommended US citizens to be prepared to immediately shelter in the event an air alert is announced. The US called on Russia -to stop this bellicose and the irresponsible rhetoric-, but said it has not seen any reason to adjust its nuclear posture. US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said he was -not surprised- by comments by the Kremlin over the revised nuclear doctrine. The UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, also accused Russia of being guilty of making -irresponsible rhetoric-. In a direct message to the Russian president, Starmer added: -On day 1,000 of Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine, I say again: ‘End the war. Get out of Ukraine’.- Ukraine fired US-made long-range missiles into Russia for the first time since the Biden administration lifted restrictions on their use. The target appeared to be an ammunition warehouse. Ukraine’s general staff said it hit a military arsenal of the 1046th logistics centre outside the city of Karachev without confirming the use of the missiles. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine launched six US-made Atacms missiles targeting the south-western Bryansk region overnight. It claimed that five of the missiles were shot down and another was damaged. It said debris from the rockets caused a fire at an unnamed military facility. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, did not directly confirm the missile attack targeting Bryansk but said: -We now have Atacms, Ukrainian long-range capabilities, and we will use them.- The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, appeared to suggest that Russia might respond with nuclear weapons if Ukraine used western-supplied missiles to strike targets inside Russia. The Kremlin said the purpose of its updated nuclear doctrine was to make potential enemies understand the inevitability of retaliation for an attack on Russia or its allies. Russia’s revised nuclear doctrine declares that a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on his country. The doctrine also states that an attack using conventional missiles, drones or other aircraft could be seen as justification for a nuclear response.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/20/russia-ukraine-war-live-biden-us-weapons-missiles-putin-nuclear	2024-11-19T22:16:21-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5f69662b776355f056921942e54ff299fd26d61/0_197_5913_3548/master/5913.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7d92872526fd346a6f1b7b7925a84eb2

Prado show aims to highlight true colours of polychrome sculpture	Madrid Exhibition intends to rescue the technique – coloured paint applied to statues – from centuries of indifference In a darkened corner of the Prado, not far from an outsized crucifixion and a sculpture of a dead, recumbent Christ with eyes of glass, teeth of ivory and fingernails of horn, is another depiction of Jesus that is remarkable in its poignancy, its humanity and its history. The tiny, painted terracotta scene, titled Los primeros pasos de Jesús (Jesus’s First Steps), is domestic rather than divine and shows a chubby, beaming infant ambling towards his equally beaming father. Its creator was the Spanish baroque artist Luisa Roldán who, despite becoming the first female sculptor to the royal court in 1692, is only now making her debut in the hallowed Madrid museum.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/20/prado-show-highlight-true-colours-polychrome-sculpture	2024-11-19T21:00:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cec5ede6b22ba9e62b36360f5c201c5593911ded/0_713_3689_2213/master/3689.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=136b12ef68f1f670175e65455bba0724

Though far from a new coinage – as an adjective meaning -clear- or -obvious-, the word dates back in English to at least the 1300s – the dictionary’s decision rests on its newest meaning as a verb, which attests to the power of visualisation and positive thinking in making fervently held dreams come to pass.	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/nov/20/celebrities-make-manifest-appear-as-2024-word-of-the-year	2024-11-19T21:00:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34efb969fb1cb45eebc0696c4983248971a535d8/0_175_5235_3141/master/5235.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9cb7f0b0cfa90350770715559b639f49

Norway to ask ICJ for advisory opinion condemning Israel’s stance on Unrwa	Draft resolution for UN general assembly seeks to protect the aid agency and allow it to keep functioning in Gaza Norway is to seek an international court of justice (ICJ) advisory opinion condemning the Israeli government for ending cooperation with the UN Palestinian relief agency Unrwa. The Israeli Knesset passed two bills last month banning Unrwa from Israeli territory and prohibiting Israeli state contact with the agency, moves that would prevent it from delivering aid to Gaza, after allegations by Israel that members of Unrwa staff in Gaza were involved in the 7 October attacks by Hamas.

AI cloning of celebrity voices outpacing the law, experts warn	David Attenborough among famous people whose voices have been exploited by fraudsters It’s the new badge of celebrity status that nobody wants. Jennifer Aniston, Oprah Winfrey and Kylie Jenner have all had their voices cloned by fraudsters. Online blaggers used artificial intelligence to fake the Tiggerish tones of Martin Lewis, the TV financial adviser. And this weekend David Attenborough described himself as -profoundly disturbed- to have discovered that his cloned voice had been used to deliver partisan US news bulletins. Now experts have warned that voice-cloning is outpacing the law as technologists hone previously clunky voice generators into models capable of emulating the subtlest pauses and breathing of human intonation.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/19/ai-cloning-of-celebrity-voices-outpacing-the-law-experts-warn	2024-11-18T23:00:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b61e0553886769be00b841cd315ca2a3cd84554/0_230_5507_3304/master/5507.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e4b9cd554cb354802e1343ffafc508b7

Tuesday briefing: Will a shift in Biden’s missile policy change the war in Ukraine?	In today’s newsletter: Ukraine can now fire US-made long-range missiles into Russian territory – but it may be too little, too late for Volodymyr Zelenskyy • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. The US president, Joe Biden, has lifted the longstanding ban on Ukraine using American-made long-range missiles to fire into Russian territory. The Biden administration secretly first sent the army tactical missile systems, or Atacms, to Ukraine earlier this year under the stipulation that Ukraine would not use it inside Russia. That has now changed, and the US has given Kyiv the green light after reports emerged that 10,000 North Korean troops were in Ukraine. Hong Kong | 47 of Hong Kong’s most prominent pro-democracy figures have been jailed – one for 10 years – in the territory’s largest national security trial, following a prosecution that has been widely criticised as politically motivated and controlled by China’s Communist party government. Poverty | More than one in three children and a quarter of adults are living in poverty in the UK as deprivation levels rise to the highest in the 21st century, according to a landmark report. Cop29 | Raising money needed to tackle the climate crisis need not be a burden on overstretched government budgets, leading economists have said. The sums needed – approximately $1tn a year by 2030 – are achievable without disruption to the global economy, and would help to generate greener economic growth for the future. Labour | A government policy to create 100,000 new nursery places using spare capacity in English primary schools is -unlikely to work- because of a geographical mismatch between capacity and demand, according to research by Frontier Economics, one of the largest economic consultancies in Europe. Environment | More than 51 million chickens are being industrially farmed in the river valleys of the Severn and Wye – the equivalent of 79 chickens for every person in the region, according to new figures. The exponential rise in large intensive poultry units (IPUs) in the valleys is a key driver of river pollution. Chicken dropping contains more phosphates – which starve fish and river plants of oxygen – than any other animal manure.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/tuesday-briefing-first-edition-joe-biden-long-range-missiles-policy-war-in-ukraine	2024-11-18T22:42:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48c23c03fc4a3b3c4e5e86d9d3d9746b2c5ae043/0_153_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dfac9d2745a4e4566024c72639fc93c5

Letting Ukraine fire missiles into Russia unlikely to have decisive effect	Military and political consequences of allowing Kyiv to use Atacms missiles remain uncertain It has taken an election defeat in the US and the arrival of 10,000 North Koreans in Ukraine for Joe Biden to finally relent. After two years of asking, Ukraine’s army has been given permission to use US long-range Atacms missiles to strike against targets inside Russia. The military and political consequences remain uncertain. Russia has been able to bomb targets across all of Ukraine throughout the war. On Sunday it attacked key sites across the country’s power network, forcing Kyiv to implement national electricity rationing as a result of the damage caused. Some missiles were aimed as far west as Lviv and at sites near the border with Moldova, and an energy crisis is closer as a result.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/18/letting-ukraine-fire-missiles-into-russia-unlikely-to-have-decisive-effect	2024-11-18T10:21:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd70bce555bcf92acd402e05f78a520932ed2b4e/0_128_5310_3186/master/5310.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c376feba019f4e2a3b7910eb20465759

‘Israel is trying to terrorise people’: Lebanon’s civil defence reels after deadly strike	After 20 people including 15 first responders killed in Douris, rescuers ask why state service was targeted All the corpses had been recovered but still the rescuers sifted through the rubble. A paramedic carried a sack with him, filled with the charred remains of his colleagues. Every few feet he stopped and knelt down, assessing. In the twisted mess left behind by the Israeli airstrike, it was hard to distinguish between flesh, earth and the life-saving equipment that had melted in the heat of the blast. The night before, on Thursday, an Israeli jet had dropped a bomb on the salon of the Douris civil defence centre on the outskirts of the ancient Lebanese town of Baalbek, killing 20 people, including 15 first responders. Five were rendered unrecognisable by the force of the explosion. On Friday afternoon, emergency workers were still collecting bodily remains to be taken for DNA analysis.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/18/lebanon-civil-defence-reels-after-deadly-israeli-strike	2024-11-18T05:03:05-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83de65dd9864be288a39d0a9050ae859f45e1bdd/0_0_5149_3090/master/5149.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=410f2b7438b37c0ac65baa242934ecf2

First Thing: Biden lifts ban on Ukraine firing US weapons deeper into Russia	Ukraine will be permitted to fire US missiles in Kursk region. Plus, attorneys would be unable to stop Trump’s potential Capitol rioters pardon Good morning. Joe Biden has lifted the ban on Ukraine using long-range missiles to fire into Russian territory by permitting them to be used against Russian and North Korean forces in the Kursk region. How did Russia react? So far, Vladimir Putin has not said anything. But Vladimir Dzhabarov, the first deputy head of the Russian upper house’s international affairs committee, said: -This is a very big step towards the start of world war three.- How could this change the war? Ukraine has recently been losing ground on the frontline, and the deployment of thousands of North Korean troops threatened to tilt the war further in Russia’s favor. As Trump signals his desire to wind up the war with ceasefire negotiations – which critics say will mean, in effect, a Russian land grab – the use of long-range missiles gives Ukraine an opportunity to hang on to its territorial gains in Russia’s Kursk region. It could become a key bargaining chip. But it’s also likely to escalate the conflict. What could be the impact of RFK Jr’s nomination? Dr Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said even if public policies remained unchanged, authorities from the federal government speaking out against vaccines -discourages people who might otherwise be vaccinated, and at that point that’s as bad as not having a vaccine at all-.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/18/first-thing-biden-lifts-ban-on-ukraine-firing-us-weapons-deeper-into-russia	2024-11-18T03:07:58-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e4e470b0137700f1d8be3dcb53f27002dca57d5/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=18942e7e3afecdf3a23acdf9b9f40e46

The Daily Mail is splashing on criticism of the meeting from some Tories. When David Cameron was PM, he cultivated Xi with an eagerness and enthusiasm that makes Starmer look quite hostile towards China by comparison, but over the past decade Tory thinking about China has changed considerably, and the Mail story quotes Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former leader, saying -those suffering genocide and slave labour under the brutal hands of Xi will feel betrayed.-	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/18/keir-starmer-china-xi-jinping-g20-ukraine-latest-live-news	2024-11-18T01:04:40-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb080dbd3c5d86b6b7f880202346ff9e06472276/0_70_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=36abacd21d2ea1137d5c7576a766261e
