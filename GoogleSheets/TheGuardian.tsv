Facebook asks US supreme court to dismiss fraud suit over Cambridge Analytica scandal	Securities fraud lawsuit brought by shareholders accuses the social media platform of misleading them about misuse of user data The US supreme court grappled on Wednesday with a bid by Meta’s Facebook to scuttle a federal securities fraud lawsuit brought by shareholders who accused the social media platform of misleading them about the misuse of user data. The justices heard arguments in Facebook’s appeal of a lower court’s decision allowing the 2018 class action suit led by Amalgamated Bank to proceed. The suit seeks unspecified monetary damages in part to recoup the lost value of the Facebook stock held by the investors. It is one of two cases coming before them this month – the other one involving artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia on 13 November – that could lead to rulings making it harder for private litigants to hold companies to account for alleged securities fraud.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/06/facebook-cambridge-analytica-lawsuit	2024-11-06T10:31:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fd44beb8d5bf2d47ef1c7251526419884d551a7/0_60_2584_1552/master/2584.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0acf3fbf675ee3ce4690ebfcf87eb3ef

US election 2024 live: Donald Trump on brink of victory as world leaders congratulate likely new president	Former president poised to return to White House after sweeping key early battleground states Donald Trump is poised to win the US presidency after an unexpected sweep through key battleground states. The former president was set for a return to the White House after a contentious election in which democracy itself had been at stake and which is likely to take the United States into uncharted political waters. -This was a movement like nobody’s ever seen before, and frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time. There’s never been anything like this in this country, and maybe beyond. -And now it’s going to reach a new level of importance, because we’re going to help our country. We’ll help our country … we have a country that needs help, and it needs help very badly. We’re going to fix our borders. We’re going to fix everything about our country. And we made history for a reason tonight, and the reason is going to be just that we overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible, and it is now clear that we’ve achieved the most incredible political thing. The swing states still to be called are Wisconsin (10 electoral college votes), Nevada (6), Michigan (15) and Arizona (11). The other states still to be called are Alaska and Maine. Alaska is considered a red state, and its three electoral college votes could deliver Trump the presidency. Missouri, Colorado, New York and Maryland all passed measures to protect abortion rights, while in Florida, an effort to roll back a six-week ban fell short. Republicans have retaken the majority in the Senate, the Associated Press reported, after picking up seats in Ohio and West Virginia, and fending off challenges to their candidates in Texas and Nebraska. Republicans will control Congress’s upper chamber for the first time in four years. Donald Trump will be in a position to confirm his supreme court justices, federal judges and appointees to cabinet posts. The House is still in play, but Republicans hold a strong lead, with 190 representatives to the Democrats’ 168. There were decisive victories for Democrats elsewhere in the election. The US will have two Black women serving as senators for the first time in American history, with the election of Lisa Blunt Rochester from Delaware and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland. Sarah McBride, a Delaware state senator, also made history as the first out transgender person elected to the US House of Representatives. McBride, 34, won Delaware’s at-large House seat in Tuesday’s general election against the Republican candidate John Whalen III, a former Delaware state police officer and businessman. The House seat, Delaware’s only one, has been Democratic since 2010. Trump won in Iowa despite the state’s foremost pollster Ann Selzer on Saturday finding Harris leading by a small amount that was nonetheless within the survey’s margin of error. The finding was viewed as a potential sign of strength for Harris in nearby Wisconsin and Michigan, two swing states that are demographically similar to Iowa. The Trump campaign decried Selzer’s poll as an outlier, which turned out to be the case.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/06/us-presidential-election-2024-donald-trump-kamala-harris-latest-news-updates	2024-11-06T02:30:56-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ff74e8b71b77f4c5200e7ae54c34ee7024d2d6c/0_151_3666_2200/master/3666.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5b7d50bc0e5763c0b4a53e01190c3ce2

Voting on US election day ‘by and large normal’ despite some glitches, experts say	Errors cause delay for some voters as over 30 bomb threats called that FBI says are ‘from Russian email domains’ Voting on election day this year largely went smoothly, despite a few glitches, typical of any election, that some Republicans used to sow distrust in the voting process. As in every election, there were a handful of administrative and technological errors that caused delay for a small numbers of voters. Elections in the United States are administered at the local level, which means that county election offices, often operating on shoestring budgets, are in charge of overseeing the vote. It is not uncommon for something to temporarily go awry causing delays.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/election-day-voting-glitches-bomb-threats	2024-11-06T00:00:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbdd22ad9a15cec067e52bcf48a1708893afaa0d/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=99b6de053b3ee05298f2e59ac1233dbf

Promise and excitement turn to jitters and dread at Kamala Harris’s watch party	Scene at Howard University had echoes of Hillary Clinton’s loss in 2016 as US appears poised to return Trump to power In the end, Kamala Harris never took the stage at her election night watch party on the Howard University campus in Washington DC. As Americans appeared poised to return Donald Trump to power, it was her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond, who appeared onstage instead. He tried to strike a note of optimism – there were still votes to be counted. But the scene had echoes of Hillary Clinton’s loss in 2016, when her campaign chairman, not the candidate, came out to address supporters awaiting the result of a presidential election that many hoped would finally shatter the -hardest, highest- glass ceiling.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/kamala-harris-presidential-election-day	2024-11-05T23:18:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ef4c175974eb8f0e9eba7e3fe92b44072e3e8b1/0_233_6987_4194/master/6987.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2463fb46c4db2bdf8143ad7b566b4c64
North Korea’s involvement in Ukraine draws China into a delicate balancing act	The entry of North Korean troops risks a dangerous escalation in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It also puts Beijing in a tight spot In October 1950, barely a year after the Chinese civil war ended, Mao Zedong sent the first Chinese soldiers to fight in the Korean war. Between 180,000 and 400,000 of Chairman Mao’s troops would die in that conflict, including his own son. But it was important to defend North Korea in that battle, Mao reportedly said, because -without the lips, the teeth are cold-. That Chinese idiom has been used to described China and North Korea’s close relationship for more than seven decades. China sees North Korea as a strategic security buffer in the region, while North Korea relies on its superpower neighbour for economic, political and military support. But that relationship is now under strain thanks to another war which is drawing Communist-rooted countries into a common battle.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/06/north-korea-troops-russia-ukraine-war-china-relationship	2024-11-05T23:02:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4b3137b70ce363df72e83c4458acca152f9b522/11_269_1623_974/master/1623.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=83ffd37d20d080ddab46f76c4db95cc4

The votes are still being counted, and it is not yet possible to call the winner of the race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. But the pattern of votes cast so far suggests that Trump is a very strong favourite to win. He has been called as the winner of key states North Carolina and Georgia. The remaining battlegrounds are not yet decided, but he currently appears on course to win all five of them, and could win the popular vote. While there is still a theoretical path for Harris, it looks very remote. Trump is expected to address his supporters soon. Harris did not appear at her HQ at Howard University, and her campaign told supporters that she would speak on Wednesday morning.

Shomari Figures elected as first congressman in Alabama’s redrawn majority-Black district	Mobile-born Figures, who worked in Obama’s White House, becomes first Black man to hold position since 1832 Tuesday night was a celebratory one for voters in Alabama’s newly redrawn second congressional district two. Shomari Figures, who was born in Mobile, was elected to the US House of Representatives, becoming the first Black person to hold the position since 1832. To some district two residents, Figures’ election is proof that their work to get the district redrawn and to educate voters was worth it. For them, Figures, who worked in Barack Obama’s White House, represents an opportunity for change and progress in the majority-Black district. Voting advocates in and around district two for months had been working to inform voters about the district change. In March, during super Tuesday, some feared their efforts were in vain as voter turnout was low.

Clashes over budget could push Germany’s ailing coalition to collapse	With contradictory proposals unlikely to mesh, leaders to decide whether there is scope for alliance to continue When, in 2021, Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats went into a -traffic light- coalition with the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats, the new government was riding high on an enthusiastic spirit of cooperation. There were promises to modernise, reinvigorate and green-proof Europe’s largest economy.

By all accounts, the key causes for Gallant’s departure lie in domestic Israeli politics: the two men’s disagreements over a hostage deal with Hamas, Gallant’s opposition to blanket exemptions for ultra-Orthodox Jews from service in the IDF, and over a leaking scandal involving a close aide to Netanyahu.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/05/netanyahus-sacking-of-gallant-likely-to-precede-a-shake-up-of-israel-us-relations	2024-11-05T15:16:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06d1b195f74250719de78b5191a3922fb109ab9b/1213_0_4681_2809/master/4681.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c6f0122c6e18dbf79b8133cf5b053597

Still, that was enough for an organization dedicated to locating, identifying and interring the remains of unclaimed veterans to conclude over several years that they were all Union soldiers deserving of a burial service with military honors.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/05/civil-war-veterans-buried-seattle	2024-11-05T09:55:55-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/033fe48358a1986cc477ef5d0a51b31fcd8e5516/0_150_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=006feec4f51339117d8dfc9e6b5c6cd4
Final days of the presidential campaign show how Trump would ‘Make America healthy again’	Jumble of proposals include ‘massive reform of Obamacare’ and giving anti-vaxxer RFK Jr the helm of health agencies From assertions that America’s highest-profile vaccine critic would lead health agencies to new promises for -massive reform- of Obamacare, the chaotic last week of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign will probably serve as a preview of what -Make America healthy again- could mean should the former president regain power. The jumble of proposals echoed conservative policy documents, channeled the residual anger of the post-pandemic anti-vaccine movement and alarmed experts who help set the nation’s health policies.

‘Excitement in the air’: newly created Alabama district votes for first time	District two, where Black people comprise 48.7% of the population, was carved after a 2023 supreme court ruling On Tuesday, residents in Alabama’s newly redrawn congressional district two will vote for the first time.

First Thing: Americans head to polls with historic election on a knife edge	Trump launched insults at his final rally as Harris ended her campaign calling for people to ‘get out the vote’. Plus, Nate Silver’s final election forecast Good morning. Tens of millions of voters will cast their ballots on Tuesday in one of the tightest and most divided presidential elections in modern US history, with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump locked in a dead heat. Why is Pennsylvania so crucial? It has the most electoral votes – 19 – of the battleground states. Who is Silver? The forecaster called 49 out of 50 states in the 2008 election, as well as the outcome of the 2012 and 2020 races.

Trump and Harris in final election push as polls signal extremely close contest	Republican nominee attacks critics and vilifies migrants while Democratic rival lays out positive vision for America Donald Trump and Kamala Harris closed out the tumultuous 2024 campaign with competing rallies across Pennsylvania, offering contrasting visions – and moods – in the final hours before polls opened in an election both candidates have cast as an existential fight for America’s future. In Philadelphia, Harris ended a frenetic dash across the state at the art museum steps made famous in the film Rocky – -a tribute to those who start as the underdog and climb to victory- – where tens of thousands of supporters gathered for the star-studded event.

US elections 2024: control of House hangs by thin margin as country votes	While Republicans are looking to expand control of the lower chamber, Democrats need only five seats to win All 435 members of the US House of Representatives face re-election on Tuesday, with Republicans looking to expand their narrow majority after two chaotic years in power. Control of the lower chamber appears to be a true toss-up, as Democrats only need to win five more seats than they did in 2022 to regain their majority. The country may have to wait days to learn who won the House, given that it took more than a week to make that call in 2022, but early results in battlegrounds like North Carolina’s first district and Virginia’s seventh district will give the first clues as to how Americans voted.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/05/house-representatives-elections	2024-11-05T03:00:49-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26d27d6e5c7531bc0bcbd8ac1e25c350acacd1f1/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bbfe1f8b395d1b041b375ff0aa7e6254

Rising Tide protesters scale back blockade of world’s biggest coal port but NSW police ready for mass ‘disruption’ at Newcastle	Lawyer for police argues business should be allowed to continue as Rising Tide threatens to halt exports for 30 hours Protesters have scaled back their plan to block the Port of Newcastle to 30 hours, down from an initial 50 hours, amid a legal challenge by New South Wales police to stop the action going ahead. On Tuesday, police and the protest organiser – Rising Tide – appeared in the supreme court for a second day.

Americans head to polls with historic election on a knife edge	With no clear swing-state advantage for Kamala Harris or Donald Trump, the US is poised for a long – and tense – wait for results Election day has arrived in America, with tens of millions of voters set to head to the polls on Tuesday in one of the closest and most consequential contests in modern US history.

Tuesday briefing: Hour by hour, what to expect as the results roll in	In today’s newsletter: A guide to what we’ll know, and when – with a serious warning attached: it might drag on for days • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. This time tomorrow, we may know who’s going to be the next president of the United States. Or we may know that we don’t yet know. Or we may know who’s projected to win, but be bracing ourselves for weeks of enervating legal action and protest. It’s going to be that sort of night, I’m afraid. There’s been a bit of a sense in the last few days that momentum has been shifting towards Kamala Harris, but most respected polling dorks are treating that narrative with the same caution they viewed the one before that, which suggested a rush towards Donald Trump. The smart way to approach it is to remember that there is literally no need to make a prediction because we will have actual numbers very soon, and then get into a flotation tank and stick on some Sigur Rós. Education | University tuition fees in England are to go up for the first time in eight years, taking annual payments up to a record £9,535 per student, the government has announced. The inflation-linked rise, amid warnings of a deepening financial crisis in the sector, was coupled with an increase in student maintenance loans. Conservatives | Kemi Badenoch has appointed Robert Jenrick shadow justice secretary, with Mel Stride shadow chancellor and Priti Patel shadow foreign secretary, as she began to put together a frontbench team. But there were questions over whether Jenrick, who lost to Badenoch in the leadership contest, had initially sought another post. Brazil | Federal police in Brazil have formally charged the alleged mastermind of the murders of Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira in the Amazon, accusing him of arming and funding the criminal group responsible for the crime.

Accrual of status credits could be key to Qantas dominance among MPs and public servants, expert says	Since 2010 government travellers have been banned from accepting frequent flyer points for work-related travel. But ban did not extend to status credits The accrual of personal airline status credits by public servants, politicians and their staff travelling for work may influence which carrier they fly with despite rules that insist on the cheapest fare, an expert in aviation loyalty programs says. Adele Elisio, publisher of The Champagne Mile frequent-flyer website, says many regular travellers value status credits – which are earned on paid flights and calculated on travel distance and fare level – over points that can be traded for flights and seat upgrades.

Badenoch plucks Patel, Jenrick and Stride from the Tories’ tiny gene pool of talent | John Crace	James Cleverly has the right idea – head down and sit tight until KemiKaze crashes and burns of her own accord Just do the maths. There are 120 other Tory MPs from which Kemi Badenoch can select her ministerial team. Or put it another way, there’s about a one in five chance of any MP making it into the shadow cabinet and a near 100% chance of becoming a ministerial bag carrier. These are days of plenty for ambitious young Tory MPs with one eye on their own careers. It just requires a different mindset. There again, not every Tory MP will necessarily want a place in Kemi’s team. James Cleverly very publicly snubbed his new boss at the weekend, saying he’d rather a return to the backbenches than carry on as shadow home secretary.

Paty, a 47-year-old history teacher, was stabbed and then decapitated near his secondary school in the Paris suburb of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, by Abdoullakh Anzorov, a radicalised 18-year-old who arrived in France aged six with his Chechen parents and had been granted asylum.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/04/eight-on-trial-in-paris-beheading-teacher-samuel-paty	2024-11-04T03:51:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbaf4cd18390a92acddcc76a6d3c0190e87358fc/0_338_5040_3023/master/5040.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d082bb1a321d3a6267ddb1bd913a50fb
First Thing: Trump election subversion efforts better organized than in 2020, experts warn	From seeding doubt about voter fraud to using legal means, the efforts stand in contrast to last election’s more haphazard efforts. Plus, authorities seize massive amounts of fentanyl in California Good morning. Experts are preparing for Donald Trump to stage an aggressive attempt to challenge the election results if he appears to be losing Tuesday’s vote, warning that such efforts will be far more organized than his attempt at overturning the result following the 2020 race. Just how close could the vote be? Analysts are predicting the closest election since 2000, when George W Bush won by 537 votes, and warning of the threat of civil unrest and political violence. Where will Trump and Harris be on the final day of campaigning? Harris will be in three cities in Pennsylvania; Trump will make appearances in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/first-thing-trump-election-subversion-efforts	2024-11-04T03:50:39-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a780385030a898f714373b7ccbbed68452aa018/0_367_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e13918a3cec1cf369f1d73a141f3502a

Is Trump actually a fascist – and why does the answer matter?	Given the comparisons to Hitler and Mussolini, experts say it’s important to remember that fascism is a process While Democratic strategists debate whether or not their attack ads labeling Donald Trump a fascist have been effective, experts and academics told the Guardian his campaign and the Republican party he now heads have clear autocratic sympathies and political qualities that are firmly in line with fascism movements historically. Put together, that makes any Trump victory this week and his return to the White House for a second presidential term a clear threat to US democracy, they added.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/is-trump-a-fascist	2024-11-04T03:00:13-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3041add5dfba53f03494e62d998f6fd0ef9be60d/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=169eeb95a98577f4a0855c71e9c2636a

Starmer to give speech about ‘severity’ of illegal migration threat as Badenoch works on shadow cabinet – UK politics live	Starmer to urge world to ‘wake up’ to severity of illegal migration threat at Glasgow’s Interpol meeting Good morning. Interpol, the International Criminal Police Organisation, which has 196 member countries, has a general assembly and, for the first time in 50 years, it is meeting in Britain. Keir Starmer will address the meeting in Glasgow and he is going to deliver a -wake up- call on illegal migration, saying that the world needs to face up to the scale of the problem and that tackling the problem needs to be internationalised. Britain cannot do it on its own, he implies. According to extracts from the speech released in advance, Starmer will say: The world needs to wake up to the severity of this challenge. I was elected to deliver security for the British people. And strong borders are a part of that. But security doesn’t stop at our borders. There’s nothing progressive about turning a blind eye as men, women and children die in the channel. Keir Starmer’s announcement on tackling gangs will mean absolutely nothing without a deterrent to stop migrants wishing to make the dangerous journey across the channel. It is a shame that Starmer has not recognised the extent of the crisis in the channel sooner, as he and the Labour party voted against numerous measures to stop the gangs while they were in opposition.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/04/keir-starmer-labour-migration-interpol-kemi-badenoch-conservative-shadow-cabinet-uk-politics-latest-news	2024-11-04T01:13:02-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b39c300e275e1478862528408dce89810d5fd1b6/142_0_1905_1144/master/1905.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=94fcab69b1324dec300ceda47020da1a

US election 2024 live: Harris and Trump converge on rust belt as final day of campaigning begins	Democratic and Republican candidates set to blitz rallies in Pennsylvania and Michigan as polls shows race too close to call The Guardian US has been averaging national and state polls to see how the two candidates are faring. Nationally, Kamala Harris has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over Donald Trump, virtually identical to last week. The election will be decided in the seven battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In these states, the polls are too close to call. Kamala Harris pledged to -do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza- in her final rally in Michigan on Sunday, as she attempted to appeal to the state’s large Arab American and Muslim American population two days out from the election. Michigan is home to about 240,000 registered Muslim voters, a majority of whom voted for Joe Biden in 2020, helping him to a narrow victory over Donald Trump. But Arab Americans and Muslim Americans in the state have expressed dissatisfaction over the vice-president’s stance on Israel’s war on Gaza. Harris was making her fourth stop of the day in Michigan, having earlier spoken at a church in Detroit and stopped by a barber shop in Pontiac. Trump is holding his final rally of the campaign in Michigan on Monday night. Donald Trump said he should never have left the White House after his defeat in 2020 and joked darkly he would be fine with reporters getting shot. -We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,- Trump said at a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania. -I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – - he said before abruptly cutting himself off. In other comments, as he denigrated the media, he said: -To get to me, somebody would have to shoot through fake news, and I don’t mind that much, because, I don’t mind. I don’t mind.- Donald Trump again suggested he would give a role on health policy to Robert F Kennedy Jr at a rally in Macon, Georgia. -I told a great guy, RFK Jr., Bobby — I said, ‘Bobby, you work on women’s health, you work on health, you work on what we eat. You work on pesticides. You work on everything,- he said. Kennedy, a well known vaccine sceptic, on Saturday said that the former president would push to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected. Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. The Trump campaign claimed that recent polling by the New York Times and the Des Moines Register is designed to suppress Trump voter turnout by presenting a bleak picture of his re-election prospects. The memo claims that the Times’s polls have biased samples and overrepresent Democratic voters compared with actual voter registration and turnout trends. Trump also disputed a shock Iowa poll that found Kamala Harris leading the former president in the typically red state 47% to 44%. -No President has done more for farmers, and the Great State of Iowa, than Donald J. Trump,- Trump said in a post on the Truth Social network on Sunday morning. -In fact, it’s not even close! All polls, except for one heavily skewed toward the Democrats by a Trump hater who called it totally wrong the last time, have me up, by a lot-.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/04/donald-trump-kamala-harris-us-election-polls-latest-live-news	2024-11-03T23:29:02-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e815e5c6798cc728228e554bba2d75f8ece224e0/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42051860c9e31b2e09bd47bde23ce127

Monday briefing: Can Kemi Badenoch face the past and plot a path for the future?	In today’s newsletter: The new Conservative party leader was announced on Saturday – and must build a credible opposition from a small pool of colleagues in the House of Commons • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. Kemi Badenoch was elected as Conservative leader over the weekend, and now has a window of about two minutes of mainstream attention before the US election devours the entire news agenda. That is not time to plot the next five years in any detail. But it doesn’t take long to observe just how stiff the challenge she faces will be. The contest was billed as a postmortem of the election defeat – but as it played out, we don’t even know in any detail why Badenoch thinks the Tories lost. She said yesterday that the threat of Reform UK was a symptom of her party not being -consistent enough about values- – without being specific about what that would mean in practice. Meanwhile she starts with a reputation as an abrasive media performer who is firmly on the right of her party, and will soon have to decide whether to oppose public spending increases just four months after a landslide defeat. US election | In the final stretch of the presidential race, Donald Trump has said he should never have left the White House after his defeat in 2020 and joked darkly he would be fine with reporters getting shot. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris promised to work to end the war in Gaza as she attempted to appeal to Arab American and Muslim American voters in Michigan. Europe | The pro-western incumbent Maia Sandu has won a second term in office in the Moldovan presidential election, preliminary results have shown, marking a significant boost for the country’s EU aspirations and a clear rebuke to Moscow. Labour | Rachel Reeves has admitted she was wrong to say before the election that no major tax rises would be needed, but promised there was -no need to increase taxes further- after last week’s budget raised £40bn. Spain | Hundreds of people have heckled Spain’s King Felipe and prime minister Pedro Sánchez – throwing mud and shouting -murderers- – as they visited an area in Valencia devastated by last week’s floods. The scenes laid bare the degree of anger among residents who feel abandoned by the authorities. Work | One thousand workers in the UK will get extra time off with no loss of pay in the first official pilot by the four-day week campaign under the Labour government. Amid growing momentum for a shorter working week, the campaign will present its findings in the summer.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/04/monday-briefing-can-kemi-badenoch-face-the-past-and-plot-a-path-for-the-future	2024-11-03T22:51:02-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d94a2121763591fb4386287db03f091f3849602c/0_474_3011_1806/master/3011.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=062143bdc9343b5b7787892bd111595f

Harris vows at Michigan rally to ‘do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza’	VP tries to appeal to state’s Arab and Muslim Americans as polling suggests they are gravitating towards Jill Stein Kamala Harris pledged to -do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza- in her final rally in Michigan on Sunday, as she attempted to appeal to the state’s large Arab American and Muslim American population two days out from the election. Michigan is home to about 240,000 registered Muslim voters, a majority of whom voted for Biden in 2020, helping him to a narrow victory over Donald Trump. But Arab Americans and Muslim Americans in the state have expressed dissatisfaction over the vice-president’s stance on Israel’s war on Gaza, and polling suggests that these voters are gravitating towards Jill Stein, the Green party candidate.

Frantic campaigning by Trump amid Iowa poll shock – US election live updates	Republican nominee to hold events in three swing states as the presidential race enters its final hours Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the 2024 US presidential election as we move into the final hours before polls open on Tuesday. It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/03/donald-trump-kamala-harris-iowa-poll-us-presidential-election-live	2024-11-03T03:07:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ab42d78dbcf93ae9c981ab6d198002b3590fb47/0_150_3731_2240/master/3731.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d21684c9009ea941002e5349519282ca
Trump aides confident in his chances – but admit results are wildly unknown	Some polls offer promising outlook for Trump in swing states and reveal most believe US is on the wrong track Donald Trump’s aides are bullish about their prospects with their internal polls showing them ahead of his rival Kamala Harris during the final weekend of the campaign before the election, even as they also concede they actually have no idea how America’s election will ultimately break. The confidence is mainly coming from two places: some polls that show the former US president ahead in every battleground state and Republicans holding onto early vote leads in places like Nevada, which they extrapolate to read that the Sun Belt states may be increasingly out of reach for Harris.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/03/trump-aides-election-results-polls	2024-11-03T03:00:43-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16bcdd6f6ac0be12aeef98e1f1e1f265a417ed78/0_278_4415_2650/master/4415.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5fd5bc61dcf89d1c6512fb897bac1879

Tory leadership election live: Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick await final results	New Conservative party leader will be announced shortly – but James Cleverly says he won’t serve in either’s shadow cabinet Good morning. Conservative party members have chosen a new leader and the winner will be announced shortly after 11am, at an event in London. This has only happened four times before since William Hague changed the rules a quarter of century ago to ensure members, not MPs, take the final decision about who should be leader. The process has not always worked very well – there’s been a failure rate of at least 50%, conventional wisdom would – which is one reason why he thinks his rule change has been a mistake. The two obvious failures were Iain Duncan Smith, who was elected leader in 2001 but replaced after two years after MPs concluded he was not up to the job, and Liz Truss, who only lasted two months. The members’ decision to elect David Cameron in 2005 is generally seen as a good one, because he led his party back into power and won a second, surprise election victory. Members also voted for Boris Johnson in 2019; like Cameron, he also turned out to be an election-winner, but his record as PM was so dire, and caused such lasting reputational damage to the party, that it is arguable that this was a bad choice too.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/02/tory-leadership-election-results-live-kemi-badenoch-robert-jenrick-new-conservative-leader	2024-11-02T01:24:40-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8967386033edf4e3745117f8a59a94a3e99c0b2/469_0_4416_2650/master/4416.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=704a09bef8e31e203a9d80409af7bcf7

The warnings – from Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans – come as Americans prepare to vote on Tuesday in the most consequential presidential contest in generations. Most polls show Trump running neck and neck with Kamala Harris, the vice-president and Democratic nominee, with the two candidates seemingly evenly matched in seven key swing states.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/republicans-donald-trump-polls-us-election-lawsuits	2024-11-01T06:12:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f65431ce5446a5686320f639230d17fcf58a72f7/0_260_3900_2340/master/3900.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e0e449b18352333cc8c6ff06662c9ecc

Harris and Trump chase swing state votes as campaign nears climax | First Thing	Harris and Trump focus on key swing states of Arizona and Nevada. Plus, ‘brat’ is Collins’ word of the year Good morning. As the 2024 presidential race nears its climax on Tuesday, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump continue to rush around swing states, rallying voters in the hopes of being sworn into the world’s most powerful office on 20 January 2025. What are the polls showing? It’s unclear. Nationally, Harris is at 47% and Trump 46%, but due to the electoral college system, it’s going to come down to a few swing states. It’s neck and neck. How many have already voted? More than 65 million people have cast their ballots, as of 31 October at 11pm EST. How do you spend a billion dollars in election funding?

The confrontation marked the first time that America Pac’s leadership became aware of the problem – canvassers falsely claiming to have knocked on doors – that has raised the possibility that thousands of Trump voters might not be reached by the field operation.

Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaign in key swing states as electoral race heats up – US politics live	Harris and Trump campaign in key swing states of Arizona and Nevada as only five days remain until election Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the US election. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are locked in a nail-bitingly close US presidential election race. Harris maintains a single point advantage over her Republican rival. As of 30 October, the latest polls put Harris at 47%, and Trump at 46%. Read more from the Guardian’s poll tracker: Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris campaigned in the western part of the US, namely the key swing states of Arizona and Nevada. In her speech, Harris told Nevada: -Make no mistake: we will win.- Adding, -It is time for a new generation of leadership in America … And I am ready to offer that leadership.- During her appearances, Harris repeatedly criticised Trump’s -very offensive- remarks about being the -protector- of women -whether they like it or not-. Harris’s speech was followed by a performance by Jennifer Lopez in Las Vegas, as she seeks to connect with Latino voters in the final days of the race. Trump, meanwhile, appeared with far-right media personality Tucker Carlson in Phoenix, Arizona. Former president Donald Trump launched another attack on former Rep Liz Cheney late Thursday, calling the Republican former Wyoming congresswoman a -war hawk- and suggesting she might not be as willing to send troops to fight if she had guns pointed at her. Cheney has vocally opposed Trump since the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol and has become a surrogate for his Democratic opponent, vice-president Kamala Harris. After calling Cheney -a very dumb individual-, he said: -She’s a radical war hawk. Let’s put her with the rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. OK, let’s see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face.- More than 65 million people have cast their ballots in the race, as of 31 October at 11pm EST.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/01/kamala-harris-donald-trump-swing-states-campaign-us-politics-latest-updates	2024-11-01T03:31:52-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae3e8cac07fab615e8641c3c08199a8e07059f02/0_405_6001_3601/master/6001.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ef092a46dba1b69e5583cc494b7ccddc

Allies see a perfect role for him in advising a new Trump administration crackdown on offshore wind energy.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/trump-presidency-rfk-jr-offshore-wind-climate-crisis	2024-11-01T03:00:44-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58edbebf0bfd0eb1b9df8004912109e4020cbc05/0_229_4343_2605/master/4343.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8cc9cef69e6fe58e22d8d92406e40488
Treasury minister says markets have ‘PTSD’ from Liz Truss’s budget – UK politics live	Darren Jones says ‘markets always respond to budgets’ and says Office for Budget Responsibility reviewed plans as extra borrowing sees markets jitter The UK is in a -very different world- compared with the turmoil which followed Liz Truss’s economic plans, a minister has said as the government seeks to quell post-budget market jitters. The scale of extra borrowing in Rachel Reeves’s budget – around £32bn a year on average – saw yields on government bonds increase as the market responded to the chancellor’s plans. The value of the pound has also fallen against the dollar after Labour’s first budget in more than 14 years. Completely different in contrast to now: We’ve got verified reports from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility that say we meet our fiscal rules earlier than had been planned originally, 2027-2028, that those tough fiscal rules means there is a fiscal consolidation and that strong approach to public spending. We’re in a very, very different world.- Yes, but the question in the manifesto, the promise in the manifesto, was not to increase the rate of tax that employees pay in their payslip. It says that we make a promise to working people, that’s people who go to work and get a payslip, that we will not increase income tax or national insurance.- Rachel Reeves has been warned an extra £9bn of tax rises may be required to avoid a fresh austerity drive in key public services as her record tax-raising budget sent tremors through the financial markets. Threatening to undermine the chancellor’s claim that her budget would restore economic stability to Britain, government borrowing costs rose sharply in the City on Thursday as traders turned on Reeves’s tax and spending measures. Reform UK is facing a schism over its approach to Tommy Robinson’s supporters, after two high-profile party figures said it was wrong to disavow those who went to a weekend rally backing the far-right leader. The Independent Schools Council (ISC) has said it will launch legal action against the government’s decision to impose VAT on independent school fees. The council, which represents more than 1,400 private schools in the UK and abroad, reached its decision after a board meeting held on Thursday. More than half of people expect the number of those living in poverty to have risen by the end of the government’s current term, according to a study. Four in 10 Labour voters expect this to be the case by 2029, the research from King’s College London (KCL) and the Fairness Foundation suggested.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/01/markets-labour-budget-treasury-rachel-reeves-uk-politics-latest-updates	2024-11-01T02:53:10-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/272177df38b9a1de9623cf961299797f6d9b4a4b/0_115_3463_2078/master/3463.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ebddb682014dc0085bdc3a5030ca003

Middle East crisis live: Netanyahu says ability to counter ‘threats’ from Lebanon key to any ceasefire deal	Israeli prime minister reportedly told US envoys that return of displaced people was paramount; Israel resumes strikes on southern Beirut Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. Hochstein and McGurk, met the Israeli prime minister on Thursday to talk about a ceasefire proposal for Lebanon. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said negotiators made -good progress- toward a deal. -We’re hopeful that we will see things transition in Lebanon in a not too distant future,- US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said. Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, who had expressed optimism of a speedy settlement -in hours or days- earlier on Thursday, said that Israel’s -ongoing escalation- in his country -does not inspire optimism-. Netanyahu’s office said the prime minister -made it clear that the main point is not this or that agreement on paper but Israel’s ability and determination to enforce the agreement and thwart any threat to its security from Lebanon, in a manner that will return our residents securely to their homes-. Thursday marked a day when the most civilians in both Israel and Lebanon were killed since October 2023. The Lebanese health ministry said that Israeli attacks had killed 45 people in the previous 24 hours, amid bombing in the north-east Bekaa valley and infantry battles in the south. In one Bekaa village, eight people were killed from the same family. In northern Israel, seven people were killed by rocket fire from Lebanon, including four Thai agricultural workers. The Israeli army’s evacuation call for several areas of south Lebanon on Thursday included a Palestinian refugee camp. Among the areas listed was Rashidieh camp, which houses thousands of Palestinian refugees. Israel issued its second evacuation order for the city of Baalbek and two surrounding villages in the Bekaa valley on Thursday afternoon, carrying out a series of airstrikes on the village of Durous a few hours later. The evacuation orders had prompted a mass exodus of residents from the city, which is home to a Unesco world heritage site.

In an election awash in cash, how does a campaign spend a billion dollars?	The candidates have raised an extraordinary amount of money, with no shortage of places to spend it It was one of the most striking images of the final full week of the presidential election campaign: a giant projection of Kamala Harris’s face on the 516ft-wide, 366ft-tall Las Vegas Sphere. At a reported $450,000 per day for what is believed to be the first political ad to appear on the futuristic new attraction, it was also one of the most expensive. But even at those rates, it barely made a dent in the staggering election war chest of almost $1bn that Harris has built since replacing Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket this summer.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/election-campaign-spending-breakdown	2024-11-01T00:00:41-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b70c3f2b6428edb01f409688b9e177a396e52810/1_133_3611_2167/master/3611.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=14271f5d717d3ea0f6b535492d2c7a7c

Elon Musk’s ‘election integrity community’ on X is full of baseless claims	Feed is rife with posts of individuals deemed suspicious and calls for doxxing with little evidence provided of fault While Elon Musk faces his own election integrity questions offline, the X owner has deputized his followers to spot and report any -potential instances of voter fraud and irregularities-. The community he spawned is rife with unfounded claims passed off as evidence of voter fraud. Musk opted not to show up to a required court appearance Thursday in Philadelphia to respond to a lawsuit challenging his political action committee’s daily $1m voter giveaway. Meanwhile, online, he has started a dedicated community space on X, formerly Twitter, where he’s asked users to share any issues they see while voting. Users posting on the self-contained feed, the -election integrity community-, quickly began pointing out what they deemed as evidence of fraud and election interference. Tweets showing everything from ballots that arrived ripped, an ABC news system test, a postal worker doing his job and dropping off mail-in ballots were all presented as evidence that the upcoming presidential election had been compromised. Some users posted videos of individuals they deemed suspicious, despite providing little or no proof of suspicious activity and asked others in the community to help identify them.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/31/elon-musk-election-integrity-community-misinformation-disinformation	2024-10-31T14:40:02-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0effe181ba26d6ce70eeafbabea59db65d07f965/110_575_5709_3426/master/5709.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f9f3af8ed4a5f125fd135ebd87407729

Britain’s leading experts on the government’s finances said the chancellor’s tax measures on Wednesday had allowed for a substantial short-term increase in public service spending this year and next, but not thereafter.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/31/rachel-reeves-more-money-fix-public-services-ifs-autumn-budget	2024-10-31T04:43:44-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4521b2fd69708bc4256a528641c17958a8e41770/0_192_6596_3956/master/6596.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=478c195ebaa0e25f353f31fe42e011cb

Why were the floods in Spain so bad? A visual guide	Scores of people have died as country is hit by deadliest floods in decades At least 95 people have died in Spain after torrential rains triggered the country’s deadliest floods in decades, unleashing a deluge of muddy water that turned village streets into rivers, destroyed homes and swept away bridges, railways tracks and cars. An unknown number of people remain missing, while thousands of others are without electricity or phone service. The majority of those killed were in the coastal region of Valencia, where the state-run agency said that nearly a year’s worth of rain had fallen in just eight hours.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/31/why-were-the-floods-in-spain-so-bad-a-visual-guide	2024-10-31T04:18:47-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29c4d5f07f247fc1f376680fc1e75ab358d8c8a0/0_239_3585_2151/master/3585.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=94d165e6ea9cb3f39fc8ded152814276

Business leaders keep quiet on Trump – what are they saying in private?	Experts say top chief executives are treading a fine line to avoid any backlash in the event of a Trump victory After the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, America’s business leaders came out strongly in their criticism of Donald Trump. Now – as the Harris campaign brands Trump a -fascist- and Trump threatens retribution against -the enemy within- – there appears to be a conspiracy of silence. In fact, as the nation heads to the polls in an election that is too close to call, some of America’s most powerful chief executive appear to be cozying up to Trump again.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/31/business-leaders-trump-election	2024-10-31T04:00:16-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f0d030cefd009ab55262db0d05566641ed21dbe/0_34_4465_2679/master/4465.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d373609087801ac4845e7c815fd42930
US election live updates: Trump and Harris head west with six days to go	Data shows almost 60 million Americans have already voted in the election Good morning. It is less than a week before polls close at the 2024 U.S. election and more than 57.5 million Americans have already checked their ballots, according to the Election Lab at the University of Florida. Presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are still hot on the campaign trail in a fiercely contested race that is too close to call. Harris spoke in Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania state capital, one of few counties that voted for Joe Biden in 2020. Polls show a tied race in Pennsylvania. Arnold Schwarzenegger has announced that he is backing Harris in next week’s election. Schwarzenegger, 77, said that while he doesn’t -really do endorsements-, he felt compelled to formally endorse Harris and her pick for vice-president, Tim Walz. Trump refused to apologise for the comments made about Puerto Rico at his Madison Square Garden rally. -He’s a comedian, what can I tell you? I know nothing about him. I don’t know why he’s there.- A Pennsylvania judge on Wednesday sided with Trump’s campaign and agreed to extend an in-person voting option in suburban Philadelphia, where long lines on the final day led to complaints voters were being disfranchised by an unprepared election office. A majority of voters in swing states do not believe Trump will accept defeat if he loses next week’s presidential election and fear that his supporters will turn to violence in an attempt to install him in power, a new poll suggests.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/31/donald-trump-kamala-harris-us-election-latest-updates-live	2024-10-31T03:40:01-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b7b2ee4205458f88898432c673e29191a78d591/0_193_5725_3436/master/5725.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0e39cd51be229b718a71cccedfbd9925

Rachel Reeves accepts budget tax rises may impact wage increases – UK politics live	Chancellor has been appearing on TV and radio defending her budget Good morning. The day after budget day is normally when the most thorough and considered budget analysis starts to emerge, and rarely has there been more to chew over than there was in Rachel Reeves’s first budget as chancellor – a mamoth, £40bn-tax-raising fiscal reset with huge consequences for Britain for the rest of the decade. Reeves and her Tory shadow, Jeremy Hunt, are doing full media rounds this morning, and the leading budget thinktanks are publishing full studies of what was announced yesterday. In an interview with BBC Breakfast, Reeves accepted that people would get lower pay rises as a result of her decision to increase employers’ national insurance. She said: I said that [the national insurance increase] will have consequences. It will mean that businesses will have to absorb some of this through profits and it is likely to mean that wage increases might be slightly less than they otherwise would have been.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/31/rachel-reeves-autumn-budget-labour-tax-rises-uk-politics-latest	2024-10-31T01:09:23-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f56e0bb82e68b5fabd08840adb8c294c8cf1d2d8/0_94_2786_1671/master/2786.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4b0f0af4e19441432bbd07e2031f574b

Thursday briefing: What you need to know about Rachel Reeves’s plans for the economy	In today’s newsletter: They spent weeks bracing the country for ‘tough decisions’, but in Labour’s first budget in 14 years, the chancellor adopted a slightly more optimistic tone • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. It was Labour’s first budget in 14 years; it was the first budget ever to be delivered by a female chancellor; and, as a share of GDP, it takes taxes to their highest level since comparable records began. As heavily trailed as Rachel Reeves’s appearance at the dispatch box yesterday was, it was still a monumental political moment, and one that is likely to set the course of the country for many years to come. After weeks of paving the way for a rough budget by blaming her Conservative predecessors for the economic legacy she inherited, Reeves largely struck a more optimistic tone in her delivery. And, by some measures, she has successfully charted a course that will increase growth and balance the books without increasing the burden on those endlessly-discussed -working people- as heavily as had been expected. UK news | Keir Starmer has warned Tory leadership contenders Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch against undermining the police investigation into the Southport attack.

Australia news live: Greens offer unlimited mental health sessions on Medicare; report finds schools too close to main roads	Under proposal, Greens would remove cap of 10 subsidised mental health sessions a year after it was halved from 20 in late 2022. Follow the day’s news live Up to 55% of schools and childcare centres are unsafely close to main roads in some Australian suburbs, exposing children to deadly car pollution, according to a new report. A Climate Council report, released today, finds that about one in six schools and childcare centres across our capital cities are located within 100 metres of a busy road. That equates to more than 2,300 childcare centres and 827 schools. Let’s give more people in our cities better travel options, so it’s easier for more people to use shared and active means of getting around our cities - like walking, riding a bike, or taking public transport - more often. This will rapidly clean up our neighbourhoods, reduce air and climate pollution at the same time, and create healthier and safer spaces for our kids to thrive in. If you’re putting off mental healthcare because you can’t afford it, you’re not alone ... 1 in 3 big corporations pay no tax. The Greens will make big corporations pay their fair share of tax so you can see a psychologist for free and get unlimited mental health appointments through Medicare.-	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/oct/31/greens-unlimited-mental-health-sessions-medicare-report-schools-roads-politics-labor-coalition-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-qld-vic-nsw-climate-economy	2024-10-30T13:47:34-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/621e72b130476bd8f4efe2dfb1873383c66b72dc/0_227_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b52e48feeb18abbc8e9f48860380ea02

Labour’s first budget in 14 years included measures to close inheritance tax (IHT) loopholes and press ahead with scrapping the controversial non-dom tax status, as well as levying higher taxes on private jet flights.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/reeves-accused-of-betraying-small-family-firms-with-inheritance-tax-rises	2024-10-30T12:28:22-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1199e086a18b1bc1608b655e5e94d80962fca5ad/63_0_4874_2925/master/4874.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4cdf69fac7d00ff923467288e86a5bd2
Labour wants to reverse decline – but with a big budget comes a big risk	The government knows cynical voters will need to see tangible change in public services and to feel better off At the final political cabinet before Rachel Reeves delivered her first budget this week, ministers were presented with internal party research on what the public was expecting. In the months since the general election, they had been fed a regular diet of gloomy warnings about the state of the economic inheritance and, more recently, high levels of pre-budget news coverage, so it was firmly on their horizon.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/labour-wants-to-reverse-decline-but-with-a-big-budget-comes-a-big-risk	2024-10-30T12:11:17-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d05ddb67beca3bad048de17e37a320012aba670e/591_756_6039_3626/master/6039.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5edc404cc82987ede5c09895f2c0f8f1

In her speech, Reeves harked back to the times Labour governments had arrived in power – in 1945, 1964 and 1979 – needing to sort out Britain’s problems. This was most like a mid-1960s budget, with its vision of a bigger state used to modernise the economy.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/rachel-reeves-goes-back-to-the-future-with-a-tax-and-spend-budget	2024-10-30T10:00:40-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d611f668352dd6db9a8056c1f2d880defa3e1ba6/0_63_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=490dbbc73ce5e627874f28d592e81c46

Most swing state voters believe Trump will not accept defeat if he loses election	Survey in seven battleground states finds most fear Trump supporters would use violence to install him in power A majority of voters in swing states do not believe Donald Trump will accept defeat if he loses next week’s presidential election and fear that his supporters will turn to violence in an attempt to install him in power, a new poll suggests.

Spain’s deadly floods and severe droughts are two faces of the climate change coin	Scientists say violent weather battering the Mediterranean is a harbinger of what the rest of Europe can soon expect Residents of Chiva, a small town on the outskirts of Valencia, can expect a grim future of worsening drought as the planet heats up and the country dries out. But on Tuesday, they also witnessed a year’s worth of rainfall in a matter of hours. The torrential rains that flooded southern and eastern Spain last night, ripping away bridges and tearing through towns, have killed 64 people and counting. Fossil fuel pollution plays a role in warping both extremes of the water cycle: heat evaporates water, leaving people and plants parched, but hot air can hold more moisture, increasing the potential for catastrophic downpours.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/30/spain-deadly-floods-and-severe-droughts-are-two-faces-of-the-climate-change-coin	2024-10-30T07:45:40-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08ccb6540674b9b8d03790b45395e7cc2b82acd0/0_68_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=236b7ab30169e5c90dc18be0fbfca673

First Thing: Kamala Harris calls for a ‘new generation of leadership’	VP delivers speech from site of Trump’s speech before deadly January 6 attack. Plus, a lost Maya city is found Good morning. With the White House illuminated behind her, Kamala Harris asked the vanishing slice of undecided Americans to elect a -new generation of leadership-, likening Donald Trump to a -petty tyrant- who had stood in the very same spot nearly four years ago and, in a last-gasp effort to cling to power, helped incite the mob that stormed the US Capitol. What was the focus of Harris’s speech? The Democratic nominee’s big speech mentioned Trump by name 24 times and Joe Biden only once. It confirmed that, even when Trump is not commander-in-chief, he still commands the American psyche. Sorry, who did you mean to condemn? Responding to the Trump rally opener calling Puerto Rico an -island of garbage-, Joe Biden got into hot water himself: -The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters’ … his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.- The president later clarified that he was condemning the demonization of Latinos, not calling Trump supporters garbage. The Trump rally on Sunday in New York opened with a series of racist remarks about Puerto Rico, Latinos, Jews and Palestinians. Why did South Carolina pause executions for 13 years?

But neither candidate captures the realities of US immigration.

Autumn budget live: major tax rises expected as Rachel Reeves prepares to set out first Labour budget in 15 years	The chancellor will deliver the budget at around 12.30pm GMT, just after PMQs Good morning. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, will today seek to reset the trajectory of public spending and taxation for the rest of this parliament – perhaps for a decade, based on Labour’s pre-election rhetoric – with what is set to be the biggest tax-raising budget in history, at least in cash terms. Larry Elliott and Pippa Crerar preview it here, in our overnight story. In recent years budgets have become two-week news events, with many of the main measures being covertly, or overtly, announced in advanced by the Treasury, instead of being unbundled as a surprise in the hour-long Commons statements. This year that has been happening even more than usual, to the extent that government insiders are saying that there will be no surprises in speech this afternoon. That means that she won’t use her last two minutes to unveil an out-of-the-blue tax cut or spending bonanza destined to grab the news headlines; it doesn’t mean that there won’t be plenty of interesting news in the budget, and things we did not know. With most of the big announcements, we have a broad indication of what’s coming, but not the detail. My belief in Britain burns brighter than ever. And the prize on offer to today is immense. More pounds in people’s pockets. An NHS that is there when you need it. An economy that is growing, creating wealth and opportunity for all. Because that is the only way to improve living standards. [Reeves] will make clear that this budget rejects austerity, instead prioritising economic stability, investment and reform. The budget will ensure funding to cut hospital waiting lists, unlock affordable homes and new investment to rebuild schools. Meanwhile, working people won’t face higher taxes in their payslips in line with the manifesto commitment not to increase taxes on income tax, VAT or employee national insurance. The chancellor will reflect on the tough decisions she has had to make to restore economic stability, on spending and welfare by cracking down on fraud, tax avoidance and waste, and making sure every penny of taxpayer money is spent wisely.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/30/autumn-budget-2024-tax-rachel-reeves-labour	2024-10-30T01:34:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a90fa952722012b5f887c3b1e68bc9754de9e40/134_180_771_463/master/771.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cc91b48d8c820da24daa903fca3c6473

Middle East crisis live: Israeli airstrikes and tank advances reported in Lebanon	Israel hits towns of Sarafand and Haret Saida, says Lebanese health ministry; ‘large number’ of tanks cross Israeli border, local media reports Israeli tanks entered the outskirts of the Lebanese village of Khiam in their deepest incursion yet into southern Lebanon in their ground operation, Lebanese media reported, while the health ministry said at least 14 people were killed in Israeli strikes on the south. The official National News Agency on Tuesday reported the entry of a -large number- of Israeli tanks into the eastern outskirts of the town of Khiam, about 6km from the border with Israel. At least 93 Palestinians were killed or missing and dozens injured in an Israeli strike on a crowded block of flats in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya, the Gaza health ministry said on Tuesday. The US state department called the incident -horrifying-. Medics said at least 20 children were among the dead. -A number of victims are still under the rubble and on the roads, and ambulance and civil defence crews cannot reach them,- the health ministry said. Israel is not addressing the -catastrophic humanitarian crisis- in Gaza, the US envoy to the United Nations told the UN security council. Linda Thomas-Greenfield’s remarks on Tuesday came as a Washington-imposed deadline looms for Israel to improve the situation on the ground in Gaza or face potential restrictions on US military aid. Four Israeli soldiers were killed in combat in northern Gaza, with one officer severely injured, the Israeli military said. Separately, the military said another soldier died from wounds sustained in battle in southern Lebanon, bringing the total number of Israeli soldiers killed since October last year to 777. The UN said that if Israel put in place new laws cutting ties with the UN Palestinian relief agency Unrwa, the Israeli government would have to meet their needs under international law. Secretary general António Guterres said Unrwa would be prevented from doing work mandated by the UN general assembly if Israel implemented the laws, and called on it -to act consistently with its obligations-. He wrote in a letter to Benjamin Netanyahu about the -devastating impact- on Palestinians in the occupied territories if the legislation was implemented, the UN chief’s spokesperson said. The World Health Organization head, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the Israeli parliament’s decision was -intolerable- and would have -devastating consequences-. Norway said it would seek clarification from the international court of justice over Israel’s aid obligations after the Israeli vote on Unrwa. The Israeli UN ambassador said Israel would facilitate humanitarian aid in Gaza but asserted that -Unrwa has failed in its mandate and is no longer the right agency for this job-. Two senior advisers to the US president, Joe Biden, will arrive in Israel on Thursday to try to close a deal that would end the war in Lebanon, Axios reported on Tuesday, citing three unidentified sources. The US news website quoted Israeli and US officials as saying the deal to end Israel-Hezbollah fighting could be achieved within a few weeks. At least 43,061 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and 101,223 injured in Israeli airstrikes since last October, according to the latest figures from the territory’s health ministry on Tuesday. The UN’s World Food Programme called for immediate action to avert famine in northern Gaza. It said north Gaza -continues to deteriorate, the likelihood of a larger group being impacted by famine will surely increase-. In Gaza’s two northern governorates, where about 300,000 people remain trapped, famine was expected to arrive between now and May.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/30/middle-east-israel-gaza-lebanon-hamas-hezbollah	2024-10-30T00:31:36-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec41fe72f48e71a79f02e3bc3ce85c3093bf8c1e/0_50_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eead8b49bdbe6c95e5d492a59538b40a

Wednesday briefing: Five key messages that will define the budget	In today’s newsletter: Labour has told two stories about Rachel Reeves’ budget. Will it be an end to austerity – or an acceptance of -the harsh light of fiscal reality-? • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. There will be no triumphalism, no big giveaways and certainly no rabbits out of hats: this, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have been at pains to tell us, is going to be a very grownup budget. And even though Reeves will promise today that -the prize on offer is immense-, we might also therefore expect it to be a painful one. Since the entire thing appears to have been briefed out in advance over the last few weeks, nobody can say they haven’t been warned. In a way, it feels like two budgets: the optimism and ambition of a minimum wage rise, a major boost for the NHS, and significant new investment in infrastructure; and a bleaker story about misleading pledges, limited ambitions, and the biggest set of tax increases in budget history. UK news | The suspect charged with the murder of three girls in Southport is to be separately prosecuted on suspicion of possessing terrorist material and producing ricin, a powerful poison, police have said. Axel Rudakubana is due to appear in court on Wednesday. US election | Kamala Harris urged American voters to elect a -new generation of leadership- in a speech at the same place Donald Trump spoke on January 6 almost four years ago. Likening her opponent to a -petty tyrant-, Harris told the crowd: -Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list … I will walk in with a to-do list.- Middle East | Israel is not addressing the -catastrophic humanitarian crisis- in Gaza, the US envoy to the UN has said, ahead of a deadline for the Israelis to improve the situation or face potential restrictions on US military aid. The warning came as Gaza’s civil defence agency said 93 people had been killed in an airstrike on a crowded block of flats. Conservatives | Britain’s former colonies should be thankful for the legacy of empire, Conservative leadership candidate Robert Jenrick has said. Jenrick’s comments, which follow an agreement among Commonwealth leaders that -the time has come- to discuss reparations, were condemned as -an obnoxious distortion of history-. Mexico | A team of researchers have stumbled on a lost Maya city of temple pyramids, enclosed plazas and a reservoir, all hidden for centuries by the Mexican jungle. The discovery was made possible by the use of laser mapping techniques in an area previously ignored by archaeologists.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/30/wednesday-briefing-five-key-messages-that-will-define-the-budget	2024-10-29T23:52:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a90fa952722012b5f887c3b1e68bc9754de9e40/0_46_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=300f7cf7d413225d4079658a8d5cd135

Mystery artist leaves neo-Nazi tiki torch ‘tribute’ to Trump near White House	Unknown artist who made bronze piece of feces to ‘honor’ January 6 rioters appears to be behind new statue The unknown artist or artists who fashioned a swirled bronze piece of feces on a replica of former US house speaker Nancy Pelosi’s desk – and placed it on the National Mall recently – appear to have struck again. This time, the artistic-political commentary is focused not on the January 6 2021 US Capitol attack carried out by Donald Trump supporters, when a participant did indeed defecate on Pelosi’s desk. Instead, the display satirically evokes the notorious white nationalist Unite the Right Tiki torch parade through Charlottesville’s University of Virginia campus in August 2017, with some marchers chanting -Jews will not replace us-.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/29/neo-nazi-tiki-torch-statue	2024-10-29T10:16:36-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b64749552f4d6baee13ce47442351d081268ebf/0_82_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ae05506c8ec1f41fe4aba5703a44fc3c

Nine days of horror as Israel steps up offensive on exhausted northern Gaza	With families too worn out to flee yet again, the death toll in recent strikes is nearing 300 Israel’s recent offensive in northern Gaza has claimed more than 700 lives in a little over three weeks, with nearly 300 deaths, mainly in the north, in the past nine days alone. While it has attempted to justify its renewed focus on the north by claiming it is targeting regrouped Hamas fighters, the intensity of the fighting has caused heavy losses on the 100,000 civilians still living there. Many of them are families, exhausted by Israel’s multiple forced displacement orders, who have chosen to stay in the north. The Israeli military has repeatedly struck shelters for displaced people across Gaza, saying it is carrying out precise strikes targeting Palestinian militants and has tried to avoid harming civilians. The strikes have often killed women and children. These are the reported deaths in the past nine days:	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/nine-days-of-horror-as-israel-steps-up-offensive-on-exhausted-northern-gaza	2024-10-29T08:52:28-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41d317aaa505eb64e3ba554e946db8049c8ede15/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=593d6a9963f00447c372e787642bf645

Private schools can mitigate VAT on fees ‘if they’re the good charities they say they are’, minister says – UK politics live	Wes Streeting says private schools have hiked fees above inflation for over a decade and can prevent pupils leaving if they really are charitable Health secretary Wes Streeting has claimed that the government is already -ramping up- a promised additional 40,000 weekly NHS appointments in England, though he said due to data lag he could not provide precise figures. Speaking on LBC radio, Streeting said it would be a hard winter ahead for the NHS, but that tomorrow’s budget was putting a level of funding in place to arrest a decline in the health service. I will come back on your programme to mark one year of a Labour government and tell you how many more appointments have been delivered in the first year of a Labour government compared to the previous year of Conservative government. And therefore I will be able to confidently tell you that we will have honoured our promise to deliver 40,000 more appointments a week well within the first year of a Labour government. That was the promise we made. It is a promise we will keep. I can’t pretend that there’s a magic wand that I can wave so that no one will be waiting on a trolley in the corridor this winter. And nor am I going to say that is any more acceptable under a Labour government than it was under a Conservative government. I would just say to independent schools, you have hiked your fees up with inflation-busting increases year after year after year since 2010 and now you’re pleading poverty. If you are worried about whether children in your schools will continue to access your schools, you’ll have to cut your cloth in the way that state schools have had to. They have hiked up their fees with inflation-busting increases for well over a decade, and they can, I’m sure, take steps to mitigate against children being forced to drop out if if they’re the good charities they say they are.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/29/autumn-budget-labour-conservatives-keir-starmer-rachel-reeves	2024-10-29T02:03:26-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66df3442af71d38a0a7aefd5f581b8f5cb4bba1e/0_317_7177_4306/master/7177.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=36abfe9baed8fbf05980a384d0b8ccb4
Kamala Harris to urge voters to ‘turn the page’ on era of Trump	Vice-president to strike hopeful tone in remarks delivered from site of Trump’s speech before deadly January 6 attack With the presidential race deadlocked a week before election day, Kamala Harris will call on voters to -turn the page- on the Trump era, in remarks delivered from a park near the White House where the former president spoke before a mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol in a last effort to overturn his 2020 loss. The Harris campaign has described the remarks as a major address that will underline the vice-president’s closing message, in a location she hopes will remind voters precisely why the electorate denied Trump a second term four years ago. She is expected to cast Trump as a divisive figure who will spend his term consumed by vengeance, leveraging the power of the presidency against his political enemies rather than in service of the American people.

Tuesday briefing: Some Democrats are grimly convinced that Trump is going to win. What does the evidence show?	In today’s newsletter: The polls are neck and neck. So why are some Kamala Harris supporters convinced the Republicans have the election in the bag? • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. With a week to go until America votes, the polls consistently show Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in a statistical dead heat. The nerds who simulate the race hundreds of times to model the likelihood of each result are consistently finding extraordinarily even chances between the two. And nothing that happens – not assassination attempts, Kamalamentum, convention speeches, running mate selections, celebrity endorsements, multi-million-dollar political ads, the debate, erratic rally performances, or plausible accusations of fascist tendencies – seems to change anything for more than a minute. The election, in summary, looks too close to call. Budget | The government is expected to announce an increase of about 4% to NHS funding, an increase that could translate to about £7bn for the health budget in England. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said that the money would deliver more surgical hubs and radiotherapy machines in a drive to add 40,000 appointments each week. Middle East | Israel’s parliament has voted to ban the UN relief and works agency (Unrwa) from the country within 90 days. Alongside a decision to declare Unrwa a terror group, the move is expected to lead to the closure of Unrwa’s East Jerusalem headquarters and would effectively block the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza via Rafah. Crime | The far-right activist Tommy Robinson has been jailed for 18 months for contempt of court for repeating false allegations against a Syrian refugee, in breach of an injunction. Robinson had repeated his false claim that Jamal Hijazi, who had been filmed being attacked at a school in West Yorkshire, -violently attacks young English girls- despite losing a libel case. Justice | Prisoners serving controversial indeterminate sentences were given minimum terms of less than six months but have remained in jail for at least 16 years, newly released data shows. Wildlife | Hedgehogs are now listed as -near threatened- on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s red list, after a decline in numbers of at least 30% over the past decade across much of their range.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/tuesday-briefing-some-democrats-are-grimly-convinced-that-trump-is-going-to-win-what-does-the-evidence-show	2024-10-28T23:51:49-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/768255fc6bbd8f3c926798ee13d11e155138a043/0_341_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2ea226dfe4ba9953f183a4126a05120f

Therapy-speak and 80s hairstyles: will Harris’s Brené Brown sit-down swing white female voters?	The Democrat’s cozy chat with the vulnerability expert was largely apolitical – which could play well with a key demographic In the quest to win over white female voters – 53% of whom showed up for Donald Trump in 2020 – Kamala Harris made her case on a podcast hosted by one of their beloved avatars, the vulnerability researcher Brené Brown. The episode, released on Monday, was a mostly fluffy discussion about leadership, trauma and the notion of voting as agency in an uncontrollable news cycle. Brown, a University of Houston professor and bestselling author who has spent two decades studying social sciences, became an overnight celebrity after giving a 2010 Ted Talk called -the power of vulnerability-. One could argue the talk, which birthed Brown’s Oprah-approved speaking empire, also spawned our culture’s current obsession with therapy-speak.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/28/kamala-harris-brene-brown-interview	2024-10-28T12:48:16-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c6b881abca741c6a410b4c046d0bf6f175d1a06/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=10a3e4e0f41f9b871fb6b2e8dc87396c

As CNN reported, between 2017 and 2021, such qualms did not stop McCormick overseeing an increase in Bridgewater’s Chinese holdings from $1.6m to $1.77bn. Nor, according to Bloomberg, did Bridgewater flinch from significant investments in companies that supply the Chinese military.

Starmer to set out ‘harsh’ reality of fiscal situation in speech – UK politics live	Prime minister will say government will ignore ‘populist chorus of easy answers’ as it is set to raise taxes and rewrite fiscal rules in this week’s budget Cabinet minister Pat McFadden has said there are -real reasons- to have optimism as the country approaches the first Labour budget for 14 years later this week. He stated that the government had -inherited a plan to decline, to reduce, investment- from Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government, and that the measures Labour were taking in the budget were -tough decisions- but the start of a turnaround. I think people should look for three things in the budget. Will it stabilize the country’s public finances and do so in a way that keeps our promises? It will Will it also start to turn around the public services and the NHS in particular. We will start that road with a combination of both investment and reform. This is not 1997, when the economy was decent but public services were on their knees. And it’s not 2010, where public services were strong, but the public finances were weak. These are unprecedented circumstances. And that’s before we even get to the long-term challenges ignored for 14 years: an economy riddled with weakness on productivity and investment, a state that needs urgent modernisation to face down the challenge of a volatile world. The Conservatives have raised the tax burden to a 70-year high. We will ensure taxes on working people are kept as low as possible. Labour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of income Tax, or VAT.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/28/keir-starmer-budget-harsh-light-fiscal-reality-uk-politics-live	2024-10-28T02:01:33-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71ec316594f542bce47db67efad8890907accb41/1138_0_1932_1159/master/1932.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a0b2f2f17585e73ff7cd41fe493bfc16

Middle East crisis live: Iranian military chief warns Israel of ‘bitter consequences’ over weekend’s airstrikes	Comments from commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps come as country mulls response to attacks Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing coverage of the Middle East crisis amid Israel’s ongoing wars on Lebanon and Gaza. The top commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has warned Israel it would face -bitter consequences- after its attack on Iranian military sites early on Saturday, according to local media reports. Israel’s parliament – the Knesset – is expected to vote on Monday on a pair of bills that, if passed, will make it impossible for the UN relief and works agency for Palestinians (Unrwa) to operate in Gaza and the West Bank. One of the bills seeks to ban Unrwa from operating within Israel’s sovereign territory, stating that the agency -shall not establish any representation, provide any services or conduct any activities within the territory of Israel-. This would lead to closure of the Unrwa headquarters in East Jerusalem and end visas for Unrwa staff. The measures look to have a cross-party majority of about 100 of the 120 members, despite widespread opposition from other countries, including most of Israel’s allies. At least three people were killed and two others injured by Israeli attacks on the Raml neighbourhood in the Lebanese city of Tyre, according to the country’s national news agency.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/28/israel-iran-gaza-lebanon-unrwa-middle-east-crisis-news	2024-10-28T00:47:30-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65650d9fef0c612592bb8d519482cd75fba18d3b/0_211_3185_1912/master/3185.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9aac3362c72b72728b3830a25183bcbc

Washington Post stirs up fury in liberal America over neutral election stance	Failure to endorse any US presidential candidate for first time in decades ‘undermines’ paper’s independence, say critics Widespread fury and shock ripped through liberal America over the weekend after news that the Washington Post, home of the Watergate scandal exposé, the paper that ran the Pentagon Papers, will not now endorse Kamala Harris for president. But angry responses were quickly replaced by two pressing questions: how did it happen, and how could readers best protest? At the centre of the storm is William Lewis, the British ­newspaperman who became Washington Post publisher and CEO in January. The 55-year-old north Londoner broke the decision to staff on Friday couched in terms that evoked the title’s traditions.	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/oct/26/washington-post-stirs-up-fury-in-liberal-america-over-neutral-election-stance	2024-10-26T11:29:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be501fe8fa57d3d84994830ffce63252cfb65315/0_108_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fce2437b712661d2195049261e988d14
Rachel Reeves has promised not to raise taxes, so how can she fill budget coffers?	Chancellor said to be planning measures including raising employer NI contributions and capital gains tax rates. We consider the likelihood of each and the potential for a row During the general election campaign, Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal studies repeatedly accused both main parties of indulging in a -conspiracy of silence- over their economic policies. Neither Labour nor the Tories would admit, he complained, that if they won they would have to announce huge tax rises or spending cuts to restore the public finances to anything resembling good health. On Wednesday, 118 days after Labour won the election, Rachel Reeves will prove Johnson right. In her first budget she will spell out plans to raise an eye-watering sum of about £40bn from tax rises and spending reductions to wipe the slate clean and to pump funds into public services. She will also confirm changes to debt rules that will release up to £50bn more to borrow for long-term investment in new national infrastructure.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/26/rachel-reeves-has-promised-not-to-raise-taxes-so-how-can-she-fill-budget-coffers	2024-10-26T11:06:01-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80b33b2ba8c5c52d788e0cedcd34a6f37e31fbfe/268_259_1454_872/master/1454.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cc58632d237536dc1b97524632e53312

Iran-Israel’s shadow war is out in the open and will only escalate unless causes addressed	Now face-to-face military confrontation on each other’s soil has been normalised For years, Israel and Iran have waged a -shadow war-, attacking each other indirectly using proxy forces, assassinations, informants, spies and hybrid, non-military covert means. Now this undeclared, largely silent war is undisguisedly out in the open. It’s become a shooting war, it’s noisy, it’s escalating, and there’s no end in sight. This is not to say Israel’s large-scale, three-wave air assault on Tehran and other targets inside Iran early on Saturday morning means the two enemies are now engaged in all-out conflict. This is not yet the full-scale, region-wide conflagration so many in the Middle East fear.

And his last pitch is as dark and sinister as any he’s made while campaigning the last two years. The US is a -garbage can for the world-, he said at a Thursday rally in Arizona, where he railed against people coming into the country illegally and the Democrats, who Trump called incompetent and stupid.

Trump, Vance to travel to Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia; Harris to appear with Michelle Obama in Michigan – live	Candidates take their pitch to road as election looms, with celebrity endorsements and appearances Good morning, with just over a week left before election day, the race is nail-bitingly close. We’ll be bringing you the latest headlines and analysis today as the campaigns continue. This morning, we’re expecting Donald Trump to deliver remarks at a rally in Novi, Michigan, before traveling to State College, Pennsylvania. His running mate, JD Vance, will similarly speak in Atlanta, Georgia, before heading to Erie, Pennsylvania. In her first event of the campaign, Michelle Obama will hold a get-out-the-vote rally alongside Kamala Harris in Kalamazoo, Michigan. In Houston yesterday, Kamala Harris was joined on stage by superstar singer Beyoncé, congressman Colin Allred, musician Willie Nelson, actor Jessica Alba, several Texas-based OB-GYNs and families affected by the state’s abortion ban in what her campaign is calling their largest rally to date. Harris focused her remarks on the state’s abortion ban, which sparked a slew of abortion restrictions nationwide. Donald Trump’s rally in Traverse City, Michigan, was delayed several hours last night after the ex-president’s interview with podcast host Joe Rogan lasted three hours. Harris and Trump are tied at 48% each for the popular vote for the US presidential election, according to the final New York Times/Siena College national poll published on today. The Washington Post declined to endorse a presidential candidate for the first time since the 1980s. Some staffers and reporters have said the decision was allegedly made by the Post’s owner, billionaire Jeff Bezos.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/26/kamala-harris-donald-trump-us-elections-politics	2024-10-26T08:09:06-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77c55c980fa29051c69f6afdcf7fe2cb0d79be26/0_371_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c7468e7bd44a1df1531d61b35be792c

From Grenfell to Bloody Sunday, the UK government’s formal apologies	UK has resisted calls to apologise over slave trade or colonialism but has said sorry for other historical wrongs As leaders gathered at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) in the Pacific nation of Samoa this week, they hoped that the UK government and King Charles might use the summit as an opportunity to issue an apology for Britain’s colonial past and discuss reparatory justice. While their concerns were acknowledged, the UK stressed it would not pay reparations, and while Keir Starmer called the slave trade -abhorrent-, the government is yet to make a formal apology. King Charles acknowledged -painful aspects- of Britain’s past but stopped short of saying sorry.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/from-grenfell-to-bloody-sunday-government-formal-apologies-slavery-colonialism-reparations	2024-10-26T07:31:08-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a06eff770eff61688bf3ceacaef07a93485ad8bf/0_58_4448_2670/master/4448.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bab1689328c15090f78b5d6e4e70e41e

The internal Iranian debate on how to respond to the long-awaited Israeli attack turns on whether to treat Israel’s breach of Iranian national sovereignty as too grave to be ignored, or instead to heed the advice coming from the region and from the US to acknowledge the relatively limited nature of the attack and to step back from the brink by not launching reprisals.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/iran-mocks-israel-attacks-weak-hardliners-reprisal	2024-10-26T05:30:11-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bcf1228ed5553452e1f8cf6e219d244d1d4256e/42_0_5603_3363/master/5603.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5e7ae89c98a7299eb5d1ed902f89a9d9

More people have crossed Channel in small boats this year than in all of 2023	Labour’s policy to ‘smash the gangs’ is not yet having an impact, Home Office figures show The number of migrants who have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year has exceeded the total number that arrived in the whole of 2023, according to figures published by the Home Office.

IDF strikes military sites in Iran: what we know so far	The IDF says it hit military targets in Iran in response to ‘continuous’ attacks on Israel. Here is everything we know so far Israel has struck military targets inside Iran in retaliatory attack that a senior US official described as -extensive but precise-. Iran said three sites were hit, and that -limited damage- was caused. Here is everything we know so far: Israel struck military sites in Iran early on Saturday, saying it was in response to -months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the state of Israel-. The move was widely expected after Tehran’s strikes on Israel earlier this month. Kan, the Israeli public broadcaster, said dozens of fighter jets were involved. The Israeli military said on Saturday morning it hit missile manufacturing sites and aerial defences in several areas inside Iran and had completed its -targeted- air attacks, and that its planes had safely returned home. Israel’s public broadcaster said three waves of strikes had been completed. The Israeli military said after its airstrikes: -If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond.- Two soldiers were killed in Saturday morning’s Israeli airstrikes on Iran, the official Iranian news agency IRNA reported. At least seven explosions were reported in the skies over the capital, Tehran, and nearby Karaj as well as the eastern city of Mashhad just after 2.30am local time on Saturday, as Israeli jets struck military targets in the country. Iran said its air defence system successfully countered Israel’s attacks on military targets in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam, with -limited damage- to some locations. A semi-official Iranian news agency vowed a -proportional reaction- to Israeli moves against Tehran. A senior Biden official said the strikes were -extensive-, -precise- and against military targets across Iran in order to deter future aggression. The official stressed that the US considered the operation to be an -end to the exchange of fire between Israel and Iran- and that the US had no involvement in the Israeli military operation. The US news outlet Axios reported on Saturday that US and Israeli officials assess that Iran will respond militarily but in a limited fashion. Iran and Iraq briefly suspended all flights after the Israeli strikes. Iran’s civil aviation authority later resumed flights from 9am (05.30 GMT) on Saturday. Iranian media initially appeared to downplay the airstrikes, noting that Tehran’s airport was operating normally. State TV reported several strong explosions heard around the capital, while the state news agency, IRNA, said there had been no casualties. There was no immediate official comment about the source of explosions, which Iranian news outlets reported were under investigation. Air defence systems were activated around the country. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) took the rare step of acknowledging the attack on Iran, in a statement that confirmed a decades-old shadow war between the enemy states has now firmly moved into the open. The IDF posted on X: -In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the state of Israel – right now the Israel Defense Forces is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran.- The attacks were widely expected as a retaliation to a missile barrage launched by Iran on 1 October that saw an estimated 180 ballistic missiles fired towards Tel Aviv and military bases, in an unprecedented direct altercation between the two regional enemy states.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-strikes-military-sites-in-iran-what-we-know-so-far	2024-10-25T23:31:58-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e4ca363c414e6a63cf28ca6ace0d8b6b1a07ca5/64_55_1454_873/master/1454.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=71447b9c6088abf77ffc414a46f5e4a8

Middle East crisis live: Israel launches airstrikes on military targets in Iran	IDF spokesman says strikes are a response to ‘months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran’, as explosions are heard around Tehran and nearby city of Karaj Welcome to our continuing live coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. Here’s a snapshot of the latest news. Israel has launched direct airstrikes against Iran in a high-stakes retaliatory attack that could bring the Middle East closer to a regional war, drawing in the US. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had begun to launch -precise strikes on military targets in Iran- in response to -months of continuous attacks- from Iran against Israel. Iranian state TV reported several strong explosions heard around Tehran. There were no casualties, the state news agency IRNA said. There was no immediate official Iranian comment about the source of explosions, which Iranian news outlets reported were under investigation. A US official confirmed that Israel notified Washington before carrying out the strikes, and that the US had no involvement in Israel’s military operation. The White House said it understood Israel was conducting the strikes -as an exercise of self-defence-. Some of the blasts reportedly occurred near Imam Khomeni international airport. Iran’s Tasnim news agency said civilian flights were operating normally as of Friday morning. In Gaza, Israeli military strikes across the territory have killed at least 72 Palestinians since Thursday night, including strikes on residential areas in southern Gaza that killed 38 people, including 13 children from the same extended family, Palestinian health officials said. Gaza’s health ministry reported that dozens of people were wounded as Israeli airstrikes and shelling pounded the southern city of Khan Younis. Palestinians said the neighbourhood was hit with no warning. Israeli strikes on three houses in Beit Lahiya killed 25 people and wounded dozens more, medics said. Later on Friday, an Israeli airstrike killed nine people in Shati camp in Gaza City, medics said. The UN rights chief, Volker Türk, described Israel’s renewed assault on northern Gaza as the -darkest moment- of the year-long war on the territory so far. -We are facing what could amount to atrocity crimes, including potentially extending to crimes against humanity,- Türk said in a statement on Friday. Three journalists from the Hezbollah-affiliated TV stations Al Mayadeen and Al-Manar were killed and several others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on their press station in Hasbaya, southern Lebanon, early on Friday morning. The strikes hit a group of small chalets that 18 journalists from at least seven different media outlets – including Al Jazeera, Sky News Arabia and TRT – were staying in while covering the Israel-Hezbollah war in south Lebanon. Several cars with -Press- signs on them were parked in front of the site. Lebanon’s prime minister, Najib Mikati, said the attack was -deliberate- and -aims to terrorise the media to cover up crimes and destruction-. UN peacekeepers withdrew from a observation post in Zahajra town in south Lebanon on Tuesday after Israeli forces fired at it, the force said on Friday. Unifil added that the Israeli military has repeatedly demanded that its peacekeepers vacate its positions along the Blue Line and deliberately damaged camera, lighting and communications equipment at some of these positions. Two people were killed in a strike on Majd al-Krum in northern Israel, Israeli media said on Friday, following a statement from Hezbollah saying that it targeted the northern Israeli town of Karmiel with a large missile salvo. Lebanon’s transport minister, Ali Hamieh, said Israeli bombing put a second border crossing between the country and Syria out of service, leaving one official passage between the two nations operational. The UN refugee agency (Unhcr) warned that Israel’s overnight airstrike on the Jousieh crossing in Lebanon’s northern Bekaa area jeopardised the main escape route for people fleeing the conflict in Lebanon in search of refuge in Syria. More than half a million people, mostly Syrians, had crossed into Syrian territory since Israel began heavily striking Lebanon late last month, according to figures by the Lebanese authorities on Friday.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/26/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-airstrikes-iran-lebanon-gaza-hamas-hezbollah-latest-updates	2024-10-25T19:39:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b3fedf835a460ca610bbec9979490678aadfdce/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d26de4a579a3d819424f029f067e6210

Tiny house with erotic frescoes uncovered in Pompeii	Paintings include one depicting a scantily clad Phaedra, mythological queen of Athens, and her stepson Hippolytus A tiny house featuring erotic frescoes is the latest discovery in the ruins of the ancient Roman city of Pompeii. Experts say the exquisitely decorated abode, called the House of Phaedra after the mythological queen of Athens, sheds light on the changing architectural styles in the first century AD but is also further proof that the residents of Pompeii had an appetite for sensual art. The vividly coloured wall paintings include one depicting a sexual encounter between a satyr and a nymph on a bed and one of a scantily clad Phaedra and her stepson Hippolytus whom, according to Greek legend, she accused of rape after he spurned her advances. Another fresco features gods presumed to be Venus and Adonis.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/25/tiny-house-erotic-frescoes-phaedra-pompeii	2024-10-25T07:36:45-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2078b391bc49ddb042bc688f06e4fb21e7dc710d/0_33_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7c345d467ac20aabdbc3f5c44b07dab1

Transition to electric cars will mean £25bn a year in fuel duty disappearing from government coffers, so what are the alternatives? While the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, grapples with the parlous £40bn funding gap in Britain’s finances, another £25bn of annual revenue is revving up to disappear into the sunset. As the Treasury knows all too well, turning cars electric will spell the end of that great money-spinner fuel duty.

‘Working people’ definition is work in progress for No 10	The phrase is commonly used by all parties but its meaning has come under scrutiny before next week’s budget It is a phrase that crops up 21 times in the Labour manifesto, 12 times in the Conservative manifesto, and has been used in the Commons more than 3,500 times in the last decade. So, surely everyone knows what -working people- are – don’t we? Perhaps not.

Stacey Williams says Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein ‘coordinated’ groping incident	Former model said of incident at Trump Tower in 1993: ‘I was rolled in there like a piece of meat in some kind of twisted game’ Former model Stacey Williams said she thought Donald Trump groped her to show off to her then boyfriend, the late financier and sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein, when the couple dropped by to visit him in Trump Tower in New York in 1993. In her first detailed, on-camera interview since discussing assault allegations with the Guardian, Williams late on Thursday told CNN that she recalled the former president and Epstein smiled at each other as the property mogul was feeling her up, which gave her the impression the entire incident was a -coordinated- game between the two men.

Harris holds rally with Obama while Trump calls US a ‘garbage can’ – US election live	Campaigning for presidential candidates continues with election less than two weeks away Good morning and welcome to the US election live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest from the campaign trail over the next couple of hours. We start with news that vice-president Kamala Harris appeared with Barack Obama for the first time, offering closing arguments targeting Black voters in Atlanta’s eastern suburbs, a vibrant, symbolic part of Georgia. The family of Amber Nicole Thurman, a Black 28-year-old mother who died just weeks after Georgia’s abortion ban went into effect, was in attendance at the Harris rally. Harris is expected to make another high profile appearance today, this time alongside Beyoncé in Houston, where the vice-president hopes to rally support for Senate candidate Colin Allred. Donald Trump rallied supporters in Tempe, Arizona, where he spoke alongside Senate candidate Kari Lake. Earlier in the day, Trump made news when he vowed that, if elected, he would immediately fire Jack Smith, the justice department special counsel who is prosecuting him for allegedly plotting to overturn the 2020 election and hide classified documents. Trump called the country a -garbage can- because of immigration policies under the Biden administration. -We’re like a garbage can, you know, it’s the first time I’ve ever said that,- Trump said in Tempe, the home of Arizona State University. -And every time I come up and talk about what they’ve done to our country, I get angry. First time I’ve ever said garbage can, but you know what, it’s a very accurate description.- Phoenix police arrested a man suspected of setting fire to a mailbox there, damaging mail-in ballots. The news comes just days after Tempe police arrested another man in connection with three shootings at Democratic party campaign offices in Tempe. An Arizona prosecutor said the second man had more than 120 guns and more than 250,000 rounds of ammunition in his home, leading law enforcement to believe he may have been planning a mass casualty event. Harris picked up the endorsement of two Republicans, one a former congressman from Michigan, the other a mayor in a pivotal county in Wisconsin. Joe Biden announced he will issue an apology for the US government’s role in forcing thousands of Indigenous American children to attend Indian boarding schools – a policy which has been widely recognized as an element of genocide. The news comes as Harris is trailing in the polls in Arizona, a state that Biden famously won in 2020, largely due to the support of Indigenous American voters. More than 29 million people have voted already in the 2024 election, at least partly driven by Republicans embracing early voting at Donald Trump’s direction. So far, Republicans have cast 32% of ballots, up from 27% at this point in 2020. Whereas Democrats have cast 42% of the votes, down from 47% at this point in the last presidential election.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/25/kamala-harris-donald-trump-us-election-politics-barack-obama	2024-10-25T02:38:05-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce815812c1d46e85c839f9dfb5ad05d437f0defa/0_232_6942_4164/master/6942.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3c03c48590bdb5c4a72e0279e59aef22

Bernardine Evaristo offers her Kent cottage to writers for free retreats	Low-income writers and those without space to work will be prioritised under the RSL’s new Scriptorium awards, with 10 people a year allowed to stay for up to a month On the wall of a Ramsgate house owned by Booker winner Bernardine Evaristo hangs a large-scale cover of Virginia Woolf’s A Room of One’s Own. It might just as well read -A Cottage of One’s Own-, as that is precisely what the Royal Society of Literature (RSL) president is offering: writers will be able to stay in the property for free. -I bought this cottage as my pension, and I decided that I could put it to use as a writer’s retreat,- Evaristo says. The choice was in part motivated by her own experience – -for many years I didn’t have my own home, I led a very peripatetic lifestyle, and I didn’t earn much money from my writing.-	https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/25/bernardine-evaristo-offers-her-kent-cottage-to-writers-for-free-retreats	2024-10-25T01:00:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb168e74b4e32d6d44143658b3565fdf4cfe8de2/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f6907056eae7670bde691e47c3547f36

Middle East crisis live: media workers reportedly killed in Israeli airstrike; Blinken to meet Lebanese PM	Three people who worked for pro-Iran Al Mayadeen and Hezbollah-owned Al Manar, were directly targeted, according to Lebanese media Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Israel’s wars on Gaza and Lebanon. An Israeli airstrike early on Friday morning killed at least three media staff staying at a guesthouse where several other reporters were staying, Lebanese media reported. At least 17 people, nearly all women and children, have been killed in Israeli bombing of a school turned shelter in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip, medics in the territory have said. Another 42 people were injured in the strike in the overcrowded camp, according to nearby al-Awda hospital. Among the dead were 13 children under the age of 18 and three women, it said. The strike marked the latest Israeli bombing of a school sheltering displaced people across Gaza. Israel’s military said the school was being used as a Hamas command and control centre. As it braces for an expected retaliatory strike from Israel, Iran has ordered the armed forces to be prepared for war but also to try to avoid it, having witnessed the decimation of its allies in Lebanon and Gaza, the New York Times is reporting. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has ordered the military to devise multiple military plans for responding to an Israeli attack, the report says, citing four unnamed Iranian officials. The scope of any Iranian retaliation, they said, will largely depend on the severity of Israel’s attacks. Several Israeli strikes hit Beirut’s southern suburbs on Thursday, about half an hour after Israel issued evacuation warnings for the Hezbollah bastion after intense strikes the night before. In Beirut’s southern Choueifat Al-Amrousieh area, Israeli warplanes -destroyed two buildings and ignited a large fire, and black smoke covered the area,- according to the official national news agency. -The raid that targeted the Saint Therese area also caused the collapse of two buildings near the constitutional council.- Israel had earlier issued evacuation warnings for the Hezbollah bastion following intense assaults the night before. Israel’s military said it had killed a Hamas commander who took part in the 7 October 2023 assault on southern Israel and worked for the UN aid agency in the Gaza Strip. Unrwa confirmed the man, Mohammad Abu Itiwi, was a staff member and was killed on Wednesday. Unrwa said Itiwi’s name was included in a letter received from Israel in July that included a list of 100 staff members who were also allegedly members of armed groups, including Hamas, but that Israeli authorities had not provided more information supporting those allegations. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, warned Benjamin Netanyahu that -civilisation is not best defended by sowing barbarism ourselves-. Macron also vowed to help train 6,000 extra Lebanese official forces, and called for a ceasefire and an end to Israeli attacks on UN peacekeepers, as a conference in Paris raised $200m (£154m) for Lebanon’s official military and $800m in humanitarian aid for the country. Gaza’s civil defence agency said on Thursday that more than 770 Palestinians have been killed in the north of the territory since Israel launched a new offensive in northern Gaza on 6 October. The agency also said it had been forced to suspend operations in northern Gaza after what it called threats from the Israeli military to -bomb and kill- rescue crews working in Jabalia camp. Gaza’s health ministry said on Thursday that 42,847 Palestinians have been killed and 100,544 injured since Israel launched its war last year. An Israeli airstrike struck the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza on Thursday night, with Gaza’s civil defence agency estimating that 150 people – including women and children – were killed or injured, the Palestinian news agency, Wafa reported.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/25/israel-lebanon-gaza-hamas-hezbollah-middle-east-latest	2024-10-24T23:37:17-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d42d31766648a60a6352a2bc7488055657353b6a/0_14_5085_3051/master/5085.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72747df98a7b6ea60cdec7d7c24d919c
Proposed powers to exempt NT projects from environmental assessments criticised as ‘terrifying’ and ‘authoritarian’	The Labor opposition, conservationists and Indigenous groups have expressed shock at the move The newly elected Northern Territory government wants to grant itself sweeping new powers to exempt major projects from environmental assessments in a move described by conservationists and Indigenous groups as authoritarian and anti-democratic.

‘Passing laws saves lives’: what’s at stake for US gun safety if Trump wins?	Biden oversaw the passage of the first major federal gun safety law in nearly 30 years. But advocates fear gun safety policy could be easily reversed: ‘We are at a pivotal moment’ Yoonie Yang was sitting in her Spanish two honors class in southern Florida when she first learned of a shooting at nearby Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school. She watched in horror as fellow students checked in on their friends to see if they were among the 17 victims. -I don’t think my peers know of an America or a world where there isn’t gun violence,- said Yang, now a senior at the University of Pennsylvania and a campus organizer for the gun safety group Students Demand Action. -This is an issue that we’re willing to take a stand on, and it’s an issue that has affected our lives and affected our childhoods into our adulthoods.-	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/oct/24/trump-gun-safety-stakes	2024-10-24T04:00:49-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b7842fc5f069d2d086cdd757f2c01828e8da7ba/0_0_5843_3506/master/5843.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=52c610109d09594d3fc73c8115902092
Project 2025 will ‘upend’ the lives of Black Americans, new report shows	Legal analysis released by Legal Defense Fund highlights specific harms rightwing plan poses to Black communities Project 2025, the 900-page ultra-conservative roadmap that details how the former president Donald Trump and his allies would restructure the US government if he is elected, has specific implications for Black Americans, according to a new report. The Legal Defense Fund (LDF), an organization that fights for racial justice, recently released the most in-depth legal analysis of Project 2025’s impact on Black communities. It highlights how Black Americans would be harmed due to policies that would weaken anti-discrimination laws; dismantle the Department of Education; threaten Black political power; increase the use of the death penalty (which disproportionately affects Black people); and exacerbate health disparities caused by environmental racism.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/24/project-2025-black-americans	2024-10-24T04:00:49-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e17d6541aa537bd2b1e8156686b433bdf2c896b/0_274_8192_4916/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f89a1883a70be0c6123ae602bd1fc490

Macron opens conference aimed at finding to path to ceasefire in Lebanon	French president is hoping to rise about £300m in funds to address humanitarian crisis caused by Israeli bombing Emmanuel Macron has opened a conference in Paris in support of Lebanon, with the twin aims of raising about £300m in funds to address the mounting humanitarian crisis caused by Israeli bombing and finding a way to fill the security vacuum created by the chronic weakness of the Lebanese state. Most observers say Macron, the president of France, which has historical ties to Lebanon, is likely to have success with his first task, partly owing to donations expected to come from Sunni-majority Gulf states. France hopes this will reflect a revived interest in Lebanon that these states had largely neglected, leaving space open for the expansion of the Shia group Hezbollah in recent years.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/24/macron-opens-conference-ceasefire-lebanon-israel	2024-10-24T02:02:35-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e49f5b8574c8e6f18dcbe92b64ad2212979d647/0_193_4791_2875/master/4791.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fa91738560ef074c2cc7d99958612ce0

Starmer calms business fears over budget as Reeves prepares to announce debt rule change - UK politics live	PM tries to reassure businesses and investors in UK, while chancellor is in New York for IMF meeting Good morning. Officially Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, will unveil Labour’s first budget (and probably most important for the whole parliament) on Wednesday next week. But in practice budget announcements are now two-week news events, because the Treasury knows that it is bad idea to spook the markets with lots of surprises on the day and so this government, like past governments, has been engaged in elaborate pitch-rolling, ensuring that there are plenty of reports in advance giving a broad idea of what is coming. Not all the stories you might read this week about what will be in the budget will be accurate, or Treasury-sanctioned, but quite a lot of them are. One of the measures subject to a lot of pitch-rolling is the proposal to change the official definition of debt used in the government’s fiscal rules. Reeves has been hinting for a while that she will change this and today, at a meeting of the IMF in Washington, she will confirm this. This yardstick – which will replace public sector net debt – will take into account all the government’s financial assets and liabilities, including student loans and equity stakes in private companies, as well as funded pension schemes. This would give the chancellor room to increase borrowing for investment in long-term infrastructure … The chancellor has made clear, both in her conference speech and consequently about her desire to see more investment in the economy. It’s a matter of record that investors in the UK have previously said that UK investment levels are too low both in terms of public infrastructure and in terms of business investment more generally. Investors shouldn’t be worried about this budget. This government is prioritising growth. It’s unashamedly pro-business. You’ll have seen from the significant vote of confidence in the UK economy at the international investment summit that it is already the case that investors are responding positively to the government’s plans.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/24/labour-budget-keir-starmer-rachel-reeves-imf-uk-politics	2024-10-24T01:01:36-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acbf3cf5124d6ee5426f218535b250356225c7b2/1023_976_2520_1512/master/2520.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a299c3840fba512c1320c095db917cf9

Thursday briefing: How the state is failing children with special needs – and what it costs	In today’s newsletter: Despite a 58% increase in funding over a decade, there has been no improvement in outcomes, a new report reveals • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. The annual budget for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) in England now stands at £10.7bn, an increase of 58% in a decade. Despite that, there has been no improvement in outcomes, and many parents say that their children are being sold short. The need for services is so great against the backdrop of years of council cuts that two in five local authorities are at risk of effectively declaring bankruptcy by 2026. In other words: the system is somehow underfunded and financially ruinous at the same time, and failing the children it is supposed to support. That is the grim diagnosis contained in a report by the National Audit Office (NAO) published this morning, which warns that system-wide reforms are needed to keep councils afloat. And there is no doubt that the figures it contains are eye-watering. Budget | Rachel Reeves will announce at the International Monetary Fund a plan to change Britain’s debt rules that will open the door to more borrowing for long-term capital investment. After weeks of speculation, the change could release up to £50bn extra for infrastructure projects. France | Gisèle Pelicot, the French woman who has become a feminist hero for insisting that the rape trial of her ex-husband and 50 other men should be held in public, has told a court in southern France she was driven by her desire to change society and expose rape culture. She said: -I wanted all woman victims of rape … to say: Mrs Pelicot did it, we can do it too.- Police | The identities of armed police officers charged after opening fire at suspects are likely to stay secret in future unless they are convicted, the home secretary has announced. Yvette Cooper’s statement came after the acquittal of the Metropolitan police sergeant Martyn Blake for shooting dead Chris Kaba. US | A former model who says she met Donald Trump through the late sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein has accused the former president of groping and sexually touching her in an incident in Trump Tower in 1993. Trump’s presidential campaign called the allegation -unequivocally false-, calling it a fake story -contrived by the Harris campaign-. Dementia | Tens of thousands of dementia patients are to be enrolled in clinical trials designed to dramatically speed up the hunt for a cure, leading scientists have announced. The initiative is intended to challenge -historically low- numbers enrolled into trials in the UK.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/24/thursday-briefing-first-edition-send-special-education-needs-disability-england	2024-10-23T23:09:00-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8a0e028ba660d9305892b968ed9aa6c1f1a14a0/0_310_4776_2866/master/4776.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bb09180dfd6503d27d1fa18d57704bd1
