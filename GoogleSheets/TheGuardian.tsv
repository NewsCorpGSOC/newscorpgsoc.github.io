US student worker unions face threats under second Trump administration	Organizers try to pre-empt action by incoming president to ‘constrict or eliminate’ labor rights Student workers are bracing for the incoming Trump administration to -constrict or eliminate- their labor rights, after a surge in union organizing on college campuses.

‘Dubious’ use of the Freedom of Information act stopping access to files on Prince Andrew, researchers say	Biographer says government departments give contradictory refusals to requests and accuses them of ‘cover up’ Researchers have called for greater transparency from the Foreign Office over the files it holds on the Duke of York. Officials responding to freedom of information requests have given a variety of reasons why the files cannot be released. Andrew Lownie, an author who is researching a biography of Prince Andrew, was told that the files could not be made public until 2065, and implied there was a general rule that papers relating to members of the royal family must remain closed until 105 years after their birth.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/28/dubious-use-of-the-freedom-of-information-act-stopping-access-to-files-on-prince-andrew-researchers-say	2024-12-28T05:24:58-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10bdee50ba46272a089073bf55f830910b079f1e/956_156_3282_1969/master/3282.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3e81b7989d211c00be5bf90d256c7f96

Trump’s threat to defund all US public media has NPR and PBS on the back foot	President-elect’s agenda and Project 2025 playbook align in stripping Corporation for Public Broadcasting’s license On the campaign trail this year, Donald Trump routinely criticized US media. The president-elect called for CBS to be stripped of its broadcast license after it aired an interview with Kamala Harris, refused to participate in an interview with 60 Minutes and routinely called journalists the -enemy of the people-. But perhaps no American media has attracted as much ire from the president-elect as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting – a non-profit corporation created by federal law in 1967 to distribute funding to public media organizations like PBS and NPR.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/28/trump-npr-pbs-funding-cut	2024-12-28T05:00:38-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8e97160cc56c0d831edb45491d0f4141a7c7f26/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=15002bcc713d8d96f55ec5743b1a3e66

‘Anti-woke’ dog food and pro-America lipstick: US sees rise in rightwing stores	A number of marketplaces have sprung up seeking to make use of anti-establishment fervor – are they here to stay? Among the many odd things to come out of Donald Trump’s political movement – see ear bandages, doomed boat rallies and rubbish dancing – one that could be here to stay is more prosaic: the creation of a series of rightwing marketplaces and products seeking to capitalize on anti-establishment fervor. In recent years a number of platforms have sprung up to sell conservative-made items, from -anti-woke- dog food to pro-America lipstick, in a pushback against what they claim is -cancel culture- in the US – and what others might see as a fairly cynical attempt to cash in on rightwing Americans’ political beliefs.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/28/anti-woke-shopping-public-square	2024-12-28T04:00:38-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/813227a42e73850ffaae14cc699c1bdfa38a24cd/0_12_3257_1955/master/3257.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8420f666a1ee8ae97897183465488cc6

Russia-Ukraine war live: Moscow says Kyiv plot to kill high-ranking officer with music speaker bomb foiled	Claim from FSB comes two weeks after Ukrainian assassination of senior Russian general Igor Kirillov On 8 March 2023, International Women’s Day, Russian soldiers were handing out tulips and boughs of mimosa to women and girls in the city of Melitopol, southern Ukraine – a move designed to promote friendly relations between the occupiers and the inhabitants. But the night before, someone had been discreetly sticking posters to walls and lamp-posts. They bore the image of a young Ukrainian woman, dressed in a traditional embroidered shirt, smashing a bouquet over a Russian soldier’s head. -I don’t want flowers,- read the slogan. -I want my Ukraine.- Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service accused American and British spies of trying to provoke attacks against Russian military bases in Syria in a bid to force the evacuation of the bases, the state-run RIA news agency said on Saturday. The SVR gave no evidence for its allegation. North Korean troops deployed in Russia’s Kursk region are suffering heavy losses and being left unprotected by the Russian forces they are fighting alongside, according to Ukraine, while the US says Russian and North Korean generals see the soldiers as -expendable-. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Friday that said Russian troops were sending the North Koreans into battle with minimal protection and that the North Koreans were taking extreme measures to avoid being taken prisoner. -Their losses are significant, very significant,- the Ukrainian president said in his nightly video address. The Biden administration pledged to approve fresh military aid to Ukraine, including crucial air defence systems. John Kirby, the US national security communications adviser, said the promised US security assistance package was expected to be announced -in the next couple of days-, though it was unclear how much it will include. Slovakia has confirmed its readiness to host any peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, despite Kyiv’s accusation that it is playing into the hands of Vladimir Putin. The Russian president on Thursday called it -acceptable- for the country to become a -platform- for dialogue over the conflict. The Slovak prime minister, Robert Fico, said on Facebook late on Friday: -If someone wants to organise peace talks in Slovakia, we will be ready and hospitable.- Ukraine has received its first batch of liquefied natural gas from the US, a deal that Kyiv says will boost Ukrainian and European energy security as a major gas transit deal with Russia ends. -Dtek, Ukraine’s largest private energy company, has today taken delivery of its first cargo of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States,- the company said on Friday. The consignment was of about 100m cubic metres of gas, it told Agence France-Presse. A Russian court has sentenced a singer who burned his passport in protest against Moscow’s Ukraine war to five-and-a-half years in prison. Eduard Sharlot, 26, was found guilty of -publicly insulting- the religious feelings of believers and -rehabilitating nazism- by a court in the Volga city of Samara in a case over videos he published online, the state news agency RIA Novosti reported.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/28/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-latest-putin-zelenskyy	2024-12-28T00:32:17-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/691030ef95674d2103981f4115c141ae296afd2f/0_92_5355_3213/master/5355.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=45c2908b78f26bd708084691ecff6f27

Why speech could be a target for the anti-abortion movement in 2025	The anti-abortion movement is looking at ways to control information about how and where to obtain abortions The next front in the US abortion wars may be what people are allowed to say about it. More than two years after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in the case Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, US abortions are on the rise, thanks in large part to the spread of abortion pills and travel across state lines. This has infuriated anti-abortion advocates, who have proposed policies to help the incoming Trump administration curtail the mailing of abortion pills and targeted individuals and groups that help women get out-of-state abortions. In a sign of how the issue is pitting states against one another, Texas earlier this monthsued a New York-based doctor who allegedly provided a telehealth abortion to a Texan woman.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/27/speech-anti-abortion-movement	2024-12-27T05:00:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3faa1b222876c0d70ea72aacd0080fcdda7a70da/0_230_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=102a7eeda3b3c7791c3d521762a1450d

Rushdie’s Satanic Verses returns to Indian bookshops after 36 years	Book banned since 1988 ‘selling out’ after import bar was overturned due to missing paperwork Salman Rushdie’s 1988 novel The Satanic Verses – which led to a fatwa threatening his life, forcing him into hiding for a decade – has finally returned to bookshops in India, the land of his birth. The novel, inspired by the life of the prophet Muhammad, became the focus of a fierce global debate about freedom of speech when Iran’s then-supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, placed a bounty on Rushdie’s head due to its supposed blasphemy. The book was banned in India by Rajiv Gandhi’s government in 1988 after riots erupted over its contents.	https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/dec/26/salman-rushdie-satanic-verses-india-bookshops	2024-12-26T05:59:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac131c7016dd580cc47a78440fab4e93351d8a06/0_463_2047_1227/master/2047.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ff9214ef9f2abbdac22b2cd809044c6e

Middle East crisis live: 14 security personnel killed in Syria after clash over former prison officer	Security personnel and three armed men killed in Tartous province after forces sought to arrest officer linked to Sednaya prison, says Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza and developments in the Middle East more widely. Fourteen security personnel from Syria’s new authorities and three armed men were killed in clashes in Tartous province when forces attempted to arrest an officer linked to the notorious Sednaya prison, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Five journalists were killed when their vehicle was struck in the vicinity of Al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat in central Gaza, health authorities said. Palestinian media and local reporters said the vehicle was marked as a media van and was used by journalists to report from inside the hospital and Nuseirat camp. The journalists worked for the Al-Quds Al-Youm television channel. The Israeli army said its air force attacked the vehicle in a -targeted manner- and that members of the Islamic Jihad militant group were inside. In a separate incident, five people were killed and 20 wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a house in Gaza City’s Zeitoun neighbourhood early on Thursday, medics with the Gaza health authorities reported. They warned the death toll could rise as many people remained trapped under the rubble. A baby girl has frozen to death in Gaza, the third to die from the cold, in Gaza’s tent camps in recent days, doctors said. The father of three-week-old Sila, Mahmoud al-Faseeh, wrapped her in a blanket to try to keep her warm in their tent in the Muwasi area outside the town of Khan Younis, but it was not enough, he told the Associated Press. On Wednesday, Hamas and Israel traded blame over their failure to conclude a ceasefire agreement despite progress reported by both sides in past days. Israel’s air and ground offensive has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry. It says more than half the fatalities have been women and children, but does not say how many of the dead were fighters.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/26/middle-east-crisis-live-security-personnel-killed-syria-sednaya-prison-gaza-israel-latest-updates	2024-12-26T01:01:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72f05a5ccbd2dadff383da682b82c435e555053e/0_189_4300_2580/master/4300.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=69afe26c36e9247d0b915814451b6dd5
Russia-Ukraine war live: Ukrainian military says it shot down 20 of 31 drones launched by Russia overnight	11 ‘imitator drones’ did not reach their targets after active engagement from the Ukrainian military, it said Hello – Welcome to the Guardian’s blog covering the Russia-Ukraine war. Joe Biden has asked the US defence department to continue its surge of weapons deliveries to Ukraine, describing Russia’s Christmas Day attack against some of Ukraine’s cities and its energy infrastructure as -outrageous-. Christmas morning in Ukraine was overshadowed by a massive Russian aerial attack using cruise missiles to target energy infrastructure across the country, which Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned as -inhuman-. The attack left half a million people in Kharkiv region without heating, in temperatures just a few degrees Celsius above zero, while there were blackouts in the capital, Kyiv, and elsewhere. Ukraine’s air defences downed 59 of 78 Russian missiles and 54 of 102 drones launched overnight and on Wednesday morning, the Ukrainian military said. British prime minister Keir Starmer has also condemned the Russian attack launched on Ukraine’s energy grid, which killed one person. Nato member Romania said it had not detected any Russian missile passing through its airspace to target Ukraine, as claimed by Kyiv. Russia’s Federal Security Service claimed on Thursday that it had foiled several plots by Ukrainian intelligence services to kill high-ranking Russian military officers and their families in Moscow. It claimed four Russian citizens allegedly involved in the plots had been detained. Ukraine’s SBU intelligence service has claimed responsibility for the killing of Igor Kirillov, chief of Russia’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection troops, who died after a bomb attached to an electric scooter exploded outsided his apartment building on 17 December. A Russian cargo ship that sank on Tuesday in the Mediterranean Sea was the target of an -act of terrorism-, according to the vessel’s owner. The Ursa Major sank while it was sailing through international waters between Spain and Algeria, leaving two crew members missing. The Ukrainian navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk said Russia faced -systemic problems- in maintaining its fleet but gave no indication that Kyiv was involved in the incident. Falling debris from a Ukrainian drone that was shot down caused an explosion and a fatal fire in a shopping centre in the city of Vladikavkaz in Russia’s North Ossetia region, the local governor said on Wednesday. One woman was reported to have been killed inside the shopping centre. Russia’s foreign ministry said Australia had been in contact about the possible capture by the Russian army of an Australian citizen fighting with Ukrainian forces. Oscar Jenkins was reportedly captured by Russian soldiers while fighting alongside Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region. Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a call with the Japanese prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, where he thanked Japan’s government for a decision to transfer an additional $3bn secured from frozen Russian assets. The Ukrainian leader also thanked Japan for the total $12bn in humanitarian and financial aid provided to Ukraine, according to a readout of the Wednesday call.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-ukrainian-military-russian-drones-latest-updates	2024-12-26T00:24:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7490487111a41480d6398b47626dbc5b4dc34b1/0_260_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=13edd08dff8fb15194da323a8fd58461

Calls for Labour to honour pledge to toughen anti-hunt laws	Government urged to ban trail hunting as data suggests illegal foxhunting is still widespread in England and Wales Animal welfare campaigners are calling on ministers to keep to a pledge to toughen anti-hunt laws, as figures suggest illegal foxhunting remains widespread in England and Wales. Almost 20 years since the Hunting Act 2004 was brought in by Tony Blair’s government, the League Against Cruel Sports (Lacs) – the animal welfare charity that was the driving force behind the original ban – says its data evidences how stronger legislation is required to close loopholes and prohibit trail hunting, which campaigners say has been used as a smokescreen for illegal foxhunting. Trail hunting is where dogs follow an animal-based scent.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/26/calls-for-labour-to-honour-pledge-to-toughen-anti-hunt-laws-england-wales-foxhunting	2024-12-25T21:00:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d79ad735bc7ffcfc2d5c744ea633045490ddf1b/0_183_3795_2277/master/3795.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2ccbcf3f7724c19b6a6f2d9cc5ea28b2

Paule Vézelay, born in Bristol in 1892, moved to Paris where she moved in the same circles as Georges Braque, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and Sophie Taeuber-Arp, and created one of the first British abstract works in 1928, a few years before Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore began their experimentations.	https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/dec/24/paule-vezelay-first-abstract-artist-bristol-exhibition	2024-12-23T23:00:40-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04978b1c1ca8528d9b7bd2200da867d77533585f/0_227_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7bea2718ce3270575078dedc9fc1219e
Tuesday briefing: What Reform UK might get from Elon Musk’s $100m – and what he might want in return	In today’s newsletter: With rumours of the political party courting a game-changing investment, people are asking not only what they might do with the money, but what the tech titan might get in return Good morning. I don’t know how long Elon Musk spent mulling over his rumoured suggestion that he might give $100m to Reform, but since it amounts to about 0.02% of his total wealth, I imagine it will have taken about as much time as most people spend mulling over a Christmas book token for their favourite nephew. But if $100m is chicken feed for the world’s richest man, it is enough money to be transformative for Nigel Farage and his cohorts – and for UK politics more generally. In the weeks since the story first broke, a growing chorus has urged Labour to update the rules on political donations to limit the influence of international money on British political parties. Meanwhile, Reform have unsurprisingly forgotten about their general view of foreigners who don’t understand British culture, and suggested that this might just be the start.

Mixed ruling leaves Missouri abortion rights in limbo despite ballot measure	Judge said state’s ban ‘clearly contrary’ to recently passed constitutional amendment but left other laws in place More than two months after Missouri residents voted to add abortion rights into their state constitution and overturn the state’s ban on the procedure, abortions have not yet resumed in Missouri – and it’s not clear when they will, according to a key Planned Parenthood official in the region.

Pedro Sánchez has remained a rare bulwark of social democracy in an increasingly right-leaning continent As Labour’s electoral honeymoon slips into distant-memory territory and Keir Starmer attempts to reboot his premiership, the party and its leader might find a southward glance instructive. For the past six years, the Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE), led by Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, has defied expectations by remaining in power during some of the most turbulent times in recent Spanish and European history, making it a rare bulwark of social democracy in an increasingly right-leaning continent.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/23/keir-starmer-pedro-sanchez-spain-socialist-leader	2024-12-23T01:01:55-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e895fedda8f75873876a9647612fdf604325dac3/1224_535_4248_2550/master/4248.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d62db4cdd315480b5fbce0c040a29786

Russia-Ukraine war live: North Korea preparing to send more troops to Russia, says South Korea	Troops and weapons, including suicide drones, to be shipped to Russia to support war against Ukraine, say Seoul’s joint chiefs of staff Hello and welcome to the Ukraine live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest from the conflict. We start with news that South Korea’s military said on Monday that it has detected signs of North Korea preparing to send more troops and weapons, including suicide drones, to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. Russian president, Vladimir Putin met the Slovakian prime minister, Robert Fico, in the Kremlin on Sunday, a rare visit by a European Union leader to Moscow, as a contract allowing for Russian gas to transit through Ukraine nears expiry. Russia has captured two more villages in east Ukraine, the latest territorial gains for Moscow’s advancing army. The defence ministry said on Telegram on Sunday that its troops had -liberated- the villages of Lozova in the north-eastern Kharkiv region and Krasnoye – called Sontsivka in Ukraine. Zelenskyy told Ukraine’s diplomats on Sunday that the country will have to fight to persuade allies to allow it to take up Nato membership, but has described the goal as -achievable- as it searches for security guarantees to protect it from Russia. Nato secretary general Mark Rutte said he considered the sometimes harsh criticism of German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to be unjustified, news wire DPA reported. Although Germany has been a vital ally of Ukraine, its hesitation in providing long-range Taurus cruise missiles has been a source of frustration in Kyiv, which is battling a foe armed with a powerful array of long-range weaponry. Russian forces executed five Ukrainian prisoners of war, Ukraine’s parliamentary commissioner for human rights, Dmytro Lubinets, claimed on Sunday. Russian troops shot the five unarmed soldiers after capturing them, Lubinets alleged on Telegram, without providing more details. A video purporting to show the Russian capture of an Australian man fighting for Ukraine on the war’s eastern front has prompted urgent inquiries by Australia’s government. The man, who identified himself as Oscar Jenkins, is struck several times and questioned roughly in Russian in the video, which is circulating on Telegram. Ukrainian drones struck a major Russian fuel depot for the second time in just over a week on Sunday, according to a senior Russian regional official, as part of a -massive- cross-border attack on fuel and energy facilities that Kyiv says supply Moscow’s military.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-north-korea-troops-russia-south-korea-latest-updates	2024-12-23T00:33:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fca852107a99babc97a03e639d350b9421e835a2/119_68_1087_652/master/1087.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=66adf3dc5a94e9b18f40f11bac3195d0
Locals win fight to save mysterious, medieval Spanish chapel from oblivion	Home to vivid 16th-century frescoes, the Ermita de San Jorge is on the brink of being saved from centuries of decay A mysterious, dilapidated and exquisitely painted Spanish chapel into which knights on horseback may have ridden centuries ago to receive a wet and most unusual blessing could be on the verge of salvation after a decades-long campaign by local heritage groups. No one knows much about the crumbling and semi-subterranean Ermita de San Jorge, which sits in a hollow 7 miles (12km) from the city of Cáceres in Extremadura, south-west Spain. Local experts believe it may have been built in the 14th century close to the defensive line erected to guard against possible Muslim incursions after the Christian reconquest, while the only definitively recorded date in its first centuries comes courtesy of Juan de Ribera who decorated the inside of the chapel with vivid biblical frescoes in 1565.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/23/locals-win-fight-to-save-spanish-chapel-from-oblivion-ermita-de-san-jorge	2024-12-23T00:32:16-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9058071ff317451ca6f4b78253a2c281f1c62651/0_16_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ce95de342f13dc1e765ddd478ec2eb0f

Middle East crisis live: Israel orders closure of one of last functioning hospitals in northern Gaza	Head of Kamal Adwan hospital says it is ‘next to impossible’ to obey shut down order due to lack of ambulances to evacuate patients Hello, and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza and developments in the Middle East more widely. Israel late last night ordered the closure and evacuation of one of the last hospitals still partly functioning in northern Gaza. We currently have nearly 400 civilians inside the hospital, including babies in the neonatal unit, whose lives depend on oxygen and incubators. We cannot evacuate these patients safely without assistance, equipment, and time. We are sending this message under heavy bombardment and direct targeting of the fuel tanks, which if hit will cause a large explosion and mass casualties of the civilians inside. Israeli forces have carried out three consecutive attacks overnight on the Gaza Strip, killing at least 11 Palestinians, according to Al Jazeera, which said the military killed four people in two separate air raids in the so-called designated -safe zone- of al-Mawasi. Palestinian news agency Wafa is reporting that four Palestinian people were killed and three others injured after Israel bombed the new camp area northwest of the al-Nuseirat refugee camp. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Phillipe Lazzarani, said there has been in -escalation- in attacks over the past day, with more civlians reported killed and injured. In a post on X, he wrote: -Attacks on schools and hospitals have been commonplace. The world must not become numb.- Jordan’s foreign minister Ayman Safadi is due to meet with Syria’s new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, and -several Syrian officials-, later today in Damascus, Jordan’s foreign ministry said. Al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, led the Sunni Islamist rebels who swept into the Syrian capital earlier this month and forced Bashar-al Assad from power.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/23/middle-east-crisis-israel-orders-kamal-adwan-hospital-close-gaza-syria-latest-updates	2024-12-22T23:47:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5958cbf0f5a47a74cbe5d4ca4c42651d4e760c5b/135_0_2803_1682/master/2803.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9829c6dd24da5b9e9da8024af63dec91

The next day he was re-arrested and he was not seen again. -They told us he would come back to us the next day but he didn’t. They said he was talking to terrorists, but he wasn’t talking to anyone. He would just go to work and then come home,- said Qasar, 29, a secretary in Damascus and the eldest of her siblings.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/23/syrian-woman-search-for-missing-father-assad-military-prisons	2024-12-22T21:00:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5e68d4cd4bfa00ff867809bfa4fe867d81a0834/0_248_5621_3373/master/5621.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4e513f200ef0e575182a744cb1933ac8

Louisiana holds people in prisons past their release date, DoJ lawsuit alleges	State accused of ‘systemic overdetention’ that violates inmates’ rights and costs taxpayers millions of dollars a year Louisiana’s prison system routinely holds people weeks and months after they have completed their sentences, the US justice department alleged in a lawsuit filed on Friday. The suit against the state of Louisiana follows a multi-year investigation into what federal officials say is a pattern of -systemic overdetention- that violates inmates’ rights and costs taxpayers millions of dollars a year. The justice department alleges that since at least 2012, more than a quarter of the people due to be released from Louisiana prisons have instead been held past their release dates. The DoJ warned Louisiana officials last year that the state could face a lawsuit if it didn’t fix the problems – but lawyers for the department say the state’s -marginal efforts- to address the issues were -inadequate- and showed a -deliberate indifference- to the constitutional rights of incarcerated individuals.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/22/louisiana-prisons-doj-lawsuit	2024-12-22T12:47:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09ef0fa8e0333df8951e950a45c64338f9760fe0/0_16_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=28ba36480a39c5131a73be717f925fab

Middle East crisis: Israeli strikes kill 17 Palestinians in Gaza – live updates	The strikes came a day after Pope Francis condemned the bombing of children in Gaza as ‘cruelty’ Hello, and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza and developments in the Middle East more widely. Israeli military airstrikes across the Gaza Strip have killed at least 17 Palestinian people, 8 of them at a school sheltering displaced families in Gaza City, medics said. Several people have been injured by Israeli attacks on northern Gaza’s Kamal Adwan hospital, according to Al Jazeera, with Israeli forces reportedly firing directly on the facility’s ICU and maternity ward, as well as at the nearby al-Awda hospital. Hussam Abu Safiya, the director of Kamal Adwan hospital, said the army ordered staff to evacuate the hospital and move patients and injured people toward another hospital in the area. Abu Safiya said the mission was -next to impossible- because staff did not have ambulances to move the patients. -Tonight’s reports of bombardment near Kamal Adwan hospital and order to evacuate the hospital are deeply worrisome. The hospital has been in the midst of fighting for too long and the lives of patients are at risk,- WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote in a post on X late last night. The US military said it mistakenly shot down one of its own fighter aircraft over the Red Sea on Sunday morning, forcing both pilots to eject. Both were rescued, one with minor injuries, after the -apparent case of friendly fire,- which is being investigated, US Central Command said in a statement. The fighter was an F/A-18 Hornet flying off the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman. One of the carrier’s escort ships, the missile cruiser Gettysburg, -mistakenly fired on and hit- the plane, the statement said. The US military carried out airstrikes against a missile storage facility and a command-and-control facility operated by Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen’s capital, Sana’a, on Saturday. The US military’s Central Command said the strikes aimed to -disrupt and degrade- Houthi operations, including attacks against US navy warships and merchant vessels in the southern Red Sea, Bab al-Mandeb and Gulf of Aden. The strike followed a similar attack last week by US aircraft against a command and control facility operated by the Houthis, who control much of Yemen. The US attack on Sana’a came the same day that a Houthi missile struck Israel’s commercial hub Tel Aviv, injuring 16 people in the second such airstrike in days. Turkey has vowed to -do whatever it takes- to ensure its security if the new Syrian administration cannot address Ankara’s concerns about US-allied Kurdish groups it views as terrorist groups, the country’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, said on Saturday. Turkey regards the YPG, the militant group spearheading the US-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants who have fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for 40 years and are deemed terrorists by Ankara, Washington, and the EU. The UN has warned that people living in makeshift shelters might not survive the winter. Nearly 2 million Palestinians have been displaced by Israel’s war on the territory and are struggling to protect themselves from the wind, cold and rain.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/22/middle-east-crisis-israel-airstrikes-gaza-yemen-houthis-latest-updates	2024-12-22T00:38:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/401da4b5622ed52d1a6a4da89df86462c16c3d95/0_0_6195_3719/master/6195.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4c336cad3cfc8424d626bfb1d1d75062

Any movement on the issue appears unlikely as Republicans prepare to take control of the Senate in January, underscoring the hurdles in imposing restrictions on a separate branch of government even as public confidence in the court has fallen to record lows.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/21/ethics-inquiry-supreme-court	2024-12-21T06:18:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/431c345e6ccdcd8c8fbd482d6b5c78d0d3749a6f/295_0_1763_1058/master/1763.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c52b1c167d5d521381cb9ff6122170ee

Middle East crisis live: 14 injured after Israel fails to intercept missile from Yemen	Missile fell in the Tel Aviv-Jaffa area leaving 14 people with minor injuries; attack comes days after Israel launched deadly strikes on Yemen Israeli airstrikes killed at least 25 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on Friday, Reuters reports, citing medics. The toll included at least eight in an apartment in the Nuseirat refugee camp and at least 10, including seven children, in the town of Jabalia. Hello, and welcome to our live coverage of developments in the Middle East. The Israeli military said its forces had shot a protester during a demonstration against the army’s activities in a village in southern Syria on Friday, injuring him in the leg. Since Islamist-led rebels toppled Syrian president Bashar al-Assad on 8 December Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes on Syrian military facilities in what it says is a bid to prevent them from falling into hostile hands. In a move widely condemned internationally, Israel also sent troops into a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone in the Golan Heights and beyond, calling it a defensive and temporary measure. Gaza’s civil defence rescue agency reported that an Israeli air strike killed 10 members of a family on Friday in the northern part of the territory, including seven children. Violence in the Gaza Strip continues to rock the coastal territory more than 14 months into the Israel-Hamas war, even as international mediators work to negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas Palestinian militants. The Israeli military told the AFP news agency it had struck -several terrorists who were operating in a military structure belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation and posed a threat to IDF troops operating in the area-. Syria wants to contribute to -regional peace-, the country’s new authorities said late on Friday, after a meeting between leader Ahmed al-Sharaa and a US diplomatic delegation. -The Syrian side indicated that the Syrian people stand at an equal distance from all countries and parties in the region and that Syria rejects any polarisation,- the statement said. It said the new authorities wanted to -affirm Syria’s role in promoting regional peace and building privileged strategic partnerships with countries in the region-. The meeting between al-Sharaa - known previously by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani - and the US delegation led by Barbara Leaf, head of the Middle East at the State Department, was -positive-, a Syrian official previously told AFP. Al-Sharaa, the leader of the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group that seized power in Damascus, was previously the target of US sanctions. But after their first formal contact in Damascus on Friday, Washington announced it had dropped a bounty for his arrest. The Iranian government is attempting to salvage some influence with Syria’s new leaders, as Tehran reels from its sudden loss of authority in Damascus after the collapse of the regime of Bashar al-Assad. The Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, is already facing multiple domestic and international crises, including power cuts due to a lack of oil supplies, continued tensions over its nuclear programme and a row about a new law that will toughen punishments for women who do not wear the hijab. But it is the sudden loss of influence in Syria after the fall of Assad to rebel groups that is exercising Iranian officials most.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/21/israel-gaza-war-yemen-syria-lebanon-hamas-hezbollah-middle-east-latest	2024-12-21T00:31:19-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3bdcfce63f5118095370e4d6ee7f6e9a3d04b17/0_367_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=27a25f396cba69ef406e0c8e7ef9fd48

This week Disney announced it would release the first full-length feature film based on the show, which features the eponymous anthropomorphic puppy and her family of Australian heelers, sparking widespread jubilation.

Oil and gas firms operating in Colorado falsified environmental impact reports	State’s energy and carbon management commission said fraudulent pollution data was reported for at least 344 wells Oil and gas companies operating in Colorado have submitted hundreds of environmental impact reports with -falsified- laboratory data since 2021, according to state regulators. Colorado’s energy and carbon management commission (ECMC) said on 13 December that contractors for Chevron and Oxy had submitted reports with fraudulent data for at least 344 oil and gas wells across the state, painting a misleading picture of their pollution levels.

Xi was in Macau to mark the 25th anniversary of its return from Portuguese to Chinese rule on 20 December 1999. In the quarter-century since then, Macau has been run as a special administrative region of China, a semi-autonomous territory with a similar legal status to Hong Kong, but it has traditionally been much more pliant to Beijing’s rule than the former British territory. More than half of its 700,000 population immigrated from China in recent decades.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/20/xi-jinping-urges-macau-to-diversify-economy-away-from-casinos	2024-12-20T06:02:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e6d9d5d3241c2883a30ee0d3e8a71aaf17a4b29/0_438_5344_3209/master/5344.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=20d5b09386476fe9877b4704736cd18b

Exclusive: Major Trump donors who complained of immigrant ‘invasion’ used Mexican workers illegally, sources allege	Experts believe the alleged ‘shuttle support’ program used by Uline – a company owned by billionaires Liz and Dick Uihlein – is likely illegal and exploitative of workers A company owned by two of Donald Trump’s top mega-donors has routinely brought dozens of its workers from Mexico to staff its warehouses in Wisconsin and other locations even though they do not appear to have permission to work in the US, according to a Guardian investigation. Uline – a giant Wisconsin-based office and shipping supply company controlled by billionaires Liz and Dick Uihlein – shuttles in its own workers from Mexico, who are using tourist visas and visas meant for employees who are entering the US temporarily to receive professional training, known as B1 visas. But instead of being part of a dedicated training program, the Mexican employees stay for one to six months and – sources with direct knowledge of the matter allege – perform normal work in Uline’s US warehouses.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/20/uline-mexican-workers-trump	2024-12-20T06:00:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dafa69a273e5a33ac004ec41791cd7c04157a85e/0_282_5255_3154/master/5255.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e7f1ff41bca89eef28c311842a0b7abc

More links surface between bankruptcy case under FBI investigation and church reorganization	Some in church case worry whether connections mean they are getting a ‘fair shake’ Links have continued surfacing between a bankruptcy case in Houston that forced a judge there to resign – while thrusting him under FBI investigation – and a contentious, costly financial reorganization being pursued by the clergy abuse-plagued Roman Catholic archdiocese of New Orleans. Perhaps the most notable so far: a portion of a transcript from a March 2023 hearing that until now had largely gone unnoticed shows how – before corruption allegations prompted his resignation – David Jones exalted the wisdom of one of the most tendentious rulings made by fellow bankruptcy judge Meredith Grabill with respect to the New Orleans archdiocese’s chapter 11 reorganization.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/20/houston-church-bankruptcy-new-orleans-archdiocese	2024-12-20T05:00:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28dfcf5fdbdf6034836e8db21666ee4294471918/0_134_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4f632ee18066bbe98f2e987ac916f454

First Thing: US Amazon workers go on their ‘largest’ strike amid holiday rush	Employees at seven facilities including in New York, Atlanta and San Francisco take action. Plus, Elon Musk sinks congressional spending bill Good morning – and happy holidays! This is the last First Thing of 2024. We will be back on 2 January. On Thursday morning, workers at seven Amazon facilities across the country went on strike early during the holiday shopping rush, aiming to pressure the retailer into union contract talks. What are the details of the dispute? The union had given Amazon a 15 December deadline to begin negotiations and warehouse workers had recently voted to authorize a strike. Teamsters says Amazon -fails to pay its workers enough to make ends meet- and has -pushed workers to the limit-, despite -obscene profits-. The company reported above-expected revenue growth in the third quarter, with revenue of $158.9bn, 11% higher than the same period in 2023. How disruptive will the strike be? Amazon said it did not expect any effect on its operations during one of the busiest times of the year. Analysts said the company was unlikely to come to the table to bargain as that could open the door to more union actions. Why? Unions represent only about 1% of the Amazon workforce, with the company – one of America’s largest by market cap – accused of anti-union practices. Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, whose personal wealth Forbes estimates to be $239bn. What is the debt ceiling? Congress is in charge of setting the debt limit, which currently stands at $31.4tn. This limits the amount of money the government can borrow to pay for services such as social security, Medicare and the military. The debt ceiling has been raised 78 times since 1960, under both Democrat and Republican presidents. What happens now? Without action from Congress, a government shutdown looms, starting tomorrow at 12.01am.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/20/first-thing-us-amazon-workers-go-on-their-largest-strike-amid-holiday-rush	2024-12-20T04:31:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b32656c4cf4a2de97a1e0fb29731aaadfbd4cd3c/0_82_5078_3047/master/5078.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dc72e02770854a1ee54a629b0ca3259f

The Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, is already facing multiple domestic and international crises, including power cuts due to a lack of oil supplies, continued tensions over its nuclear programme and a row about a new law that will make wearing the hijab compulsory for women.

They don’t want any big beasts coming back to mark anyone’s homework.- Let’s hope that in his new job the intelligence he gathers about what is going on in Donald Trump’s administration turns out to a little bit more accurate. One source said that Starmer’s decision to make a political appointment reflected how seriously he takes the UK’s relationship with the US, adding that Mandelson is a -significant figure in his own right-. He’s a big political hitter, well connected in our government, and I think that’s what we need with the Trump administration. He’s very interested in international affairs and foreign policy. And by the way, he is well connected in America.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/20/peter-mandelson-ambassador-us-keir-starmer-labour-uk-politics-latest	2024-12-20T01:30:55-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a589edff6526d4ca0f86c74d7f1e08ed2301e3c/609_121_3123_1875/master/3123.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=236454edb1b3624ba61eb044cafc9ae6
Middle East crisis live: mediators push on with Gaza ceasefire talks amid fresh strikes	Talks in Egypt and Qatar are focused on forging a deal to pause the 14-month-old war and release Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners A senior delegation of US diplomats has arrived in Syria to speak directly to the new Islamist-led rulers, hoping to encourage a moderate, inclusive path and to seek information on missing Americans. It is the first formal US diplomatic mission to Damascus since the early days of the brutal civil war that broke out in 2011 and culminated in a surprise lightning offensive that toppled longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad this month. Israel has launched widespread airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, killing at least nine people in the port city of Hodeidah, and threatened more attacks against the group, which has launched hundreds of missiles at Israel over the past year. There had been reports beforehand that Israel was planning to hit Yemen with force after a recent increase in Houthi attacks, including two in the past week. All references to Syria’s former ruling Ba’ath party will be removed from the country’s education system, the country’s new education minister said. Speaking to Reuters, Nazir Mohammad al-Qadri added that the country’s new leaders will not otherwise change school curricula or restrict the right of girls to learn, saying, -Education is a red line for the Syrian people, more important than food and water … The right to education is not limited to one specific gender. There may be more girls in our schools than boys.- The UK government has said any new Syrian government needs to build a -secure and peaceful- Syria weeks after its president Bashar al-Assad fled the country. Foreign Office minister Anneliese Dodds said British officials had met with the Syrian rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in Damascus and the UK was giving Syria £61m in aid. Thousands of people demonstrated on Thursday in north-east Syria in support of a US-backed, Kurdish-led force that for weeks has been pushing back against Turkey-backed fighters, an AFP correspondent said. The show of support for the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) comes after Islamist-led rebels toppled Syria’s longtime strongman Bashar al-Assad earlier this month. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has accused Israel of -ethnic cleansing- in the Gaza Strip in a report documenting the 14-month conflict published on Thursday. The report documents 41 attacks on MSF staff including airstrikes on health facilities and direct fire on humanitarian convoys, AFP reported. The NGO said it was forced to evacuate hospitals and health centres on 17 occasions. Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia had not been defeated in Syria and that Moscow had made proposals to the new rulers in Damascus over Russia’s military bases there. Putin said he had not yet met with Bashar al-Assad but planned to meet him and said he would ask about the fate of missing US reporter Austin Tice.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/20/middle-east-crisis-live-gaza-ceasefire-talks-fresh-strikes	2024-12-20T00:47:47-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb521c925ffa13fd040c5ff84142eab865e2b43e/0_108_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fe897980a17f3b323383b78b3df9f5da
Russia-Ukraine war live: airstrike on Kyiv following warnings of ballistic missile attack	One killed in attack that reportedly used Kinzhal and Iskander missiles against the Ukrainian capital One person was reported killed on Friday in a Russian missile strike on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, where AFP staff saw smoke rise over parts of the city after a series of explosions. -According to preliminary reports, one person was killed,- the head of the city’s military administration, Sergiy Popko, said on Telegram. Attacks overnight also hit the southeastern city of Kryvyi Rih, badly damaging a two-storey building and injuring six people, according to officials. A man and a teenage girl had been pulled from the rubble and had been hospitalised, the region’s governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded to Putin’s comments about testing a new hypersonic missile above Kyiv -to see what happens-. Zelenskyy said: -Do you think that’s a sane person? Simply scumbags.- Russia has been accused of carrying out a mass cyber-attack on Ukraine’s state registries. Ukrainian deputy prime minister Olha Stefanishyna said on Facebook late on Thursday: -As a result of this targeted attack, the work of the unified and state registries, which are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine, was temporarily suspended.- Stefanishyna said it was clear the attack was -carried out by the Russians to disrupt the work of the country’s critically important infrastructure-. Russia did not immediately comment on the claim. Vladimir Putin has said he was ready to meet Donald Trump and discuss peace proposals as he used a marathon phone-in event to claim that the war in Ukraine had made Russia -much stronger-. The Russian president said during the annual event that Moscow was -ready for negotiations and compromises- to end the fighting, but later he pointed to a maximalist position that would involve keeping Crimea and other occupied territories, Ukraine not joining Nato, and the lifting of sanctions by the west. He also denied that the fall of his key ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria had hurt Moscow’s standing. Zelenskyy said Putin was a fantasiser and accused him of wanting to destroy Ukraine’s army. -He (Putin) is an old fantasiser. He lives in a different world. He lives in his own aquarium I am afraid.- Zelenskyy said he needed both Europe and the United States on board to secure a durable peace, as he huddled with EU leaders at their final summit before Donald Trump’s inauguration. -I believe that the European guarantees won’t be sufficient for Ukraine,- he said after talks with his EU counterparts.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/20/russia-ukraine-war-live-kyiv-airstrike-ballistic-missile-vladimir-putin	2024-12-19T23:58:53-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26cdc5d1cf6022ce18fd68a5299ce33ce6228d99/0_81_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=36db90a9b6d3e53fb6ae6d8b49434eea
Friday briefing: Will the Gisèle Pelicot case finally change how we view violence against women?	In today’s newsletter: For years, Dominique Pelicot drugged his wife and recruited men to rape her. It could be a turning point in social and legal attitudes to sexual assault Good morning. Dominique Pelicot, described as one of France’s worst sex offenders, has been sentenced alongside 50 other men who he recruited to rape his wife, Gisèle Pelicot. Dominique, who was given the maximum sentence possible of 20 years in prison, had been drugging and raping his wife for a decade before he was caught. The scale of the horror and depravity of this case has shocked the world, and reignited conversations around consent and sexual violence.

Inside Aleppo, the city Assad left to rot as a lesson in the price of rising up	A decade on from the Guardian’s last visit, it is clear war has ripped the city apart – but there are signs of positive change Bashar al-Assad’s face has been ripped away from posters at the abandoned checkpoint that separates Sheikh Maqsoud, a neighbourhood in the north of Aleppo, from the rest of the city. No cars dare use the wide boulevard any more because the road is still watched by Kurdish snipers allied to the regime.

Chaos in Congress after Trump rejects spending deal as government shutdown nears – live updates	President-elect torpedoes bipartisan plan with less than 48 hours remaining until government shuts down for holidays Good morning, US politics blog readers. Just yesterday, it seemed like Congress was on the verge of enacting legislation to keep the government running for the next three months and prevent a shutdown that would begin after midnight on Friday. But on X, Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy and other conservatives whose influence grew after Donald Trump won re-election were busy condemning the deal. It was an effort that culminated yesterday afternoon, when the president-elect and JD Vance blew up the negotiations entirely by declaring that the bill should be scrapped and replaced with a new one that also increases country’s debt ceiling – a surprise demand that hadn’t been raised previously. The incoming administration’s opposition blew up the funding compromise, and now it is up to the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, to pick up the pieces, with less than 48 hours remaining until the government shuts down. Needless to say, few in Congress wanted this to happen with the Christmas holiday right around the corner. We’ll find out today if the GOP has it in them to turn the situation around. Here’s what else we are watching today: Democrats appear content to let Republicans own the government funding fiasco, with the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, tweeting that the GOP has -been ordered to shut down the government-.

Why do Black women consistently vote Democrat?	No other demographic has maintained the level of voter loyalty for a party as Black women have – experts tell us why For decades, Black women have been the most ardent supporters of the Democratic party. Most recently, in the 2024 election, they voted for Kamala Harris at 92%. Since 1972, Black people’s overall support for Democrats has stayed at about 90% during a presidential election, with Black women voting even more Democratic than Black men. No other demographic has maintained that level of voter loyalty for a political party. Donald Trump’s victory over the vice-president, and success with certain voting blocs such as Latino men and white women, has drawn attention to just how differently situated Black women are when compared with other voters.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/19/why-black-women-vote-democrat	2024-12-19T04:00:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfe617387eebedffd9d3637e69ed449d06eb692e/0_0_7700_4623/master/7700.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c025c68b39e64f57ad981ed2aba179f

But the Pelicot children have said they are -disappointed by the low sentences-, Agence France-Presse reports.

First they came for his older brother Amafer, nabbed in broad daylight on the streets of the Mexican city of Morelia. Then they came for his other brother, Armando, grabbed on the outskirts of the capital. That same day, soldiers burst into the family home, beating his younger brothers Solón and Venustiano, as well as his father Jesús – eventually they too would be taken. Finally in October, security forces took Abdallan Guzmán himself, subjecting him to the cruelest forms of torture before tossing him in prison.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/19/mexico-dirty-war-victims-planes	2024-12-19T03:30:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/664f102789699a7100fa7270c0ec4128bc875851/0_209_5396_3240/master/5396.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=684547f7ef2e6df6914ad7ed3b653c1d

Starmer to take questions from liaison committee as No 10 firms up links with incoming Trump administration – UK politics live	Prime minister to be questioned on economy, public services and global affairs as No 10 says he spoke to Trump on the phone on Wednesday Good morning. It is the last day the House of Commons is sitting before the Christmas recess, and the main event will be in a committee room in Portcullis House where Keir Starmer will have his first question session with the liaison committee, the prefects’ club comprising the chairs of all the other Commons select committees. For 90 minutes he will take questions on the economy, public services and global affairs from MPs who know their subjects pretty well. Most of them are Labour MPs, but they include people who have only become select committee chairs because, despite serving on the front bench before the election, they were not appointed ministers, and so it is wrong to assume they are all Starmer loyalists. In theory, 90 minutes of intelligent questioning with the PM should produce a decent amount of news. In the past liaison committee hearings have often failed to get much beyond a rehash of familiar No 10 lines to take, but we live in hope. Relations with the US are almost certain to come up, and Starmer may be asked about an overnight story that suggests Starmer is firming up links with the incoming Donald Trump administration. Yesterday Starmer and Trump spoke on the phone. In its readout, No 10 says: The prime minister began by congratulating President-elect Trump on his recent team appointments and President-elect Trump warmly recounted his meeting with His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in Paris earlier this month. Both agreed on their joint ambition to strengthen the close and historic relationship between the UK and the US. They looked forward to working together on shared priorities, including international security and delivering economic growth and prosperity. Morgan McSweeney travelled to Florida to meet Susie Wiles, the political strategist who masterminded Mr Trump’s re-election campaign and will be his chief of staff in office. Mr McSweeney also had policy discussions in Washington with Mike Waltz, the congressman who has been named as Mr Trump’s next national security adviser. The mood music was very warm. President Trump is nothing but warm about the UK. As the year closes, Team Starmer is confident the UK is in a good position for a strong bilateral relationship with the new presidency.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/19/keir-starmer-questions-liaison-committee-donald-trump-administration-uk-politics-latest-updates	2024-12-19T01:28:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ad911fc8ee3b99d81641bf37755d7a7c5d02c78/41_69_5516_3310/master/5516.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f31ecd6bc8ed6b195b5f106f9e5b83ee
Middle East crisis live: Israel’s ‘long hand’ will reach Houthi leaders, says defence minister	Israel Katz warns leaders of movement after airstrikes hit several areas of Yemen overnight, including power stations near capital Sana’a Hello and welcome to the Middle East crisis live blog. My name is Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news and developments from the region. We start with the news that Israel’s -long hand- will reach the leaders of Yemen’s Houthi movement, its defence minister, Israel Katz, vowed on Thursday, after unleashing airstrikes on several areas of the country overnight. The visiting UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told Agence France-Presse that there is a need for a significant aid boost across Syria after the ousting of Bashar al-Assad. -Across the country, the needs are huge. Seven in 10 people are needing support right now,- Fletcher said, adding, -I want to scale up massively international support, but that now depends on donors. The Syria fund has been historically, shamefully underfunded and now there is this opportunity.- Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said his country and Lebanon would work together on Syria after the overthrow of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad earlier this month. -A new era has now begun in Syria. We agree that we must act together as two important neighbours of Syria,- Erdoğan told a news conference, alongside Lebanese caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati. The Israeli military has ordered another evacuation in central Gaza, even as Israel and Hamas appear to inch closer to a ceasefire agreement. -This is an advance warning ahead of an offensive,- Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee posted on X. The order included four residential block areas in the urban refugee camp of Bureij, where Adraee claimed that Palestinian militants fired rockets toward Israel. UN special envoy Geir Pedersen has called for -free and fair elections- in Syria and urged humanitarian assistance, AFP reports. Addressing reporters at the end of a visit to Damascus, Pedersen said -there is a lot of hope that we can now see the beginning of a new Syria-, which he expressed hope would also include a -political solution- in the Kurdish-held northeast. The US, joined by Arab mediators, is seeking to conclude a long-negotiated ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. A Palestinian official told Reuters earlier today that mediators had narrowed gaps on most of the agreement’s clauses. He said Israel, however, had introduced conditions which Hamas rejected but would not elaborate. At least 45,097 Palestinian people have been killed and 107,244 injured in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said. Of those, 38 Palestinians were killed and 203 injured in the latest 24-hour reporting period, the ministry said.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/19/middle-east-crisis-israel-houthis-yemen-airstrikes-latest-updates	2024-12-19T00:22:49-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da0e4c70c8755fbf3906c8897659c193466985bf/0_251_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9a56fef70d82d1f55b61349eed46c4b9

Russia-Ukraine war live: Zelenskyy says he discussed French troop idea with Macron	Ukrainian leader says presence of forces ‘could contribute to stabilising the path to peace’ Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had held a new discussion with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, on the latter’s proposal to deploy troops in Ukraine as a means to help achieve a stable peace. At least 100 North Koreans deployed to support Russia’s war effort in Ukraine have been killed since entering combat in December, South Korean lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun told reporters on Thursday. Pyongyang has sent thousands of troops to reinforce the Russian military, including to the Kursk border region, where Ukrainian forces seized territory earlier this year. -In December, they [North Korean troops] engaged in actual combat, during which at least 100 fatalities occurred,- Lee said, speaking after a briefing by South Korea’s spy agency. -The National Intelligence Service also reported that the number of injured is expected to reach nearly 1,000.- Despite those losses, the agency also said it had detected signs North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was preparing to train a new special operations force to ship westward. Ukraine struck Russian territory with at least 13 missiles and 84 drones, triggering a fire at the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in the southern Rostov region that burned for hours, Russian officials said on Thursday. Russian air defences shot down 84 drones over Russian regions, including 36 over Rostov region, according to the defence ministry. A Russian missile attack damaged residential buildings and infrastructure in Ukraine’s Sumy and Dnipropetrovsk regions, the Ukrainian military said this morning. There were no immediate reports of causalities. Russia used two Iskander-M ballistic missiles and a Kh-59/69 guided missile in its attack, the air force said. The attack damaged infrastructure, two apartment buildings, a hospital, and a school in Dnipropetrovsk region, its governor Serhiy Lysak said. A missile attack on the northeastern Sumy region damaged nine private residences, regional authorities said. Britain has unveiled £225m (US$286m) in new military aid to Ukraine for next year including drones, boats and air defence systems. The World Bank has approved $2.05bn in funding for Ukraine that includes the first grant from a $20bn US loan fund for Kyiv that is backed by income from frozen Russian sovereign assets.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskyy-french-troop-plan-macron-russia	2024-12-19T00:14:30-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7211c41d680577b246c25aafc79bf2efb53ed05/0_74_3485_2091/master/3485.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ac85b24e2cb0b829c0669f3e9d9f5769

Trump warns Liz Cheney ‘could be in a lot of trouble’ after Republicans call for FBI investigation – US politics live	President-elect reacts to House subcommittee report calling for former congresswoman to be investigated over January 6 inquiry Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump stayed up late (or woke up early?) to threaten Liz Cheney, the Republican former congresswoman who lost her seat two years ago after breaking with the president-elect. In a post written shortly after three in the morning, Trump said that Cheney -could be in a lot of trouble- over the findings of a Republican controlled House subcommittee that investigated the now-concluded bipartisan panel that held public hearings into the insurrection two years ago. The Republican subcommittee’s report accuses Cheney of witness tampering, saying, -numerous federal laws were likely broken by- the former congresswoman, and -these violations should be investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.- Those aren’t just empty words, considering Trump has nominated loyalist Kash Patel to lead the FBI, and, based on what Republican senators have said publicly so far, he may get confirmed. Here’s what else is happening today: Congress, and particularly House Republicans, are scrambling to pass a short-term government funding bill to ward off a shutdown that will otherwise begin Friday. As usual, many lawmakers do not like the compromises struck in the draft legislation released by Republican House speaker Mike Johnson, and will no doubt pipe up about it throughout today. The New York Times, which has had a fraught relationship with Joe Biden, has published a comprehensive look at what the president has been up to since Trump won re-election. You will learn that he appears older than ever, and even less willing than usual to entertain reporters. Biden has nothing public on his scheduled today, but is in Delaware to mark the anniversary of the car crash that killed his first wife and daughter.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/dec/18/trump-cheney-january-6-politics-latest-updates	2024-12-18T06:09:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4fe341f0ec9a4ffcdac66675dde9858aef672ab/0_193_5796_3478/master/5796.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=136f53c6db4b0a4119975c87c547e150

US violating law to fund Israel despite alleged human rights abuses, lawsuit says | First Thing	Suit claims state department is deliberately bypassing the Leahy law. Plus, New York grand jury charges Luigi Mangione with first-degree murder Good morning. The US state department is facing a new lawsuit – brought by Palestinians and Palestinian Americans – accusing it of deliberately circumventing a decades-old human rights law by continuing to fund Israeli military units accused of widespread atrocities in the occupied Palestinian territories. What is the Leahy law? Enacted in 1997, it was designed to prohibit US assistance to any security forces that the US identifies as being ineligible due to a gross violation of human rights. But, as one former state official told the Guardian earlier this year: -The rules were different for Israel.- What are the aims of the lawsuit? With the death toll in Gaza since last October reportedly approaching 45,000, humanitarian aid to the territory severely restricted, millions of people displaced and infrastructure decimated, the legal challenge demands judicial intervention to force the US to comply with the law. What happens now? The Kremlin has not yet indicated how it will retaliate. But RIA reported that the former president Dmitry Medvedev, now a senior Russian security official, said Ukraine’s military and political leadership faced revenge. What’s the latest on the frontlines? Russian forces took control of the villages of Trudove and Stari Terny in eastern Ukraine, RIA claimed. Meanwhile, North Korean forces have suffered -several hundred- casualties, according to a senior US military official.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/18/first-thing-us-violating-law-by-funding-israel-despite-alleged-human-rights-abuses-lawsuit-says	2024-12-18T04:51:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c44242eeadb3c26992463de49a18ae5d5e40c011/0_25_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1d11c7d61896aabc2e27020f1f7354e9

Though technically still a refugee camp, in the ensuing decades it had become largely indistinguishable from the rest of northern Gaza’s urban sprawl – densely populated, vibrant and busy.

Reeves says compensating Waspi women not ‘best use of taxpayers’ money’ as backlash grows – UK politics live	Chancellor and PM have both defended not to pay compensation to Waspi women Good morning. Keir Starmer is facing his last PMQs of the year and, if he takes a glance at the papers this morning, he will find that he is being attacked by the Tory papers for not implementing a Jeremy Corbyn manifesto promise. Here are two of the headlines about yesterday’s announcement that the government will not compensate the so-called Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) women – women who lost out because they were not properly notified about the planned rise in their state pension age. The Daily Telegraph has not splashed on the story, but it does have it on the front, under the headline -Labour betrays Waspi women with U-turn on pension payouts-. It is true that, when Corbyn was leader, Labour did promise compensation for the Waspi women. But when the parliamentary and health service ombudsman (PHSO) recommended compensation worth up to £10bn in a report earlier this year, Keir Starmer very deliberately did not commit to implementing this, and his manifesto did not promise Waspi compensation.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/18/pmqs-starmer-badenoch-labour-tories-waspi-women	2024-12-18T01:24:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83775e089b50d6b7e285f2b3afddbdeebd2b9a46/0_286_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f17c6aa392ff0b526c87c23be13d8258

Rachel Reeves: improving services more important than Waspi women payout	Chancellor says high cost of compensation cannot be justified because most of women affected had known pension changes were coming Improving public services is a higher priority than spending £10bn compensating Waspi women, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said, as MPs and campaigners criticised the decision to reject the watchdog’s recommendation for a flat-rate compensation scheme. Her comments came after campaigners accused Labour of hypocrisy for having promised to compensate women hit by the rising state pension age. The parliamentary ombudsman had recommended paying out £1,000 to £2,950 to each of the more than 3 million women affected.	https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/dec/18/rachel-reeves-improving-services-more-important-than-waspi-women-payout	2024-12-18T01:06:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44323d4df6f8c7f8a2ebc44094258ab75088ad83/330_641_5065_3039/master/5065.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=227181b830678dde81cf7675a00282fe

Middle East crisis live: hopes for Israel-Gaza ceasefire deal rise as officials express cautious optimism	Israeli negotiating team has travelled to Qatar with Hamas, US and Arab officials all suggesting a deal may be within reach On Tuesday an Israeli negotiating team travelled to Qatar while a report from Reuters – denied by his office and Egypt – said that the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was planning to travel to Cairo for talks. Instead, Netanyahu’s office said he had toured a buffer zone inside Syria that was recently seized by Israeli forces after the fall of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, which he said would remain under Israeli control for the foreseeable future. A ceasefire between Turkey and the U.S.-backed Kurdish Syrian forces (SDF) around the northern Syrian city of Manbij has been extended until the end of this week, state department spokesperson Matthew Miller has said. Washington brokered an initial ceasefire last week after fighting that broke out earlier this month as rebel groups advanced on Damascus and overthrew the rule of Bashar al-Assad. Geir Pedersen, the UN’s special envoy for Syria, however, has warned that the conflict -has not ended-, highlighting the clashes between the Turkish-backed and Kurdish groups. Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Israeli forces will stay in a buffer zone on the Syrian border, seized after the ouster of Syria’s President Bashar Assad, until another arrangement is in place -that ensures Israel’s security.- Netanyahu made the comments from the summit of Mount Hermon about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border with the Israel-held Golan Heights. Israeli lawmakers narrowly approved the country’s 2025 state budget in an initial vote. The 59-57 vote in the Knesset – the Israeli parliament – to pass the wartime austerity budget in its first of three readings. A UN refugee agency official said that about one million Syrian refugees are expected to return to the country in the first six months of 2025, with thousands of people already having returned to the country mostly from Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, said his country’s forces will maintain -security control- over the devastated Gaza Strip, even after the war is over, with Israeli soldiers able to act with -full freedom of action- over the territory. At least 45,059 Palestinian people have been killed and 107,041 injured in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement. Of those, 31 Palestinians were killed and 79 injured in the latest 24-hour reporting period, the ministry said. At least 10 people were confirmed killed in an Israeli airstrike on a house in Gaza City that destroyed the building, while further north in the town of Beit Lahiya at least 15 people were reportedly killed while they were sheltering in a house. Ahmed al-Sharaa, the leader of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group that toppled Assad, said all rebel factions would -be disbanded and the fighters trained to join the ranks of the defence ministry- during a meeting with members of the minority Druze community. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the bloc would send an ambassador back to Damascus. -We are ready to reopen our delegation, which is the European embassy, and we want this to be fully operational again,- she said. Kallas added that the EU would aim to help authorities restore basic services like electricity, water and infrastructure.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/18/israel-gaza-ceasefire-talks-middle-east-netanyahu-hamas-syria-lebanon	2024-12-17T23:44:28-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b0a7032305ea058206289fafd5cb8df94e85d05/0_25_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=01621d4376bf39c66a3c97bd0b6d9fa9

Wednesday briefing: The world waits after Ukraine assassinates top Putin general in Moscow	In today’s newsletter: Kyiv assassinated Igor Kirillov inside enemy territory, in its most audacious operation since the war began – how will Russia respond? Good morning. In the early hours of yesterday morning, Russian general Igor Kirillov and his deputy were killed when a bomb concealed in an e-scooter detonated as they left an apartment. Ukraine’s SBU security service swiftly claimed responsibility for the attack, which stands as one of the most audacious assassinations of a senior Russian military figure since the war began almost three years ago. Russian authorities arrested a 29-year-old citizen of Uzbekistan early today, the news agency Tass reported, citing the FSB, the country’s domestic spy agency.

On Ukraine’s frontline, the country’s soldiers report what statistics show: a persistent use of chemical weapons, mostly teargas, whose deployment on the battlefield is illegal. The US and UK go further in their accusations and say Russia is using another toxic agent, chloropicrin, first employed to gruesome effect in the trenches of the first world war. Behind the effort are the radiological, chemical and biological defence troops of the Russian ministry of defence, known as RKhBZ.

US voters believe Trump will get more done than Biden – but also trust his government less	Survey finds voters think Trump will be an effective president, but don’t believe his administration will share accurate information Donald Trump won a second White House term in November’s election thanks to voters’ attaching higher priority to having an effective president than one who was trustworthy, fresh polling has suggested. A post-election survey conducted by Scheon Cooperman Research, in conjunction with George Washington University’s graduate school of political management, has concluded that voters believe Trump’s second presidency will be more effective in getting things done – even though they trust his administration less to share accurate information. And Trump not only failed to deliver on some of his more prominent campaign promises during his first term from 2017 to 2021, including a southern US border wall for which Mexico would pay – he also botched the federal response to the deadly Covid-19 pandemic.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/17/trump-biden-effective	2024-12-17T08:35:35-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e68dfd23a1a95270f98bbddb761193eea8938ba/0_27_5717_3429/master/5717.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6f5998789771def1c56597b3d23492d3

Donald Trump calls Canadian PM Justin Trudeau ‘governor’ for second time as he weighs in on deputy PM’s departure – live	President-elect criticizes Chrystia Freeland in social media post after doubling down on tariff pledges on Monday Good morning, US politics blog readers. Since winning re-election last month, Donald Trump has, for reasons that are not clear, taken to calling Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau -governor-. He’s done it in two instances that we can think of, the most recent coming last night, in a post on Truth Social where the president-elect weighed in on the departure from Trudeau’s government of deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland, who had disagreed with Trudeau over how to handle Trump’s threatened economic policies. Without giving examples, the president-elect said -her behavior was totally toxic-, and accused her of standing in the way of a trade deal between the two countries. The -governor- moniker is a strange one to bestow on Trudeau, considering it is both inaccurate, and because the prime minister has made efforts to reach out to Trump, including by dining with him at Mar-a-Lago. Hanging over the two men’s relationship is Trump’s threat to impose steep tariffs on Canada, which Trudeau is trying to convince him not to follow through with. But at a press conference at Mar-a-Lago yesterday, Trump made clear he’s not changing course. -We lose a lot of money to Canada, tremendous amount,- the president-elect said, later adding: -Tariffs will make our country rich.- Kamala Harris will give a speech billed as encouraging young people to be active in their communities in the Washington DC suburbs at 11.35am ET.

Minister says ‘no plans’ to ban smacking in England, despite comment from Sara Sharif’s father – UK politics live	Education secretary Bridget Phillipson tells LBC ‘we’re not intending to legislate around this’ Good morning. The children’s wellbeing and schools bill is being published today and, as Sally Weale reports, it will set out plans to tighten checks on children being educated at home in England. Publication coincides with the sentencing of the killers of 10-year-old Sara Sharif – her father and step-mother – following a trial that revealed details of one of the most shocking cases of child cruelty heard by a British court in years. Sara was taken out of school, and educated at home in the months before her death, even though teachers had started to notice evidence that she was being assaulted at home, and so the legislation – although planned well before the trial – does address one of safeguarding loopholes the Sharif case has highlighted. Too many children have been failed by the state in recent years, it is clear that action is required. So no more lessons learned, no more words. Today we set out our plans to make sure that those agencies are working together and that we have much greater visibility of where children are and what they’re experiencing in their lives. What haunts me the most about Sara’s death is that her father used the words ‘I legally punished my child’, believing this to be a defence to murder. It is unthinkable that any parent or carer could hide behind our legal system to justify such cruelty – and yet, children living in England today have less protection from assault than adults. We’re not intending to legislate around this. I do want to look at the experience in Wales and Scotland where they have legislated to understand what the effect has been. Because what I want to understand is the impact and the effect of the legislation in Wales. They will be setting out the first round of a review into the implications and effect of the legislation that they had introduced. I would like to see that, would like to understand it, and to decide then whether it’s necessary to take further measures here in England.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/17/uk-politics-latest-news-labour-conservatives-keir-starmer	2024-12-17T01:17:48-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ad969a48a4a02233db8159d54137570e7d02ebb/0_153_1795_1077/master/1795.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=00dbcd1ffe5e827f510d180e357705bb

Tuesday briefing: How the UK left 64 asylum seekers stranded on an island in the Indian Ocean	In today’s newsletter: As a judge finds the government unlawfully detained Tamils on Diego Garcia, we look at the geopolitcs that led to them being trapped in ‘hell on earth’ for three years Good morning. In October 2021, a boat carrying dozens of Tamils trying to find their way to Canada sprung a leak. They were rescued by the British navy and brought to Diego Garcia, a tropical island in the middle of the Indian Ocean that was under the control of the British government, and which hosted a US military base. But their saviours became their captors – and they found themselves in rat-infested camps, largely deprived of their liberty and caught in legal limbo with no obvious way out. The authorities on Diego Garcia maintained that the asylum seekers were free to leave whenever they wanted, and that any restrictions on their movements there were lawful and necessary. Yesterday, a judge said that case had -not come close- to being made. She ruled that the asylum seekers had been unlawfully detained in conditions that one of them described as -hell on earth-. The ruling amounts to a crushing defeat for the British government, and a wholesale vindication for an almost forgotten group of people whose fate has been subjugated to geopolitical forces far beyond their control.

Democrats make last-minute push to add Equal Rights Amendment to US constitution – live	If Joe Biden published the ERA, move could trigger a court fight that would cast a shadow over incoming Trump administration Good morning, US politics blog readers. Dozens of Democratic lawmakers have proposed a novel idea for Joe Biden to secure his presidential legacy in his final weeks in office: decide that the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which protects against sex discrimination, has met the standard for ratification, and have the Archivist of the United States publish the amendment into the constitution. The proposal was approved by the US House and Senate in the early 1970s but a conservative backlash prevented it from being ratified by the necessary two-thirds of states by a 1982 deadline congress had set. In the years since, several states have voted to approve the amendment, and in a letter to Biden sent over the weekend, more than 120 House Democrats argued that the ERA has met the requirements, and should be added to the constitution as the 28th amendment, and the first since 1992. The subtext here is Donald Trump’s impending arrival in the White House, and the likelihood that Biden publishing the ERA would trigger a court fight that casts a shadow over the newly arrived president, particularly since he is viewed as politically vulnerable among women. We’ll tell you more about the ERA push today. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the anti-vaccine activist Trump has named to lead the health and human services department, is heading to Capitol Hill to meet with Republican senators throughout the day. Biden will at 12.15pm hold an event at the labor department to promote his administration’s efforts to help American workers, then convene a Hanukkah reception at 7.45pm. Syrian diplomats and community leaders plan to today hoist the flag of -Free Syria- at its Washington DC embassy, which has been closed since 2014.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/dec/16/biden-trump-latest-equal-rights-amendment-push-democrats	2024-12-16T06:06:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77526c124f296d0f4c344c1ad91ea9217ebeab02/0_0_5122_3074/master/5122.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=76d54db8aeb17afee5129d192ecd46d5

Assad uncle used Guernsey adviser to secretly manage vast wealth	Rifaat al-Assad, the ‘Butcher of Hama’, identified as client of consultant who received ban and fine this year An uncle of the recently ousted Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad used an adviser in Guernsey to secretly manage his wealth, which included a vast European property empire worth hundreds of millions of euros that prosecutors claim was acquired with funds looted from the wartorn state. Rifaat al-Assad, known as the -Butcher of Hama- for overseeing the violent suppression of a rebellion in the 1980s, has been accused of war crimes by Swiss prosecutors. In 2020, he was convicted by a French court of embezzling Syrian state funds and pouring the money into luxury properties, with the French state seizing assets worth €90m. The Witanhurst estate in Highgate, north London – the second largest private residence in the capital after Buckingham Palace. Rifaat sold it for £32m to developers in 2007 after leaving it in disrepair. A £50m mansion in South Street, Mayfair. Owned through a shell company in the British Virgin Islands, it was frozen by British proceeds of crime prosecutors in 2017. A seven-bedroom, seven-bathroom estate in Leatherhead, Surrey, with a gym, tennis court and indoor swimming pool. It was sold for £4m in 2016 before prosecutors could impose an asset freeze. A seven-storey mansion on Avenue Foch, which leads to the Arc de Triomphe in the most expensive arrondissement of Paris. Art and furnishings from the property were auctioned but the property itself remains frozen. Thirty-two apartments in Paris’s Avenue du Président Kennedy, which runs along the bank of the Seine next to the Eiffel Tower. La Máquina, a €60m estate occupying almost a third of the entire Marbella resort town of Benahavís. La Máquina’s footprint is so expansive that the Assads were reported to have considered transforming it into an enclave exclusively for wealthy Syrians.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/16/assad-uncle-used-guernsey-adviser-to-secretly-manage-vast-wealth	2024-12-16T06:00:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d82da064c47585b6d46a70621835c0b6fd8be51d/1776_23_1582_949/master/1582.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f2a007df0fd34a08e3297ee117b1df71

Germany: parliament to declare no confidence in chancellor Olaf Scholz – live	Chancellor triggered path to elections, due to take place on 23 February, by firing finance minister Christian Lindner last month Scholz, who is deeply unpopular, will begin the session at 1pm CET with a short speech presenting his reasons for calling the confidence motion. He will be the fifth chancellor to use the measure as laid out in Article 68 of Germany’s Basic Law since the second world war – Angela Merkel was a rare exception in never using it despite her 16 years in power through many a crisis. About 90 minutes of debate will follow. If all goes according to Scholz’s plan, a majority of MPs will vote against Scholz and he can go to president Frank-Walter Steinmeier at Bellevue Palace in central Berlin, recommending that the head of state dissolve the current Bundestag and clear the way for a general election. Steinmeier will have 21 days to take his decision, during which he will consult with the leaders of the various parliamentary groups. If he agrees to dissolve the Bundestag, an election would have to be held within 60 days, thus clearing the way to the 23 February poll.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/16/germany-parliament-no-confidence-olaf-scholz-chancellor-latest-updates	2024-12-16T03:39:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e59f61d0314cfda06f84c032768ceb4d26b2cd4/0_215_4724_2833/master/4724.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7cbaad78d484daa4b19a8371ceee4652
First Thing: Israel strikes Syria as Netanyahu approves settlement expansion	The Israeli PM approved plan to double Israeli population in Golan Heights. Plus, South Korea’s constitutional court begins reviewing presidential impeachment Good morning. Israel bombed dozens of sites in Syria overnight, despite the Syrian rebel leader, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani aka Ahmed al-Sharaa, saying his Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group was not interested in conflict with Israel. What is Israel bombing in Syria? Israeli air raids have hit bases, heavy weapons, sites associated with the former Assad regime’s missile and chemical weapons programme, and destroyed Syria’s small naval force in port of Latakia. The scale of the Israeli bombing campaign has surprised many western capitals. How did Netanyahu justify further settlements? He justified expanding Israeli settlements in the occupied Golan Heights -in light of the war and the new front facing Syria- and a desire to double the Israeli population in the area. -We will continue to hold on to it, cause it to blossom and settle in it,- he said.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/16/first-thing-israel-strikes-syria-netanyahu-approves-settlement-expansion	2024-12-16T03:32:35-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb75ef23be46e886d273963569a782d1337701d6/0_208_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b48ba56c69122d3ba54ea5eca65b9d76

Monday briefing: What do we know about Prince Andrew and the alleged Chinese spy?	In today’s newsletter: Many questions remain unanswered about the person known only as H6, but the complex relationship between China and the UK is sure to be put under the spotlight Good morning. Espionage is an obviously mysterious business, but there can be fewer greater puzzles in the annals of national security than the one that has arisen in the last few days. If you were the mighty Chinese state, and making a list of British public figures who might hold useful intelligence or influence, what would make you put Prince Andrew on it? I can’t answer that one. But many other questions besides have arisen since it emerged that a businessman and alleged Chinese spy with links to Andrew has been barred from entering the UK on national security grounds – and last night, MPs raised fears that the case shows that the UK has been too eager to strengthen UK-China relations. Today’s newsletter explains what we know. Here are the headlines. Ireland | Israel has announced it will close its embassy in Ireland, citing Dublin’s decision last week to support a petition at the international court of justice accusing Israel of genocide. Irish taoiseach Simon Harris called the move -deeply regrettable-. Economy | Fifty economists and policy experts have issued a warning to Rachel Reeves that encouraging the city to expand could threaten financial stability and jeopardise growth. The chancellor has claimed that regulations imposed after the global financial crisis have -gone too far-. Extreme weather | At least several hundred people are feared to have been killed after the worst cyclone in almost a century ripped through the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte on Saturday. Officials said the final toll would be hard to ascertain but could be in the thousands. Immigration and asylum | Syrian asylum seekers left in limbo after the UK home secretary said the government was pausing their claims have called the decision -cruel- and urged officials to resume processing their cases. About 6,500 cases are now in the system.

‘Celebrating the unknown’: Syrian Alawites fear for future under rebel rule	Minority Islamic sect associated with overthrown Assad regime waits to see how threats of revenge will play out To prepare khubeiza, the leaves of the kale-like plant must be roughly chopped and sauteed with onions, garlic and a dash of salt. Folklore says that the recipe originated among the Alawite communities who lived in Syria’s mountainous coastline where the fibrous, wild-growing plant can be found in abundance. So poor were the Alawites during Ottoman times, the story goes, that the only food they could find to eat was khubeiza, which sprouts like a stubborn weed every spring. When Hafez al-Assad, a member of the minority Islamic Alawite sect, seized the reins of power in 1971, he promised to lift the neglected community out of its poverty and end its hunger.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/15/celebrating-the-unknown-syrian-alawites-fear-for-future-under-rebel-rule	2024-12-15T05:52:14-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba91f0597f2f49153498aa299fda8c5aee4963c0/0_327_4902_2941/master/4902.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2d5c7ae847959dc10e9860e3030f5615

When they don’t, it grinds to a halt- was how former French president Jacques Chirac put it almost a quarter of a century ago at one of the periodic love-ins between the EU’s two biggest member states. So what would Chirac, who died in 2019, make of the current condition of the famed Franco-German engine which, since the bloc’s inception, has powered so much of the postwar European project?

Prince Andrew may have been a victim of Chairman Mao’s ‘magic weapon’ | Isabel Hilton	The United Front Work Department aims to befriend, bribe and seduce ‘useful idiots’. Was Andrew caught up in its net? The late Chairman Mao, China’s former supreme leader, once called the United Front Work Department (UFWD) one of the three -magic weapons- of the Chinese Communist party (CCP). That the other two were the People’s Liberation Army and the party’s propaganda arm signals how central the UFWD has been to the CCP’s efforts for nearly a century. The operation involving Andrew must count as one of its more unusual achievements. The UFWD’s job began as neutralising potentially hostile actors at home. As China has expanded into the world, it has increasingly taken on the international challenge of befriending, bribing or otherwise seducing figures of influence who can be won over to China’s cause. Such elite figures can become both useful sources of information and agents of influence who can be invited to smooth away any hostility or suspicions that might otherwise get in the way of the CCP’s ambition.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/14/prince-andrew-chairman-mao-united-work-front-department	2024-12-14T11:04:48-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d61d687319f7a344e7b2ee9949ae4bcec7a9c2c/338_541_2222_1333/master/2222.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3acfe2612f0a168ce5f17dee46098835
