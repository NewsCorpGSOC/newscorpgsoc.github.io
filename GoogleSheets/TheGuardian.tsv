Alarm as Republican judge who lost election pushes voter-fraud claim	Jefferson Griffin trying to remove thousands of ballots from North Carolina count in case that has drawn large protests Four months after the 2024 election, and after recounts affirmed his loss, a North Carolina judge running for a seat on the state’s high court has yet to concede. Instead, Jefferson Griffin is still trying to remove more than 65,000 voters’ ballots from the count, contending they were not lawfully able to vote. Griffin’s case, closely watched by both political parties for its ability to set a precedent in a swing state, is now before the state’s court of appeals, on which he sits. Griffin, a Republican, lost to Democratic supreme court justice Allison Riggs by 734 votes, affirmed by two recounts. The parties filed briefs in early March, and the Republican-leaning court of appeals is expected to schedule arguments soon.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/republican-judge-voter-fraud-north-carolina	2025-03-08T06:00:25-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b8032a60932063feaa425796a4bcf0d2e25fdcc/0_67_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c16e63c0262f8f7a71f63e8baa509d80

‘I’ve lost my work and been ostracised’: Oxford University accused of failing to act after ruling on ‘sham’ contracts	Despite winning a landmark legal battle, academic Alice Jolly believes it won’t benefit others An academic who won a landmark court battle last year against Oxford University for employing her and her colleague on -sham- gig economy contracts has criticised the university for trying to brush their case under the carpet. Alice Jolly and her colleague Rebecca Abrams, both award-winning authors, taught on Oxford’s prestigious creative writing course for 15 years but were employed on zero hours -personal services- contracts, often earning only £23 an hour. After they publicly challenged the university on their lack of employment rights, Oxford wrote to the Society of Authors in April 2022, agreeing to offer the two academics more appropriate contracts.	https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/mar/08/ive-lost-my-work-and-been-ostracised-oxford-university-accused-of-failing-to-act-after-ruling-on-sham-contracts	2025-03-08T04:08:59-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47db2b368f7ad8c2eeffa00eae992cbb9177c79d/0_238_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=82d0c8c4cea79036644b3ac951cad06a

Ukraine war live: 11 killed in Donetsk as Russia steps up attacks after Trump defends Putin	High-rise apartment blocks in centre of Dobropillia town hit in attack a day after US suspended intelligence sharing with Kyiv Welcome to our live coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. Here’s a snapshot of the latest to bring you up to speed. At least 11 people were killed and 30 wounded in Russian strikes on eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region late on Friday, the country’s emergency service said on Saturday, raising the earlier death toll of four. Russia carried out huge ballistic missile and drone strikes across Ukraine a day after the US stopped sharing intelligence with Kyiv which had previously given advance warnings of attacks. The strikes came early on Friday as a Ukrainian delegation prepared to meet with US counterparts in Saudi Arabia next week for talks about a possible end to the war, report Luke Harding and Dan Sabbagh. In a post on Truth Social, Donald Trump appeared to criticise Russia’s latest bombardment. The US president posted: -Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely ‘pounding’ Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED.- Separately, Trump said after the strikes that Vladimir Putin was -doing what anybody would do-. -I think he wants to get it [the war] stopped and settled and I think he’s hitting them harder than he’s been hitting them and I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now,- he told reporters in the White House. Trump also said he found it -easier- to deal with Russia than with Ukraine in efforts to end the war and that he trusted Putin, the Russian president. -I believe him,- Trump said. -I’m finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine and they don’t have the cards. It may be easier dealing with Russia.- Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded to Russia’s strikes by calling for a truce covering air and sea. -The first steps to establishing real peace should be forcing the sole source of this war, Russia, to stop such attacks,- the Ukrainian president said on Telegram. Moscow has rejected the idea of a temporary truce, which has also been proposed by Britain and France. US aerospace company Maxar Technologies disabled Ukraine’s access to its satellite images after a request from the Trump administration. Maxar said it had contracts with the US government and dozens of allied and partner nations and -each customer makes their own decisions on how they use and share that data-. Zelenskyy’s approval rating in Ukraine has risen by 10 percentage points since his White House spat with Trump, a survey by a leading Ukrainian pollster showed on Friday. The poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology – conducted from 14 February to 4 March – found 67% of respondents trusted Zelenskyy in March, up from 57% a month earlier. Iran’s foreign ministry denied accusations by Emmanuel Macron that Tehran had supplied equipment to Russia for use in the Ukraine war, calling the French president’s remarks -baseless and false-.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/mar/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-putin-trump-zelenskyy-donetsk-latest-news-updates	2025-03-07T23:24:21-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95c56436f78f6dc030eeff0bf69145ba3fa1ebc6/0_232_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d9980de2f7c5171d35c786b7e6d5c522

The Ukraine crisis has accelerated a reset of UK-EU relations – but will it last?	Trump’s abandonment of Ukraine has led even Farage to praise Starmer’s lead role in European diplomacy Barely a day passes, it seems, without Keir Starmer talking to another European leader or preparing for a continental summit. The crisis over Ukraine has very much pushed the UK closer towards the centre stage than at any point since Brexit. But is this a new era or a false dawn? One thing is certain: the optics of engagement have changed. Starmer never shared Boris Johnson’s almost active pride in stoking a row with Brussels, but particularly before the election his advisers were wary of reminding voters about his past as a diehard remainer.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/07/ukraine-crisis-reset-uk-eu-relations-diplomacy-trump	2025-03-07T08:00:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13816260df258c8912e77529ffe9b48154e5091e/501_616_3819_2291/master/3819.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=977a9460e7a8055241762f28eb14c7ad

Another message followed on Telegram: -Can we look into this guy or would it raise too many questions?- And so a spy ring of Bulgarians based in Britain but working for Russia began to form. The author was Jan Marsalek, a fugitive businessman accused of involvement in a €1.9bn fraud on the German payments company Wirecard – and an agent for Russia. Earlier that year he had fled to Moscow, and now he had time on his hands. The message’s recipient was Orlin Roussev, 47, an IT specialist and private investigator who had been based in the UK for several years – and somebody Marsalek appeared to know well.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/07/spy-trial-scheming-bluster-tangled-relationships	2025-03-07T06:46:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3bbd920883c55d3ed7b988811234f4669f7a5cc/0_386_1686_1011/master/1686.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4b934d01c2f8c8fc8d0f827356a66af3

‘I’ve very felt lost and insecure’: TV producers despair as work dries up	People with decades of experience reveal how they have gone from stable careers to minimum-wage jobs The low point for Stef Loughrey, an established television edit and casting producer, came when she found herself sobbing in HMV’s Blu-ray section. A young, well-meaning colleague had pointed out she was the same age as their dad. It inadvertently brought home the sudden headwinds that had affected her career. Despite 17 years in the industry with steady demand for her skills, the 38-year-old said -things just totally disappeared- in the summer of 2023. She desperately tried to find employment, including asking to do TV jobs for a lower wage.

Trump layoffs have hollowed out key weather monitoring staff amid storm season	The National Weather Service has lost about 10% of its staff, hitting offices prone to severe weather hardest As deadly severe storms swept the US this week, recent Donald Trump administration staffing cuts have left key parts of weather monitoring and disaster preparedness systems severely understaffed, the Guardian has learned.

China vows action over ‘arbitrary’ tariffs as Trump pauses measures against Canada and Mexico – US politics live	Foreign minister calls measures ‘two-faced acts’ Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the coming hours. We start with news that the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said China will continue to retaliate against the United States’ -arbitrary tariffs- despite pausing similar action against Canada and Mexico. Trump told his cabinet secretaries that they are in charge of hiring and firings at their agencies, not Elon Musk. The House has voted to censure Democratic congressman Al Green for disrupting Trump’s address to this week’s joint session of Congress. The motion was approved with 224 votes in favor and 198 opposed, with 10 Democrats in support. In an escalation of his pressure campaign, Trump said the US will not fight for Nato allies who don’t spend enough on their own defense. US district judge Beryl Howell ruled on Thursday that Donald Trump’s firing of a Democratic member of the National Labor Relations Board was illegal and ordered that she be reinstated to her post. Axios reports that the state department is hunting for evidence that foreign students who express support for Palestinians under Israeli occupation while studying in the US are -pro-Hamas-, and can have their visas revoked, based on an AI review of their social media accounts. Trump thanked a reporter for the partisan outlet Breitbart for asking him a friendly question in the Oval Office, which teed him up to attack Democrats. The White House excluded non-partisan reporters from Reuters and the Associated Press to make room for Breitbart and One America News, two pro-Trump outlets. Trump signed an executive order on Thursday evening to establish a -strategic bitcoin reserve-, a day before meeting with executives from the cryptocurrency industry at the White House. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who reportedly endured a profanity-laced tirade from Trump, was asked about his foreign minister’s comment that dealing with the US was now -a psychodrama-. -How would you characterize it?- a reporter asked. -Thursday-, Trudeau replied.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/mar/07/donald-trump-tariffs-china-canada-mexico-us-politics-live-news	2025-03-07T02:57:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0de3ed9765049cf579b50c80481a6572917893d2/0_251_5719_3432/master/5719.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a32b249129293bd6db6db0d5df94fec9
Evidence of torture found as detention centre and mass grave discovered outside Khartoum	Exclusive: What appears to be a vast burial site found at former Rapid Support Forces base in Sudan, while rescued detainees speak of torture, starvation and deaths of fellow inmates More than 500 people may have been tortured or starved to death and then buried in a secret mass grave north of Khartoum, according to evidence seen by the Guardian. A visit to a base belonging to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) shortly after it was retaken by the Sudanese military found a previously unknown detention centre, with manacles hanging from doors, apparent punishment chambers and bloodstains on the floor.

His company – the producer of most of the world’s most advanced semiconductors – would boost its existing $65bn US presence by a whopping $100bn. For TSMC the deal meant they would avoid massive tariffs Trump had flagged for the global chip industry. For the US it mean tens of thousands of construction jobs, and the eventual development of crucial technology on US soil, far away from the threat of China taking control of it if it one day annexed Taiwan.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/07/taiwan-tsmc-deal-us-microchip-technology-investment	2025-03-06T22:45:35-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79567405abdf7999f5caf89915b83cff94730a6c/254_418_6468_3883/master/6468.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e77f17eee8f143039dfc2c24a6d083cb

Inside the Islamic State prisons the west is trying to forget – podcast	Michael Safi travelled to north-east Syria to speak to IS foreign fighters imprisoned there. And discovered that a change in the US administration, and USAid funding cuts, means there is a growing fear of prison breaks A few weeks ago, Michael Safi travelled to north-east Syria, an area controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. Here, suspected foreign fighters for Islamic State – including those from Britain – have for years been imprisoned without charge and with no idea of when they would be released. Few prisoners in the camp say they are IS members. Michael and fellow journalist, Will Christou, spoke to a former British surgeon from Leicester who told a surprising story of being ‘tricked’ into crossing into Syria from Turkey. They also met an Australian prisoner, who admitted to being an IS member, and whose family for years did not know his whereabouts.	https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/mar/07/inside-the-islamic-state-prisons-the-west-is-trying-to-forget-podcast	2025-03-06T19:00:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5db91da0e1ae59a151f1403ae387bb12d777e1a4/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=31c5d93a0e37f651a593d93fd0f18fc8

Elon Musk tells Republicans he isn’t to blame for mass firings of federal workers	Trump and Musk appear to make parallel efforts to distance tech billionaire from radical job slashing in government Elon Musk is telling Republican lawmakers in private meetings that he is not to blame for the mass firings of federal workers that are causing uproar across the country, while Donald Trump reportedly told his cabinet secretaries on Thursday that they are ultimately in charge of hiring and firings at their agencies – not billionaire aide Musk. The two powerful figures appeared to be making parallel efforts to distance Musk from radical job slashing made over the last two months. This despite the tech entrepreneur boasting about cuts, recommending the US -delete entire agencies- and taking questions on the issue alongside the US president, then wielding a chainsaw at an event to symbolize his efforts – all amid legal challenges and skepticism from experts.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/06/elon-musk-republicans-federal-workers-firings	2025-03-06T16:29:44-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/264cc5bb672eb2f89a059133c698bc81c09dd4c6/611_0_5401_3242/master/5401.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=592834ccf8864fb414a7eeb15e0eac56

Migrants and refugee families in the UK denied childcare funding, report finds	Immigration status is denying children equal access to early years education and pushing families ‘deeper into poverty’ Tens of thousands of children in migrant and refugee families in the UK are being denied access to government-funded childcare because of benefit restrictions linked to their parents’ immigration status, a report says.

First Thing: Trump says administration ‘just getting started’ in address to Congress	Democrats protested from the chamber as he thanked Elon Musk and spoke about upending US foreign policy. Plus, half of world’s CO2 emissions ‘come from 36 fossil fuel firms’ Good morning. Donald Trump used his lengthy address to Congress on Tuesday to declare that his administration was -just getting started-, hailing his purging of the federal workforce, upending of foreign policy and intensification of a risky trade war as the beginning of the -most thrilling days in the history- of the US. What else did the Democrats do? Some brought fired federal workers and Americans who rely on the social safety net programs Trump is threatening. The formal rebuttal, by the Michigan senator Elissa Slotkin, called on voters to actively hold politicians accountable. Did all the Democrats attend? No – several, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, skipped it in protest. Ocasio-Cortez instead live-posted on the social media platform BlueSky. What has Zelenskyy said about a deal? He suggested the -first stages- could include a release of prisoners and a ban on missiles and long-range drones used to attack energy and civilian infrastructure. A mutual truce in the sea could also be included.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/05/first-thing-trump-says-administration-just-getting-started-in-address-to-congress	2025-03-05T04:10:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be4d9d63e2e4a1284b070ccb84e5af39161b4b93/0_130_4229_2538/master/4229.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2d252ff99b17c798579276b603f6d098
Exposure to combination of pesticides increases childhood cancer risk – study	Study on cancer data in US agricultural heartland finds children more at risk than if exposed to just one pesticide Exposure to multiple pesticides significantly increases the risk of childhood cancers compared to exposures to just one pesticide, first-of-its-kind research finds, raising new fears that children are more at risk to the substances’ harmful effects than previously thought. The study’s authors say they are the first to look at the link between exposures to multiple widely used pesticides and the most common childhood cancers. Most research considers pesticides’ toxicity on an individual basis, and the substances are regulated as if exposures occur in isolation from one another.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/05/pesticides-childhood-cancer-study	2025-03-05T04:00:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2025da4a1fb4567abf3019d7eae425f9ee1b407/0_71_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8ff45be562b6c0c79a49e15fb0ba0b09
Tesla’s UK sales rise despite threat of backlash over Musk’s political role	Sales of battery-powered cars jumped in February, with Model 3 and Model Y most popular after Mini Cooper Sales of Teslas in the UK rose by more than a fifth last month as demand for battery-powered cars increased, despite the prospect of a buyer backlash over Elon Musk’s controversial and divisive behaviour since becoming a key figure in Donald Trump’s administration. Almost 4,000 Teslas were sold in the UK in February, with the Model 3 and Model Y proving the second and third most popular after the Mini Cooper, according to the latest new car registration figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/05/teslas-uk-sales-rise-despite-threat-of-backlash-over-elon-musk-political-role	2025-03-05T03:40:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f607edf58e4af0506227ea4e2f03d57120634a8/82_540_4946_2969/master/4946.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c4a7aa689ba1114982e57adf90f1aa4f
Key court hearing as Alabama threatens prosecutions over abortion support	Experts say victory for state could give green light for other states to attack those who help women travel for procedure A bellwether test of states’ ability to prosecute people over abortions that take place across state lines will hold a critical hearing on Wednesday, when Alabama abortion rights supporters will square off against the state attorney general over his threats to prosecute groups that help women travel for the procedure. In the months after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, clearing the way for Alabama to ban virtually all abortions, Alabama attorney general Steve Marshall repeatedly suggested that abortion rights activists who help people go out of state for abortions could be charged as participants in an illegal conspiracy. The Yellowhammer Fund, an abortion fund that helped people pay for the procedure, and the West Alabama Women’s Center, a former abortion clinic that pivoted to providing services like miscarriage management, joined with other abortion rights advocates to sue Marshall over his comments.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/05/alabama-court-hearing-abortion	2025-03-05T03:00:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dea029afeebd9d9beb743179befb1a8c9adc884/0_179_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d18df9255f0a2fda5fade74b04ce1aed
IRS workforce ‘could halve’ after Trump hails cuts to federal staffing in marathon Congress speech – US politics live	Federal agencies have until 13 March to formulate staff reduction plans as allies and critics react to Trump’s marathon Congress speech Welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of US politics and the Donald Trump administration. I’m Tom Ambrose. We start with news that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is considering reducing its workforce by as much as 50%, according to reports. The agency has already laid off about 7,000 of its 90,000 employees since Donald Trump came to power. Donald Trump on Tuesday declared that his administration was -just getting started- as Democratic lawmakers protested with placards that read -lies- and -false- during his a marathon address to Congress The president’s speech was littered with false claims he has previously been corrected on but continues to repeat – here are some of those -facts- checked He doubled down on his expansionist rhetoric, saying the administration was in the process of -reclaiming the Panama canal- and repeating his threat to take control of Greenland: -One way or the other, we’re going to get it-. The president has also recently stated that the US will -own- the Gaza Strip The dollar has fallen to the lowest level since November, after Trump said his new tariffs will cause -a little disturbance- in his Congress speech Responding to Trump’s speech, Sen Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said that Ronald Reagan -must be rolling in his grave- after last week’s Oval Office spat with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Trump -cozying up to dictators like Vladimir Putin-, and asserted that Trump would have -lost- the cold war Democratic Rep Al Green of Texas was ejected for an outburst during Trump’s speech. He later told the media -It’s worth it to let people know that there are some of us who are going to stand up against this president- The Trump administration has listed over 300 federal buildings for sale.

Minister says welfare budget ‘unsustainable’ amid reports Reeves has earmarked billions in cuts – UK politics live	Justice secretary said there is a ‘moral case’ for getting people into work when asked about the chancellor’s reported plans Good morning. Three weeks today Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, will present her spring statement. Originally this was not meant to involve budget-scale changes for plans to tax or spending (Reeves says she is only going to have one proper budget a year, in the autumn, to ensure stability), but changes to the country’s economic situation mean this statement is going to be more consequential than originally intended and this morning the BBC is running a story that looks like classic Treasury pitch rolling. The markets don’t like surprises and, while exact details of budget announcements are kept secret until the chancellor speaks to MPs, the Treasury invests a lot of effort in ensuring that people have a rough idea of what’s coming. According to a report by the BBC’s economics editor Faisal Islam, Reeves is going to announce cuts, worth several billions pounds, particularly affecting welfare. He says: The Treasury will put the proposed cuts to the government’s official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), on Wednesday amid expectations the chancellor’s financial buffer has been wiped out. Sources said -the world has changed- since Rachel Reeves’s Budget last October, when the OBR indicated she had £9.9bn available to spend against her self-imposed borrowing rules. Clearly the world has changed a lot since the autumn Budget. People are watching that change happen before their eyes. The Office for Budget Responsibility will reflect that changing world in its forecasts later this month and a changing world will be a core feature of the chancellor’s response later this month. This is the Labour party. The clue is in the name. We believe in work. We know that there are many people who are currently receiving state support for being out of work who want to be in work. We know that we have too many of our young people currently out of work, not in education, employment or training. It is right that a Labour government strains every sinew to make sure that the support is available to prevent people from leaving the labour market or, if they have left the labour market, to help them get back. We’ve seen a huge rise in that welfare budget. We know that there are millions of people who are out of work in our country who want to be in work. It is absolutely morally the right thing to do to support people, to make sure either they don’t leave the labour market, or if they have, they’re supported to get back into it.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/05/rachel-reeves-welfare-budget-spring-statement-pmqs-labour-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-news-uk-politics-live	2025-03-05T01:23:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ebe1389c6c5f4b6686a58a386eddef45b65dc9b/0_97_4127_2477/master/4127.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=890ae1635d150bf8d4ffe531dfe49d93

Wednesday briefing: The view from ​Russia as ​Trump upends the world order	In today’s newsletter: Pjotr Sauer explains Russia’s response to the new Trump administration following a fraught week in global relations Good morning. In his address to Congress last night, Donald Trump recited a letter from Volodymyr Zelenskyy offering to return to the negotiating table – and warmly welcomed the tone of discussions his administration has held with Russia. -We’ve received strong signals that they are ready for peace,- he said. -Wouldn’t that be beautiful?- That was not the first sign of Trump’s faith in Vladimir Putin’s promises – but it served to underline what is surely the most radical US foreign policy shift in a generation. Whether parroting Kremlin talking points on Zelenskyy’s democratic credentials, making false claims that Ukraine started the war or cutting off vital military aid to Kyiv, the US president has created a dynamic that would have scarcely been believable six months ago.

More than 170 mothers killed by their sons in 15 years in UK, report reveals	Number is nearly one in 10 of all women killed by men, leading to calls for government action to tackle matricide Nearly one in 10 of all women who died at the hands of men in the UK over the past 15 years were mothers killed by their sons, a report reveals. Data analysing the deaths of 2,000 women killed by men since 2009 has given an unprecedented insight into the hidden scourge of matricide, with more than 170 mothers killed by their sons. 61% of women were killed by a current or former partner, 9% of women were killed by their sons, 6% by other family members, 15% by other men they knew and 10% by someone they did not know. Of the 213 women killed by a close family member, 80% were mothers killed by sons. Nearly half of women were stabbed, 27% strangled and 17% hit with a blunt instrument. In 16% of cases, a man used kicking, hitting or stamping as the weapon. In almost a quarter of cases, more than one form of violence was used. Overkill – the use of excessive, gratuitous violence beyond that necessary to cause the victim’s death – happened in 59% of femicides. Leicestershire had the highest rate of femicide over the period, followed by Merseyside, the West Midlands, Greater Manchester and London. Killed women involved in prostitution were younger and less likely to have been born in the UK. Children witnessed at least 163 femicides, while 37 women were killed alongside 53 children, most commonly by their father.

‘A real injustice’: mothers killed by their children is still a hidden issue in UK	Research shows that mothers are seen as a ‘safe space’ for their offspring – nearly all of them sons – to use violence The thought of mothers being abused or killed by their own children – the people they have carried, cared for and nurtured since birth – is something of an underexamined and almost taboo issue in Britain. There is a slowly growing body of research into why children under 18 use violent behaviour towards their parents. There is an even smaller body of research showing why adults – nearly all of them sons – do the same.

Trump to address Congress as policy decisions divide nation – US politics live	President expected to ask for more money for immigration crackdown as Democrats invite fired federal workers to speech Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. My name is Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news over the next few hours. We start with news that president Donald Trump will stand before a joint session of Congress today to give an accounting of his turbulent first weeks in office as a divided nation struggles to keep pace. The Trump administration has suspended delivery of all US military aid to Ukraine, blocking billions in crucial shipments as the White House piles pressure on Ukraine to sue for peace with Vladimir Putin. The decision affects deliveries of ammunition, vehicles, and other equipment including shipments agreed to when Joe Biden was president. It comes after a dramatic blow-up in the White House on Friday during which Donald Trump told Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he was -gambling with- a third world war. The Ukrainian president was told to come back -when he is ready for peace-. US vice-president JD Vance said that the best way to protect Ukraine from another Russian invasion is to guarantee the US has a financial interest in Ukraine’s future. -If you want real security guarantees, if you want to actually ensure that Vladimir Putin does not invade Ukraine again, the very best security guarantee is to give Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine,- Vance said in the interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity which aired Monday night. China and Canada unveiled retaliatory measures against the US after Donald Trump imposed his sweeping tariffs plan at midnight US time, despite warnings it could spark an escalating trade war. US tariffs have come into force of 25% against goods from Canada and Mexico, the US’s two biggest trading partners, and 20% tariffs against China – doubling the levy on China from last month. The duties will affect more than $918bn-worth (£722bn) of US imports from Canada and Mexico. The US health department told employees on Monday they could apply for early retirement over the next 10 days and should respond to a request for information on their accomplishments of the past week, according to emails seen by Reuters. Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, who oversees the so-called -department of government efficiency-, are spearheading an unprecedented effort to shrink the federal bureaucracy, including through job cuts. The US Senate has confirmed Linda McMahon as the nation’s next education secretary, entrusting the former wrestling executive with a department marked for dismantling by Donald Trump. The 76-year-old billionaire businesswoman and longtime Trump ally was approved 51-45, reflecting deep divisions over her qualifications and the administration’s education agenda. McMahon, who previously led the small business administration during Trump’s first term, now faces the paradoxical task of running an agency while simultaneously working toward its potential elimination. Two alleged leaders of a criminal organization suspected of smuggling 20,000 people without permanent legal residency into the US from Guatemala have been arrested in Los Angeles, federal prosecutors said on Monday.

EU plan to bolster Europe’s defences could raise €800bn for Ukraine	‘We are ready to step up’ says Ursula von der Leyen after US suspends military aid to Ukraine A five-part plan to bolster Europe’s defence industry and increase its military capability could raise nearly €800bn and help provide urgent military support for Ukraine after the US suspended aid to Kyiv, the head of the European Commission has said.

Starmer won’t be derailed from Ukraine plan, Rayner says, amid claims Trump’s aid decision ‘humiliated’ PM – UK politics live	Few hours after Starmer’s statement to Commons on Monday, White House suspended all military aid to Ukraine Good morning. Yesterday Keir Starmer had a comfortable two hours in the Commons during which MPs from all sides praised him, lavishly and sincerely, for the leadership he has shown on Ukraine, trying to hold the US and Europe together, while mobilising European efforts to build up support for Ukraine. There were probably only two moments when Starmer lashed out; first at Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, whom he accused of fawning over Vladimir Putin; and then at Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminser, whom he accused of being a keyboard warrior (in response to a question from a Labour MP who was even more critical). The attack on Flynn came about half an hour after Flynn asked a perfectly reasonable question. Unfortunately, it has been reported this afternoon that President Trump is set to meet American aides to discuss withdrawing military aid to Ukraine. Are those reports something that the prime minister recognises, and, if so, what impact will that have on the timetable to which he and President Macron are currently working? I have not seen reports of the United States withdrawing support for Ukraine, and, as I understand it, that is not its position.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/04/keir-starmer-ukraine-plan-donald-trump-aid-labour-conservative-uk-politics-latest-news	2025-03-04T01:12:34-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2baf10edcd01a6346a3265d1a3647d31816d139e/0_259_7775_4665/master/7775.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=76b42ddc4272d30109c864d899ad9c19

Tuesday briefing: Where Gaza’s fragile ceasefire stands – and what it will take to move it forward	In today’s newsletter: With talks stalled, aid blocked and a truce in question, can the path to peace get back on track? Good morning. The first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza expired over the weekend – and now, the only thing stopping the resumption of Israel’s assault on the territory is the will of Benjamin Netanyahu. That is the bleak reality for the hostages still alive in Gaza, and the Palestinian civilians there who were subjected to a new aid embargo on Sunday. Last night, the Israeli government was reported to be planning to ratchet the blockade up further – with a programme of measures referred to as the -hell plan-. When the ceasefire was agreed in January, the theory was that the first phase would provide space for negotiations over a more durable truce. But those talks simply have not happened. Israel is pushing for the release of more hostages in an extension to the first phase – a step that Hamas, fearing the loss of its only source of leverage, refuses to countenance. Both sides are now making preparations for the resumption of violence.

Ministers plan major changes to Send education in England	White paper being prepared as councils hope for relief from huge deficits in special educational needs budgets Labour is preparing major changes to special educational needs provision in English schools, as individual councils raise the alarm over debts running into hundreds of millions of pounds that have pushed many to the brink of bankruptcy. A Guardian analysis has found the vast majority of English upper-tier councils have accumulated often eye-watering special educational needs spending deficits. At least 12 have forecast accumulated deficits of more than £100m, running as high as £312m, when the debts have to be settled in a year’s time. Some councils have raised concerns about profiteering amid frustration over huge fees from private specialist schools, which can charge between £50,000 and £100,000 per place, typically two to three times the cost of state provision. Tensions between headteachers and councils over attempts by the latter to shift millions of pounds from local school budgets to ease high needs deficits. Some schools have said such moves would force them to sack Send support staff. Attempts to rein in local Send demand and spending via -safety valve- initiatives at 42 councils have largely failed, with most failing to hit savings targets on time, despite receiving government grants running into tens of millions of pounds.	https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/mar/03/ministers-plan-major-changes-to-send-education-in-england	2025-03-03T06:32:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d28c9276148911acb41375e2c52fe95c27a6644e/0_197_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=151a5af5a31c6fbcbbeb51dd61556a05

Dan Patrick announced on Friday on social media that he intended to go to Texas’s senate and work with lawmakers to pass a resolution favoring the switch – which would not carry the force of law but nonetheless would amount to a substantial statement of legislative support.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/03/texas-new-york-strip-steak-dan-patrick	2025-03-03T03:00:02-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51d457140c01bd56f73c3d911ad51a1cb807e281/60_303_5771_3462/master/5771.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a6eb93e840c9bde37bdf50c2b9cacc73
Peter Mandelson’s Ukraine comments ‘not government policy’, minister says	Ambassador to US rebuffed for saying Zelenskyy should give ‘unequivocal backing’ to Trump’s peace efforts Peter Mandelson has been rebuffed for saying Volodymyr Zelenskyy should be more supportive of US peace efforts and that Ukraine should unilaterally call a ceasefire, with a UK defence minister saying this was -not government policy-.

Peter Mandelson criticised after saying Ukraine should give ‘unequivocal backing’ to Trump’s plan – UK politics live	Defence minister Luke Pollard tries to distance the government from the US ambassador’s comments to the media Good morning. Domestic politics has not gone away, but it is all being eclipsed at the moment by the Ukraine crisis, and the efforts Keir Starmer is leading to develop a Europe-led peace plan and – crucially – to keep the US and Europe at least broadly aligned. The stakes are enormous. Labour is very proud of the role the Attlee government played in creating Nato, but now its future as a funtioning alliance is in doubt. In his press conference yesterday Starmer said he did not accept the US is now an -unreliable ally-. But many Europeans who watched President Trump and JD Vance bully and belittle President Zelenskyy on camera in the Oval Office on Friday will have come to a different conclusion. Starmer is expected to make a statement to MPs about his visit to the White House, and yesterday’s summit in London, and that should start after 3.30pm. We need a very radical reset. The reset has to consist of the US and Ukraine getting back on the same page. And President Zelenskyy giving his unequivocal backing to the initiative that President Trump is taking to end the war and to bring a just and lasting peace to Ukraine. And the Europeans too need to back the calls for a ceasefire. And by the way, I think that Ukraine should be the first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow. The UK ambassador to Washington isn’t meant to communicate his own opinion, he is meant to communicate the UK government opinion. Lammy and Starmer need to grip this. What is Mandelson up to? You cannot square what the Prime Minister said this morning with this. What is the Government’s actual position? Our man in DC should be securing US protection for our brave Ukrainian allies, not telling President Zelensky what to do. No. It’s certainly right that Ukrainians want peace. I think of all the people on our continent that want peace, the Ukrainians want it the most. But we’re still in discussions, diplomatic engagement with our European, US and Ukrainian friends as to the shape of that deal. That’s not government policy and you wouldn’t expect me to commentate on every ups and downs in negotiations.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/03/peter-mandelson-ukraine-donald-trump-volodymyr-zelenskyy-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live	2025-03-03T01:12:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72e7098aa494ad66591abd150135b84a45ca41db/0_199_7599_4559/master/7599.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4fd849e23e71bb7de435a6bf864240b9

Middle East crisis live: Israel accused of using ‘food as weapon of war’ in aid blockade on Gaza	Egypt and Qatar condemn Israel’s decision to block goods and supplies from entering Gaza, saying it violates the ceasefire deal Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in the Middle East as Israel is widely condemned for blocking the entry of all humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said yesterday that it was imposing a blockade on Gaza because Hamas would not accept a plan which it claimed had been put forward by the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to extend phase one of the ceasefire and continue to release hostages, and postpone phase two, which should, in theory, see Israel completely withdraw its forces from Gaza, in effect ending the war.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/mar/03/middle-east-crisis-live-news-israel-criticised-aid-blockade-gaza	2025-03-03T00:54:47-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08c61561998bc2262ffdebb2d82718d209d0a54d/0_169_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ab7b2d3412798fdb23079a2c1aed635c

Monday briefing: UK and Europe pick up the pieces after White House car crash	In today’s newsletter: After Friday’s clash meeting in the Oval Office between Trump and Zelenskyy, Keir Starmer and his European allies will try to broker the peace Ukraine desperately needs Good morning. After the shocking treatment he received at the White House on Friday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy was on friendlier turf yesterday – but whether a bear hug from Keir Starmer and an audience with King Charles will ultimately prove consequential for the war in Ukraine is still anyone’s guess. The Ukrainian president was in the UK to attend a European summit, convened by Starmer, to take steps towards new proposals that might be able to find support in Kyiv and Washington alike. And while there were some signs of European unity, the White House and its surrogates were still suggesting that Zelenskyy was guilty of some sort of insult to the United States that might be enough to make a durable peace impossible. Last night, Zelenskyy refused to say whether he believed he had been ambushed – but said that he was ready to talk to Trump again.

Amid brutal foreign wars and democracy under siege, the Oscars were silent on Trump	No one uttered the US president’s name, and speeches bore few references to Gaza or Ukraine, focusing on the LA fires The 97th Academy Awards had one of the longest run times for the annual show in recent history, yet the least mentions of the current political climate – with not a single person uttering the name -Donald Trump-. While few people watch awards shows – least of all the Oscars – for political discussion, comments on world events have long been an expected part of the broadcasts. Trump himself has even weighed in on a show – at least once while it aired: last year, while campaigning for re-election, he posted on Truth Social and asked rhetorically whether there was ever a -worse host- than Jimmy Kimmel at the 2024 Oscars and criticized his opening monologue.

The UK has one of the stingiest rates of statutory sick pay in the developed world, according to the Resolution Foundation, with those earning less than £123 a week not entitled to anything.

I’m Still Here wins Oscar for best international film, becoming first Brazilian film to do so	Brazil’s official entry beats beleaguered French favourite Emilia Pérez to the podium I’m Still Here has won the Oscar for best international film at the Academy Awards, which are currently taking place in Los Angeles. It is the first Brazilian film to win the award – and was also the first to be nominated.

Orbán problem pushes EU towards ‘coalitions of the willing’ on Ukraine	As crisis talks loom, Trump and the bloc’s own populist spoilers have driven it away from its old quest for unanimity A fortnight after Vladimir Putin sent his troops to attack Ukraine, the 27 leaders of the EU gathered at the palace of Versailles and condemned Russia’s invasion, pledged support to the people of Ukraine – -we will not leave them alone- – and vowed to -take more responsibility for our security-. Three years later, EU leaders are under pressure like never before to live up to those promises. After a summit hosted by Keir Starmer on Sunday, the EU27 leaders will gather in Brussels on Thursday for crisis talks. But trouble is ahead: Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán has called on the EU to follow Trump’s example and open direct talks with the Russian president.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/02/orban-problem-pushes-eu-towards-coalitions-of-the-willing-on-ukraine-russia	2025-03-02T07:40:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09a06f18614cd8e87bcc7003545e0a4b40455005/0_358_6706_4026/master/6706.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0d54d08717b7e64b84b04b7a5934c273

‘Trump doesn’t understand who the aggressor is’: fatigue and anger in Odesa	Russian attacks on Ukrainian city that was initially spared worst have increased since Washington-Moscow detente Olena Palash heard a loud buzzing above her flat in the Ukrainian port of Odesa. It was 11pm. First one drone, and another, then more. Soon afterwards, one of the Shaheeds crashed into the children’s clinic where she works. An explosion shredded the building’s facade. The metal covering of a car park was remade into a spaghetti-like jumble. Another drone smashed into a nearby kindergarten. The attack on 18 February knocked out a substation and plunged some of the city into darkness. Four people were injured, including a 10-year-old girl, and 80,000 were left without heat. Russia’s air war in the skies above Ukraine is nothing new. But since negotiations began between the US and Russia – talks from which Kyiv has been excluded – the raids have got dramatically worse.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/02/odesa-ukraine-russian-airstrikes-donald-trump-vladimir-putin	2025-03-02T06:21:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6e5c37bb79601e6ab9d63b8ff1c810d67c662bb/0_338_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b8afdee24715889552f851048c8585a1

Revealed: New Orleans touted public safety street closures for years but didn’t implement them	A Guardian analysis shows that vehicles were allowed to approach Bourbon Street despite safety plans in years leading up to deadly attack Local government officials in New Orleans, which endured an intentional, deadly truck ramming attack on its most famous street during New Year’s Day celebrations, have not shut down vehicular cross traffic on that street during major events nearly 90 times – evidently failing to fully enact public safety plans that they touted ahead of the gatherings, a Guardian investigation has confirmed. In many cases, cars and other vehicles were allowed to cross the street for the entire period that the city’s press releases said they would be forbidden from doing so. And during all but a handful of days, officials failed to place any physical barriers that would prevent motorists intending to attack crowds there from turning in either direction on to Bourbon Street, a one-way thoroughfare, leaving pedestrians vulnerable to terrorists for many years.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/02/new-orleans-public-safety-measures	2025-03-02T05:00:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69176fc58661a34123b7e128d00572f9aebb575f/0_18_1137_682/master/1137.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a7b52c03ff97e472666d89c8614f829f

The high-stakes White House showdown that unfolded on Friday after the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, demanded US security guarantees was deemed a damaging setback to Donald Trump’s goal of forging a peace deal – and a win for Russian dictator Vladimir Putin – by some US political commentators.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/01/media-politicians-react-trump-zelenskyy	2025-03-01T08:49:48-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db31fbe9eff75261aa90cb2693eb6d292994164d/0_210_6299_3781/master/6299.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ba03634a59d8849a9039d5ba4bfbf03
How do we make Europe more secure? Here are five steps we need to take now	Europe can’t wait to react to Trump’s mood swings but must show we have the will and the wallet to take back control • Ukraine war live It’s exhausting and humiliating to have no control – watching every meeting in the Oval Office for a glimmer of Trump’s approval or displeasure, our security resting on a perceived slight or a mood. The last week of meetings between Trump, Macron, Starmer and finally Zelenskyy always felt like crawling across a minefield. Some might agonise about whether Zelenskyy could have played things differently. It’s the wrong question. The point is that we can’t carry on being so dependent on every meeting at the White House. Until we start taking charge of our future, we will always be one heart palpitation away from dreading doomsday.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/01/how-do-we-make-europe-more-secure-here-are-five-steps-we-need-to-take-now	2025-03-01T08:29:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fd49d68fcd62ac5deadad0b8b10a29a10687172/0_185_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7f4eebbcdbe5924b221a34f3c82754d3
Email shows that Musk ally is moving to close free tax filing program at IRS	Program is apparently being closed according to email from former Tesla engineer installed in GSA An Elon Musk ally installed in the US government said in a late night email going into Saturday that the office behind a popular free online tax filing option would be shuttered – and its employees would be let go. The 18F office within the General Services Administration (GSA) created the IRS Direct File program that allows for free online tax filings. It has been a frequent target of Musk, and one of the billionaire businessman’s close associates who holds a key position in the GSA informed staffers that the agency would close 18F in an email to staffers that arrived around 1am on Saturday morning.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/01/musk-close-irs-free-filing-system	2025-03-01T08:25:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6adffef6fd9e9b7e689db431008ce533676574/0_254_4450_2670/master/4450.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1d2dc99d66d4cf72b687c5105d489ebd
‘It’s packed with dealers.

Holidays at a one-time Communist luxury beach haven? Yugoslav resort built for Tito to rise from ruins	Revolutionary leader’s derelict Adriatic getaway is on verge of a new life after starring in Kate Winslet film and hit Mr Beast YouTube video With its spectacular views over the Adriatic and a half-moon beach, Kupari, near Dubrovnik, was regarded as the Monaco of what was once called the Yugoslav Riviera. In the 1960s, the country’s Communist leader, Josip -Tito- Broz, ordered the building of a vast holiday complex exclusively reserved for members of the military on this hilly stretch of the Dalmatian coast. For the top brass there were individual villas; for the lower ranks, a choice of six hotels, while the foot soldiers were relegated to a camping site surrounded by palm trees and lush greenery.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/01/communist-tito-yugoslav-adriatic-luxury-beach-resort	2025-03-01T07:00:43-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5379ded8f8b80c844dcd89b2fe14d33442df3c3f/49_27_735_441/master/735.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c35c403b2cd0e8a0e8146677de00176c
Plane crashes have people freaked out – but here’s what US data for 2025 shows	This year’s 16 fatal accidents fall below average rate of 20 per month, yet recent crashes were US’s deadliest in a decade People across the US are worried about flight safety after several high-profile plane crashes this year, including a commercial crash in Washington DC that killed 67 people. Google searches for -is flying safe- have jumped in recent weeks. But the numbers suggest 2025 has actually been a relatively safe year to fly – at least in terms of the overall number of accidents. January and February typically have about 20 fatal aviation accidents per month, according to numbers from the National Transportation Safety Board. By contrast, this January, there were only 10 fatal aviation accidents, and in February there were six.

Ageing nuclear plant in Florida at risk from climate crisis, advocates warn	Regulators extended the life of two of the oldest US reactors in Miami. Millions of people in the area are now vulnerable A decision by regulators to extend the life of two of the oldest reactors in the US decades beyond their original permits has elevated the risk of a nuclear disaster in heavily populated south Florida, environmental groups are warning. The Miami Waterkeeper says the ageing Turkey Point facility in south Miami-Dade county, which was built in 1967 and generates power for a metropolitan area covering about 3 million people, is especially vulnerable to flooding and excessive heat from the climate emergency, in part because of its low-lying position and coastal exposure to a major hurricane.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/01/nuclear-power-plants-miami-florida	2025-03-01T06:00:43-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eae5876a73085e00fe6a76f728f54c1dd191dbd3/0_237_4688_2814/master/4688.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cc4394d0f7590b8820c9a16de11262a9

Starmer may have weaponised the Windsors, but soft power is the royals’ great asset	Just as in the Oval Office this week, history shows the royals can be deployed to serve British interests – whether they like it or not As Donald Trump waved his personal invitation from King Charles III to pay a second historic state visit in the Oval Office, there was no disguising his delight before the TV cameras.

Live: European leaders rally behind Zelenskyy after stunning Trump clash – updates	European leaders voice support for Ukrainian leader as US support for Kyiv hangs in the balance following disastrous meeting Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine, hours after an unprecedented showdown between US president Donald Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. European leaders have voiced their solidarity with Ukraine in the wake of the disastrous summit, in which Trump said the Ukrainian leader was not -ready for peace- and accused him of -gambling with world war three-. European leaders have rallied behind Zelenskyy after the unprecedented exchange. The heads of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the European Council, Antonio Costa, were among the leaders who assured Zelenskyy of Europe’s support. -Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader,- said the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas. German chancellor Olaf Scholz said: -Ukraine can rely on Germany – and on Europe.- French president Emmanuel Macron said: -Russia is the aggressor and Ukraine is the aggressed people.- A spokesperson for UK prime minister Keir Starmer said: -He retains his unwavering support for Ukraine.- Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán stood out in Europe for thanking Trump for having -stood bravely for peace-. Moscow, meanwhile, reacted with glee to the Trump-Zelenskyy clash, with former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev – now deputy head of Russia’s security council – saying on Telegram: -A brutal dressing down in the Oval Office.- In an interview with Fox news, Zelenskyy expressed regret that the Trump meeting became acrimonious but insisted their relationship could be salvaged. The Ukrainian leader defended himself, but also acknowledged the dispute was -not good for both sides-. Asked if he felt he owed the US president an apology, as many of Trump’s Republican allies have demanded, Zelenskyy did not directly answer, saying instead: -I think that we have to be very open and very honest. And I’m not sure that we did something bad.- US secretary of state Marco Rubio called on Zelenskyy to apologise after the disastrous exchange, while questioning whether the Ukrainian leader really wanted a peace deal. Zelenskyy should -apologise for turning this thing into the fiasco for him that it became-, Rubio told CNN. -There was no need for him to go in there and become antagonistic.- The Trump administration is considering ending all ongoing shipments of military aid to Ukraine after the Oval Office meeting, according to a report. The decision, if taken, would apply to billions of dollars of radars, vehicles, ammunition and missiles awaiting shipment to Ukraine through the presidential drawdown authority, the Washington Post reports, citing a senior US official. US Democratic lawmakers came to Zelenskyy’s defence, condemning Trump and Vance’s -shameful- and -disgraceful- treatment of the Ukrainian leader. But Trump’s Republican colleagues described the Oval Office exchange as evidence that the president was -putting America first-. US senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, who was once among the most outspoken advocates for supporting the Ukraine war effort, called on Zelenskyy to resign. A Russian drone strike on a medical facility and other targets in Kharkiv late on Friday injured at least five people, according to local officials. Regional governor Oleh Syniehubov said eight drones hit civilian areas in three central districts of Ukraine’s second largest city. More than 50 people were evacuated from the medical facility and emergency crews were bringing a fire triggered by the strike under control, he said. Dozens of buildings were damaged.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/mar/01/live-european-leaders-rally-behind-zelenskyy-after-trump-vance-clash-updates	2025-02-28T22:53:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/762c41c53d0bef46ae2f32744fbe359f74be911e/0_206_7451_4473/master/7451.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=55082309b73a0b76e0c6bb09d8cdf42a

Gunshots and a surge of panic: footage shows last moments of boy, 12, killed in the West Bank	Two children a week are killed in the West Bank. Two cameras recorded the circumstances of one such death The last time Nassar al-Hammouni talked to his son, Ayman, it was by telephone and the 12-year-old was overflowing with plans for the coming weekend, and for the rest of his life. He had joined a local football team and planned to register at a karate club that weekend. When he grew up, he told Nassar, he was going to become a doctor, or better still an engineer to help his father in the construction job that took him away from their home in Hebron every week. None of that – the football, the karate or his imagined future career – will happen now. Last Friday, two days after the call to his father, Ayman was killed, shot by Israeli fire, video footage seen by the Guardian suggests.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/01/footage-shows-last-moments-boy-12-killed-in-west-bank	2025-02-28T21:00:29-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be4cd3e63a8d4a045624574ea5a7198477afabff/0_82_665_399/master/665.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bcf395f4496782a22e1075f8e4d9e90a

Sex 20 times a week? New study identifies four types of romantic lover	Australian research is ‘first to empirically show that we don’t all love the same’, lead author says New research has identified four types of romantic lover, including one that has sex up to 20 times a week. The research, published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences, categorised lovers as mild romantic, moderate romantic, intense romantic, and libidinous romantic. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Mild: About one in five – 20.02% – fell into this cluster, characterised by -the lowest intensity, lowest obsessive thinking, lowest commitment, and lowest frequency of sex-. This group also had the lowest proportion of people who thought their partner was -definitely- in love with them – just 25.31% – and the lowest proportion having sex, at 82.72%. Moderate: About four in 10 – 40.91% – landed in this category, which Bode described as -fairly stock-standard- – or in the words of the journal article, -entirely unremarkable-. Those in this category were more likely to be male, and less likely to have children. This group had -relatively low intensity, relatively low obsessive thinking, relatively high commitment, and relatively moderate frequency of sex-. Intense: This category described about one in three – 29.42% – of survey respondents, who Bode described as -crazy in-love- types. They were characterised by -the highest intensity, highest obsessive thinking, highest commitment, and relatively high frequency of sex-. About six in 10 people in this group were female. Libidinous: About one in 10 – 9.64% – were libidinous romantic lovers, who had sex an average of 10 times a week and up to 20 times. They were characterised as -relatively high intensity, relatively high obsessive thinking, relatively high commitment, and exceptionally high frequency of sex-. This group were slightly more likely to be male, and had the highest proportion of people in a committed relationship but not living together.	https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/mar/01/sex-20-times-a-week-new-study-identifies-four-types-of-romantic-lover	2025-02-28T15:00:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20fb8153df8ca00ed2e36a7cdddffd51df435e85/0_88_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cf4f5d5ca251ed73021c1687e145b9dc

‘Back injuries’ and ‘a tripping hazard’: New Orleans officials still resisting anti-ramming barriers after deadly vehicle attack	Unearthed emails detail concerns about injuries and work duties in utilizing devices that might have prevented New Year’s terrorist attack At least some public safety officials in New Orleans evidently remain skeptical of easily deployable, 700lb steel barriers designed to prevent intentional vehicle ramming attacks – even after one carried out on the city’s most famous street on New Year’s Day killed 14 people and injured 67 others, according to a trove of government emails obtained by the Guardian. Received through a public records request, the emails detail how the inventor of so-called Archer barriers – which the city had bought but kept in storage on the day of the deadly Bourbon Street attack – encountered a measure of resistance when he traveled to New Orleans with his company of his own volition to train local authorities on how to expeditiously deploy the barricades.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/new-orleans-officials-truck-attack-vehicle-barriers	2025-02-28T05:00:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c13beb61ea8e90afe3d6d44a15b8e3ad33a85045/0_708_2114_1268/master/2114.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cf54b89bbfbdd0e4175b3333ab8c5465

Keir Starmer is back in the UK and, in the unlikely event that he goes into a newsagent’s this morning, he will find that his meeting with President Trump in the White House has secured him perhaps the most favourable press coverage he has had since the general election. Gloria De Piero, the broadcaster and former Labour MP, has the headlines laid out here. Of course, the success of a government should never be judged by what the national newspapers are saying about it (few other performance indicators are less reliable), but after months of relentlessly critical press coverage, Starmer will be grateful for a spot of respite. I thought that the meeting yesterday was a spectacular success both on the defence and security issues that President Trump and our prime minister were discussing but also on the enthusiasm President Trump showed for a deeper trading relationship.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/28/keir-starmer-donald-trump-kemi-badenoch-uk-politics-live	2025-02-28T01:49:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6536a516c3053353997f79a2f9eadd014807f664/759_293_6719_4032/master/6719.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=414dd813a7351c654a59ba7a575e9721

Zelenskyy expected to sign minerals deal with US during Trump talks – Europe live	Key details of agreement yet to be made public but US president has resisted agreeing to provide security guarantees If you want to catch up on the key developments from last night’s meeting between Trump and Starmer, our global affairs correspondent Andrew Roth has this helpful summary for you. Keir Starmer’s meeting with Donald Trump this week comes at a crucial moment for the war in Ukraine and the future of the Nato alliance. Europe is looking for leaders who can engage Trump on the future of the continent as the US leader appears more inclined to demand tribute from his allies and cosy up to Vladimir Putin. Can the -special relationship- between the US and the UK save the day? Or has the era of transatlantic cooperation ended in the era of -America first-? Starmer has already established a friendly rapport with Trump and comes bearing promises to raise defense spending and negotiate on trade, but can that overcome Trump’s impulse to abandon Europe and strike a deal with Russia to end the war as quickly as possible?	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/28/volodymyr-zelenskyy-donald-trump-us-minerals-deal-russia-ukraine-live-news	2025-02-28T00:15:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0aced75232507ee480b215c2d092c4001591fe3/0_149_4418_2651/master/4418.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d4f67004122736f48a426912ad508d5f

Donald Trump’s body language uncovered: ‘If you’re the silverback, you stand proud’	The recent ‘hand jiu-jitsu’ with Keir Starmer is just the latest awkward exchange between the US president and world leaders As Keir Starmer handed Donald Trump his unprecedented invitation from King Charles – a second state visit – he grasped the US president chummily by the shoulder, more than once. Starmer was skating a tricky line, between matey familiarity and patronising reassurance, which must have been tutored, as he’s not a tactile man.

The man has always been incredibly idiosyncratic.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/donald-trump-body-language-keir-starmer-us-president	2025-02-27T23:59:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37ae9911cdfe17007e9cfd776e9e2e5a7bd0b3e4/0_576_8640_5184/master/8640.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=69e09f86aa5ce2f7d411dc26a726a85b

The Australian Security Leaders Climate Group, a group of former defence leaders, has warned that the plan to build seven small nuclear reactors across five states on the sites of coal-fired stations could leave Australia vulnerable to missile warfare and sabotage. Every nuclear power facility is a potential dirty bomb because rupture of containment facilities can cause devastating damage. With the proposed power stations all located within a 100 kilometres of the coast, they are a clear and accessible target.

Gene Hackman and wife’s deaths ‘suspicious enough’ for investigation, warrant says	Warrant raises questions about scattered pills, after Betsy Arakawa’s body had ‘mummification in hands’ An active investigation is underway into the deaths of the Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife, classical pianist Betsy Arakawa, after their bodies were found -in a state of decomposition- along with that of one of their dogs in their home in New Mexico, the local sheriff’s department has confirmed. The local gas provider, the New Mexico Gas Co, was involved in the investigation alongside the Santa Fe county sheriff’s department, Associated Press reported, raising speculation that carbon monoxide poisoning lay behind the deaths.

Elon Musk’s conflicts of interest ‘should scare every American’, experts say	Doge’s work allows Musk to keep control of companies with billions in federal contracts as he guts government agencies As Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk work zealously to slash tens of billions in federal spending by axing thousands of jobs and gutting some government agencies, Musk faces mounting claims he has conflicts of interest and no oversight, legal and ethics experts say. Trump’s largest campaign donor and the world’s wealthiest man, Musk was tapped by the president to lead the so-called -department of government efficiency- (Doge) in a radical and opaque cost-cutting drive that allows him to keep control of SpaceX, Tesla and other huge companies with billions of dollars in federal contracts.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/27/elon-musk-conflicts-of-interest	2025-02-27T04:00:44-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bff954463075ad6ec8a5abf100740b7f1426f1df/0_0_5585_3353/master/5585.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ab1493f467c078ae952f8bbdc85c71e7

Supreme court backs Trump over holding back $1.5bn in USAid cash – US politics live	Stay of lower court ruling comes as Trump administration said it is eliminating $60bn worth of US assistance around the world The US supreme court has backed the Trump administration in an action over payments due by the US Agency for International Development (USAid), with chief justice John Roberts issuing an -administrative stay- that means the $1.5bn worth of payments can still be delayed. Donald Trump had ordered the payments to be stopped, but a federal judge had set a deadline for the agencies to release funds for work already carried out. Roberts responded to an emergency appeal by the administration by allowing the payments freeze to continue. Thousands of US Agency for International Development (USAid) workers who have been fired or placed on leave as part of the Trump administration’s dismantling of the agency are being given a brief window Thursday and Friday to clear out their workspaces. The Trump administration said it is eliminating more than 90% of USAid contracts and $60bn in overall US assistance around the world. The supreme court hasbriefly paused a lower court’s ruling ordering the administration to pay for $1.5bn of work already carried out. Trump used the first full cabinet meeting of his second term to emphasize his administration’s focus on drastically reducing the size of the federal government, and signed an executive order expanding the power of Elon Musk’s Doge -agency-.

Trump says US will make Europe provide security guarantees to Ukraine ahead of Starmer meeting – UK politics live	Starmer said he wants Trump to agree that, in the event of a peace settlement in Ukraine, US will offer security guarantees that make it durable Good morning. Keir Starmer is in Washington where later today he will have his first meeting with President Trump since the inauguration. With Trump aligning with Moscow even more explicitly than he did during his first administration, and threatening to wind down the Nato guarantees that have underpinned the security of western Europe since the second world war, the stakes could not be higher. Starmer, despite leading a party whose activists mostly loathe Trump and everything he represents, has managed to establish a warm relationship with the president and today will give some clues as to what extent he can sustain that, and protect the UK from the tariff warfare that Trump is threatening to unleash on the EU. But Starmer is one of three European leaders in Washington this week (Emmanuel Macron was there on Monday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy is there tomorrow) and today’s meeting is also part of a wider story about the fracturing of the US/Europe alliance. It is definitely in trouble; but what is not yet clear is whether after four years of Trump it will still be functioning effectively. Starmer spoke to reporters on his flight to the US yesterday. Pippa Crerar, the Guardian’s political editor, was on the plane and, as she reports, Starmer said he wants Trump to agree that, in the event of a peace settlement in Ukraine, the US will offer security guarantees that will make it durable. He has already said that Britain would contribute troops to a European so-called -tripwire- peace-keeping force, there to defend Ukraine and deter Russia. But European soldiers would need US air and logistical support to be effective, and Starmer is looking for assurances on this topic. I’m not going to make security guarantees beyond very much. We’re going to have Europe do that.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/27/keir-starmer-donald-trump-white-house-ukraine-uk-politics-live-news	2025-02-27T01:32:49-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9afac33b0bc37a566d1bb18e5f06d497272eb4e/0_0_7986_4794/master/7986.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5fd10bd2c1efdfeef47e91e256566424

Trump executive order targets payments and travel after reporters barred from cabinet meeting – as it happened	This blog is now closed. You can read our latest story here There has been reaction to Trump’s proposal for a -gold card- for wealthy foreigners (post 11.14am) which would give them the right to live and work in the US as well as a route to citizenship in exchange for a $5million fee. Immigration and wealth advisers have said the proposed initiative is unlikely to trigger a major inflow of wealthy global investors seeking US citizenship because of concerns over higher taxes, Reuters reports. I do not believe that the current POTUS offer will have a big impact, as getting a green card in the US if you meet certain criteria, is not difficult. Paying $5 million for a golden visa and getting taxed on your global income defeats the purpose.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/feb/26/donald-trump-mike-johnson-republicans-democrats-spending-bill-elon-musk-doge-us-politics-news-live	2025-02-26T18:49:02-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a3ab29d4f9c03b91e9f47711b52e0cef7e6520e/82_0_5147_3088/master/5147.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f57f80b5d580131582f75b9c67e97050

Donald Trump has said that Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit the White House on Friday to sign a rare earth minerals deal to pay for US military aid to defend against Russia’s full-scale invasion. What’s not in the deal? The deal is more favourable to Ukraine than the original one proposed by Washington. According to the Financial Times, which first reported the deal, the new terms do not include the onerous demands for a right to $500bn in potential revenue from exploiting the resources, which include rare earth metals and Ukrainian oil and gas resources. It also does not include references to long-term security guarantees that Kyiv wanted to receive. Where are they looking, and for how long?

David Lammy says key projects in Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan to be protected as aid spending slashed – UK politics live	The foreign secretary described the decision to cut development aid to fund defence as ‘extremely difficult’ Good morning. At Westminster MPs are still absorbing the implications of Keir Starmer’s decision to slash the aid budget to fund an increase in defence spending. Pippa Crerar and Kiran Stacey have all the details in their overnight story. John Healey, the defence secretary, has been giving interviews this morning and he has faced a lot of questions about whether this announcement was entirely about pleasing Donald Trump. -No, it’s not,- he told Sky News. Healey pointed out that raising defence spending by 2.5% of GDP was a Labour manifesto commitment. (That’s true, but the manifesto did not say it would happen by 2027 – or that aid spending would be cut to fund it.) But Healey did not try to pretend that the timing of the announcement was unrelated to the fact that Starmer has his first meeting with Trump since the inauguration in the White House tomorrow. -President Trump, over the last two weeks, has been very direct in his challenge,- Healey said. This is unfortunate. Lammy self evidently not been able to protect the foreign office budget since only weeks ago urged the US not to cut its aid budget saying it would be a big strategic mistake. By cutting to 0.3% of GDP, the UK, once an aid superpower, joins Italy in the G7 in being one of the least generous of industrialised countries. Fear of Reform, and Trump, drives No 10’s and Treasury choices. To make this [higher defence spending] commitment, and stick within our fiscal rules, we have had to make the extremely difficult decision to lower our spending on international development. As the prime minister said, we do not pretend any of this is easy. This is a hard choice that no government – let alone a Labour government – makes lightly. I am proud of our record on international development. It helps address global challenges from health to migration, contributes to prosperity, and supports the world’s most vulnerable people. It grows both our soft power and our geopolitical clout, while improving lives. For all of those reasons, this government remains committed to reverting spending on overseas aid to 0.7% of gross national income when the fiscal conditions allow. But we are a government of pragmatists not ideologues – and we have had to balance the compassion of our internationalism with the necessity of our national security.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/26/david-lammy-john-healey-defence-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-pmqs-uk-politics-live-news-updates	2025-02-26T01:43:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9939ea8186417797ea2424fc2d22e4faa538800/127_90_2298_1378/master/2298.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6f8cc176bd6c6c7d55ff4232f2fea3b0

Wednesday briefing: Why Keir Starmer cut foreign aid to pay for defence – and who loses out	In today’s newsletter: The prime minister announced a significant increase in defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, funded entirely by a cut in the aid budget Good morning. On Tuesday, Keir Starmer confirmed that the government will increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, with plans to raise it further to 3% during the next parliament. The announcement marks the biggest increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war, but the even bigger surprise came with the announcement that the additional funding would come directly from the overseas aid budget, which will fall from 0.5% to 0.3% of GDP – a cut of around £6bn. Ukraine | Donald Trump has said that Volodymyr Zelenskyy is likely to visit the White House on Friday to sign a rare earth minerals deal worth $500bn to pay for US military aid. Gaza | Israel is seeking to extend the first stage of the ceasefire agreement in the war with Hamas in Gaza and is prepared to resume fighting if there is no progress in crucial talks this week, according to reports. Health | Wes Streeting will axe thousands of jobs at NHS England after his ousting of its chair and chief executive in what health service staff fear is a power grab. The health secretary’s plan follows Amanda Pritchard’s shock announcement on Monday that she was stepping down as the organisation’s chief executive next month. She will be replaced, for the foreseeable future, by Sir Jim Mackey. Education | British universities have been warned to -stress-test- all assessments after new research revealed -almost all- undergraduates are using generative artificial intelligence in their studies. A survey of 1,000 students – both domestic and international – found there had been an -explosive increase- in the use of genAI in the past 12 months. 88% said they used tools such as ChatGPT for their assessments, up from 53% last year. BBC | The BBC has admitted that it -fell short and failed people- by not dealing with -bullying and misogynistic- behaviour by its former Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood. A major external inquiry found it -missed opportunities- that could have led to action. The inquiry was triggered by a 2022 Guardian-BBC News joint investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct and predatory behaviour by the DJ.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/26/first-edition-keir-starmer-defence-spending	2025-02-25T22:44:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c77b18fb45d845cd5fad233dbb42d30a6196bce5/0_137_5830_3498/master/5830.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b1284a555883bdd905773a05d76eb2bf
Dutton defends ‘astute’ share purchases and late property disclosures as Labor demands details	Opposition leader says he made required disclosures to parliamentary register and defends lucrative property and share investments Peter Dutton has refused to reveal details about bank shares he bought at the height of the global financial crisis in the days before a bank bailout, defending his lucrative property investment history and stock market decisions as Labor tries to discredit him as out of touch with ordinary Australians.

Tim Westwood inquiry report: what new allegations against him have emerged?	The document contains a series of previously unpublished claims, including 22 from members of the public The independent inquiry into what the BBC knew about the former Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood’s conduct has been published almost three years after a joint investigation by the Guardian and BBC News. The investigation told the stories of a number of women who accused the 67-year-old of sexual misconduct and predatory behaviour. -Hounded- a 17-year-old Black woman with phone calls and texts. Invited a girl who was 15 or 16 back to his home following an under-16 night, after she had added him on Blackberry to get information about the event. Contacted a woman who had shared her business card, and appeared agitated when she did not want to meet late at night. -Hurled- a can of drink at a woman who was serving in a club. A former BBC staff member told the corporation their son had witnessed Westwood propositioning a 15-year-old girl in a night club in around 2007. The BBC reported the complaint to the Metropolitan police, who took no action. A BBC employee said in 2022 that a guest on Radio 1 had described potential sexual assault by Westwood between 2004 and 2007. They said they had reported it to a more senior employee, but White found no evidence the complaint had been documented. Westwood’s lawyers said he was never spoken to about the incident. A student told the review about Westwood referring to her breasts during a 1Xtra DriveTime show in 2010, calling her her -cuddly- and miming grabbing her breasts, which his lawyers say he strongly denies. A Sun journalist contacted Radio 1 in November 2012 saying they had been given tipoffs about Westwood and -inappropriate relations with young girls-. A senior figure flagged allegations made about Westwood on Twitter to HR and the corporate investigations team, which decided that no action would be taken without further evidence. White concluded that senior BBC did not think Westwood had had sexual contact with 15-year-old girls, but that the issue -ought to have been formally raised with him- and the online allegations should have been examined further. -Many- BBC employees -perceived there to be a close relationship between the controllers and Tim Westwood-. Witnesses felt they were unable to complain because of the -feeling that … that senior management were likely to side with presenters-. Westwood made repeated comments about guests and staff members’ bodies, particularly about women’s breasts. Until Westwood was removed from the 1Xtra DriveTime show in 2012, -the approach appears to have been to raise issues informally … and, when the situation did not improve, to move BBC staff working on the 1Xtra DriveTime show to other programmes-.	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/feb/25/tim-westwood-inquiry-report-what-new-allegations-against-him-have-emerged	2025-02-25T11:41:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2f68fa13a789ef1e109396baf0f195baa1d5695/0_0_4250_2551/master/4250.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=645d08ddf560b4bd2b4cf1828a3bf50f

Starmer can only hope aid grab-raid to lift defence budget wins Trump’s favour	PM’s Washington trip clear impetus for abrupt news of budget switch to meet defence commitment by 2027 Before Keir Starmer’s meeting with Donald Trump on Thursday, the prime minister thought it necessary to offer the president a gift. Britain’s defence spending will increase by 0.17 percentage points to 2.5% of GDP by April 2027, he told MPs in a hastily arranged Commons statement. The money, he added, would be taken directly from the overseas aid budget, whose level will be cut by nearly half to 0.3%. The last measure is a remarkable turn for a Labour government. Uncomfortably, it comes at a time when Donald Trump wants to shut down perhaps the entire $40bn US aid budget – and at a stroke eliminates a signature commitment from the Blair-Brown years. It was back in 2004, when Tony Blair was prime minister, that Labour first committed to increasing aid spending to 0.7% of GDP.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/25/starmer-can-only-hope-aid-grab-raid-to-lift-defence-budget-wins-trumps-favour	2025-02-25T11:27:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4247e195c8c053e7715f4662ab06674ab669f603/0_124_5872_3524/master/5872.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2653de9e05276f944c5a2d208472c11e

Official internationally mediated negotiations on how to implement the second stage – which would involve a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territory – were supposed to begin weeks ago, but have been repeatedly postponed as the fragile truce has lurched from crisis to crisis.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/25/israel-wants-to-extend-first-phase-of-gaza-ceasefire-deal-as-talks-stall	2025-02-25T06:17:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/386e6b173beed3259f71348b7cced8e35fd17611/107_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=29d2b7997f3ef82f30a9c9df9d042394

Donald Trump said Vladimir Putin would accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential deal to end the three-year war. Trump was speaking alongside French president Emmanuel Macron at the White House as the leaders sought to smooth over a transatlantic rift to achieve peace. The Trump-Macron meeting came as the US voted against a United Nations resolution condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, siding with countries such as North Korea, Belarus and Sudan over European allies. Trump said the US and Ukraine are -very close- to coming to terms on a rare earth minerals agreement, in comments made during a visit from French president Emmanuel Macron amid European concerns over the US position on Ukraine. A federal judge on Monday denied a request by the Associated Press to immediately restore full access to presidential events for the news agency’s journalists, but said the issue required more exploration before ruling. The Trump administration barred the outlet earlier this month for continuing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico in its coverage after the president renamed it the -Gulf of America-.

The judge, who blocked the Federal Bureau of Prisons from carrying out Donald Trump’s executive order that would have transferred three incarcerated trans women into men’s facilities earlier this month, has extended protections for nine additional women. A federal judge blocked immigration agents from conducting enforcement operations in houses of worship for some religious groups, the Associated Press reported.

Good morning. The meeting was cordial, at times even warm, but the fracture lines in the transatlantic partnership were clear. Here’s what Macron said: -This peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine. It must not mean a ceasefire without guarantees. This peace must allow for Ukrainian sovereignty and allow Ukraine to negotiate with other stakeholders.- Here’s what Trump said: -I believe that Emmanuel agrees with me on many of the most important issues. … Europe must take a central role in ensuring the long-term security of Ukraine.- Trump also said a US-Ukraine minerals deal was -very close-. How are unions challenging Musk’s moves?

The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the move was evidence of Washington’s willingness to try to find a peaceful settlement. Moscow backed the resolution, which was passed late on Monday, although European countries abstained in a sign of a deepening rift with Washington.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/25/kremlin-welcomes-much-more-balanced-us-stance-ukraine	2025-02-25T02:19:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81007fa7e1662eb5540216eacb446c0489343438/0_343_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b5e247456c3a8f4417fb80e3c80fea89
Yvette Cooper says it’s ‘unacceptable’ jailed ex-Labour MP still qualifies for parliamentary salary – UK politics live	Mike Amesbury was sentenced to 10 weeks in jail for assault but is still being paid his Commons salary Good morning. Today the government is publishing its crime and policing bill. As the home affairs commentator Danny Shaw explains in a helpful social media summary, it is a -huge and unwieldy- bill, tackling various Labour law and order priorities, as well as a raft of ones that the last Conservative government was planning to legislate for before the election got in the way. Most of what is in the bill has already been well trailed. As Peter Walker reports, overnight the Home Office has been highlighting the provisions that will allow the police to search properties for stolen phones or other electronically geotagged items without a warrant. I think the Runcorn constituents deserve better, and we wanted to see a new MP in place as swiftly as possible. We look forward to Runcorn constituents getting the representation that they deserve from a newly elected Labour MP. I think everything that’s happened is unacceptable here. You’re asking me about parliamentary rules and procedures, which obviously are separate from those that the government runs. They’re separately ones for parliament.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/25/yvette-cooper-labour-mike-amesbury-keir-starmer-conservatives-kemi-badenoch-uk-politics-live-news-updates	2025-02-25T01:10:54-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23f7da94b969ea8d2197a964b0a9a9bc60c4f4d7/61_8_5823_3494/master/5823.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=57f201d21f501eaa7c6adf0eb113a77b

Russia-Ukraine war live: Macron says ceasefire could come in ‘weeks’ as US sides with Russia at UN	French president says he told Trump deal should be ‘substantial for Ukraine’; UN security council backs US resolution that fails to mention Russia as aggressor Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. French president Emmanuel Macron has said a truce -could be done in the weeks to come-, shortly after meeting Donald Trump at the White House where he told the US president a deal should not mean the -surrender- of Ukraine. Donald Trump said Vladimir Putin would accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential deal to end the three-year war. Speaking before bilateral talks at the White House, French president Emmanuel Macron said Europe was prepared to provide security guarantees to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire including peacekeepers, although they would not be sent to the frontline. Trump said he saw no objection to European troops being sent to Ukraine to serve as peacemakers, adding that he had raised the idea with Putin. Trump described a potential minerals deal with Ukraine as -very close- and said he might meet Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy soon to seal the agreement. Trump added that he would also be meeting Putin at some point. Zelenskyy last week rejected US demands for $500bn in mineral wealth from Ukraine to repay Washington for wartime aid, contending that the US had supplied nowhere near that sum so far and offered no specific security guarantees in the agreement. More than a dozen world leaders gathered in Kyiv on Monday to mark the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion. A coordinated Europe-led show of solidarity took an overnight train for a summit with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, including the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb. The coordinated Europe-led show of solidarity on Monday came after a torrid week, in which Trump blamed Ukraine for starting the war against Russia, described Zelenskyy as a -dictator without elections-, and made it clear Europe would have to enforce and pay for any future peace settlement. There was strong collective pushback against the US president’s upside down version of recent history and a consensus that Ukraine had to take part in negotiations over its future. Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow will cease its military actions only if the outcome is -satisfactory- to Russia. He said that many more countries had become -realistic- in their position on Ukraine, and that the recent meeting in Riyadh raised the hope of having normal dialogue between Russia and the US. EU foreign ministers have discussed sending billions of military aid to Ukraine, ahead of a summit dedicated to European defence next week. At a meeting in Brussels on Monday a handful of countries proposed military aid for Ukraine in 2025 ranging from €20bn to €40bn, according to several diplomatic sources. The EU is spending more money on Russian fossil fuels than on financial aid to Ukraine, according to a new report. The EU bought €21.9bn (£18.1bn) of Russian oil and gas in the third year of the war, an amount equalling one-sixth greater than the €18.7bn the EU allocated to Ukraine in financial aid in 2024. Downing Street said Trump has changed the global conversation around Ukraine -for the better-, as the UK imposed further sanctions on Russia in an effort to force Putin to make concessions. Keir Starmer’s spokesperson did not comment on Trump’s false claims that Volodymyr Zelenskyy was a dictator. Starmer will hold talks with Trump in Washington on Thursday.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/25/ukraine-russia-trump-putin-zelenskyy-macron-ceasefire-latest-news-updates-live	2025-02-24T23:28:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e030638fd5ed9275565878dc1dd6963293d77f1f/0_186_5708_3426/master/5708.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=df01dda261fd32e366b7d3c48381c04d

Tuesday briefing: Farmers prepare to give minister chilly reception as Labour seeks to mend fences over inheritance tax	In today’s newsletter: The government is refusing to back down over its changes to inheritance tax breaks for farmers – here’s why the issue is still rumbling on Good morning. It’s a time-honoured tradition: the minister arriving to speak to a conference hall full of people who absolutely hate him, and getting roundly pilloried as he sticks to the government line. Today, it might be the environment secretary Steve Reed’s turn. His adversaries: a large number of implacably angry farmers. Whether or not they bring pitchforks, the attendees who listen to his speech at the National Farmers’ Union conference are up in arms because of the government’s refusal to back down over its changes to inheritance tax breaks for farmers. And while Reed is coming with policy changes that he says will be to the benefit of British farmers, like a five-year extension of the seasonal farm workers’ scheme, they are unlikely to be enough to earn him a warm welcome.

From Creative Australia to Sydney writers’ festival, the direct threat facing the arts is coming from within | Louise Adler	In this adapted extract from What’s the Big Idea? Louise Adler looks at the failure of Australian cultural leaders shying from risk and artistic vision – and letting the tail wag the dog All around the world, a succession of arts organisations across all sectors have come under pressure from artists – surely their first and most important stakeholders – to -take a stand- on a range of topical issues from the climate crisis to Israel’s war on Gaza. If artists engage with the issues of the day, what is the appropriate response of the boards and managers of arts organisations? On Monday we saw the resignation of Kathy Shand, chair of the Sydney writers’ festival. Obviously individual board members, like donors, have every right to decide the values of an organisation do not align with their own.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/25/whats-the-big-idea-extract-louise-adler-creative-australia	2025-02-24T18:41:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf8f99a92d97b9d7e18c6de9e8f61c06d3f9aa20/0_295_4416_2652/master/4416.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=caf56a024a5a220d120d6318a1b69b06

One possibility for the CDU/CSU alliance leader, who is on course to become Germany’s next chancellor, is to claim that the country is in an emergency, to try to force the change through the Bundestag before its dissolution.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/24/friedrich-merz-germany-europe-independence-from-us	2025-02-24T07:51:41-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23c43279a18ec8eeefb0cc0902279164f183565e/667_194_5170_3102/master/5170.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7f7b6f89b5f582716c0986cd22004140

Revealed: how members of House of Lords benefit from commercial interests	Months-long Guardian investigation exposes weaknesses in code of conduct that could trigger calls for greater reform A Guardian investigation into the House of Lords raises questions over the accountability of parliament’s second chamber, with revelations about how a string of peers are benefiting from commercial interests. One in 10 members have been hired to give political or policy advice, according to their own declarations, and others do paid work for companies that could conflict with their role as legislators. The findings expose weaknesses in the Lords code of conduct and raise questions about whether the rules on lobbying and paid employment should be tightened in line with restrictions signed up to by MPs. Nearly 100 members of the Lords are paid to give political or policy advice by commercial firms. A Labour peer offered access to ministers during discussions to sponsor an event in parliament. A former minister has earned millions of pounds since entering the Lords by working for 30 companies. Multiple peers are being paid by foreign governments including repressive regimes. More than £1 in every £14 donated to political parties since 2001 came from those who have sat as peers in the last parliament.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/24/revealed-how-house-lords-benefit-from-commercial-interests	2025-02-24T06:15:01-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f9944a58952b583d8856dd388e55d95d21be1ca/1_0_4999_3000/master/4999.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1bbd05d121c88bdad15aad978d4d6679

Confusion at US agencies over whether to comply with Elon Musk email demanding workers justify their jobs – US politics live	Government agencies give conflicting advice after email from Elon Musk demanding employees list accomplishments from past week Hello and welcome to our US politics rolling coverage. Elon Musk’s email demanding all 2.3 million government workers justify their work has caused confusion with several administration officials telling workers not to reply to the missive. French President Emmanuel Macron will meet with Donald Trump in Washington on Monday, saying he will present -proposals for action- to counter the -Russian threat- in Europe and ensure peace in Ukraine. Conservative podcaster Dan Bongino has been appointed as FBI deputy director. Bongino, a former Secret Service agent and NYPD officer turned conservative radio host, puts a second Trump ally at the top of the agency. Trump announced the appointment on Sunday night in a post on his Truth Social platform, praising Bongino as -a man of incredible love and passion for our country-. The Trump administration on Sunday said it was placing all but a handful of USAid personnel around the world on paid administrative leave and eliminating about 2,000 of those positions in the US, according to a notice sent to agency workers and posted online. More than 150,000 people from Canada have signed a parliamentary petition calling for their country to strip Elon Musk’s Canadian citizenship because of the tech billionaire’s alliance with Donald Trump, who has spent his second US presidency repeatedly threatening to conquer its independent neighbor to the north and turn it into its 51st state.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/feb/24/elon-musk-email-donald-trump-us-government-latest-live-politics-news	2025-02-24T03:40:46-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76b7451ede5e4397f736a948dc0c70d1f46180b1/901_1192_4840_2904/master/4840.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=abc2012271a28a3f2a7048c03bece380
First Thing: Zelenskyy hails ‘three years of resistance’ on anniversary of Russian invasion	It follows Russia’s biggest ever aerial attack on Ukraine. Plus, far-right AfD doubles support in German election Good morning. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, hailed -three years of resistance … three years of absolute heroism of Ukrainians,- as foreign leaders arrived in Kyiv to mark the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion. What’s the latest war news? Russia launched its biggest ever drone attack on Ukraine, using 267 drones and killing at least four people. What did Zelenskyy say about US demands? He claimed the Trump administration was asking Ukraine to pay back $2 for every $1 of military aid the US provides going forward. What do we know about the death toll after three years of war? Zelenskyy said in December that 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed, with 370,000 injured. US officials estimated last October that 600,000 Russian troops had been killed or wounded. In November, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights verified 12,162 civilians killed, including 659 children, though the total is likely much higher.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/24/first-thing-zelenskyy-hails-three-years-of-resistance-on-anniversary-of-russian-invasion-ukraine	2025-02-24T03:34:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbbac5474a87878d48d7c4ec968399db7acad947/0_241_5887_3533/master/5887.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1c9a6166b6d756e341c9b0c822c8d64d

Home Office says it will tighten rules to keep ‘Kremlin-linked elites’ out of UK as Starmer speaks to European leaders – UK politics live	Keir Starmer to join European leaders on call to Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss Ukraine war Good morning. At least this week we’re not going to have to put up with all the usual guff about the special relationship. UK politics this week will be dominated by Keir Starmer’s meeting with Donald Trump in the White House on Thursday, which was described on the Westminster Hour last night as -probably is one of the most consequential meetings of a British prime minister and president that we have had since the second world war- by Sir Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador to Washington. For the last 30 years at least, whenever a PM has met a new US president for the first time, commentary has inevitably focused on what it said about the state of the -special relationship-. Despite making the British sound insecure and needy, as a media narrative it always worked because it was simple and appealed to patriotic notions of British exceptionalism. But last week it became clear that the -special relationship- that seems to matter most to Trump is the one he has with Vladimir Putin. There will still be huge interest in the outcome of the Starmer/Trump meeting. But the parameters have now shifted, and No 10 will probably be happy with a relationship that is positive, functioning, and not entirely disastrous for Ukraine. Under the new measures, the government will expand the criteria for exclusion to cover Kremlin-linked elites. This will ensure that, while Russia remains an acute national security threat, elites linked to the Russian state can be prevented from entering the UK. Those who could be barred from the UK include anyone who provides significant support to the Russian state and/or those who owe their significant status or wealth to the Russian state and/or those who enjoy access to the highest levels of the Russian state. Successive governments have welcomed the oligarchs and their money with open arms, providing them with a means of recycling illicit finance through the London ‘laundromat’, and connections at the highest levels with access to UK companies and political figures.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/24/keir-starmer-labour-latest-politics-live-news-updates	2025-02-24T01:29:38-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b6e0110e1966e56aae935f45e3e92bf3eaea641/0_376_5808_3485/master/5808.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b3592f48b1aa2d83d45e37138d8e80e0

Monday briefing: Merz will be Germany’s chancellor – but extremists are waiting in the wings	In today’s newsletter: The far-right AfD may have come second, but at 20% they have been held off by the performance of mainstream parties, with the CDU leader Friedrich Merz on course to be the new chancellor Good morning. Germany’s elections always matter far beyond the country’s borders – but yesterday’s vote could be the most important in a generation. After decades as the stable linchpin of European liberal democracy, Germany has found itself sucked into the same crises that are erupting all over the continent – over its economy, attitudes to immigration and the war in Ukraine. And after the shocking interventions of JD Vance and Elon Musk in favour of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, the election became a symbol of a wider struggle for ideological supremacy – and posed a serious question over whether the centre can hold across the continent. Ukraine | Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he is not willing to cave in to intense pressure from the Trump administration to sign a $500bn minerals deal – adding that that he was ready to quit as president if it meant -peace for Ukraine- or membership of Nato. Catholicism | Pope Francis, who is battling pneumonia and a complex lung infection, remains in a critical condition, the Vatican has said. Archbishop Rino Fisichella, a senior Vatican official, told participants at a mass in St Peter’s Basilica on Sunday morning they should make their prayers for Francis -stronger and more intense-. Afghanistan | The Taliban have arrested a British couple in their 70s for -teaching mothers parenting with children-. Peter Reynolds, 79, and his wife, Barbie, 75, have been running projects in schools in Afghanistan for 18 years. Farming | Hospitals, schools and prisons are to be urged to buy more British food, as part of a government push to heal a rift with farmers over changes to inheritance tax. The environment secretary, Steve Reed, will set a target of sourcing at least half of public sector food from farms with the highest welfare standards, which should benefit British producers. Green economy | The net zero sector is growing three times faster than the overall UK economy, analysis has found, providing high-wage jobs across the country while cutting climate-heating emissions and increasing energy security. 22,000 net zero businesses generated £83bn in gross value added last year.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/24/monday-briefing-merz-will-be-germanys-chancellor-but-extremists-are-waiting-in-the-wings	2025-02-23T23:10:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ce1c53e13ac5f40618a7bb1aa6e45fc62fb2719/0_4_1652_991/master/1652.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1aa0b8ecc6af299c9f5a7e249d4bf89b

Ukraine war live: Zelenskyy hails ‘three years of resistance’ on anniversary of Russian invasion	Ukraine president pays tribute to ‘absolute heroism’ of Ukrainians as EU leaders arrive in Kyiv Welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine, on the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed -Three years of resistance- and the -absolute heroism- of Ukranians this morning. In a post on X he wrote: Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he would be willing to resign in exchange for peace or Nato membership, telling reporters he doesn’t plan to stay in power for decades. -But we won’t let Putin stay in power over Ukrainian territories either,- he said Sunday. He made his remarks just hours after Russia launched its biggest ever aerial attack on Ukraine, using 267 drones, killing at least four people across the country. Kyiv echoed with the booms of anti-aircraft fire as crews spent the night trying to shoot the drones down. Zelenskyy also said he would not bow to pressure from Washington to hand over $500bn worth of Ukraine’s minerals, adding: -I’m not signing something that 10 generations of Ukrainians are going to pay later.- Around $350bn worth of Ukraine’s critical resources are in areas captured by Russia, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, told reporters. Zelenskyy also revealed the Trump administration was asking Ukraine to pay back $2 for every $1 of military aid the US provides Ukraine going forward – an interest rate of 100%. The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, will separately meet Trump early this week and have agreed to show -united leadership in support of Ukraine-. EU leaders will meet on 6 March for a special summit -to take decisions- on Ukraine and European defence, Costa said, as pressure mounts on European nations to boost defence spending. Meanwhile, US and Russian officials are planning to meet again at some point in the next two weeks, Russian state news agency RIA reported over the weekend, citing the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov. Russian government spokesperson Dmitry Peskov supported comments made by Trump about Zelenskyy – such as calling the Ukrainian leader a dictator – as -understandable- after Zelenskyy made -inappropriate remarks- about Trump. Zelenskyy had accused Trump of being -trapped- in a Russian -disinformation bubble.- Despite Zelenskyy’s growing frustration with the Trump administration, he repeated his hopes in keeping the US allied with Ukraine, and to be included in any peace talks. -We would really like it as a priority for the US to first talk to us, then to Russia.- He added, -it is not possible to decide anything about Ukraine without us.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/24/ukraine-war-live-zelenskyy-hails-three-years-of-resistance-on-anniversary-of-russian-invasion	2025-02-23T22:26:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/052512656caf71b6d9711aa38a07ccf35d731dad/0_187_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fe093dfea55ffcd905e103621afbdeb2

German election live: Merz says priority is to make Europe independent from US on defence as coalition talks to begin	Donald Trump has made it clear he is ‘fairly indifferent to Europe’s fate’, says CDU leader who plans to form a coalition by Easter Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the German election results. CDU leader Friedrich Merz has said his -absolute priority- will be to strengthen Europe so as to achieve independence from the US in defence matters as he prepares to embark on coalition negotiations that are expected to last until Easter. The Greens, the SPD’s coalition partner, slumped by three percentage points to 11.6%. The Left has surged to 8.8% and the liberal FDP – which triggered the early election by collapsing Olaf Scholz’s coalition – along with the far-left Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance failed to meet the 5% threshold required top get into parliament. The results mean Merz could form a so-called -grand coalition- with the SPD, without needing to find a third party. That would mean a future government would be more stable and less fractious than for example Scholz’s. The Social Democratic party was left reeling on the back of a historically low vote share, with outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz, admitting it was a -bitter result-. He said he would not be involved in any coalition talks with the CDU/CSU, with other SPD leaders expected to lead negotiations. Merz hailed -a historic election evening,- and acknowledged the responsibility and the scale of the task ahead. He said he planned to form a coalition by Easter and told party faithful that -the world out there is not waiting for us and for lengthy negotiations.- Alice Weidel, co-leader of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) called the result -historic- for her party, having doubled the number of votes from 2021. Weidel said her party remained open to coalition talks with other parties, and said excluding the AfD was the equivalent to -voter fraud-. The AfD swept all five former East German states: Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony and Thuringia. It won well over 30% of the vote in each state and as much as 38.6% in Thuringia – that’s where the AfD made history in September as the first far-right party to win a state election since the second world war. Christian Lindner, the leader of the liberal FDP whose falling out with Scholz triggered the collapse of his coalition government and paved the way for early elections, resigned after his party failed to reach the 5% threshold to re-enter parliament. In a post on X, he said would retire from active politics and said he hoped the election would bring a -new start for Germany-.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/24/german-election-live-results-updates-2025-cdu-afd-widel	2025-02-23T21:08:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c059e777504ba41196add95b7e3146a3451e933/0_6_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42fc97d5f91fbbcd3e0eb456f0081c42
Starmer’s meeting with Trump will be PM’s biggest diplomatic test to date	Aides say prime minister will try to balance the UK and Europe’s interests while retaining good relations with unpredictable US president The first time Keir Starmer met Donald Trump, the prime minister had a convivial two-hour dinner with the then presidential candidate in his luxury New York apartment, before Trump dimmed the lights to show off the Manhattan skyline. The stakes at the two leaders’ second meeting at the White House this Thursday will be much higher. It will take place days after the third anniversary of Russia’s full scale invasion of Ukraine, amid tensions at the United Nations and during a turbulent period in transatlantic relations.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/24/starmers-meeting-with-trump-will-be-pms-biggest-diplomatic-test-to-date	2025-02-23T21:00:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/675f058ff2bfb782f106d03c033de316ca07a062/718_283_3797_2277/master/3797.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd59ba06e4cc706572bb42177ead66f0
Will Germany’s new government restore its role as a bold leader of the EU?	Friedrich Merz can rebuild European relationships and be a driving force on defence spending, but faces Trump’s upending of postwar certainties Germany has long been seen as the EU’s -indispensable nation- – the biggest, richest and most consequential power. But in recent years Berlin has widely been regarded as missing in action in the EU, hobbled by internecine feuding in a coalition government that has caused flip-flops and delayed decisions. Olaf Scholz has a cool relationship with Emmanuel Macron, slowing down the fabled Franco-German motor that powers the EU. The Polish-German relationship has also been rocky, strained by disputes over European air defence and historical grievances.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/24/restoration-of-germany-as-bold-eu-leader	2025-02-23T21:00:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc73252a3e51860b727dc5f3e50ea89e6fdf9e98/0_117_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ceddb441efee8aff71ca22b4d5e0248d

The EU bought €21.9bn (£18.1bn) of Russian oil and gas in the third year of the war, according to estimates from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea), despite the efforts under way to kick the continent’s addiction to the fuels that fund Vladimir Putin’s war chest.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/24/eu-spends-more-russian-oil-gas-than-financial-aid-ukraine-report	2025-02-23T21:00:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba71e4851d7b4088edce5bacd6007ed58f59c7d7/0_90_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cfa31373d79fb2ebafb120498708755d

Literary gold … or betrayal of trust? Joan Didion journal opens ethical minefield	Soon we can all read the late author’s private notes about her therapy. But should we? In 1998, the late journalist Joan Didion wrote a scathing essay about the posthumous publication of True at First Light, a travel journal and fictional memoir by Ernest Hemingway, 38 years after the author killed himself. -This is a man to whom words mattered. He worked at them, he understood them, he got inside them,- Didion wrote. -His wish to be survived by only the words he determined fit for publication would have seemed clear enough.- Just over a year later, in December 1999, Didion began writing her own journal about her sessions with a psychiatrist. She addressed these notes – detailing her struggles with alcoholism, anxiety, guilt and depression, a sometimes fraught relationship with her adopted daughter Quintana and reflections on her childhood and legacy – to her husband, John Gregory Dunne.	https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/feb/23/literary-gold-or-betrayal-of-trust-joan-didion-journal-opens-ethical-minefield	2025-02-23T01:00:30-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12785d80570bfd3b6b586bdb24330bc6a9576dbe/0_913_2672_1603/master/2672.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d62a2d29cab4409e20c18ca5e26e1160

How UK and EU could find more money for defence without spooking the markets	There is political agreement that Britain and Europe need to increase military spending. But in straitened times, how can it be done? Can Britain increase defence spending without cuts elsewhere?Rachel Reeves is constrained by fiscal rules that govern the extent of the UK’s debts and the annual spending deficit by the end of the parliament. Following lower than expected tax receipts and higher borrowing costs in the current financial year, it looks likely that the chancellor will need to make budget cuts when she makes her next financial statement on 26 March. Last week she said a rise in defence spending would mean making -difficult decisions across the board-. Reeves fears a backlash from financial markets in response to higher, unfunded spending, pushing the cost of borrowing up in a repeat of the Liz Truss mini-budget debacle. Most analysts believe a rise in borrowing is expected by international lenders.	https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/feb/23/how-uk-and-eu-could-find-more-money-for-defence-without-spooking-the-markets	2025-02-22T22:00:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc442bfa49dc954ec094290bf375be3e9fa379b7/0_155_4677_2807/master/4677.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8ebee58ab96bc64483ef26fcbf5857e0

Coalition to match ‘dollar for dollar’ Labor’s plan to make GP visits cheaper in $8.5bn Medicare boost	Less than half of Australians were always bulk billed when they saw a GP in 2023-24, government data says The Coalition says it will match -dollar for dollar- Labor’s landmark $8.5bn proposal to dramatically increase Medicare bulk-billing rates for GP visits, pledging to meet Anthony Albanese’s commitment to make nearly all doctors’ appointments free. Doctor’s groups have welcomed Labor’s pledge to fund 18m extra bulk-billed GP visits annually, but have warned some patients will still miss out because government rebates are sometimes still too low to cover the cost of all appointments. The health minister, Mark Butler, says nine out of 10 GP visits will be covered by 2030 under Labor’s plan, and has accused the Coalition of -cooking the books- on bulk-billing statistics during their time in office.

Only 160 of those killed were non-Indigenous colonists. There were 13 massacres of colonists by Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people. The most intense period of massacres was from the late 1830s into 1840s, with a pivotal point being the Myall Creek massacre in 1838 – the first time any perpetrators had been punished. After the Myall Creek convictions, the government could no longer involve the military and new -police- forces were created, which set a pattern for the rest of the conflict. About half of all massacres of Aboriginal people were carried out by police and other government agents. Many others were perpetrated by settlers acting with tacit approval of the state. Some perpetrators were involved in many massacres.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/23/more-than-10000-first-nations-people-killed-in-australias-frontier-wars-final-massacre-map-shows-ntwnfb	2025-02-22T16:52:25-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7db9294df616e96913084c0a8ff7397bdf1685da/0_282_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2bfb9fc3c42c5eaa5ae4381bb5be4518
