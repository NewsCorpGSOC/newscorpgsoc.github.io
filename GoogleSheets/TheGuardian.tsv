Literary gold … or betrayal of trust? Joan Didion journal opens ethical minefield	Soon we can all read the late author’s private notes about her therapy. But should we? In 1998, the late journalist Joan Didion wrote a scathing essay about the posthumous publication of True at First Light, a travel journal and fictional memoir by Ernest Hemingway, 38 years after the author killed himself. -This is a man to whom words mattered. He worked at them, he understood them, he got inside them,- Didion wrote. -His wish to be survived by only the words he determined fit for publication would have seemed clear enough.- Just over a year later, in December 1999, Didion began writing her own journal about her sessions with a psychiatrist. She addressed these notes – detailing her struggles with alcoholism, anxiety, guilt and depression, a sometimes fraught relationship with her adopted daughter Quintana and reflections on her childhood and legacy – to her husband, John Gregory Dunne.	https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/feb/23/literary-gold-or-betrayal-of-trust-joan-didion-journal-opens-ethical-minefield	2025-02-23T01:00:30-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12785d80570bfd3b6b586bdb24330bc6a9576dbe/0_913_2672_1603/master/2672.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d62a2d29cab4409e20c18ca5e26e1160

How UK and EU could find more money for defence without spooking the markets	There is political agreement that Britain and Europe need to increase military spending. But in straitened times, how can it be done? Can Britain increase defence spending without cuts elsewhere?Rachel Reeves is constrained by fiscal rules that govern the extent of the UK’s debts and the annual spending deficit by the end of the parliament. Following lower than expected tax receipts and higher borrowing costs in the current financial year, it looks likely that the chancellor will need to make budget cuts when she makes her next financial statement on 26 March. Last week she said a rise in defence spending would mean making -difficult decisions across the board-. Reeves fears a backlash from financial markets in response to higher, unfunded spending, pushing the cost of borrowing up in a repeat of the Liz Truss mini-budget debacle. Most analysts believe a rise in borrowing is expected by international lenders.	https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/feb/23/how-uk-and-eu-could-find-more-money-for-defence-without-spooking-the-markets	2025-02-22T22:00:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc442bfa49dc954ec094290bf375be3e9fa379b7/0_155_4677_2807/master/4677.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8ebee58ab96bc64483ef26fcbf5857e0

Coalition to match ‘dollar for dollar’ Labor’s plan to make GP visits cheaper in $8.5bn Medicare boost	Less than half of Australians were always bulk billed when they saw a GP in 2023-24, government data says The Coalition says it will match -dollar for dollar- Labor’s landmark $8.5bn proposal to dramatically increase Medicare bulk-billing rates for GP visits, pledging to meet Anthony Albanese’s commitment to make nearly all doctors’ appointments free. Doctor’s groups have welcomed Labor’s pledge to fund 18m extra bulk-billed GP visits annually, but have warned some patients will still miss out because government rebates are sometimes still too low to cover the cost of all appointments. The health minister, Mark Butler, says nine out of 10 GP visits will be covered by 2030 under Labor’s plan, and has accused the Coalition of -cooking the books- on bulk-billing statistics during their time in office.

More than 10,000 First Nations people killed in Australia’s frontier wars, final massacre map shows	‘Horrendous’ eight-year long project has ended with final fact check, leaving a legacy ‘nobody can argue’ with, says researcher The final findings of the -horrendous- eight-year long -massacre map-, tracing the violent history of the Australian colonial frontier have been released. The Colonial Frontier Massacres Digital Map Project, spearheaded by the late emerita professor of history at the University of Newcastle, Dr Lyndall Ryan, officially concluded in 2022. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email At least 10,657 people were killed in at least 438 colonial frontier massacres. 10,374 of them were Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people killed by colonists. Only 160 of those killed were non-Indigenous colonists. There were 13 massacres of colonists by Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people. The most intense period of massacres was from the late 1830s into 1840s, with a pivotal point being the Myall Creek massacre in 1838 – the first time any perpetrators had been punished. After the Myall Creek convictions, the government could no longer involve the military and new -police- forces were created, which set a pattern for the rest of the conflict. About half of all massacres of Aboriginal people were carried out by police and other government agents. Many others were perpetrated by settlers acting with tacit approval of the state.

‘It’s blackmail’: Ukrainians react to Trump demand for $500bn share of minerals	Ukraine’s lithium deposits are among biggest in Europe and the US is looking for ‘payback’ for previous military assistance Drawing in the snow with his finger, Mykola Hrechukha sketched out how Ukraine’s new lithium mine might look. It would have a deep central shaft, with a series of side tunnels, he said. -The lithium is good everywhere. The biggest concentration is at a depth of 200-500 metres,- he said. -We should be able to extract 4,300 tonnes a day. The potential is terrific.- For now, though, there is little sign of activity. The deposit is buried under a large sloping field, used in communist times to grow beetroot and wheat. The mine’s proposed entrance is in an abandoned former-Soviet village, Liodiane, today a scruffy grove of acacia and maple trees. The only inhabitant is a security guard, who lives on the 150-hectare site in an ancient Gaz-53 truck.

Americans sharply divided over Trump’s embrace of Putin	While US allies are alarmed at changing loyalties, new poll finds starkly partisan reaction to president’s Ukraine policy Donald Trump’s shocking and mendacious attack this week on the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as a -dictator- while cozying up to the Russian president and indicating that traditional US security support for Europe is waning may have alarmed US allies abroad but has prompted a more starkly divided response among Americans at home. Reflecting the country’s deeply partisan attitude to the new president and his -America first- foreign policy doctrine, polling suggests that Republicans are much more likely to oppose additional help for war-torn Ukraine. A Pew Research Center survey earlier this month found that 47% of Republicans but just 14% of Democrats thought the US was providing too much support to Ukraine – views that have changed dramatically since the war began three years ago, when just 7% of all American adults (9% of Republicans and 5% of Democrats) said the US was providing too much support to Ukraine.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/22/trump-putin-friendship	2025-02-22T00:01:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8a63bd83cb96794242c15180a31c68d1505673c/0_480_7176_4304/master/7176.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=929f49e6c2af508ddf182fce7b30f468

Middle East crisis live: Gaza hostage-prisoner exchange set to go ahead	Hamas says six captives expected to be freed from Gaza on Saturday in swap for about 600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, after return of wrong body risked derailing ceasefire Welcome to our live coverage of the Middle East crisis. It’s just after 8.30am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv – here’s the latest news. Israel prepared on Saturday to receive six more hostages from Gaza in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, after accusations over the return of a misidentified body this week threatened to derail a fragile truce. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, vowed revenge for what he described as a -cruel and malicious violation- of the ceasefire agreement after authorities determined that a body released by Hamas on Thursday was not Shiri Bibas. The body was determined to be of an unidentified woman from Gaza. The Bibas family accused Netanyahu of failing to protect their loved ones during Hamas’s 2023 attack and of failing to bring them home. -There is no forgiveness for abandoning them on October 7, and no forgiveness for abandoning them in captivity,- said Ofri Bibas, the sister-in-law of Shiri Bibas, in a statement. Netanyahu said he has ordered the Israeli military to carry out an intensive operation against what he called -centres of terrorism- in the West Bank. He also said on social media that he had ordered Shin Bet and police to increase -preventative- measures against attacks on Israeli cities. It followed a series of explosions on three parked buses in Bat Yam, a city outside Tel Aviv, on Thursday night. Authorities said they were a suspected terrorist attack. No injuries were reported. More than half a million children have been left without education across Gaza and the West Bank, according to the International Rescue Committee. The NGO warned that vital aid for children in the region was being scuppered by increasing violence. Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman held a meeting of Egyptian and Jordanian leaders described as -an informal brotherly gathering- by the state-run Saudi Press Agency. It came ahead of an Arab League summit likely to discuss the Gaza Strip after the US president, Donald Trump, proposed it -take over- the territory and permanently resettle its Palestinian residents, a plan Arab countries have universally rejected. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald will boycott St Patrick’s Day events in the US over Gaza. She and Northern Ireland’s first minister, Michelle O’Neill, said they would not attend the celebrations after Trump’s call to exile Palestinians from the territory.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/22/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-hamas-new-gaza-hostage-prisoner-exchange	2025-02-21T22:40:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1b7d6bb8cf37ae714b8079ac16a93de35a4769c/0_210_3173_1904/master/3173.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b836f14a874494485f41a197b82c5e2c

Prominent figures in the arts say class is a key factor that determines who can make it in the creative industries In recent years, a string of academic reports have shown in stark terms just how elitist the arts have become over the last four decades.

Jaysley Beck inquest prompts flood of testimonies of abuse in UK military	Ministry of Defence says lessons learned from death will make military safer, but victims and families say they have heard it all before A soldier left suicidal after complaints about a senior officer were ignored. Two women told they needed to grow up or their heads would be banged together after they complained about sexual harassment by their major. A servicewoman raped and left with post-traumatic stress disorder while her attacker was given a slap on the wrist. Online army forums have been flooded this week with testimonies of abuse – and the military’s failure to tackle it – sparked by the inquest into the death of 19-year-old gunner Jaysley Beck. The head of the army, Gen Sir Roly Walker, has expressed his disgust and suggested senior ranks may even be -actively complicit- in abusive behaviour.

‘This could have all been avoided’: how Creative Australia allowed itself to be blind-sided over its Venice Biennale pick	High-profile artists and curators stunned by Creative Australia’s swift abandonment of Khaled Sabsabi, the art community, and the complex nature of art itself A week after Creative Australia controversially dumped artist Khaled Sabsabi as Australia’s representative for the 2026 Venice Biennale, Richard Bell still can’t understand the decision. The Kamilaroi, Kooma, Jiman and Gurang Gurang artist has a long history with the Venice Biennale and Australia’s peak arts funding body – in 2019, he crashed the prestigious showcase after being passed over to officially represent Australia. He’s shocked that Creative Australia would allow itself to be blind-sided by criticism of Sabsabi’s past work, and its refusal to answer predictable attacks with a nuanced conversation.

‘He’s selling the city’: behind Eric Adams’s New York City administration	The mayor of America’s largest city is caught up in a swirl of indictments, immigrants, Rikers and Donald Trump This Valentine’s Day, a new political power couple said their vows on the plush white couches of Fox &amp; Friends in midtown Manhattan: Donald Trump’s border tsar, Tom Homan, and the New York City mayor, Eric Adams. The pair appeared on the conservative TV show to discuss an agreement they had reached the day before. Their deal reversed longstanding New York City policy by letting federal immigration agents back onto Rikers Island, the city’s jail complex that largely holds people who have been charged but not yet convicted of crimes. The surprise agreement came as the newly installed leaders of Trump’s Department of Justice were making an extraordinary push to dismiss criminal corruption charges that the agency had been pursuing against Adams.

The Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey has said the government must swiftly ramp up defence spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP). I’ve never known a time like this, it is probably one of the most alarming times for Britain’s defence and security since the second world war, with our closest ally changing their position. So we have to debate it, it is going to be difficult. I don’t think there’s an easy solution, but we have put some ideas on the table. One idea we have put is to increase the digital services taxes, a tax on about 20 multinational companies with turnovers of over £500m and we would raise it from the current 2% to 10%.

Macron outlined parts of his strategy on Thursday night. During a Q&amp;A session on social media that he would tell Trump not to be -weak- on Russian president Vladimir Putin, warning about the consequences that would have in relation to other powers around the world, like China. -That’s not who you are, it’s not your trademark,- he said he would argue.

Peter Dutton says Labor is fast-tracking citizenship so that migrants can vote. Here’s what we know	The opposition leader picked up on News Corp claims that Tony Burke was conducting ‘industrial-scale’ ceremonies. Labor denies it has anything to do with the election This week Peter Dutton has claimed Labor wants to -expressly push- new Australians through citizenship ceremonies ahead of the federal election – allegations the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, has strongly denied, accusing critics of a -whinge-. In the same remarks, Dutton also again claimed the government wanted to -bring people in from a war zone-, referring to Gaza, and appeared to insinuate people from that region were among those being offered citizenship. Tony Burke is spending today and the rest of this week, as I understand it, conducting as many citizenship ceremonies as you can, and literally putting thousands of people through an express citizenship process so that they can vote in the election within a few weeks, which I think is quite remarkable. And I just question whether there has been any slackening of the process, whether there has been any compromise on the security checks, and whether it’s in our country’s best interests for people to receive citizenship before the proper security checks have been undertaken, or people have had – within the home affairs department – the time to be able to conduct the searches that we would expect to be conducted.- What would you like to happen to be assured that the processes are being followed?- There needs to be transparency. If the government’s giving a nod and the wink to a particular part of society – they’re obsessed with the Green vote and they’re worried about losing seats, without being political about it – but let’s be frank about the motivation. Why would you bring people in from a war zone without the requisite checks, on a tourist visa, without precedent? Why would you do that and knowing that it’s territory controlled by a listed terrorist organisation? Why would you expressly push people through the process to receive citizenship in advance of an election which is pending?-	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/21/peter-dutton-says-labor-is-fast-tracking-citizenship-so-that-migrants-can-vote-heres-what-we-know-ntwnfb	2025-02-20T22:19:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ffbb702b6b2ce00338b2a69a40d20ad058925bc/0_255_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7c012b7638859b17dfd74c8e6d871767

Starmer tells Zelenskyy it was ‘perfectly reasonable’ to suspend elections during war – UK politics live	Downing Street says the two leaders spoke overnight, after Donald Trump accused the Ukrainian president of being a ‘dictator’ Shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel told viewers of Sky News this morning that she could not comment on the -motivation- of Donald Trump in criticising Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but said that Trump was -wrong-. Ask what she made of the comments, Patel said: First of all, that’s wrong. President Zelenskyy is not a dictator. Let’s just put some context of this. For three years – the third anniversary of the conflict is on Monday – for three years he has led his nation in terms of this conflict, standing up to Putin, Putin’s aggression, and the appalling conduct that we’ve seen. [Zelenskyy] is fighting for sovereignty and the freedom of his country. And this is a significant conflict in our neighbourhood, effectively on European soil, and this is the most brutal conflict that we’ve seen in Europe since, clearly, the second world war. So here’s a man that’s fighting for sovereignty, freedom, and actually standing up for the rule of law, and many of the values that we all hold very dearly. I think I said at the weekend too that there is a lot of chatter, there’s a lot of noise. There are no clear solutions right now. And I think, you know, I say this not just as a member of the Conservative frontbench, but actually as a British politician, having led the support for Ukraine, this is why we must really be quite strong all over again in our support for greater defence and military spending and capability. I think we need to take the heat down from what has become a very heated conversation in public over recent days. That’s what the prime minister has been doing, meeting with European leaders, speaking to President Zelenskyy. Next week, he’ll travel to the US to meet with President Trump. The truth is that if we want a solution to what is happening in Ukraine –and we absolutely do, because it’s in British interests to do so, and it’s the right thing to do – then we know in our country from the experience of dealing with very difficult matters on our own shores, that the only way that you reach a solution is to bring all parties around the table, to take the heat down, to have cool heads, and to bring people together for a negotiated solution. We’ve got our own view as the UK. And our view is that the US matters, Ukraine must be involved in negotiations about Ukraine’s own future, and that Europe matters as well. And we need to make sure with all parties around the table that our alliance doesn’t fracture. We’re absolutely committed to Nato. We have to hold that coalition together. We have got a real threat here in Vladimir Putin. We have got to work together with our allies in order to make sure that we don’t just win the war and win the peace in Ukraine, but we also make sure that we don’t see the like of this happening again. The prime minister has made his own view clear. He spoke to president Zelenskyy in the last few days and made clear that he understands, first of all, that he is an elected leader, and we consider him in the United Kingdom to be a legitimate leader. We do not consider president Zelenskyy to be a dictator. He was elected by the people of Ukraine. And the reason that there haven’t been elections is because of Russian aggression, and that is something that is out with Ukrainian control.

Middle East crisis live: Hamas to return bodies of four Israeli hostages, including two children	Bodies of Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir, who Hamas says were killed in an Israeli airstrike, as well as Oded Lifshitz, 83, to be handed over Hello, we are restarting our live coverage of the Middle East. Hamas is set to return the bodies of four Israeli hostages on Thursday, including a mother and her two children who have long been feared dead and had come to embody the nation’s agony following the 7 October 2023 attack. Hamas has said it is ready to release all its remaining hostages in a single exchange if the ceasefire agreement with Israel moves forward to a second phase next month. A senior Hamas official, Taher al-Nunu, told Agence France-Presse -We have informed the mediators that Hamas is ready to release all hostages in one batch during the second phase of the agreement, rather than in stages, as in the current first phase.- The offer came as the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, signalled his readiness to talk about a second phase of the Gaza ceasefire after an extended delay, by appointing one of his closest advisers, Ron Dermer, a US-born cabinet minister and former ambassador to Washington, to lead the Israeli delegation to the talks. Dermer replaces the heads of the Mossad and the Shin Bet security service, who have led the negotiations until now and have frequently been at odds with Netanyahu over his reluctance to move forward with the ceasefire. Arab leaders will gather in Saudi Arabia on Friday to counter President Donald Trump’s plan for US control of Gaza and the expulsion of its inhabitants, diplomatic and government sources said. The plan stirred rare unity among Arab states which roundly rejected the idea, but they could still disagree over who will govern the Palestinian territory and who will pay for reconstruction. US secretary of state Marco Rubio met on Wednesday with the leader of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, after talks in Israel and in Saudi Arabia. The UAE has been key in mediating between Israel and Gaza. Wednesday’s meeting included discussions on artificial intelligence, the Gaza Strip, Syria, Lebanon and the Red Sea, which had been the site of attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels until the Gaza ceasefire a state department spokesperson said.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/20/israel-gaza-war-hostages-shiri-bibas-ariel-kfir-oded-lifshitz	2025-02-19T23:09:48-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73891f9f79f4910a304405824a81b664c130c455/763_0_7500_4500/master/7500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=205bcf3d6b56c0d6f052cec764a1a489

Thursday briefing: The real reasons that Volodymyr Zelenskyy can’t face a new election yet	In today’s newsletter: Zelenskyy described Trump’s claims as -disinformation- – only for the US president to double down. But his claims have no plausible basis in fact Good morning. Donald Trump’s view of Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un: -The smartest one gets to the top-. Donald Trump’s view of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who won Ukraine’s presidency in a landslide, enjoys continued popular support, and had to postpone new elections because his country was, as you will remember, invaded: he’s a dictator. Zelenskyy earned that astonishing designation yesterday by rejecting Trump’s claims that he is very unpopular, that Ukraine brought the invasion on itself, and that to be considered a legitimate leader he must hold new elections even under the threat of Russian attack. At a press conference in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said: -Unfortunately, President Trump, with all due respect for him as the leader of a nation that we respect greatly … is trapped in this disinformation bubble-. And he added: -I would like to have more truth with the Trump team.- Bills | The companies behind Great Britain’s gas pipes and power lines have pocketed a windfall of nearly £4bn from household bills during the energy and cost crisis, according to a report. The analysis, by Citizens Advice, argued that energy network owners were able to make the -excess profits- over the past four years after the industry regulator misjudged their costs. Brazil | British journalist Charlotte Alice Peet, 32, has been missing in Brazil for 11 days, a foreign correspondents’ association in the country has said, urging authorities to step up their search efforts. Peet has worked as a freelance journalist for outlets such as the Independent, Times, Telegraph and Al Jazeera. Immigration and asylum | Plans to prevent refugees who arrive in the UK on a small boat, lorry or via other -irregular- means from becoming a British citizen are facing their first legal challenge. The case is being brought by a 21-year-old Afghan refugee who arrived in the UK aged 14, after fleeing the Taliban and being smuggled to Britain in the back of a lorry. Sellafield | The UK nuclear industry regulator has taken Sellafield, the world’s largest store of plutonium, out of special measures for its physical security – but said concerns remained over its cybersecurity. In 2023, the Guardian revealed a string of safety concerns at the site – from issues with alarm systems to problems staffing safety roles at its toxic ponds – as well as cybersecurity failings.

Trump signs executive order targeting ‘benefits for illegal aliens’	US president issues order aimed at preventing taxpayer dollars supporting illegal immigration and another designed to get rid of regulations Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at ending federal benefits for people in the country illegally, his latest in a blizzard of moves to crack down on immigration. The White House said the order seeks to end -all taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens- but it was not clear which benefits will be targeted.

On the ground in a new Lebanon – podcast	Israel’s war has left many Lebanese people contemplating what once seemed unimaginable: is Hezbollah finished? Michael Safi reports from Beirut Michael Safi was in Lebanon in the summer, when it was on the brink of war between Israel and Hezbollah, the most powerful force in the country. Months later, in October, Israeli troops invaded Lebanon amid a wave of airstrikes and assassinations of top Hezbollah leaders and commanders. Michael returned this month and visited destroyed villages in southern Lebanon as civilians were returning to their homes. On the ground, it appeared the Israeli military had a political strategy too: splintering Lebanese society by driving a wedge between the community that traditionally supports Hezbollah and everybody else.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2025/feb/20/on-the-ground-in-a-new-lebanon-podcast	2025-02-19T19:00:25-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d58e8cb6e1439f10918610721d381f7db0c71969/0_149_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=35b9068e1a3363736ea60f96fa18acc6

Reaction to the rise in inflation, Davey said: The chancellor’s misguided policies are putting us at risk of a new era of stagflation. The economy still isn’t growing, and now people are being hit in their pockets too.

‘No artist’ will want to represent Australia at Venice Biennale after Sabsabi dumped, former museum head says	Elizabeth Ann Macgregor says Tony Burke has questions to answer after Khaled Sabsabi’s offer was rescinded but the arts minister has denied involvement The Australian Pavilion at the 61st Venice Biennale is likely to remain dark next year for the first time, the former director of the Museum of Contemporary Art says.

Middle East crisis live: Israeli troops remain in five locations in Lebanon after deadline for withdrawal expires	Original deadline in late January extended to 18 February by both Israel and Lebanon as both sides claim the other has violated ceasefire agreement Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of developments in the Middle East. Israel’s army has left southern Lebanese villages but remains in five positions, a Lebanese security source told Agence France-Presse (AFP), as a deadline for their withdrawal agreed to under a peace deal with Hezbollah expired. Itamar Ben-Gvir has suggested that the Egyptian government may have had a role to play in the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. -They [Egypt] have a role in what happened on October 7,- the former national security minister, who resigned from Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet in protest over the Gaza ceasefire deal, said in comments carried by Israeli state radio. -There was probably some partnership, or at the very least, a willful blindness.- An alternative to Donald Trump’s proposal for the effective ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from Gaza is being prepared by Egypt, under which Hamas would be formally excluded from governance and control of the territory’s reconstruction. The process would be handed over on an interim basis to the control of a social or community support committee. No member of Hamas would sit on the committee (you can read more about the alternative plan here). The World Bank will release an assessment of damages to infrastructure in Gaza in coming days. It is expected to provide a fuller overview of damage done to the territory by Israeli airstrikes after an interim report in April showed it suffered $18.5bn in damages to critical infrastructure in the first four months of the war.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/18/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-troops-lebanon-withdrawal-deadline-passes-egypt-gaza-latest-updates-news	2025-02-17T23:58:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecab4c4e38ec405cd9e3cc0ff4d45b715e02f3b4/0_102_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f9b4a4fc474243255915cc145e50ebce
How Spain’s radically different approach to migration helped its economy soar	As immigration has increased, GDP has surged and unemployment has fallen to lowest level since 2008 From Madrid to Barcelona, restaurants and bars are brimming with people, and reservations have become essential for everything from fine dining to high-end hotels. It’s a glimpse of how Spain has become Europe’s buzziest economy – named the world’s best by the Economist in 2024 – fuelled in part by what analysts have described as the government’s strikingly different approach to migration.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/18/how-spains-radically-different-approach-to-migration-helped-its-economy-soar	2025-02-17T23:00:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cae13a1801fe3ed75493eceeaec8a0f2ff1827ed/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a1efba8b856e412f286bb7884c372495

Tuesday briefing: Europe faces tough choices on Ukraine as US pursues own path	In today’s newsletter: As the US and Russia go ahead with talks in Saudi Arabia, Keir Starmer and other European leaders are grappling with their next move Good morning. Yesterday, European leaders attended an emergency meeting in Paris to discuss how best to respond to the shift in Ukraine policy from the US under Donald Trump. Today, US and Russian officials will meet in Saudi Arabia for preliminary peace talks. And while Volodymyr Zelenskyy says that there can be no -agreements about us without us-, events of the last week have made it clear that the second of these summits is likely to be more consequential than the first. As shocking as interventions from the US vice-president, JD Vance, and the secretary of defence, Pete Hegseth, were last week, part of their argument was emanating from Washington even before Trump’s first term: the demand that European nations take more responsibility for their own security as the US seeks to shift its focus towards Asia. Prisons | Successive governments’ overreliance on longer prison sentences and desire to seem -tough on crime- have driven the justice system to the brink of collapse, an official review has found. The prison population in England and Wales was more than 85,000 at the end of last year, having increased by more than 40,000 since 1993. UK news | A woman shot dead at a Kent pub on Valentine’s Day has been named as Lisa Smith. The 43-year-old from Slough was killed in Knockholt near the Three Horseshoes pub shortly after 7pm on Friday, Kent police said. Conservatives | Kemi Badenoch has said -our country and all of western civilisation will be lost- if efforts to renew the Conservative party and drive forward rightwing ideas globally fail. In a speech at a right-wing conference attended by Jordan Peterson and Nigel Farage, Baedenoch said that -pronouns, diversity policies and climate activism- are a -poison-. Canada | A plane carrying 80 people crash landed at Toronto Pearson airport on Monday, flipping upside down and leaving at least 18 people injured. Video from the scene showed a Delta Air Lines plane belly-up on snow-covered tarmac and people walking away. Religion | Pope Francis will remain in hospital for as long as required after tests in recent days showed a -complex clinical picture-, the Vatican has said. The pontiff, 88, was admitted to Gemelli hospital in Rome on Friday with worsening bronchitis and was diagnosed and treated for a respiratory tract infection. If current trends in the decline of European defence capabilities are not halted and reversed, future US political leaders – those for whom the cold war was not the formative experience that it was for me – may not consider the return on America’s investment in Nato worth the cost.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/18/tuesday-briefing-europe-faces-tough-choices-on-ukraine-as-us-pursues-own-path	2025-02-17T22:51:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/476db846c2b307d8aaca7a3f876ebe7c9d78dd90/0_193_4675_2805/master/4675.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5493440d148fd4666e280dc53aec9a34

Russian and US officials meet in Saudi Arabia for high-stakes talks on war in Ukraine, without Kyiv – Europe live	European officials not part of discussions as Volodymyr Zelenskyy warns his country will not recognise peace deals made without Ukrainian participation Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the US-Russia talks in Riyadh – it’s approaching 8am in the Saudi capital. Today’s talks aim to pave the way for the first exchanges on a potential peace deal to end the Ukraine war. However, Kyiv and European leaders have been excluded, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that Ukraine -cannot recognise any things or any agreements about us without us-. Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s foreign policy adviser, said on Monday upon arrival in Riyadh that talks on Ukraine would be strictly bilateral, Russia’s RIA state news agency reported. -We came to negotiate with American colleagues,- it quoted Ushakov as saying. -These are bilateral talks, purely bilateral. There can be no trilateral talks in Riyadh.- The Riyadh talks are proceeding to follow up on a surprise phone call to Putin initiated by Trump last week. Trump’s special Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, stressed Trump wanted a quick deal: -We are now at Trump time, which means I get an assignment today and tomorrow at noon he asks me why it hasn’t been done yet.- Russia said ahead of the meeting that Putin and Trump wanted to move on from -abnormal relations- and that it saw no place for Europeans to be at any negotiating table. Zelenskyy accused Washington of wanting -to please- Putin by -now saying things that are very favourable- to him. The Ukrainian president said any peace deal would need to include -robust and reliable- security guarantees, which France and Britain have called for but not all European powers support.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/18/russia-us-ukraine-peace-talks-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-volodymyr-zelenskyy-saudi-arabia-live-latest-updates-news	2025-02-17T21:02:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/622c4bb6b535f011d104729e1b824259ef95b88f/0_436_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=55af9545ebb57f8fb79fce600939363e

Weatherwatch: Cyclone Zelia brings 130mph winds to north-west Australia	Tropical cyclone first to make landfall this year, while a winter storm causes extreme cold across north-eastern US Cyclone Zelia became the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in 2025, hitting north-west Australia on Valentine’s Day as a category 4 system. It brought damaging winds of 130mph and heavy rainfall, with 440mm of rain falling in two days. Prior to landfall, Zelia affected southern Indonesia, including Bali, with winds of more than 45mph. The storm weakened into a tropical low by Saturday, but continued to cause widespread flooding, particularly near the Pilbara rivers and the Great Sandy Desert. Zelia intensified rapidly because of the record-warm Indian Ocean temperatures, which were 1-2C above seasonal average, providing increased energy and moisture to fuel the storm. While Port Hedland in Western Australia had minimal damage, nearby areas like Pilbara and Marble Bar faced flooding and fallen trees. The Great Northern Highway remains closed, disrupting food supplies and leaving supermarket shelves empty. The tropical low is now tracking southwards, with rainfall becoming patchier and lighter.	https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/feb/17/weatherwatch-cyclone-zelia-brings-130mph-winds-to-north-west-australia	2025-02-17T02:37:42-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06272b018467c240a6bf8e5d338236bd8a6e8cc5/0_46_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6e5bc709d2fbbac52f5225f3bb5f8303

Egypt draws up Gaza reconstruction plan that would exclude Hamas	Alternative to Trump plan would involve committee of technocrats but future military status of Hamas unresolved An alternative to Donald Trump’s plan to turn the Gaza Strip into a US-owned -Riviera of the Middle East- is being prepared by Egypt in conjunction with the World Bank, under which Hamas would be formally excluded from governance and control of the territory’s reconstruction. The process would be handed over on an interim basis to the control of a social or community support committee. No member of Hamas would sit on the committee. But the future military status of Hamas within Gaza is unresolved, which is likely to be a barrier to Israeli endorsement of the plan.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/16/egypt-gaza-reconstruction-plan-hamas	2025-02-16T09:44:46-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2458070a8b94463bf20cc5eb64cd6402deaac52/0_0_4801_2881/master/4801.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=69f251aac1ed7ae64afec735108c6808
Trump’s return means UK must swiftly find a way to increase defence spending | Peter Walker	Under Biden, the move could wait until the UK worked out how to meet its 2.5% GDP commitment. Not now It has been one of the few political constants in a turbulent period for British politics: an agreement that defence spending really should increase. But in the second era of Donald Trump, what was a consensual background hum has suddenly become an ear-splitting alarm. European Nato members, the UK among them, have long been used to US presidents urging them to spend 2% of GDP at a bare minimum, something only a minority of them manage.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/16/trumps-return-means-uk-must-swiftly-find-a-way-to-increase-defence-spending	2025-02-16T09:35:56-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e00633b0f12ce93a2eaa1493916bc78c84d192d/0_0_3999_2400/master/3999.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ce15e00aa72391f6887145f298e741f7

Trump vowed to champion US workers - the reality has been a relentless assault	President has begun slashing federal workforce while hobbling labor watchdogs NLRB and EEOC As a presidential candidate last fall, Donald Trump repeatedly promised to battle for US workers, but ever since he returned to the White House, he has taken a surprisingly large number of anti-worker actions, labor experts say. Some of those moves, among them hobbling the National Labor Relations Board, will help Trump’s billionaire business friends, most notably Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. In his first few weeks back in office, Trump fired the acting chair of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), leaving the US’s top labor watchdog without a quorum to enforce laws that protect workers’ right to unionize. Trump has designated Musk, a vehemently anti-union billionaire, to launch an all-out war against the federal bureaucracy and workforce, and Trump and Musk have essentially treated the country’s 2 million-plus federal employees as if they were disposable.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/16/trump-anti-worker-actions-unions	2025-02-16T04:00:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b5183e9e7d14cb5785e66134d6df6fc744b6431/0_83_8640_5182/master/8640.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a160f433cf0dfc34a0e76f1856483368

While the immense cuts are framed as a means of removing waste, they may also become a boon to private companies – including Musk’s own businesses – that the government increasingly relies on for many of its key initiatives. Musk and his allies in the -department of government efficiency- (Doge), the unofficial committee acting as the operations arm of his cost-cutting efforts, have targeted a range of major government departments. They have moved to close the United States Agency for International Development, slashed the Department of Education and taken over the General Services Administration that controls federal IT structures. Doge staffers have also gained access to the treasury department, as well as set their sights on the Department of Defense, energy department, Environmental Protection Agency and at least a dozen others.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/16/elon-musk-doge-government-privatization	2025-02-16T04:00:05-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c63b8543ab23600247d78b8fab60446a4f259d2d/0_0_8041_4827/master/8041.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d4468700e2330e3e5519c2b961a65152

‘There has been an awakening’: ancient sects on the rise in Modi’s India	Some 400 million devotees will attend this year’s Kumbh Mela festival. Pilgrims and politicians explain why it’s bigger than ever They sat quietly together on the banks of the Ganges river, heads bowed in sombre meditation. Some men were naked, their bodies smeared grey with ash. Others had a simple saffron cloth tied around their waist. Nearby, barbers balanced on their haunches, shaving the head of each man clean with a flick of their knives, save for a small strand at the back. This ceremony, in which millions of pilgrims seek to cleanse their sins to break the cycle of reincarnation has been taking place at the Kumbh Mela festival for centuries. It is mandatory for thousands of sadhus – Hindu holy men who live an austere life of strict spiritual discipline. Among the most sacred events in the Hindu calendar, the festival occurs every 12 years across four sacred locations in India where it is believed the Hindu god Vishnu once spilled drops of the nectar of immortality.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/16/modi-india-kumbh-mela-hindu-festival-sects	2025-02-16T01:00:05-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16f9931a617907325e9faf12087ec4efe52b3aa1/370_0_6356_3815/master/6356.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ae7699d0e64f733f4585ebbc442b79ff
Munich security conference concludes as Europe scrambles to mount united front amid warming US-Russia ties – Europe live	Reports of planned meeting between US and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia leaves Europe concerned over Ukraine ceasefire negotiations The Munich security conference concludes today after a dramatic two days during which the US vice-president, JD Vance, excoriated European leaders, accusing them of suppressing free speech, and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, declared it was time to create a European army. With Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine looming over the conference, the two men met at its sidelines, with Zelenskyy demanding -security guarantees- and a joint US-Ukrainian peace plan before he enters into any talks with Moscow. Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said Europe will be consulted – but ultimately excluded – from the talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US. -To my European friends, I would say: ‘Get into the debate, not by complaining that you might, yes or no, be at the table, but by coming up with concrete proposals, ideas, ramp up [defence] spending’,- Kellogg said at the Munich conference on Saturday. Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb, said -Europe needs to talk less and do more-, in response to the prospect of being shut out of talks. -There’s no way in which we can have discussions or negotiations about Ukraine, Ukraine’s future or European security structure, without Europeans,- Stubb told reporters in Munich. -But this means that Europe needs to get its act together.- The Nato chief, Mark Rutte, said Europe had to come up with -good proposals- for securing peace in Ukraine if it wanted to be involved in US-led talks. -If Europeans want to have a say, make yourself relevant,- Rutte told journalists. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, and Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, have discussed Kyiv’s vision of a path to peace with China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi. Sybiha said on X the meeting that took place on the sidelines of the Munich conference was to -reaffirm mutual respect for territorial integrity-. On Friday, Wang told the conference that China believes all stakeholders in the war in Ukraine should participate in the peace talks, underscoring Europe’s role in them.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/16/ukraine-us-europe-donald-trump-russia-uk-relations-munich-conference-keir-starmer-live-latest-news	2025-02-16T00:34:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc1340e562fb3621e899bff82a7a81c1281bda60/0_280_7677_4608/master/7677.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=52c9812c64eb75be2e80ea40357c2a02

Australia news live: Dutton suggests teal MPs ‘will never come our way’ in event of a hung parliament; poll points to Coalition wave in outer suburbs	Follow all today’s headlines live On the upcoming election, Spender says -we need to see how this plays out- and that -it is very unclear exactly what [parliament] is going to look like in the end.- On statements from Peter Dutton this morning that the Independents should back him in any minority government: Yes, I’m sure that is what he thinks and it will depend on the numbers and the shape of the crossbench and what people are willing to negotiate and back at that time so I think we really need to look at it at the time. In relation to climate, I haven’t worked with the Coalition because I don’t think they are committed to a transition in terms of the most cost-effective and frankly good for the climate transition that we have at the moment. So my point is I take things on the basis of the arguments and on the basis of the evidence and I am very open to working with a coalition government and I’m open to working with the Labor government, but that depends on what they are actually going to put on the table. What I want to see is good process, good parliamentary process where all of these issues are really fleshed out, where community can actually listen to the experts arguing about these laws so that we can get one answer that is going to get big money out of politics and make sure there is a level playing field. Myself and I think others on the crossbench have approached decisions on parliament and how we vote and what we support really on the basis of what the evidence is saying. Is it in our long-term interests? What do our communities think? What are the experts think? Bringing that together, backing good ideas from all sides, working with all sides to try and get good policy through – that is how I will continue to behave whatever form the next parliament takes.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/feb/16/australia-news-live-tropical-cyclone-zelia-foreign-investors-housing-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-federal-election-ntwnfb	2025-02-15T15:43:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb828aba8f44a179a149d9d3830dc6f16efe0e14/0_277_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c3f61b4d4c1945c044f0d2b37e30613f

JD Vance’s Munich speech laid bare the collapse of the transatlantic alliance	The US vice-president was hypocritical and insensitive, but bracingly clear in his resetting of relationships Since 1963, the Munich Security Conference has seen many consequential speeches, notably Vladimir Putin announcing in 2007 that Russia would never accept a subordinate role in the new world order. But Friday’s speech by JD Vance, the US vice-president, has the potential to be the most consequential – the moment the world order against which Putin railed fell apart. Sometimes, even in this digital age, speeches can act as clarifiers. Yes, the 22 minutes were full of laughable hypocrisy, distorted portraits of European democracy and insensitivity to Europe’s trauma with fascism, but for what it said about the chasm in values between most in Europe and the Trump administration, it was hard to overlook.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/15/jd-vance-munich-speech-laid-bare-collapse-transatlantic-alliance-us-europe	2025-02-15T05:20:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fede26e2075023a08e341126494482c24e421d78/0_94_2526_1516/master/2526.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0b657cb7de8bf912e4468208ba3d036c

There are only two possible outcomes for any deal with Putin. If he remains in power, he will find a way to break the agreement. If he loses power, the agreement will become meaningless.- Probably it will be very, very, very difficult. And of course, in all the difficult situations, you have a chance. But we will have low chance – low chance to survive without support of the United States.- The widow of Russian dissident Alexei Navalny has warned there is -no point trying to negotiate- with Putin on Ukraine. -Just remember: he will lie,- Yulia Navalnaya told the Munich Security Conference on Friday. -If he remains in power, he will find a way to break the agreement.

Musk-linked group offered $5m for proof of voter fraud – and came up with nothing	Fair Election Fund has yet to reveal evidence of voter fraud despite deep-pocketed backers – and has now gone silent In May 2024, a flashy ad went viral on social media warning that -across the country, there are real cases of fraud and abuses of the [election] system that have eroded our trust-.

Trump administration continues to gut federal workforce – US politics live	Tens of thousands of government employees told to leave amid Elon Musk’s call to ‘delete’ entire agencies Good morning, US politics blog readers. The Trump administration’s drive to downsize the federal workforce continues, with news that thousands of US government employees across the United States have been told they are being let go. The latest cuts target employees in their probationary periods at agencies that include the Department of Veterans Affairs, Small Business Administration and US Forest Service. That’s in addition to the 75,000 employees the White House said accepted its legally questionable offer of deferred resignations. All this is taking place after Elon Musk, who Trump has appointed as chair of his -department of government efficiency- said that his intention was to -delete entire agencies-. Federal worker unions have sued over his moves, while warning that the Trump-Musk drive to downsize government by going after the people who work there threatens to undermine programs Americans depend on. We’ll tell you more about that today. Here’s what else is going on: Trump is heading to Mar-a-Lago for the weekend this afternoon, but before he does, he’ll sign executive orders at 1pm. He often invites the press into the Oval Office to watch him do so. Top federal prosecutors have resigned after receiving orders from the justice department to drop bribery charges against New York mayor Eric Adams. We expect to hear more about the fallout from the decision throughout the day. JD Vance is scheduled to meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and deliver remarks at the Munich security conference, where America’s European allies are grasping for details of the Trump administration’s new policy on Ukraine.

Middle East crisis live: Hamas expected to name Israeli hostages it will free this weekend	Israel warned Thursday that Hamas must release three living hostages this weekend or face a resumption of the war in Gaza Hamas is expected on Friday to name three hostages it will release this weekend as part of a planned exchange for Palestinian prisoners and detainees, according to local media. Israeli media reported on Thursday that Hamas was to name three hostages it would release on Saturday, after it reiterated its commitment to the ceasefire and to carrying out the next exchange -according to the specified timetable-. The Israeli government has signalled that it intends to stick to the hostage-release schedule agreed in the ceasefire deal with Hamas, but warned that if the anticipated three hostages are not released on Saturday, it would go back to war. Hamas said on Thursday it will continue implementing the Gaza ceasefire deal, including hostage exchange. Yemen’s Houthis said they will immediately take military action if the US and Israel attack Gaza, the group’s leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, said in a televised speech on Thursday. In Israel, dozens of relatives of hostages held in Gaza blocked a highway near Tel Aviv, waving banners and demanding the terms of the ceasefire be respected, an AFP journalist said on Thursday. US secretary of state Marco Rubio is expected to visit Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates soon to discuss the fragile Gaza ceasefire. On Thursday, for the first time since the truce began, Israel’s military said it identified a rocket launch from Gaza. The rocket landed back inside the Palestinian territory and the military later said it had struck the launcher. Two Jerusalem booksellers detained this week on charges their books were causing -public disorder- have said the experience reflected an intensifying campaign by the Israeli government against Palestinian culture and free speech. Mahmoud Muna and his nephew Ahmed, whose family has owned the Educational Bookshop for more than 40 years, spent two days in detention and will remain under house arrest until Sunday, despite the absence of evidence to support the vague accusations against them.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/14/israel-gaza-war-hostages-ceasefire-middle-east-latest-news	2025-02-13T23:41:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff04320e94723d3eb6b98b1d9ada2fdd83cbdcb8/0_168_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8092470913aae97059028299b105d7aa

EU failed to Trump-proof Europe and now faces humiliation over Ukraine	As Putin’s actions again disrupt the start of a Munich security conference, Brussels largely has itself to blame The start of the Munich security conference has a habit of being disrupted by a display of power by Vladimir Putin. In 2022, the transatlantic security establishment gathered in the knowledge that Putin was days from launching his attack on Kyiv. In 2023, the opposition leader Alexei Navalny died in disputed circumstances in a Russian jail and this year Russia’s leader is on the brink of opening talks with Donald Trump that many analysts predict will end with Russia not just gaining Ukrainian territory but dismembering Ukraine as a sovereign independent state. For Europe it is a humiliation. And yet little that Trump or his defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, said on Wednesday about their approach to a ceasefire including the US’s refusal to commit further resources to Ukraine could have come as a shock. Indeed Europe largely has only itself to blame.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/13/eu-failed-trump-proof-europe-humiliation-ukraine	2025-02-13T10:35:39-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff6f8280eb4bf537d4241a1670b083db040b64f4/0_216_2962_1777/master/2962.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a2377b9c40b84246b6935159df785531

Ukraine just the latest Trump wheeze for Labour to try to defend and disown | John Crace	It was left to the poor junior defence minister Maria Eagle to walk that particular tightrope in the Commons In his ghostwritten 1987 bestseller, The Art of the Deal, Donald Trump delivers his own version of the American Dream. Get as much as you can for yourself. There’s always someone out there who’s stupider than you. Any attention is better than none. Promise people the Earth even if you know you can never deliver. Paint yourself orange and glue what’s left of your hair to your head. This is business as a macho willy waving contest. So much so you suspect The Donald is deeply insecure about the size of his own. But maybe we should have read between the lines better. For the real message is: -Always let someone else take the hit.- After all, it wasn’t Trump who was left out of pocket when his hotels and casinos six times filed for bankruptcy between 1991 and 2009 due to an inability to meet scheduled payments. It was his creditors. That’s a business style The Donald has taken into his presidency. After the Trump Plaza and the Trump Tower, we now have the Trump Toilet. To flush away Ukraine.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/13/ukraine-just-the-latest-trump-wheeze-for-labour-to-try-to-defend-and-disown	2025-02-13T10:16:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b116ce9914af7ea96a5380227dbcc835a6098618/0_314_2987_1792/master/2987.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2c9e44ab5be7562a4d5991b8e7671d88

The rapid push to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table is -not a betrayal- of Ukraine, the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, has insisted, after Donald Trump said he and Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin ceasefire talks and that Kyiv was unlikely to regain much territory or join Nato.

Google defends scrapping AI pledges and DEI goals in tense all-staff meeting	Exclusive: Google executives gave employees details on dropping the company’s promise against weaponized AI and nixing diversity goals Google’s executives gave details on Wednesday on how the tech giant will sunset its diversity initiatives and defended dropping its pledge against building artificial intelligence for weaponry and surveillance in a tense all-staff meeting.

It was the first time company executives have addressed the whole staff since Google announced it would no longer follow hiring goals for diversity and took down its pledge not to build militarized AI.

He said it would -good for society- for the company to be part of evolving geopolitical discussions in response to a question about why the company removed prohibitions against building AI for weapons and surveillance.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/google-all-staff-meeting-ai-dei	2025-02-12T10:49:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/102a4baa4e6267059acf012706e7e0d6f4188820/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=607f10bd3d2963104c6cd44596a5a84a

The workers from Mexico earned per day about the same as their US counterparts were paid by the hour, according to the American and Mexican sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of nervousness about speaking out publicly against the company.

Backlash over ‘spiteful’ move to block small boat refugees from ever claiming British citizenship – UK politics live	Stella Creasy says Home Office decision ‘erects more barriers’ to refugees integrating and contributing to communities in UK Good morning. On Monday MPs debated, and passed, the second reading of the border security, asylum and immigration bill. It is a signficant piece of legislation that repeals a lot of the Rwanda-policy law passed by the Tories and gives the authorities new anti-terrorism-style powers to tackle people smuggling. There is a good summary of it here. During the debate Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said one reason why the Conservatives were opposed to the bill was because it repealed section 32 of the Illegal Migration Act 2023 which -prevents people who enter the country illegally from gaining citizenship-. He went on: By repealing that section, the bill will create a pathway to citizenship for people who entered the country illegally, and I think that is unconscionable. This change flies in the face of reason. The British public want refugees who have been given safety in our country to integrate into and contribute to their new communities, so it makes no sense for the government to erect more barriers. We know that men women and children who are refugees want to feel part of the country that has given them a home, and support to rebuild their lives. So many refugees over many generations have become proud hard working British citizens as doctors, entrepreneurs and other professionals. Becoming a British citizen has helped them give back to their communities and this should be celebrated, not prevented. We urge ministers to urgently reconsider. What this message is saying is that we will judge your asylum claim, so we will let you stay in the country, but we will not expect you to be part of our community. I just genuinely, gently, say to my colleagues on the front bench, I think that is counterproductive. That is not where the British public are at. They recognize that there are not safe routes [for many refugees wanting to come to the UK]. If you are an Iranian dissident right now fleeing the regime, there is not a safe route. So you may well have come in a boat. We should absolutely interrogate your claim. If your claim is not well founded, you should not be able to stay. At first I hoped this was some sort of accident, a residue of the Illegal Migration Act, which legislated to have this same effect, still making its way through the system. But it doesn’t look like it. It looks deliberate. Even though those provisions of the Illegal Migration Act are being scrapped by this government. A permanent bar on citizenship for illegal entrants is a bad idea.

Few words can fully capture the first few weeks of Donald Trump’s presidency. Dizzying? Unrelenting? Disorienting? Middle East | Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Israel will resume fighting in Gaza if Hamas does not release more hostages by noon on Saturday, endorsing a threat by Donald Trump that could shatter the three-week-old ceasefire between the two sides. Economy | Nationwide, Britain’s biggest building society, has waded into a row over whether the government should cut tax breaks on cash Isas, arguing such a move would reduce the availability of mortgages for first-time buyers. AI | The US and the UK have refused to sign the Paris AI summit’s declaration on -inclusive and sustainable- artificial intelligence, in a blow to hopes for a concerted approach to developing and regulating the technology. Assisted dying | The Labour MP Kim Leadbeater has said her assisted dying bill for England and Wales will still have the strongest safeguards in the world despite the removal of a requirement for scrutiny from a high court judge. Opponents derided the change as -rushed and badly thought out-. Housing | Rogue landlords in England will face curbs on how much housing benefit income they can receive if their properties are substandard, Angela Rayner has said as she announced an extra £350m for affordable housing.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/12/wednesday-briefing-us-president-donald-trump-chaos	2025-02-11T22:53:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a784c09859b10073a3f0a91b02dd1c5bd34fadeb/656_186_3988_2393/master/3988.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=739d45f6c0cb77603873edd40cecf96b

Amid the ceasefire wrangling, how popular is Hamas in Gaza now?	The group still projects a powerful presence but, after all the damage, it will need to divert blame if the truce collapses Of the many factors that will determine the fate of the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, one of the most difficult to quantify and predict is the level of popular support for Hamas. On Monday, Hamas threatened to delay the release of further Israeli hostages, accusing Israel of breaches of the ceasefire deal. The uncertainty, just over halfway into the ceasefire’s six-week first phase, complicates talks on the far more difficult second phase. It also jeopardises the pause in the devastating fighting and the increase in humanitarian aid for Gaza that the truce has made possible.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/amid-the-ceasefire-wrangling-how-popular-is-hamas-in-gaza-now	2025-02-11T08:35:14-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3441c1fde51b1285dffe7c3555d314b69b9b0d2/0_311_8103_4861/master/8103.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6e18570896036c41efa9ca8dbdb3edbf

Amid court losses, Trump administration talk of ignoring rules fuels fears of constitutional crisis – live	Democrats and scholars fear Trump will create a constitutional crisis by defying the courts blocking the administration’s efforts to upend federal government Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump’s efforts to upend the federal government have been given a dim reception by judges nationwide, who in recent days handed down rulings blocking his attempt to curtail birthright citizenship for undocumented immigrants, allow Elon Musk and his cohort access to the Treasury’s payment systems, coax government workers to resign en masse and freeze federal funding, among others. But as the decisions have come down talk among Trump administration officials of ignoring decisions they disagree with has increased. JD Vance was the most prominent of those who have floated these ideas, musing over the weekend that -judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.- Such statements have sparked worries among Democrats and legal scholars that the Trump administration will create a constitutional crisis by defying the courts. You can expect to hear plenty more about that today, as the president’s campaign, and the legal battle it has created, continues. Here’s what else we are watching for: Trump will host King Abdullah II of Jordan at the White House beginning at 11.30am, then sign unspecified executive orders at 3pm. Yesterday’s orders included new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and regulations to hold off on enforcing an anti-bribery law. Today may be the day that House Republicans release details of their big bill that is expected to cut taxes and government spending and pay for Trump administration priorities such as mass deportations. Mike Johnson and his team have a press conference scheduled for 10am. Hamas said they are holding off on the release of future Israeli hostages over breaches of the ceasefire deal, prompting Trump to say -let hell break out- if more aren’t freed by Saturday.

Top Republican condemns Elon Musk for ‘supplication’ to China in new book	Exclusive: Tom Cotton, Senate intelligence chair, risks angering key Trump ally with harsh words for ‘tech titans’ In a new book, the Arkansas senator Tom Cotton condemns Elon Musk for -chasing Chinese dollars- and having -shamefully supplicated China’s Communist rulers-, in order to advance his own interests as chief executive of companies including Tesla and SpaceX.

First Thing: Musk-led group bids $97.4bn for control of OpenAI	OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the offer will not be accepted. Plus, $500m of food aid could spoil amid USAid cuts Good morning. Elon Musk leads a consortium of investors that on Monday submitted a bid of $97.4bn for -all assets- of the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, with Musk escalating his feud with OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman. What did the bidders say? -If Sam Altman and the present OpenAI, Inc. board of directors are intent on becoming a fully for-profit corporation, it is vital that the charity be fairly compensated for what its leadership is taking away from it: control over the most transformative technology of our time,- said Marc Toberoff, the attorney representing the investors. How did Altman respond? Altman posted on X: -no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74bn if you want.- Musk bought Twitter in 2022 for $44bn and renamed it X.

Assisted dying bill has lost Commons majority now high court signoff abandoned, says MP – UK politics live	Danny Kruger says those who backed the bill did so under false premise after change to safeguards announced Good morning. In parliament MPs and peers don’t simply vote yes or no on proposed legislation. They debate it at length, over weeks and months, and consider amendments line by line. This process is at the heart of parliamentary democracy, and it happens like this so that bills, in theory, can be improved before they reach the statute book. There is a good example of this today. The terminally ill adults (end of life) bill is perhaps the most consequential bill going through this session of parliament and the Labour MP who has sponsored it, Kim Leadbeater, has announced a significant change. As Jessica Elgot reports, she wants to scrap the requirement for an assisted dying application to be approved by a high court judge, because the judiciary said this process would be too time-consuming and would clog up the courts. Instead an expert panel, with a legal chair, would vet the assisted dying applications already approved by two doctors.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/11/assisted-dying-bill-high-court-judge-kim-leadbetter-danny-kruger-keir-starmer-labour-uk-politics-live-news	2025-02-11T01:29:28-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e404adb8611a601af5a30bc11cb7a770fc34452c/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=09f17ad23a4bfa571b2073a994d71ce5

Tuesday briefing: Will Labour’s own ‘go home’ moment work – or lead to more desperate measures?	In today’s newsletter: As the Home Office trails a tough new stance against illegal immigration, Daniel Trilling explains what an alternative approach might look like Good morning. Last night, the Home Office published footage of a group of men being escorted from a bus onto a deportation flight. With that release, the Labour government gains the dubious honour of being the first to publish that kind of footage. It follows the publication on Sunday of video showing immigration raids on illegal workers, and comes as ministers announce that nearly 19,000 refused asylum seekers, foreign criminals and other immigration offenders had been returned to their home countries since the election. Labour explains that it has a good story to tell. All of this makes for bleak viewing – and that’s the point. The Labour government is pushing a well-trailed effort to counter Reform and the Conservatives on immigration by showing it is every bit as tough as its rivals. As well as the videos, there are Facebook ads – styled in Reform’s signature turquoise – and a leaflet resembling a red-top newspaper declaring that -Labour is tackling illegal immigration-. Taken together, the implication is clear: the hostile environment has not gone away. Trump tariffs | Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum on Monday, ramping up his controversial bid to boost the US economy by hiking taxes on imports from overseas. The changes are not due to come into effect until 4 March, raising the prospect of the White House brokering deals with governments seeking reprieve. Assisted dying | MPs are to scrap the requirement for a high court judge to decide on assisted dying cases, with an expert panel to scrutinise decisions instead. The removal of mandatory high court involvement is likely to worry MPs who had been reassured the safeguards were uniquely robust. Israel-Gaza war | Hamas has said it is delaying the release of Israeli hostages indefinitely over -violations- of the ceasefire deal, prompting Israel’s defence minister to order the military to prepare for -any scenario in Gaza-. Mediators now fear that the three-week old ceasefire is in jeopardy. UK politics | Labour was warned more than a year ago about a -vile- WhatsApp group involving two of the party’s MPs, local councillors and a series of offensive messages, the Guardian has been told. The disclosure came as the MP Oliver Ryan was suspended over his membership of the group a day after health minister Andrew Gwynne was sacked and suspended by the party. Technology | Elon Musk escalated his feud with OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman on Monday, leading a consortium of investors that announced it had submitted a bid of $97.4bn for -all assets- of the artificial intelligence company. Altman rejected the offer and suggested he would buy X from Musk for a tenth of that price.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/tuesday-briefing-first-edition-labour-illegal-immigration-raids	2025-02-10T22:51:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6850010e76a0a1e64425bc146bca7640b55a2a63/0_84_3379_2027/master/3379.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c1e00d3f591124c548151bf266e88e03

Far-right populists much more likely than the left to spread fake news – study	Amplifying misinformation is now part of radical right strategy, says Dutch study of tweets by MPs in 26 countries Far-right populists are significantly more likely to spread fake news on social media than politicians from mainstream or far-left parties, according to a study which argues that amplifying misinformation is now part and parcel of radical right strategy. -Radical right populists are using misinformation as a tool to destabilise democracies and gain political advantage,- said Petter Törnberg of the University of Amsterdam, a co-author of the study with Juliana Chueri of the Dutch capital’s Free University.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/far-right-mps-fake-news-misinformation-left-study	2025-02-10T21:00:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09906be333764870be06058b52a3a6af1d42d7db/0_323_3625_2176/master/3625.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f2207313a09d99f2ab5b3d6ecb65c0cd

Lucy Letby and the medical experts who believe she is innocent – podcast	She was called the worst child serial killer in Britain in modern times. So why are medical experts saying her conviction is unsafe? Josh Halliday and Felicity Lawrence report Lucy Letby was convicted for the murder and attempted murder of more than a dozen babies. She has been called the worst child serial killer the UK had seen. But even before the trial was over experts had begun raising concerns about her conviction. Then, last week, came a bombshell press conference in which a panel of renowned neonatal experts said they believed not just that Letby’s conviction was unsafe - but that there was no murder or deliberate harm. Instead they said the deaths had been caused by a series of factors including understaffing and a lack of skills on the ward to treat the babies they were caring for. So what is the evidence that the panel was looking at and why do so many questions seem to swirl around the Letby trial?	https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/feb/11/lucy-letby-and-the-medical-experts-who-believe-she-is-innocent-podcast	2025-02-10T19:00:05-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/921b1f342a3da5476688e7e6b85dff3ddff967e4/48_0_1769_1062/master/1769.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=01bad96d03fa2790b27c3257a69ebc91

Middle East crisis live: Trump says Gaza ceasefire should be cancelled if hostage release delayed	US president said it was ultimately up to Israel but he warned that ‘all hell is going to break out’ if the remaining hostages aren’t released on Saturday Hello and welcome to our live coverage of events in the Middle East. The latest development is that US President Donald Trump has said that if all the hostages held in Gaza are not returned by Saturday at noon he would propose canceling the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and letting -all hell break loose.- Donald Trump said his plan to -take over Gaza- would not include a right of return for the more than 2 million Palestinians that he has said have -no alternative- but to leave because of the destruction left by Israel’s military campaign. Trump continued to endorse a plan for the Palestinians to be resettled in Egypt and Jordan, a plan that both countries have rejected. The remarks are the latest effective endorsement of ethnic cleansing by the US president. Hamas’s announcement prompted Israel’s defence minister to put the country’s military on alert with orders to prepare for -any scenario in Gaza-. Israel’s security cabinet has moved forward a meeting to discuss negotiations on second phase, which had been set for Tuesday evening. The army has cancelled all leave for soldiers in the Gaza division, the Kan news outlet reported, in a sign that Israeli authorities are preparing for the resumption of war. Mediators fear a breakdown of the three-week-old ceasefire and have postponed talks until they receive a clear indication of Washington’s intent to continue with the phased deal, according to reports. Qatar had reportedly warned Israeli officials at the weekend that even the first stage of the ceasefire deal was being put in jeopardy by provocative statements from Benjamin Netanyahu and by his government’s approach to talks on a second stage. Israeli police raided a leading Palestinian-owned bookshop in Jerusalem and detained two of its owners, accusing them of selling books that supported terrorism, including a children’s colouring book entitled From the Jordan to the Sea. Karim Khan, the international criminal court’s (ICC) chief prosecutor, is the person to be hit with economic and travel sanctions authorised by Trump that target the court over investigations of US citizens or US allies, the White House has confirmed. The US president signed an executive order last week authorising aggressive economic sanctions against the ICC, accusing the body of -illegitimate and baseless actions- targeting the US and Israel. A former UK supreme court judge described Israel’s assault on Gaza as -grossly disproportionate- and said there was -at least an arguable case- that it was genocidal. Lord Sumption, who served on the UK’s highest court from 2012 to 2018, was one of the highest profile signatories of a letter last year warning that the UK government was breaching international law by arming Israel.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/11/middle-east-crisis-live-blog-donald-trump-gaza-ceasefire-hostages	2025-02-10T15:23:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a0cea33ea9f8841d6be379f2b87cda689e7d7a3/0_256_7680_4608/master/7680.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e457e9bd7a19a45b85b83d01930fc982

Minister defends plan to broadcast footage of deportation of illegal workers – UK politics live	Angela Eagle defends government plan to broadcast deportations as Home Office launches new immigration raids The Labour MP Oliver Ryan is to meet the government chief whip to decide on any sanctions over his membership of a WhatsApp group that featured racist, sexist and other offensive comments, Angela Eagle has said. Peter Walker has the story. Good morning. Politicians like to claim that they are completely different from their opponents, because to win elections they need dividing line issues, but in truth the similarities can be striking too, because they end up facing the same challenges, and the electorate does not change much either. This Labour government is not the same as the last Conservative one. But at times it has sounded like Rishi Sunak (it adopted his signature anti-smoking legislation wholesale), Liz Truss (ministers constantly stress that growth is the number one priority) and even Boris Johnson (after the negativism of last year’s budget, there is a pivot towards more optimism). And today it it is sounding a bit like Theresa May in her -hostile environment- phase as home secretary. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, is expected to join an early morning raid this week targeting illegal working, while the government will broadcast footage of deportations, a number of them involving foreign criminals, from detention to removal centres and on to waiting planes … Downing Street is planning to go beyond simply taking the fight to Reform. -We don’t think it’s enough just to look strong on migration, we actually need to be strong.

Emmanuel Macron hosts AI summit, while EU braces for Trump tariffs – Europe live	Tech conference will also mark first visit to Europe for new US vice-president JD Vance Responding to Trump’s comments on aluminium and steel tariffs overnight, the EU has just said that it had not received any official notification yet, but insisted there was no justification of any such move and it would be ready to respond if needed. A spokesperson for the European Commission said: We will not respond to broad announcements without details or written clarification. The EU sees no justification for the imposition of tariffs on its exports. We will react to protect the interests of European businesses, workers and consumers from unjustified measures. In general: The imposition of tariffs would be unlawful and economically counterproductive, especially given the deeply integrated production chains the EU and U.S. established through transatlantic trade and investment. Tariffs are essentially taxes. By imposing tariffs, the U.S. would be taxing its own citizens, raising costs for business, and fuelling inflation. Moreover, tariffs heighten economic uncertainty and disrupt the efficiency and integration of global markets.

Ukraine war live: Zelenskyy ready for talks if given ‘an understanding that US and Europe will not abandon us’	Ukrainian president’s comments came as Donald Trump indicated he had been in contact with Russia’s Vladimir Putin Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he would be ready for talks in any format if he has -an understanding that America and Europe will not abandon us-. Chinese President Xi Jinping has accepted Russia’s invitation to Moscow to attend second world war commemorations, Tass state news agency reported on Monday. Trump’s national security adviser Mike Waltz said on Sunday that senior US diplomats would be in Europe this week -talking through the details of how to end this war and that will mean getting both sides to the table-. In an interview on NBC Waltz said the Russian economy was not doing well and that Trump -is prepared to tax, to tariff, to sanction- Moscow to get Putin to the negotiating table. He added that the Trump administration is looking to use this week’s engagements to begin talks on clawing back some of the United States’ assistance to Ukraine nd said European allies would need to take a greater role in supporting Ukraine. Russia’s deputy foreign minister said Moscow had yet to receive a good offer to start talks on Ukraine, in remarks published on Monday. -It is important that words be backed up by practical steps that take into account Russia’s legitimate interests, demonstrating a readiness to eradicate the root causes of the crisis and recognise the new realities,- Mikhail Galuzin told Ria state news agency in an interview. -Concrete proposals of this nature have not yet been received,- he said. Russia launched an overnight drone attack on Kyiv, injuring a woman and damaging several houses in the northeastern city of Sumy, Ukrainian officials said on Monday. The Ukrainian military said on Monday that it had shot down 61 out of 83 drones with 22 more likely downed by electronic warfare. Russia said on Sunday that its forces had captured the eastern Ukrainian village of Orikhovo-Vasylivka, near the strategic military hub of Chasiv Yar that Moscow is attempting to seize. An explosion on Sunday on an oil tanker at a port in north-west Russia forced the crew to evacuate and was being investigated, the country’s federal shipping agency said. The Rosmorrechflot maritime and river transport agency wrote on Telegram that -an explosion took place in the engine room- of the Koala in Ust-Luga port west of St Petersburg on Sunday morning.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/10/ukraine-war-live-zelenskyy-trump-talks-us-europe-russia-latest-news	2025-02-10T00:32:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d055b35d6eb51a2267b8fdc4020c77f905e2cbbf/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=59f3504a81fdb57a41857e8bcb068dd2

Middle East crisis live: returning Palestinians ‘shocked’ by ‘complete scale of destruction’ of northern Gaza	Unicef says many displaced people had hoped their homes had been spared, but have returned to total devastation Welcome back to our live coverage of the latest news from the Middle East. Displaced Palestinian families who have returned to northern Gaza since the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas came into effect last month have been -shocked- by the -complete scale of destruction- of their homes and neighbourhoods, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef). The families that I’ve spoken to this week here in the north of Gaza have been shocked by what they have returned to. They’ve been shocked by the complete scale of this destruction. Even after seeing photos and videos from the south, they hoped that their homes, their neighborhoods, their communities, maybe had been spared. Egypt will host an Arab summit on 27 February to discuss what it said were -serious- developments for Palestinian people, according to the country’s foreign ministry. Egypt has rejected Donald Trump’s plans – condemned as ethnic cleansing - to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank to neighbouring countries such as Egypt and Jordan. Speaking on Sunday, the US President repeated his pledge to take control of the Gaza Strip. -I’m committed to buying and owning Gaza. As far as us rebuilding it, we may give it to other states in the Middle East to build sections of it. Other people may do it through our auspices. But we’re committed to owning it, taking it, and making sure that Hamas doesn’t move back. There’s nothing to move back into. The place is a demolition site. The remainder will be demolished,- he told reporters. A spokesperson for Israeli prime minster Benjamin Netanyahu said that an Israeli delegation arrived in Qatar on Sunday for further ceasefire talks between Hamas and Israel. Reuters reports that indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas on the next stage of the ceasefire are set to begin this week.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/10/middle-east-crisis-live-palestinians-complete-destruction-northern-gaza-latest-news	2025-02-09T23:51:54-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85754371c4999963567a264f47c0e1179e33efc7/0_209_6260_3757/master/6260.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7b4acfd65ee2f2a9931be04665e88d68
Monday briefing: Why the brutal fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo could spiral into wider war	In today’s newsletter: As Rwandan-backed M23 rebels seize more territory and the humanitarian crisis worsens, what’s the background to the war and prospect of peace? Good morning. Over the weekend, the presidents of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda – Félix Tshisekedi and Paul Kagame – were among those who took part in a regional summit aimed at ending the resurgent violence in eastern DRC. The summit ended with a call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. But while there was a lull in the fighting yesterday, many fear that a ceasefire is less likely than escalation to a wider regional war. Rwanda does not officially admit to its involvement in the latest episode of the long-running and devastating conflict in eastern DRC. But M23, an armed group with Rwanda’s tacit and practical support, has taken the capital of North Kivu province, Goma, and is now moving south to expand the territory under its control. At stake is control of a mineral-rich region of crucial strategic significance, and the fate of civilians there who are frequently the subject of ethnically targeted attacks – but also the question of whether national borders can act as any sort of constraint. Arms trade | Britain’s system for controlling arms exports is broken, subject to political manipulation and has seen conduct that crossed the threshold into complicity with war crimes, a former UK diplomat has claimed. Mark Smith said officials were instructed to manipulate findings on the misuse of UK arms by allies. Immigration | The Home Office is launching a fresh wave of immigration raids as Labour attempts to counter the growing political threat from Reform UK. Amid anger from critics who believe the approach echoes Theresa May’s -hostile environment- regime, the government will broadcast footage of deportations from detention to removal centres and on to waiting planes. Israel-Gaza war | Israeli forces have withdrawn from the strategic corridor that divides northern and southern Gaza, as part of a ceasefire plan that has brought a fragile pause to the 16-month war. Despite the withdrawal – and the release of hostages and prisoners – little progress has been made on negotiating the second phase of the deal. Air pollution | More than 1,100 people a year in the UK are developing the most prevalent form of lung cancer as a result of air pollution, the Guardian can reveal. Health experts, cancer charities and environmental campaigners said the UK findings were -devastating- Trump tariffs | Donald Trump has said he will announce new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the US on Monday that would affect -everybody’, including its largest trading partners Canada and Mexico, in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/10/monday-briefing-why-the-brutal-conflict-in-the-democratic-republic-of-congo-could-spiral-into-wider-war	2025-02-09T22:53:17-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80e2fafb43e0d8e758c182d76562fdb8d12436d5/0_352_5651_3392/master/5651.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40778a090c4c3570294644c7f90a0d05

‘Finally this is justice’: the Assad torture survivors who guard their former jail	Men imprisoned and abused at the notorious Palestine branch detention centre return to the facility as free men The first thing the three militants did on entering Syria’s notorious Palestine branch prison as free men was to search for their former solitary confinement cells. They crossed under the towering iron gates and barbed wire at the edge of the Damascus complex after the fall of Bashar al-Assad and headed immediately to the squalid cells just a few feet wide where they had spent years huddled in the dark, staring at the back of the heavy metal doors and drawing on the walls.
