Middle East crisis live: Hamas expected to name Israeli hostages it will free this weekend	Israel warned Thursday that Hamas must release three living hostages this weekend or face a resumption of the war in Gaza Hamas is expected on Friday to name three hostages it will release this weekend as part of a planned exchange for Palestinian prisoners and detainees, according to local media. Israeli media reported on Thursday that Hamas was to name three hostages it would release on Saturday, after it reiterated its commitment to the ceasefire and to carrying out the next exchange -according to the specified timetable-. The Israeli government has signalled that it intends to stick to the hostage-release schedule agreed in the ceasefire deal with Hamas, but warned that if the anticipated three hostages are not released on Saturday, it would go back to war. Hamas said on Thursday it will continue implementing the Gaza ceasefire deal, including hostage exchange. Yemen’s Houthis said they will immediately take military action if the US and Israel attack Gaza, the group’s leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, said in a televised speech on Thursday. In Israel, dozens of relatives of hostages held in Gaza blocked a highway near Tel Aviv, waving banners and demanding the terms of the ceasefire be respected, an AFP journalist said on Thursday. US secretary of state Marco Rubio is expected to visit Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates soon to discuss the fragile Gaza ceasefire. On Thursday, for the first time since the truce began, Israel’s military said it identified a rocket launch from Gaza. The rocket landed back inside the Palestinian territory and the military later said it had struck the launcher. Two Jerusalem booksellers detained this week on charges their books were causing -public disorder- have said the experience reflected an intensifying campaign by the Israeli government against Palestinian culture and free speech. Mahmoud Muna and his nephew Ahmed, whose family has owned the Educational Bookshop for more than 40 years, spent two days in detention and will remain under house arrest until Sunday, despite the absence of evidence to support the vague accusations against them.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/14/israel-gaza-war-hostages-ceasefire-middle-east-latest-news	2025-02-13T23:41:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff04320e94723d3eb6b98b1d9ada2fdd83cbdcb8/0_168_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8092470913aae97059028299b105d7aa

Sweet romance: Japanese boys start buying into gift giving on Valentine’s Day	Women are traditionally expected to buy chocolates for male colleagues on Valentine’s day but teenage boys are shunning the one-sided custom It has been several years since Japanese women first signalled their contempt for the long tradition of showering male colleagues with chocolates on Valentine’s Day.

EU failed to Trump-proof Europe and now faces humiliation over Ukraine	As Putin’s actions again disrupt the start of a Munich security conference, Brussels largely has itself to blame The start of the Munich security conference has a habit of being disrupted by a display of power by Vladimir Putin. In 2022, the transatlantic security establishment gathered in the knowledge that Putin was days from launching his attack on Kyiv. In 2023, the opposition leader Alexei Navalny died in disputed circumstances in a Russian jail and this year Russia’s leader is on the brink of opening talks with Donald Trump that many analysts predict will end with Russia not just gaining Ukrainian territory but dismembering Ukraine as a sovereign independent state. For Europe it is a humiliation. And yet little that Trump or his defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, said on Wednesday about their approach to a ceasefire including the US’s refusal to commit further resources to Ukraine could have come as a shock. Indeed Europe largely has only itself to blame.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/13/eu-failed-trump-proof-europe-humiliation-ukraine	2025-02-13T10:35:39-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff6f8280eb4bf537d4241a1670b083db040b64f4/0_216_2962_1777/master/2962.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a2377b9c40b84246b6935159df785531

It was voted through on Thursday as part of measures to improve flood and landslide protection.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/13/norway-to-open-protected-rivers-to-hydropower-plants	2025-02-13T10:21:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b807a1d8e9aad46935611f3866858ca2f874137c/0_194_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c58201cafc7447c568a814e33159c419
‘I feel angry and betrayed’: Ukrainians react to Donald Trump’s call to Putin	While some Kyiv residents express relief over possible end to war, others predict further Russian attacks in future The first thing Olena Litovchenko thought, when she read the news of Donald Trump’s phone call to Vladimir Putin on Wednesday evening, was that it might finally be time for her to leave Ukraine. -It feels like Ukraine is being screwed,- said Litovchenko, a personal trainer who was born in Kyiv and has stayed in the city throughout the three years of full-scale war. Believing the prospect of a Ukrainian defeat to be closer after Trump’s call and statements on Wednesday, she thought for the first time that she perhaps ought to leave, for the sake of her daughter. -But then, leave and go where? Europe is most certainly going to be next. Go to Australia? I don’t know.

Ukraine just the latest Trump wheeze for Labour to try to defend and disown | John Crace	It was left to the poor junior defence minister Maria Eagle to walk that particular tightrope in the Commons In his ghostwritten 1987 bestseller, The Art of the Deal, Donald Trump delivers his own version of the American Dream. Get as much as you can for yourself. There’s always someone out there who’s stupider than you. Any attention is better than none. Promise people the Earth even if you know you can never deliver. Paint yourself orange and glue what’s left of your hair to your head. This is business as a macho willy waving contest. So much so you suspect The Donald is deeply insecure about the size of his own. But maybe we should have read between the lines better. For the real message is: -Always let someone else take the hit.- After all, it wasn’t Trump who was left out of pocket when his hotels and casinos six times filed for bankruptcy between 1991 and 2009 due to an inability to meet scheduled payments. It was his creditors. That’s a business style The Donald has taken into his presidency. After the Trump Plaza and the Trump Tower, we now have the Trump Toilet.

Having a facility at the jail would make it easier for federal agents to deport people held there before they can be released on to the streets.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/13/nyc-eric-adams-rikers-ice	2025-02-13T05:00:02-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48e4507057db23caa9b00670881750967cd2759e/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c3bab0a14019be935d5d2d163c602b39

Plus, how dating apps ignore reports of rape Good morning. The rapid push to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table is -not a betrayal- of Ukraine, the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, has insisted, after Donald Trump said he and Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin ceasefire talks and that Kyiv was unlikely to regain much territory or join Nato. How has Europe reacted? Several European nations including the UK, France and Germany, insisted they must be involved in any negotiations on Ukraine’s future. Why is the truce in jeopardy? Hamas’s armed wing initially said on Monday it would delay releasing further hostages over alleged Israeli ceasefire violations, including the continued killing of Palestinians, blocks on aid, and stopping displaced Palestinians from returning to northern Gaza. But on Thursday, Hamas said it will continue implementing the ceasefire deal, including a hostage exchange within the agreed timeframe.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/13/first-thing-trump-putin-call-not-a-betrayal-of-ukraine-insists-hegseth	2025-02-13T03:40:26-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afc46b3311195fab71d895f95fab5f0805b0198f/0_257_7769_4665/master/7769.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7ee4943a9d5ed8d408fcf9bb0a3e8a15

Google defends scrapping AI pledges and DEI goals in tense all-staff meeting	Exclusive: Google executives gave employees details on dropping the company’s promise against weaponized AI and nixing diversity goals Google’s executives gave details on Wednesday on how the tech giant will sunset its diversity initiatives and defended dropping its pledge against building artificial intelligence for weaponry and surveillance in a tense all-staff meeting.

It was the first time company executives have addressed the whole staff since Google announced it would no longer follow hiring goals for diversity and took down its pledge not to build militarized AI.

He said it would -good for society- for the company to be part of evolving geopolitical discussions in response to a question about why the company removed prohibitions against building AI for weapons and surveillance.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/google-all-staff-meeting-ai-dei	2025-02-12T10:49:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/102a4baa4e6267059acf012706e7e0d6f4188820/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=607f10bd3d2963104c6cd44596a5a84a

The workers from Mexico earned per day about the same as their US counterparts were paid by the hour, according to the American and Mexican sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of nervousness about speaking out publicly against the company.

Backlash over ‘spiteful’ move to block small boat refugees from ever claiming British citizenship – UK politics live	Stella Creasy says Home Office decision ‘erects more barriers’ to refugees integrating and contributing to communities in UK Good morning. On Monday MPs debated, and passed, the second reading of the border security, asylum and immigration bill. It is a signficant piece of legislation that repeals a lot of the Rwanda-policy law passed by the Tories and gives the authorities new anti-terrorism-style powers to tackle people smuggling. There is a good summary of it here. During the debate Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said one reason why the Conservatives were opposed to the bill was because it repealed section 32 of the Illegal Migration Act 2023 which -prevents people who enter the country illegally from gaining citizenship-. He went on: By repealing that section, the bill will create a pathway to citizenship for people who entered the country illegally, and I think that is unconscionable. This change flies in the face of reason. The British public want refugees who have been given safety in our country to integrate into and contribute to their new communities, so it makes no sense for the government to erect more barriers. We know that men women and children who are refugees want to feel part of the country that has given them a home, and support to rebuild their lives. So many refugees over many generations have become proud hard working British citizens as doctors, entrepreneurs and other professionals. Becoming a British citizen has helped them give back to their communities and this should be celebrated, not prevented. We urge ministers to urgently reconsider. What this message is saying is that we will judge your asylum claim, so we will let you stay in the country, but we will not expect you to be part of our community. I just genuinely, gently, say to my colleagues on the front bench, I think that is counterproductive. That is not where the British public are at. They recognize that there are not safe routes [for many refugees wanting to come to the UK]. If you are an Iranian dissident right now fleeing the regime, there is not a safe route. So you may well have come in a boat. We should absolutely interrogate your claim. If your claim is not well founded, you should not be able to stay. At first I hoped this was some sort of accident, a residue of the Illegal Migration Act, which legislated to have this same effect, still making its way through the system. But it doesn’t look like it. It looks deliberate. Even though those provisions of the Illegal Migration Act are being scrapped by this government. A permanent bar on citizenship for illegal entrants is a bad idea.

Few words can fully capture the first few weeks of Donald Trump’s presidency. Dizzying? Unrelenting? Disorienting? Middle East | Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Israel will resume fighting in Gaza if Hamas does not release more hostages by noon on Saturday, endorsing a threat by Donald Trump that could shatter the three-week-old ceasefire between the two sides. Economy | Nationwide, Britain’s biggest building society, has waded into a row over whether the government should cut tax breaks on cash Isas, arguing such a move would reduce the availability of mortgages for first-time buyers. AI | The US and the UK have refused to sign the Paris AI summit’s declaration on -inclusive and sustainable- artificial intelligence, in a blow to hopes for a concerted approach to developing and regulating the technology. Assisted dying | The Labour MP Kim Leadbeater has said her assisted dying bill for England and Wales will still have the strongest safeguards in the world despite the removal of a requirement for scrutiny from a high court judge. Opponents derided the change as -rushed and badly thought out-. Housing | Rogue landlords in England will face curbs on how much housing benefit income they can receive if their properties are substandard, Angela Rayner has said as she announced an extra £350m for affordable housing.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/12/wednesday-briefing-us-president-donald-trump-chaos	2025-02-11T22:53:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a784c09859b10073a3f0a91b02dd1c5bd34fadeb/656_186_3988_2393/master/3988.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=739d45f6c0cb77603873edd40cecf96b

Amid the ceasefire wrangling, how popular is Hamas in Gaza now?	The group still projects a powerful presence but, after all the damage, it will need to divert blame if the truce collapses Of the many factors that will determine the fate of the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, one of the most difficult to quantify and predict is the level of popular support for Hamas. On Monday, Hamas threatened to delay the release of further Israeli hostages, accusing Israel of breaches of the ceasefire deal. The uncertainty, just over halfway into the ceasefire’s six-week first phase, complicates talks on the far more difficult second phase. It also jeopardises the pause in the devastating fighting and the increase in humanitarian aid for Gaza that the truce has made possible.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/amid-the-ceasefire-wrangling-how-popular-is-hamas-in-gaza-now	2025-02-11T08:35:14-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3441c1fde51b1285dffe7c3555d314b69b9b0d2/0_311_8103_4861/master/8103.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6e18570896036c41efa9ca8dbdb3edbf

Amid court losses, Trump administration talk of ignoring rules fuels fears of constitutional crisis – live	Democrats and scholars fear Trump will create a constitutional crisis by defying the courts blocking the administration’s efforts to upend federal government Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump’s efforts to upend the federal government have been given a dim reception by judges nationwide, who in recent days handed down rulings blocking his attempt to curtail birthright citizenship for undocumented immigrants, allow Elon Musk and his cohort access to the Treasury’s payment systems, coax government workers to resign en masse and freeze federal funding, among others. But as the decisions have come down talk among Trump administration officials of ignoring decisions they disagree with has increased. JD Vance was the most prominent of those who have floated these ideas, musing over the weekend that -judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.- Such statements have sparked worries among Democrats and legal scholars that the Trump administration will create a constitutional crisis by defying the courts. You can expect to hear plenty more about that today, as the president’s campaign, and the legal battle it has created, continues. Here’s what else we are watching for: Trump will host King Abdullah II of Jordan at the White House beginning at 11.30am, then sign unspecified executive orders at 3pm. Yesterday’s orders included new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and regulations to hold off on enforcing an anti-bribery law. Today may be the day that House Republicans release details of their big bill that is expected to cut taxes and government spending and pay for Trump administration priorities such as mass deportations. Mike Johnson and his team have a press conference scheduled for 10am. Hamas said they are holding off on the release of future Israeli hostages over breaches of the ceasefire deal, prompting Trump to say -let hell break out- if more aren’t freed by Saturday.

Top Republican condemns Elon Musk for ‘supplication’ to China in new book	Exclusive: Tom Cotton, Senate intelligence chair, risks angering key Trump ally with harsh words for ‘tech titans’ In a new book, the Arkansas senator Tom Cotton condemns Elon Musk for -chasing Chinese dollars- and having -shamefully supplicated China’s Communist rulers-, in order to advance his own interests as chief executive of companies including Tesla and SpaceX.

First Thing: Musk-led group bids $97.4bn for control of OpenAI	OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the offer will not be accepted. Plus, $500m of food aid could spoil amid USAid cuts Good morning. Elon Musk leads a consortium of investors that on Monday submitted a bid of $97.4bn for -all assets- of the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, with Musk escalating his feud with OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman. What did the bidders say? -If Sam Altman and the present OpenAI, Inc. board of directors are intent on becoming a fully for-profit corporation, it is vital that the charity be fairly compensated for what its leadership is taking away from it: control over the most transformative technology of our time,- said Marc Toberoff, the attorney representing the investors. How did Altman respond? Altman posted on X: -no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74bn if you want.- Musk bought Twitter in 2022 for $44bn and renamed it X.

Assisted dying bill has lost Commons majority now high court signoff abandoned, says MP – UK politics live	Danny Kruger says those who backed the bill did so under false premise after change to safeguards announced Good morning. In parliament MPs and peers don’t simply vote yes or no on proposed legislation. They debate it at length, over weeks and months, and consider amendments line by line. This process is at the heart of parliamentary democracy, and it happens like this so that bills, in theory, can be improved before they reach the statute book. There is a good example of this today. The terminally ill adults (end of life) bill is perhaps the most consequential bill going through this session of parliament and the Labour MP who has sponsored it, Kim Leadbeater, has announced a significant change. As Jessica Elgot reports, she wants to scrap the requirement for an assisted dying application to be approved by a high court judge, because the judiciary said this process would be too time-consuming and would clog up the courts. Instead an expert panel, with a legal chair, would vet the assisted dying applications already approved by two doctors.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/11/assisted-dying-bill-high-court-judge-kim-leadbetter-danny-kruger-keir-starmer-labour-uk-politics-live-news	2025-02-11T01:29:28-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e404adb8611a601af5a30bc11cb7a770fc34452c/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=09f17ad23a4bfa571b2073a994d71ce5

Tuesday briefing: Will Labour’s own ‘go home’ moment work – or lead to more desperate measures?	In today’s newsletter: As the Home Office trails a tough new stance against illegal immigration, Daniel Trilling explains what an alternative approach might look like Good morning. Last night, the Home Office published footage of a group of men being escorted from a bus onto a deportation flight. With that release, the Labour government gains the dubious honour of being the first to publish that kind of footage. It follows the publication on Sunday of video showing immigration raids on illegal workers, and comes as ministers announce that nearly 19,000 refused asylum seekers, foreign criminals and other immigration offenders had been returned to their home countries since the election. Labour explains that it has a good story to tell. All of this makes for bleak viewing – and that’s the point. The Labour government is pushing a well-trailed effort to counter Reform and the Conservatives on immigration by showing it is every bit as tough as its rivals. As well as the videos, there are Facebook ads – styled in Reform’s signature turquoise – and a leaflet resembling a red-top newspaper declaring that -Labour is tackling illegal immigration-. Taken together, the implication is clear: the hostile environment has not gone away. Trump tariffs | Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum on Monday, ramping up his controversial bid to boost the US economy by hiking taxes on imports from overseas. The changes are not due to come into effect until 4 March, raising the prospect of the White House brokering deals with governments seeking reprieve. Assisted dying | MPs are to scrap the requirement for a high court judge to decide on assisted dying cases, with an expert panel to scrutinise decisions instead. The removal of mandatory high court involvement is likely to worry MPs who had been reassured the safeguards were uniquely robust. Israel-Gaza war | Hamas has said it is delaying the release of Israeli hostages indefinitely over -violations- of the ceasefire deal, prompting Israel’s defence minister to order the military to prepare for -any scenario in Gaza-. Mediators now fear that the three-week old ceasefire is in jeopardy. UK politics | Labour was warned more than a year ago about a -vile- WhatsApp group involving two of the party’s MPs, local councillors and a series of offensive messages, the Guardian has been told. The disclosure came as the MP Oliver Ryan was suspended over his membership of the group a day after health minister Andrew Gwynne was sacked and suspended by the party. Technology | Elon Musk escalated his feud with OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman on Monday, leading a consortium of investors that announced it had submitted a bid of $97.4bn for -all assets- of the artificial intelligence company. Altman rejected the offer and suggested he would buy X from Musk for a tenth of that price.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/tuesday-briefing-first-edition-labour-illegal-immigration-raids	2025-02-10T22:51:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6850010e76a0a1e64425bc146bca7640b55a2a63/0_84_3379_2027/master/3379.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c1e00d3f591124c548151bf266e88e03

Far-right populists much more likely than the left to spread fake news – study	Amplifying misinformation is now part of radical right strategy, says Dutch study of tweets by MPs in 26 countries Far-right populists are significantly more likely to spread fake news on social media than politicians from mainstream or far-left parties, according to a study which argues that amplifying misinformation is now part and parcel of radical right strategy. -Radical right populists are using misinformation as a tool to destabilise democracies and gain political advantage,- said Petter Törnberg of the University of Amsterdam, a co-author of the study with Juliana Chueri of the Dutch capital’s Free University.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/far-right-mps-fake-news-misinformation-left-study	2025-02-10T21:00:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09906be333764870be06058b52a3a6af1d42d7db/0_323_3625_2176/master/3625.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f2207313a09d99f2ab5b3d6ecb65c0cd

Lucy Letby and the medical experts who believe she is innocent – podcast	She was called the worst child serial killer in Britain in modern times. So why are medical experts saying her conviction is unsafe? Josh Halliday and Felicity Lawrence report Lucy Letby was convicted for the murder and attempted murder of more than a dozen babies. She has been called the worst child serial killer the UK had seen. But even before the trial was over experts had begun raising concerns about her conviction. Then, last week, came a bombshell press conference in which a panel of renowned neonatal experts said they believed not just that Letby’s conviction was unsafe - but that there was no murder or deliberate harm. Instead they said the deaths had been caused by a series of factors including understaffing and a lack of skills on the ward to treat the babies they were caring for. So what is the evidence that the panel was looking at and why do so many questions seem to swirl around the Letby trial?	https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/feb/11/lucy-letby-and-the-medical-experts-who-believe-she-is-innocent-podcast	2025-02-10T19:00:05-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/921b1f342a3da5476688e7e6b85dff3ddff967e4/48_0_1769_1062/master/1769.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=01bad96d03fa2790b27c3257a69ebc91

Middle East crisis live: Trump says Gaza ceasefire should be cancelled if hostage release delayed	US president said it was ultimately up to Israel but he warned that ‘all hell is going to break out’ if the remaining hostages aren’t released on Saturday Hello and welcome to our live coverage of events in the Middle East. The latest development is that US President Donald Trump has said that if all the hostages held in Gaza are not returned by Saturday at noon he would propose canceling the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and letting -all hell break loose.- Donald Trump said his plan to -take over Gaza- would not include a right of return for the more than 2 million Palestinians that he has said have -no alternative- but to leave because of the destruction left by Israel’s military campaign. Trump continued to endorse a plan for the Palestinians to be resettled in Egypt and Jordan, a plan that both countries have rejected. The remarks are the latest effective endorsement of ethnic cleansing by the US president. Hamas’s announcement prompted Israel’s defence minister to put the country’s military on alert with orders to prepare for -any scenario in Gaza-. Israel’s security cabinet has moved forward a meeting to discuss negotiations on second phase, which had been set for Tuesday evening. The army has cancelled all leave for soldiers in the Gaza division, the Kan news outlet reported, in a sign that Israeli authorities are preparing for the resumption of war. Mediators fear a breakdown of the three-week-old ceasefire and have postponed talks until they receive a clear indication of Washington’s intent to continue with the phased deal, according to reports. Qatar had reportedly warned Israeli officials at the weekend that even the first stage of the ceasefire deal was being put in jeopardy by provocative statements from Benjamin Netanyahu and by his government’s approach to talks on a second stage. Israeli police raided a leading Palestinian-owned bookshop in Jerusalem and detained two of its owners, accusing them of selling books that supported terrorism, including a children’s colouring book entitled From the Jordan to the Sea. Karim Khan, the international criminal court’s (ICC) chief prosecutor, is the person to be hit with economic and travel sanctions authorised by Trump that target the court over investigations of US citizens or US allies, the White House has confirmed. The US president signed an executive order last week authorising aggressive economic sanctions against the ICC, accusing the body of -illegitimate and baseless actions- targeting the US and Israel. A former UK supreme court judge described Israel’s assault on Gaza as -grossly disproportionate- and said there was -at least an arguable case- that it was genocidal. Lord Sumption, who served on the UK’s highest court from 2012 to 2018, was one of the highest profile signatories of a letter last year warning that the UK government was breaching international law by arming Israel.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/11/middle-east-crisis-live-blog-donald-trump-gaza-ceasefire-hostages	2025-02-10T15:23:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a0cea33ea9f8841d6be379f2b87cda689e7d7a3/0_256_7680_4608/master/7680.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e457e9bd7a19a45b85b83d01930fc982

Minister defends plan to broadcast footage of deportation of illegal workers – UK politics live	Angela Eagle defends government plan to broadcast deportations as Home Office launches new immigration raids The Labour MP Oliver Ryan is to meet the government chief whip to decide on any sanctions over his membership of a WhatsApp group that featured racist, sexist and other offensive comments, Angela Eagle has said. Peter Walker has the story. Good morning. Politicians like to claim that they are completely different from their opponents, because to win elections they need dividing line issues, but in truth the similarities can be striking too, because they end up facing the same challenges, and the electorate does not change much either. This Labour government is not the same as the last Conservative one. But at times it has sounded like Rishi Sunak (it adopted his signature anti-smoking legislation wholesale), Liz Truss (ministers constantly stress that growth is the number one priority) and even Boris Johnson (after the negativism of last year’s budget, there is a pivot towards more optimism). And today it it is sounding a bit like Theresa May in her -hostile environment- phase as home secretary. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, is expected to join an early morning raid this week targeting illegal working, while the government will broadcast footage of deportations, a number of them involving foreign criminals, from detention to removal centres and on to waiting planes … Downing Street is planning to go beyond simply taking the fight to Reform. -We don’t think it’s enough just to look strong on migration, we actually need to be strong.

Emmanuel Macron hosts AI summit, while EU braces for Trump tariffs – Europe live	Tech conference will also mark first visit to Europe for new US vice-president JD Vance Responding to Trump’s comments on aluminium and steel tariffs overnight, the EU has just said that it had not received any official notification yet, but insisted there was no justification of any such move and it would be ready to respond if needed. A spokesperson for the European Commission said: We will not respond to broad announcements without details or written clarification. The EU sees no justification for the imposition of tariffs on its exports. We will react to protect the interests of European businesses, workers and consumers from unjustified measures. In general: The imposition of tariffs would be unlawful and economically counterproductive, especially given the deeply integrated production chains the EU and U.S. established through transatlantic trade and investment. Tariffs are essentially taxes. By imposing tariffs, the U.S. would be taxing its own citizens, raising costs for business, and fuelling inflation. Moreover, tariffs heighten economic uncertainty and disrupt the efficiency and integration of global markets.

Ukraine war live: Zelenskyy ready for talks if given ‘an understanding that US and Europe will not abandon us’	Ukrainian president’s comments came as Donald Trump indicated he had been in contact with Russia’s Vladimir Putin Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he would be ready for talks in any format if he has -an understanding that America and Europe will not abandon us-. Chinese President Xi Jinping has accepted Russia’s invitation to Moscow to attend second world war commemorations, Tass state news agency reported on Monday. Trump’s national security adviser Mike Waltz said on Sunday that senior US diplomats would be in Europe this week -talking through the details of how to end this war and that will mean getting both sides to the table-. In an interview on NBC Waltz said the Russian economy was not doing well and that Trump -is prepared to tax, to tariff, to sanction- Moscow to get Putin to the negotiating table. He added that the Trump administration is looking to use this week’s engagements to begin talks on clawing back some of the United States’ assistance to Ukraine nd said European allies would need to take a greater role in supporting Ukraine. Russia’s deputy foreign minister said Moscow had yet to receive a good offer to start talks on Ukraine, in remarks published on Monday. -It is important that words be backed up by practical steps that take into account Russia’s legitimate interests, demonstrating a readiness to eradicate the root causes of the crisis and recognise the new realities,- Mikhail Galuzin told Ria state news agency in an interview. -Concrete proposals of this nature have not yet been received,- he said. Russia launched an overnight drone attack on Kyiv, injuring a woman and damaging several houses in the northeastern city of Sumy, Ukrainian officials said on Monday. The Ukrainian military said on Monday that it had shot down 61 out of 83 drones with 22 more likely downed by electronic warfare. Russia said on Sunday that its forces had captured the eastern Ukrainian village of Orikhovo-Vasylivka, near the strategic military hub of Chasiv Yar that Moscow is attempting to seize. An explosion on Sunday on an oil tanker at a port in north-west Russia forced the crew to evacuate and was being investigated, the country’s federal shipping agency said. The Rosmorrechflot maritime and river transport agency wrote on Telegram that -an explosion took place in the engine room- of the Koala in Ust-Luga port west of St Petersburg on Sunday morning.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/10/ukraine-war-live-zelenskyy-trump-talks-us-europe-russia-latest-news	2025-02-10T00:32:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d055b35d6eb51a2267b8fdc4020c77f905e2cbbf/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=59f3504a81fdb57a41857e8bcb068dd2

Middle East crisis live: returning Palestinians ‘shocked’ by ‘complete scale of destruction’ of northern Gaza	Unicef says many displaced people had hoped their homes had been spared, but have returned to total devastation Welcome back to our live coverage of the latest news from the Middle East. Displaced Palestinian families who have returned to northern Gaza since the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas came into effect last month have been -shocked- by the -complete scale of destruction- of their homes and neighbourhoods, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef). The families that I’ve spoken to this week here in the north of Gaza have been shocked by what they have returned to. They’ve been shocked by the complete scale of this destruction. Even after seeing photos and videos from the south, they hoped that their homes, their neighborhoods, their communities, maybe had been spared. Egypt will host an Arab summit on 27 February to discuss what it said were -serious- developments for Palestinian people, according to the country’s foreign ministry. Egypt has rejected Donald Trump’s plans – condemned as ethnic cleansing - to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank to neighbouring countries such as Egypt and Jordan. Speaking on Sunday, the US President repeated his pledge to take control of the Gaza Strip. -I’m committed to buying and owning Gaza. As far as us rebuilding it, we may give it to other states in the Middle East to build sections of it. Other people may do it through our auspices. But we’re committed to owning it, taking it, and making sure that Hamas doesn’t move back. There’s nothing to move back into. The place is a demolition site. The remainder will be demolished,- he told reporters. A spokesperson for Israeli prime minster Benjamin Netanyahu said that an Israeli delegation arrived in Qatar on Sunday for further ceasefire talks between Hamas and Israel. Reuters reports that indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas on the next stage of the ceasefire are set to begin this week.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/10/middle-east-crisis-live-palestinians-complete-destruction-northern-gaza-latest-news	2025-02-09T23:51:54-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85754371c4999963567a264f47c0e1179e33efc7/0_209_6260_3757/master/6260.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7b4acfd65ee2f2a9931be04665e88d68
Monday briefing: Why the brutal fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo could spiral into wider war	In today’s newsletter: As Rwandan-backed M23 rebels seize more territory and the humanitarian crisis worsens, what’s the background to the war and prospect of peace? Good morning. Over the weekend, the presidents of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda – Félix Tshisekedi and Paul Kagame – were among those who took part in a regional summit aimed at ending the resurgent violence in eastern DRC. The summit ended with a call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. But while there was a lull in the fighting yesterday, many fear that a ceasefire is less likely than escalation to a wider regional war. Rwanda does not officially admit to its involvement in the latest episode of the long-running and devastating conflict in eastern DRC. But M23, an armed group with Rwanda’s tacit and practical support, has taken the capital of North Kivu province, Goma, and is now moving south to expand the territory under its control. At stake is control of a mineral-rich region of crucial strategic significance, and the fate of civilians there who are frequently the subject of ethnically targeted attacks – but also the question of whether national borders can act as any sort of constraint. Arms trade | Britain’s system for controlling arms exports is broken, subject to political manipulation and has seen conduct that crossed the threshold into complicity with war crimes, a former UK diplomat has claimed. Mark Smith said officials were instructed to manipulate findings on the misuse of UK arms by allies. Immigration | The Home Office is launching a fresh wave of immigration raids as Labour attempts to counter the growing political threat from Reform UK. Amid anger from critics who believe the approach echoes Theresa May’s -hostile environment- regime, the government will broadcast footage of deportations from detention to removal centres and on to waiting planes. Israel-Gaza war | Israeli forces have withdrawn from the strategic corridor that divides northern and southern Gaza, as part of a ceasefire plan that has brought a fragile pause to the 16-month war. Despite the withdrawal – and the release of hostages and prisoners – little progress has been made on negotiating the second phase of the deal. Air pollution | More than 1,100 people a year in the UK are developing the most prevalent form of lung cancer as a result of air pollution, the Guardian can reveal. Health experts, cancer charities and environmental campaigners said the UK findings were -devastating- Trump tariffs | Donald Trump has said he will announce new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the US on Monday that would affect -everybody’, including its largest trading partners Canada and Mexico, in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/10/monday-briefing-why-the-brutal-conflict-in-the-democratic-republic-of-congo-could-spiral-into-wider-war	2025-02-09T22:53:17-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80e2fafb43e0d8e758c182d76562fdb8d12436d5/0_352_5651_3392/master/5651.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40778a090c4c3570294644c7f90a0d05

‘Finally this is justice’: the Assad torture survivors who guard their former jail	Men imprisoned and abused at the notorious Palestine branch detention centre return to the facility as free men The first thing the three militants did on entering Syria’s notorious Palestine branch prison as free men was to search for their former solitary confinement cells. They crossed under the towering iron gates and barbed wire at the edge of the Damascus complex after the fall of Bashar al-Assad and headed immediately to the squalid cells just a few feet wide where they had spent years huddled in the dark, staring at the back of the heavy metal doors and drawing on the walls.

Why Trump blinked before imposing his ‘beautiful’ tariffs on Canada and Mexico	Trump has teased two of the US’s biggest trading partners with levies but has moved the goalpost at least three times in two weeks Donald Trump was in his element in the Oval Office this week. Surrounded by cameras, flanked by billionaire allies and confronted by a barrage of questions about whether he was really prepared to unleash a trade war on the US’s closest neighbors, the president talked tough. By his telling, powerful economies were scrambling to bend to his will. Hours earlier, Mexico had announced a series of measures to shore up its border, prompting the White House to hastily postpone the imposition of 25% tariffs on all its goods; Canada would announce similar measures, and receive the same reprieve, later that day.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/09/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china	2025-02-09T05:00:01-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e6f48fc5a55df678120527b901ed80a3fc706f1/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5018f35d495d58b390673e3ebd3338c9

Nigel Farage has been a threat to every recent UK prime minister. But this is something new	Reform has surged in the polls, panicking both Labour and the Conservatives. It’s a trap, and the risks are high Nigel Farage is making trouble again. Reform, his latest political vehicle, has surged in the polls, moving into first place with some pollsters, and ruffling feathers on Labour back benches. While Farage has caused headaches for every prime minister since David Cameron, his recent rise is something new. Reform scored an average of almost 25% in January polls, past the peaks achieved by Ukip or the Brexit party in earlier parliaments. And while past Farage surges were spikes driven by circumstances – European parliament elections, the EU referendum, the collapse of Theresa May’s ­government – the current rise is more sustained. This Farage boom is no bubble.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/08/nigel-farage-reform-uk-labour-conservatives	2025-02-08T09:08:58-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27cb4b7895a349500e0a756d1b6e692923974cb0/0_202_8192_4915/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e434bb7a8998d89aaa5e2f4d8c0c0705

Rediscovered, a young English novelist’s warning of the Nazi threat	Crooked Cross, Sally Carson’s ‘electrifying masterpiece’ from 1934, to be republished Sally Carson was not an oracle or a prophet, just a young woman from Dorset, born in 1901. Yet she foresaw a dark and violent future for Europe and gave voice to those fears in a 1934 novel that is now being hailed as -an electrifying masterpiece-. Carson’s book, Crooked Cross, predicted the scale of the Nazi threat and is to be republished for the first time this spring, ahead of the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war. Controversial in its day, her novel had to walk a careful path to avoid the accusation that it was alarmist about the Fuhrer’s aims. A stage adaptation of her story was even censored, shorn of all its -Heil Hitlers-.	https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/feb/08/rediscovered-a-young-english-novelists-warning-of-the-nazi-threat	2025-02-07T21:00:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f493fd41ed958183bd48f6351bea672f8b43bf1c/0_577_3292_1975/master/3292.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=be1ee4a42b29d9c98c079301de44cd7a
‘We make the most of every minute’: relief and resolve at Gaza’s few reopened restaurants	Palestinians find moment of respite in going out to dinner or relaxing in cafes as devastated territory seeks to rebuild It is a Thursday night in Khan Younis and business is good at the al-Sawafiri restaurant. Not far away, entire blocks have been reduced to rubble, but here, in this small corner of the city in the southern Gaza Strip, the damage is less extensive. Raed al-Sawafiri, the owner and manager, stands in front of chicken rotating on a grill and smiles. Every one of his plastic tables is occupied. Al-Sawafiri had no experience of the restaurant trade until very recently. Displaced 10 times during the 16-month conflict in Gaza, the 23-year-old opened his first establishment in Rafah, the southernmost city in the territory, early this year, after sourcing old equipment and sending his father to the border with Egypt to buy meat.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/08/gaza-restaurants-khan-younis-ceasefire-war	2025-02-07T21:00:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ee1be8c819e5c64524cbb56beb8103b827457a8/0_341_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6f6b9be2204cac59c07341a9989d4e78

Trump’s orders include the abrupt firing of 17 agency watchdogs called inspectors general without giving Congress the required 30 days’ notice, the rejection of birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants, which is guaranteed by the 14th amendment, and pardons for more than 1,500 people convicted for their roles in the January 6 Capitol insurrection.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/07/trump-executive-actions-democracy	2025-02-07T03:00:42-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3c38934d4b9bf61bf5a7e5502cfaed3b0935315/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b927889136057bc2d11211ab7986dbb9

Trump’s Gaza plan suggests his pro-settler advisers are in the ascendant	Idea of US occupying Gaza and pushing out the Palestinians delights Israel’s pro-settler movement and its US allies Donald Trump’s plan for Gaza has no cost estimates or budget. There are no troop estimates or outlines in the Pentagon. Even Donald Trump’s allies have admitted that his proposal for the US to -take over- Gaza and for Palestinians to make their homes elsewhere was an idea he had only tinkered with before Tuesday evening, when it tumbled out to the obvious surprise of his closest aides. One of the very few constituencies to welcome the proposal – which if enacted would amount to the effective ethnic cleansing of the territory – was Israel’s rightwing pro-settler movement and their allies in the US. In these circles there is optimism that the shifting US policy gives the green light to settlement expansion or even the eventual annexation of all the occupied Palestinian territories, including the West Bank.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/07/trumps-gaza-plan-suggests-his-pro-settler-advisers-are-in-the-ascendant	2025-02-07T02:03:54-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/530e4383f554502e7e68883489965326c465e093/0_342_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d2557e86adde8e06e56e08c732119c31

Some people on sickness and disability benefits ‘taking the mickey’, says Liz Kendall – UK politics live	The work and pensions secretary said those who think they were unable to work probably could with the right support Good morning. Keir Starmer is chairing an extended meeting of cabinet today. There will be a normal cabinet meeting, and then a political cabinet, where ministers will discuss the many challenges facing the government in a party political context. They won’t be in Downing Street, and it has been described by some people as an away days, but it is not one of those away days that involves a spa hotel in the countryside. They will be somewhere in Whitehall apparently, but being out of Downing Street should provide a change of scene. One of the problems the government needs to address soon is what to do about the rising cost of working-age people on sickness and disability benefits. A recent inquiry by the Lords economic affairs committee found that that there are 3.7m, people of working-age on health-related benefits – up 1.2m on the figure five years ago – and that incapcity and disability benefits are costing almost £65bn, more than the government spends on defence. Kendall said that some people on sickness and disability benefits who think they could not do a job probably could work with the right support. Asked about a DWP survey saying 49% of people on these benefits think they will never be able to work, Kendall said: I don’t blame people for thinking that they can’t, because they’re stuck on a waiting list for treatment. They haven’t had the proper support that they might need from the job centre or the skills that they need to get the jobs, we’ve also got to create more jobs in the areas that need them most. So I’m under no illusions about the scale of the challenge that we’ve got. I believe more of those people could work. But even if we just start with those who say they can, we need to do more to get them back into work. She said that the government’s drive to cut waiting lists would make a difference. She said: When 2 in 5 of people on sickness and disability benefits are stuck on an NHS waiting list, we’ve got to drive those down. That’s why health secretary Wes Streeting has got a big plan to drive down that backlog, get people the help they need. She said there were some people claiming sickness and disability benefits who were -taking the mickey-. Asked if she agreed with people who think that too many claimants are just pretending they cannot work, she replied: If you speak to people here today, you will know that many of them have either just lost jobs that they desperately miss, or really want to get back into to work once they’ve got their health condition under control. So I think that there are many more people who want to work. I have no doubt, as there always have been, there are people who shouldn’t be on those benefits who are taking the mickey and that is not good enough - we have to end that. She suggested that some young people might have to adjust more to having to work. Asked if she agreed that some conditions were being over-medicalised, and that people were taking time off for anxiety when in the past that might just have been regarded as normal worry, she replied: I think there is genuinely a problem with many young people, particularly the Covid generation. But we can’t have a situation where doing a day’s work is in itself seen as stressful. I went to visit one of my local supermarkets recently to see the brilliant work they’re doing with the charity to get young people into work. And we saw two things. One was young people with genuine mental health problems who the supermarket was doing great stuff to help them get work and stay in work.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/07/liz-kendall-benefits-welfare-angela-rayner-grenfell-tower-uk-politics-live-news-updates	2025-02-07T01:30:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea5ab1324564526581acc8830e74948b8a15cbba/469_297_4649_2791/master/4649.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1bd8ada294a19cc9ca6d1d3d6a760b98
US politics live: Trump administration sued by largest government workers’ union over dismantling of USAid	American Federation of Government Employees and American Foreign Service Association seeks order to block ‘unconstitutional actions’ Good morning, Donald Trump has signed an executive order authorising unprecedented and aggressive sanctions against the international criminal court (ICC), accusing the body of -illegitimate and baseless actions- targeting the US and Israel. Leaders of the southern California city of San Clemente, which lies between Los Angeles and San Diego, are partnering with US Customs and Border Protection to place surveillance cameras along the city’s beach to detect boats carrying passengers attempting to enter the country without authorization. -People have observed pangas crammed with illegal aliens, hitting our beach, and then scattering in the community or jumping into a van, which is parked nearby and ready to receive them,- Knoblock told the LA Times. The largest US government workers’ union and an association of foreign service workers sued the Trump administration on Thursday in an effort to reverse its aggressive dismantling of the US Agency for International Development. The lawsuit, filed in Washington, DC federal court by the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Foreign Service Association, seeks an order blocking what it says are -unconstitutional and illegal actions- that have created a -global humanitarian crisis- Donald Trump demanded the -termination- of 60 Minutes, a staple of US broadcast news. The move is a continuation of the president’s vendetta against the media that also included baseless claims that money from the country’s beleaguered foreign aid body had been illicitly funding news organisations. Trump said: -CBS should lose its license, and the cheaters at 60 Minutes should all be thrown out, and this disreputable ‘NEWS’ show should be immediately terminated.- Donald Trump’s shutdown of USAid has already had disastrous effects on humanitarian aid and development programmes around the world, but it has also ceded ground to the US’s chief rival, China, analysts have said. -[The US is handing] on a silver platter to China the perfect opportunity to expand its influence, at a time when China’s economy is not doing very well,- said professor Huang Yanzhong, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. The NCAA changed its participation policy for transgender athletes on Thursday, limiting competition in women’s sports to athletes assigned female at birth. The move came one day after Donald Trump signed an executive order intended to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports. Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly gave Donald Trump a -golden pager- during their meeting in Washington DC this week, in an apparent reference to Israel’s deadly attack against Hezbollah in Lebanon last year.In photos circulating online, the golden pager can be seen mounted on a piece of wood, accompanied by a golden plaque that reads in black lettering: -To President Donald J.

Middle East live: Netanyahu applauds Trump’s ‘bold’ ICC sanctions	Israeli PM thanks Trump for executive order; Amnesty chief says sanctions seek to ‘destroy what the international community has painstakingly constructed’ Hello, and welcome to our live coverage of developments in the Middle East. It’s nearly XY am in Gaza and Jerusalem and if you are just tuning in, there is plenty to catch up on. Rights activists have strongly criticised Donald Trump’s sanctioning of the international criminal court (ICC). The US president’s announcement, in which he claimed the court had targeted the US and its close ally, Israel, came two days after he declared the US would take over Gaza and envisioned the area as the -Riviera of the Middle East-. Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the ICC, which accuses the ICC of having -engaged in illegitimate and baseless actions- targeting the US and its -close ally- Israel. It said the court -abused its power- by issuing -baseless- arrest warrants targeting Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and its former defence minister, Yoav Gallant. Trump has doubled down on his proposal to -take ownership- of Gaza despite widespread opposition. In a Truth Social post, Trump said the Palestinian territory would be -turned over- to the US by Israel after it concludes its military offensive against Hamas. Netanyahu, who is in Washington, said it is -worth listening carefully- to Trump’s proposal. Globally, the proposal to relocate 2.3 million Palestinians to other countries has provoked outrage. Trump’s proposal would -squash- the ceasefire and -incite a return of fighting-, Egypt’s foreign ministry said. Russia called Trump’s proposal -counterproductive- and accused him of fuelling -tension in the region-. China’s foreign ministry said Beijing opposed the forced transfer of people in Gaza. Pakistan described Trump’s plan as -deeply troubling and unjust-, while Iran said it -categorically rejected and condemned- Trump’s proposal. US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Palestinians in Gaza are -going to have to live somewhere else in the interim-, describing Gaza as -not habitable- in comments that appeared to walk back on Trump’s proposal about transferring Palestinians permanently to neighbouring countries. Rubio will travel to Europe and the Middle East next week, a senior State Department official said Thursday. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, ordered the military to prepare plans to allow Palestinians -who wish to leave- Gaza to exit. Asked who should take the residents of Gaza, Katz said it should be countries who have opposed Israel’s military operations since the 7 October attacks, he said. He also claimed that Spain, Ireland, and Norway, who all last year recognised a Palestinian state, are -legally obligated to allow any Gaza resident to enter their territories-. In violation of a ceasefire deal, Israel said late on Thursday it had struck two sites in Lebanon that allegedly contained weapons of the Hezbollah group. Israeli forces -conducted a precise strike in Lebanese territory on two military sites that contained Hezbollah weapons, which were in violation of the ceasefire agreement,- the army said in a post on X. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) warned the agency faces an -existential threat- after Israel formally banned it from operating on its territory. Philippe Lazzarini also described Trump’s Gaza proposal as -totally unrealistic-, adding: -We are talking about forced displacement. Forced displacement is a crime, an international crime. It’s ethnic cleansing.- Human Rights Watch warned that Trump’s proposal could move the US -from being complicit in war crimes to direct perpetration of atrocities-. Forced or coerced displacement is a crime against humanity, illegal under the Geneva conventions, to which Israel and the US are signatories. -Governments should together make clear their strong opposition to Trump’s call for forced displacement in Gaza and take action to prevent further atrocities against the Palestinian people,- said HRW Middle East and North Africa director Lama Fakih. At least 47,583 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli attacks since October 2023, according to the Palestinian health ministry on Thursday. The ministry’s latest daily update also said that a total of 111,633 have now been injured. Israel informed the United Nations human rights council (UNHRC) that it is formally withdrawing from the body. Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said the decision was reached -in light of the ongoing and unrelenting institutional bias against Israel in the human rights council.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/07/middle-east-live-donald-trump-gaza-benjamin-netanyahu-icc-latest-news-updates	2025-02-06T22:33:43-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ef2ce4c2dfd01567cbd6b7325a4ffbfadd39632/0_191_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ebe76f0385018b48de6c2d179c98a0fd

US cedes ground to China with ‘self-inflicted wound’ of USAid shutdown, analysts say	Sudden suspension of aid funding a ‘perfect opportunity’ for Beijing to fill the gap and grow its own soft power Donald Trump’s shutdown of USAid has already had disastrous effects on humanitarian aid and development programmes around the world, but it has also ceded ground to the US’s chief rival, China, analysts have said. The result of the sudden 90-day suspension of USAid funding – which accounts for 40% of global foreign aid – has been chaos: employees locked out of offices, humanitarian shipments left to rot, and lifesaving assistance stopped. Around the world, development programmes previously assisted by the USAid are panicking, warning of disastrous risks of escalating famine, death and disease.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/07/donald-trump-usaid-shutdown-impact-china-relationship-funding	2025-02-06T20:30:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6fe6db214c9f90b535828ac31e05d615514331e/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c9e8013b82c0195c85288251ee642427

Follow the latest news live Dutton coy on what public servant jobs he will slash if he wins election Peter Dutton, of course, says he wants to cut the size of the federal government and has promised to slash civil service jobs in what appears to be an attempt to live up to the Howard dictum. It’s a huge mistake for a centre-Right party to assume that a disgruntled conservative has -nowhere else to go-. That arrogant attitude cost the Liberal party in Australia dear in the 2022 election. In the UK they now have Reform to go to. These are the invariable default definitions trotted out. Yet the reality often falls short, and that creates a credibility deficit. The voting public will no longer accept the excuse that taxes would be higher under leftwing governments as a substitute for actual tax relief under conservative ones. Central to the success of future centre-right governments will be their capacity to actually deliver on tax and smaller government – and not just talk.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/feb/07/northern-territory-remote-services-funding-labor-coalition-election-donald-trump-gaza-plan-reaction-ntwnfb	2025-02-06T12:14:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b2f67c91f8b5b8a6af4b0c1f887f5c1002cceef/0_68_6509_3908/master/6509.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3f93846e879d56f4d927655fdd8ed944

Yet the announcement seems like yet another sign that the president, while sometimes distancing himself from the neoconservative foreign policies that entangled the US in Iraq and Afghanistan, is willing to pursue – or at least entertain pursuing – an undisguised US imperialism that has more in common with the expansionism of Teddy Roosevelt and Andrew Jackson, the 19th and early-20th century presidents associated with some of American’s most brazen and violent conquests.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/06/trump-gaza-netanyahu-imperialism-roosevelt-jackson	2025-02-06T04:00:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed4af8d716991a64907dcb1e479a01a9a3b39f3d/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2541b675309b8e197e9c4a67a16206a6

Thursday briefing: The outlandish plan to turn Gaza into a ‘riviera of the Middle East’	In today’s newsletter: Donald Trump’s proposal is an attempt to reshape political reality that has historical precedent, explains architect and researcher Eyal Weizman Good morning. Donald Trump’s suggestion that Palestinians should be forced out of Gaza so that it could be rebuilt as a US-run -Riviera of the Middle East- is so outlandish that many have returned to the reminder that we should beware of taking what he says too literally. And, it’s true, the comments don’t seem as if they came on the back of a detailed feasibility study; White House officials spent much of yesterday trying to walk his comments back. But it’s also true that his proposal, which if enacted would amount to an unambiguous case of ethnic cleansing, tells us something about who Trump understands to be the stakeholders in Gaza’s future: not Palestinian civilians, but the United States, Israel, and the contractors who could make it happen. And the idea has so delighted the Israeli right that it is easy to see how, even if no American soldier ever sets foot in Gaza, it creates the space for serious discussion of the same project by other means.

Middle East crisis live: White House walks back Trump’s Gaza ‘takeover’ comments in face of widespread international anger	Secretary of state Marco Rubio says Trump comments should not be seen as ‘hostile move’; Netanyahu says ‘remarkable idea’ should be pursued Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that there was nothing wrong in Donald Trump’s idea of displacing Palestinians from Gaza after the US president’s proposal drew international criticism. Rights groups have condemned as ethnic cleansing Trump’s suggestion the previous day that Palestinians in the territory should be permanently displaced, while also proposing a US takeover of Gaza. Defence secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon was prepared to look at -all options- when it comes to Gaza. Hegseth made the comments on Wednesday before meeting with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, reportedly said the US president does not want to put any American troops into Gaza. -Witkoff said that the president doesn’t want to put any troops into Gaza, and that he doesn’t want to spend any US money on Gaza,- the Republican senator for Missouri, Josh Hawley, said, according to the Washington Post. Peace through strength is a concept Israel shares with the United States, Netanyahu said. -The only way to get peace, and enduring peace, is by being very, very strong,- he said, according to a readout of the meeting. -And with our alliance and your support, including the decision … of supplying Israel the much-needed tools for our defense, we are a lot stronger than we’ve ever been.- The UN said forcible deportation of people from occupied territory is -strictly prohibited- under international law, while Human Rights Watch said the policy would be a -moral abomination-. Amnesty International condemned Donald Trump’s comments as -inflammatory, outrageous and shameful-. International law experts said it could amount to a war crime or crime against humanity. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Gaza was -an integral part of the State of Palestine- and that -we will not allow the rights of our people … to be infringed on-. The estimated death toll in Gaza since the start of Israeli operations in the territory after the 7 October attacks reached 47,552, according to the Palestinian ministry of health on Wednesday.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/06/middle-east-crisis-live-white-house-walks-back-trumps-gaza-takeover-comments-in-face-of-widespread-international-anger	2025-02-05T22:35:25-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff709adc79faf9b774aab35fd222c4c819b79682/0_71_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=88b64fbaed0db1dfaf351258124d9508

Knock, knock! Who’s bear? California man returns to 525lb tenant in burned home	Samy Arbid’s home was spared by the Altadena fire, but he returned to find it was occupied by a 525lb black bear For those lucky enough to have homes to return to in Altadena, going home meant dealing with unfinished chores left behind when the Eaton fire forced them to evacuate. For some, that meant paying overdue bills or cleaning out freezers filled with rotting food, all in the midst of trauma and toxic surroundings. For Samy Arbid, who had moved into a home just a block from the fire line in November, there was a different kind of obstacle: a 525lb black bear.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/california-man-bear-neighbor	2025-02-05T14:37:05-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6436a6140a6c68cfe9b27ff01303e64fdeecb68/0_221_4032_2421/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=418c54651f4e02d53ddb61430b0f75d4
Bangladeshi protesters destroy ex-PM’s family home symbolising independence	Property from which Sheikh Hasina’s father declared break from Pakistan attacked due to link with authoritarianism Thousands of protesters in Bangladesh have taken out their anger at exiled former prime minister Sheikh Hasina by destroying a family home that came to symbolise the country’s independence – and now, they say, the authoritarianism they believe she stood for. The attack was sparked by a speech that Hasina planned to give to supporters from exile in neighbouring India, where she fled last year during a deadly student-led uprising against her 15-year rule.

Trump’s plan to own Gaza a throwback to 19th-century imperialism	It does not seem to occur to US administration that to the rest of the world they seem to be advocating a second Nakba Donald Trump’s vision of Gaza as a US-administered Riviera stripped of Palestinians indulges the fantasies of Israel’s extremist right, but also, if taken seriously, builds on an expansionist foreign policy that Trump has articulated since he took on the presidency. The outlook is more akin to mid-19th century US imperial thinking than the era of isolationism his election appeared to herald. Indeed the one moment Benjamin Netanyahu did not look delighted at Tuesday’s joint press conference was when Trump, negotiating in real time, referred to the US as being opposed to Israeli ownership of Gaza.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/trumps-plan-to-own-gaza-chimes-of-19th-century-imperialism	2025-02-05T09:46:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82d0146aa21e3b8a3516520a688a31f39c1bd8a3/306_635_6183_3712/master/6183.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=edfea944c8380254a9d1d1d92ff53862

RFK Jr’s claim about Black people’s immune systems is ‘unscientific and terrifying’	Kennedy’s hearing signifies how close a man with medically racist beliefs is to becoming the US’s leading health official During Robert F Kennedy Jr’s Senate confirmation hearing on 30 January, Angela Alsobrooks, a Democratic senator from Maryland, pressed the nominee on his past claims that Black people have a stronger immune system than white people, and thereby should receive vaccines on a different schedule than them. -What different vaccine schedule would you say I should have received?- Alsobrooks, who is Black, asked the health secretary nominee. Kennedy then referenced a -series of studies- showing that -to particular antigens, Blacks have a much stronger reaction-. The exchange is cause for alarm for many, as it signified how close a man who holds medically racist beliefs was to becoming the country’s leading health official.

Trump’s proposed EPA leadership stacked with lobbyists and attorneys	Guardian review of new political appointees also finds president is largely reappointing officials from his first term Donald Trump is stacking his proposed Environmental Protection Agency leadership with former industry lobbyists, executives, and attorneys who have spent their careers attacking protections covering everything from water quality to greenhouse gas emissions to toxic chemicals. A Guardian review of new political appointees also finds the president is largely reappointing officials from his first term. Since 2016, while working at the EPA or for industry, environmental campaigners say these veterans have led efforts to shred Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, kneecap drinking water limits for toxic PFAS, ram through new chemicals without proper review, undo an asbestos ban, or defend the nation’s biggest polluters.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/trump-epa-lobbyists-attorneys	2025-02-05T05:00:38-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50c022152121ce45825371c4c212bd0edfda47a6/0_361_5400_3239/master/5400.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=84a14c98d5d25759938fa697da54618a

Government rejects claim Chagos deal to cost £18bn amid growing Labour backlash – UK politics live	Foreign policy set to dominate PMQs amid unease over deal with Mauritius and Trump’s Gaza comments Good morning. PMQs is normally mostly about domestic politics, but today – despite the government doing its best to promote an announcement about a £2.65bn investment in flood defences – foreign policy may well dominate. That is partly because of President Trump, and his desire to leave office with the US territorially bigger than it was when it arrived (something that went out of fashion in most parts of the respectable world around the end of the 19th century). Last night Keir Starmer had dinner with the prime minister of Denmark, the country that has sovereignty over Greenland, and late last night No 10 put out a statement that slightly firmed up Starmer’s support for Denmark in its determination to see off Trump’s plan to buy/annex the vast, frozen island. More on that soon. This reporting is incorrect. The figures being quoted are entirely inaccurate and misleading. A person familiar with the views of one cabinet minister said they did not understand why the UK was agreeing to pay large sums of money to Mauritius at a time when the Treasury was telling UK government departments to prepare for spending cuts. A second person familiar with a different cabinet member’s views said Starmer should cancel the deal. Both suggested Starmer was acting on legal advice from Attorney General Richard Hermer. Making calls on this story to contacts in government last night, it became clear to me that some of the most senior people in government are opposed to this deal … Just looking through the words in my notebook, -terrible-, -mad-, -impossible to understand- – those are the words I can use, at least at this time of day on air. But there are other words in my notebook. And these are from very senior government sources. One MP who fears Nigel Farage’s outfit could be closing in on their marginal seat told Playbook the treaty would be -Reform rocket fuel.- -How am I supposed to tell my constituents that we took away their winter fuel allowance to pay a foreign country to take our sovereign territory?- they messaged to say.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/05/pmqs-chagos-islands-trump-gaza-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-uk-politics-live	2025-02-05T01:39:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06f1d3c3d7f167878498ab50e00929a92170270b/0_241_4940_2964/master/4940.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ca0642c9f5b1f81e3bfeefdcebe4bb5f

How the world’s richest man laid waste to the US government	Elon Musk has achieved astonishing power in Trump’s administration – and spent the weekend wielding it Since declaring his support for Donald Trump in July of last year and subsequently spending more than $250m on his re-election effort, Elon Musk has rapidly accumulated political influence and positioned himself at the heart of the new administration. Now as prominent as the president himself, he has begun to make use of that power, taking actions that could affect the health of millions of people, gaining access to highly sensitive personal data and attacking anyone who opposes him. Musk, the world’s richest man and an unelected official, has achieved an astonishing level of power over the federal government. Over the weekend, workers with Musk’s -department of government efficiency- (Doge) clashed with civil servants over demands for unfettered access to the computer systems of major US government agencies in a breakneck series of confrontations. When the dust settled, several top officials who opposed the takeover had been pushed out, and Musk’s allies had gained control.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-elon-musk-federal-government	2025-02-04T11:52:24-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/153a0c447760596072c83ad7ac0d282977bda122/0_136_4109_2467/master/4109.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=042e0ef1f9f5255f0aca6a429bbc820d

In this Trump era of shakedown diplomacy, everything has a price	Friends and allies of the US president will say his recent tariff threats delivered quick wins, but he may find there are no winners in a trade war As the world reels from the first three weeks of Donald Trump’s shakedown diplomacy, it is divided between those who marvel at this display of raw American economic hegemony, and those who fear that the US’s president, fatally misreading how the globe has changed since his first term, is storing up trouble that will diminish the US as an economic and moral force in four years’ time. At one level Trump’s antics are wearily familiar. After all, the last rites of the 70-year-old liberal world order were also read when Trump came to power in 2017, before that order was briefly disinterred under Joe Biden. The diplomatic pearls were collectively clutched when Trump 1.0 threatened to pull out of Nato, launched a trade war with China, introduced a travel ban on mainly Muslim countries, and withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation trade agreement championed by Barack Obama. In 2019 Trump dropped the threat of a 5% tariff in return for Mexico sending 6,000 militarised police to the southern border. Grievances, and bargains, have always animated Trump’s thinking.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/in-this-trump-era-of-shakedown-diplomacy-everything-has-a-price	2025-02-04T08:22:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a726668bb3d94b624fc479e88c91803807ce29b/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42f35e6ec17d14d7c76dce942479aa18

Netanyahu hoping to ‘redraw map’ of Middle East in Washington DC ceasefire talks with Trump – Israel-Gaza war live	Israeli PM in Washington for talks with US president as Hamas says it is ready to discuss details of second phase of ceasefire and hostage releases Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the latest news from the Middle East. Today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in Washington for talks with US President Donald Trump about the ceasefire in Gaza. Trump said on Monday he did not known whether the ceasefire deal in Gaza was going to last. -I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,- he told reporters. Hamas is ready to begin talks on the details of a second phase of the ceasefire, two officials from the group told the AFP on Monday. -We are waiting for the mediators to initiate the next round of negotiation,- said one. Israel continued its operations in the West Bank city of Jenin for a 14th consecutive day, with dozens of homes demolished and at least 25 people killed, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa The Palestinian ministry of health said the Israeli military had killed at least 70 people, including 10 children in the West Bank, since the beginning of 2025. More than 545,000 Palestinians are estimated to have crossed from southern Gaza to northern Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect, according to figures by the UN. The Trump administration has asked congressional leaders to approve transfers of roughly $1bn worth of bombs and other military hardware to Israel, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing US officials. The sales would include 4,700 1,000-pound bombs as well as armoured bulldozers built by Caterpillar. The head of Amnesty International, Agnes Callamard, said the ceasefire should not erase the events of the last 15 months and that Israel should held accountable for -genocide-. -If you have any sense of the future, you need a reckoning for the past,- she told Al Jazeera. The office of Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said the ongoing Israeli military operation in the occupied West Bank amounts to -ethnic cleansing- and urged the US to intervene. A spokesperson said the presidency -condemned the occupation authorities’ expansion of their comprehensive war on our Palestinian people in the West Bank to implement their plans aimed at displacing citizens and ethnic cleansing-. A car bomb killed at least 15 people in the northern Syrian city of Manbij. The attack was the second in three days and the deadliest since Bashar al-Assad was deposed in December. The office of the president vowed that those responsible would be help accountable.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/04/benjamin-netanyahu-donald-trump-israel-gaza-middle-east-ceasefire-latest-live-news	2025-02-04T02:54:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a18271bda488f2f0ee5861668d403ec200bb0fb1/0_72_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f7868134d28da8a88c0c4bbd518ef1ab

Reform UK overtakes Labour for first time in national opinion poll – UK politics live	Trend shows support for Nigel Farage’s Reform UK has grown significantly since general election Good morning. A good rule of thumb in political reporting is that any news story about voter intention polling is wrong. That is because news stories, by definition, are what’s what new and what’s different, and polls that show anything unusual (or at least anything significantly unusual) are probably outliers. In polling, what matters is the trend (because polls are a reliable guide to voting trends) but not so much the actual numbers (where polling is much more hit and miss). So it it is with some reservation that we start with YouGov polling, for the Times and Sky News, showing Reform UK in first place, and ahead of Labour for the first time in a national opinion poll. It has Reform UK on 25%, Labour on 24% and the Conservatives on 21%.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/04/latest-live-uk-politics-news-labour-reform-tory-conservatives-keir-starmer	2025-02-04T01:30:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ce7dbc5a63bc37033987f48a5f49ba3247aea66/0_164_4929_2957/master/4929.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1da340d05b6e227e3e21a5c1ff06947a

Trump to pause Canada tariffs for at least 30 days as China levies set to take effect Tuesday – live	Canadian PM Justin Trudeau says he had ‘good call’ with US president, as Mexico tariffs paused too Donald Trump’s administration has confirmed plans to merge the US international aid agency USAid into the state department in a major revamp that would shrink its workforce and align its spending with Trump’s priorities. The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, declared himself the acting administrator of the agency and employees have been locked out of its Washington DC headquarters, while others have been suspended. Trump announced he’s planning to appoint Michael Ellis and the deputy director of the CIA. Ellis is a close Trump ally and worked in the president’s previous administration and helped fight allegations of collusion with Russia in the 2016 election. The Trump administration is opening new investigations into allegations of antisemitism at five US universities including Columbia and the University of California, Berkeley, the Education Department announced Monday. The US Senate on Monday confirmed Chris Wright, a fracking executive, to be Donald Trump’s energy secretary. The vote was 59-38. Wright, 60, the CEO of Liberty Energy since 2011 has said he will step down from the company once confirmed. He wrote in a Liberty report last year that he believes human-caused climate change is real, but that its hazards are -distant and uncertain-. He has also said that top-down governmental policies to curb it are destined to fail. The US interior department has unveiled a suite of orders aimed at carrying out Donald Trump’s agenda to maximise domestic energy and minerals production and slash red tape, Reuters reports. In a statement, the agency said interior secretary Doug Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota, signed six orders on his first day in office. US President Donald Trump has invited Indian prime minister Narendra Modi to visit the White House next week, a White House official said, hours after a US military plane departed to return deported migrants to the country. Senator Susan Collins, a republican from Maine, said she’ll vote to confirm Tulsi Gabbard as the director of national intelligence. Collins is a key swing vote and her support brings Gabbard’s nomination close to being sealed. Trump is reportedly mulling an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education, in alignment with mandates from Elon Musk’s -department of government efficiency- to slash federal agencies. Musk’s Doge reportedly accessed administration systems for the federal Small Business Administration. It has also reportedly accessed secure information at USAid and the Treasury department. According to Wired, Musk has reportedly deployed six young men to lead Doge’s efforts to access federal government data. The Trump administration made plain its intent to merge USAid with the state department under Musk’s supervision. Employees were barred from the agency headquarters today, after the website was shuttered over the weekend. Several democrats cried foul, calling the act illegal and denouncing Musk. The Trump administration may today begin using an obscure 18th-century law to deport undocumented migrants without first going through the courts. Darren Beattie, a former White House official who wrote, -Competent white men must be in charge if you want things to work,- is reportedly set for a top role at the state department.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/feb/04/donald-trump-tariffs-live-blog-news-updates-canada-trudeau-mexico-china	2025-02-03T18:50:35-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c6c32f7de6d46668cfb725059f5a2f0e8ff0662/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=57c8c39923efef51a60d05e4860c4c9e

Starmer’s EU dinner date a big moment in tricky tightrope act	Domestically and on the world stage, the PM faces a series of challenges as he resets UK’s post-Brexit relationship Whichever way you slice it, Keir Starmer’s invitation to dinner in Brussels is a big moment.

Starmer was a committed remainer who spent years steering his party towards endorsing a second referendum. Most of the cabinet privately think Brexit was an act of self-harm — and David Lammy, the foreign secretary, has reportedly been arguing that the UK should now rejoin the customs union.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/03/starmers-eu-dinner-date-a-big-moment-in-tricky-tightrope-act	2025-02-03T10:07:45-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c3a1fe20aab7905fd7ef18421044fd29d6c5d22/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fa5221c9359123c0157eb2a15056d3c8

In the first two weeks of his return as president, Trump has, like his first term, issued orders to open up more American land and waters for fossil fuel extraction and started the process to yank the US from the Paris climate agreement. -We will drill, baby drill,- said Trump, who has promised to cut energy and electricity prices in half within 18 months.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/03/trump-war-on-clean-energy-big-oil	2025-02-03T03:00:39-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4692017038050d670d846cb0365ac4ff2bcfa5b3/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=60028ce25095472afb904a7d603f0aa4

‘Vicious cycle’: far-right parties across Europe are inspiring imitators	Hardline agendas, especially on immigration, are copied by mainstream conservatives in vain effort to win back votes Far-right parties could become the largest force on the right in Europe within a decade, experts have said, as mainstream conservative parties look to copy their hardline agendas, especially on immigration, in a vain effort to win back votes. Germany’s conservatives last week sparked fury when their leader, Friedrich Merz, the country’s likely next chancellor, broke a longstanding pledge by relying on far-right votes to adopt a non-binding motion urging a drastic immigration crackdown.

Trump baselessly blames ‘diversity’ and Democrats for deadly DC plane crash | First Thing	Sixty-seven people die in deadliest US air tragedy since 2001. Plus, Israeli-Hamas deal leads to release of eight hostages and 110 prisoners Good morning. Donald Trump used the plane crash in Washington DC to attack his political enemies, claiming Democrats were responsible for declining standards in air traffic control and that the disaster -could have been- caused by diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies at the Federal Aviation Administration. What details have emerged about the passengers? As many as 14 figure skaters and coaches were onboard the plane, as well as other Americans and citizens of several other countries. How did Democrats respond to Trump’s rant? Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic House minority leader, said Trump used the collision to -peddle lies, conspiracy theories, and attack people of color and women without any basis whatsoever-. He continued: -Have you no respect for the families whose lives have been turned upside down?- What is the death toll of the war? At least 47,460 people have been killed in the Israeli offensive, according to Gaza health officials, but a study published in the Lancet says the true number is about 41% higher. How many hostages have been released? Fifteen since the ceasefire began on 19 January.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/31/first-thing-trump-baselessly-blames-diversity-and-democrats-for-deadly-dc-plane-crash	2025-01-31T03:55:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f99f1403eddda91ece62fd87cde432fa67e1810/0_336_5043_3026/master/5043.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3bdafec776f0445ac02c020c021c4216
