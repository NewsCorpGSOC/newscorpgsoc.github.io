Albanese’s ‘knee-jerk’ social media ban not enough to curb growing harm from eating disorders, experts say	Onus needs to be on social media companies to make them safer, including allowing users to reset algorithms Australia’s eating disorder peak body and leading experts say a social media ban for under 16s is not enough to curb the scale of harm being done to young people on platforms, with one describing it as a -knee-jerk- policy response. They are instead calling on the government to make changes to the legislation governing platforms and forcing providers to be more transparent about algorithms, including allowing people to reset them, and for the removal of harmful content.

The scramble to flee Florida ahead of Hurricane Milton | First Thing	Floridians are clogging interstates in an effort to escape the path of Hurricane Milton as it intensifies in strength. Plus: the Afghan women holding the Taliban accountable Good morning. Hurricane Milton is barrelling toward Florida’s west coast and is expected to make landfall as early as Wednesday night. An estimated 6 million people across 11 counties in Florida are now under mandatory evacuation orders, with time running out to make preparations. -If you choose to stay … you are going to die,- said Tampa mayor Jane Castor. How bad is Milton predicted to be? In barely a day, Milton went from a tropical storm to a category 5 hurricane, the strongest possible rating, with its winds hitting 180mph. Milton has the potential to become -one of the most destructive hurricanes on record for west-central Florida-, the National Hurricane Center said. What are the hardships facing those evacuating? For some, fleeing home to avoid a disaster is simply not possible. The Federal Reserve has estimated that nearly 40% of Americans would not be able to cover a $400 emergency expense in cash, while a 2021 study found that people who evacuated from the Texas Coastal Bend during Hurricane Harvey spent about $1,200 on average on evacuating – more if they had to stay in hotels. What have local officials done to ease evacuation efforts? Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, lifted tolls on major highways and ordered breakdown lanes open but traffic levels were still above 150% of normal, with accidents blocking some routes. -Unfortunately every storm we see traffic fatalities because people wait until the last minute to leave,- Florida’s transportation secretary, Jared Perdue, said. How has Trump responded to the allegations? Steven Cheung, Trump’s communications director, said: -None of these madeup stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man … clearly upset because President Trump is successfully suing him because of the unauthorized publishing of recordings he made previously.-	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/09/first-thing-the-scramble-to-flee-florida-ahead-of-hurricane-milton	2024-10-09T04:58:20-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4fa3edea503cb11b43a3b4ac01a01dd985dfbaa/0_167_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7f4ae7daea851566f3c1e146169c1873

Cannabis is now legal in many US states – but can the smell get you in trouble?	Parts of the country are starting to treat cannabis like alcohol when it comes to policing intoxicated driving As states around the country continue to legalize recreational and/or medical cannabis use, more are beginning to treat cannabis like alcohol when it comes to policing intoxicated driving. A recent unanimous decision by the Illinois supreme court found that the smell of burnt cannabis alone does not give police license to conduct a warrantless vehicle search, making it the sixth state supreme court to make such a ruling. In contrast, Wisconsin’s supreme court, ruled the opposite just last year. They found that cannabis odor in a vehicle is probable cause to justify a search (unlike in Illinois, adult recreational cannabis is still illegal in Wisconsin).	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/09/dui-cannabis-vehicle-search	2024-10-09T04:00:13-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d39332f618216a65e65a27a554d660a937a3a2c5/0_141_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=33ea58a2222631e5969c24394e256174
US emergency crews struggle as climate crisis fuels ‘unprecedented’ competing disasters	Resources are stretched thin as the south-east grapples with hurricanes and the west swelters in high temperatures It’s been a brutal week in weather-related disasters across the US. Large parts of the south-east are still grappling with the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene, and another potentially catastrophic storm is barreling towards Florida. At the same time, much of the west has been sweltering amid scorching temperatures, which have elevated fire risks and fueled extreme fire behavior. Hurricanes and fires aren’t abnormal in early autumn. But the climate crisis has turned up the dial and created more opportunities for catastrophes to overlap, ultimately adding strain on relief resources, emergency response, and those who have been impacted by the dangerous and destructive events.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/09/hurricanes-wildfires-climate-crisis	2024-10-09T04:00:12-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4ff237eed8731ba24697d9358481704089cd6c2/0_144_7185_4310/master/7185.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5f4823250296d99e3c6c510b977c8cbe

According to the nonpartisan campaign analysis group Cook Political Report, the race between Hovde and Baldwin – in which Baldwin previously enjoyed an ample lead – is now a toss-up.

In it, Scalise outlined how he planned to unleash a massive attack against universities that fail to squash criticism of Israel.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/09/republicans-crackdown-universities-pro-palestinian-protests	2024-10-09T02:00:10-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/495f36d2e8a04141c56155736b5aaaef917257c3/0_274_8192_4916/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=76945f7f9aee942ced3fd149affe8206

Tory MPs to choose final two leadership candidates for members’ ballot – UK politics live	Robert Jenrick, the bookmakers’ favourite prior to the Tory conference, has implied he is victim of ‘horse trading’ Good morning. Keir Starmer is taking PMQs today, for the first time since the conference season recess and the internal No 10 reshuffle that saw his chief of staff, Sue Gray, in effect sacked. But there may be even more interest in what Bob Blackman, chair of the Conservative 1922 Committee, has to say at 3.30pm, when he announces the names of the two Tory leadership candidates who will go to the ballot of members. One of them is about 99.999% certain to be James Cleverly. The other will be either Kemi Badenoch or Robert Jenrick. They are both candidates for the Tory right, but Badenoch is a lifelong, conviction rightwinger, very popular with Tory members, while Jenrick is someone elected to parliament as a Cameroon moderniser who says he has been radicalised into favouring ECHR withdrawal by his experience in a Home Office unable to control irregular migration. There’s always horse trading, OK, in the final stages …. I’ve been around long enough to know that in the last few votes in these leadership contests there’s always people moving around votes and so on. In this leadership contest over the last few months I think I’ve been the only candidate who has set out specific, clear policies to tackle the big issues facing our country – the NHS, how do we grow the economy, how do we tackle immigration, secure our borders Because I think it’s so important that the Conservative party gets back onto the common ground of British politics, addressing the things that the public really care about.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/09/conservatives-leadership-james-cleverly-robert-jenrick-kemi-badenoch-pmqs-keir-starmer-uk-politics-latest-news	2024-10-09T01:35:57-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0a221525addc194abf14c611e53444f73b32f61/0_86_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0dcac5a1105b35be6c23d1334267dcd3

The environment minister told a -global nature positive summit- in Sydney on Tuesday the government had quadrupled the size of the sub-Antarctic Heard Island and McDonald Islands Marine Reserve, a world heritage area about 4,000km south-west of Perth.

Doubts over legal regime to re-detain those released from Australian immigration detention, FoI documents reveal	Exclusive: Meeting minutes show that without any offending by those released, it’s hard to ‘illustrate that they pose an ongoing risk’ Officials responsible for a regime to re-detain people released from immigration detention have cast doubt on its effectiveness, warning the minimum nine-month timeframe to put cases together could make it harder for the government to win. -In the absence of any offending, [it is] hard to illustrate that they pose an ongoing risk – so the longer it takes it weakens [the applicants’] case,- officials said, according to minutes of a January meeting discussing the operation of the scheme, passed after the high court’s ruling that indefinite immigration detention is unlawful.

Scapegoat Sue Gray’s exit leaves Starmer’s No 10 with nowhere left to hide	Downing Street reset means PM and his team only have themselves to blame if they fail to communicate purpose and vision Office politics can be complicated. And Westminster can get obsessed with personalities behind the scenes and where someone sits on the office floor plan. But with all that being said, it is true to say that relations between Sue Gray, Keir Starmer’s former chief of staff and some others in the early days of Keir Starmer’s government were if anything worse than reported. She is not the first outsider who found it impossible to gel with Starmer’s close-knit and fiercely political team who ran his leadership campaign and who worked on Labour’s election strategy.

Biden sets 10-year deadline for US cities to replace lead pipes	President to announce in Wisconsin EPA rule aimed at ensuring drinking water is safe for all Americans A decade after the Flint, Michigan, water crisis raised alarms about the continuing dangers of lead in tap water, Joe Biden is setting a 10-year deadline for cities across the nation to replace their lead pipes, finalizing an aggressive approach aimed at ensuring that drinking water is safe for all Americans. The president is expected to announce the final Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule Tuesday in the swing state of Wisconsin during the final month of a tight presidential campaign. The announcement highlights an issue – safe drinking water – that Kamala Harris has prioritized as vice-president and during her presidential campaign. The new rule supplants a looser standard set by former President Donald Trump’s administration that did not include a universal requirement to replace lead pipes.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/biden-lead-pipes-drinking-water	2024-10-08T05:09:55-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/854a9b6615b6b7ee62e224d29d961bf5b6f248a7/0_51_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=268e3010c66ef77dd06039c7c2968356
Hurricane Milton barrels toward Florida as Trump spreads falsehoods | First Thing	A top emergency official says lies spread by Donald Trump and his supporters about Hurricane Helene have hampered recovery efforts. Plus: how to combat food waste Good morning. Hurricane Milton is expected to sweep past Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula and hit the south-west coast of Florida by Wednesday evening local time, bringing sustained winds of nearly 155mph (250km/h) to an area already reeling from Hurricane Helene’s devastation 12 days ago. Almost all of Florida’s west coast was under a hurricane warning and more than a million people were told to evacuate. How has the Fema chief responded to Trump’s falsehoods? Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, have accused the Biden administration of -abandoning- people and, baselessly, of being short of disaster relief funds due to money spent on undocumented migrants. (Fema’s housing program, which offers shelter to migrants leaving detention, is separate from its disaster relief program.) Deanne Criswell, the Fema administrator, said these falsehoods were -creating an impedance to our ability to actually get people the help they need-. What else is the right saying about the hurricanes? The far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has been criticised for spreading false conspiracy theories that -they can control the weather-. Though she never specified who she meant by -they-, she has a history of promoting untrue conspiracy theories around the federal government, her political opponents and Jews. What will happen to disaster relief if Trump is elected? Experts say that under the controversial rightwing Project 2025 manifesto, which was authored by numerous former Trump officials, federal forecasting of severe storms and aid given to shattered towns and cities would be drastically scaled back. What else did Harris say? She vowed to raise taxes on billionaires and the biggest corporations in order to fund her economic proposals, which include plans to build millions of new housing units, tax breaks for new parents and $25,000 down-payment assistance for new homebuyers. Will Trump sit down with 60 Minutes? The CBS correspondent Scott Pelley told the audience that Trump cancelled an interview last week, with the Trump campaign providing -shifting explanations- for why the Republican nominee had declined to participate, including that he did not want to be factchecked. What do the polls say? Harris has a narrow lead over Trump in national polls, though the race is in effect neck and neck in the swing states that will decide the election.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/first-thing-hurricane-milton-barrels-toward-florida-trump-falsehoods	2024-10-08T05:06:19-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b940c70a5fd84623b628a5a2b1adb7bef90fe28/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=54d7ca3e6ba380cd88912e0456c369b5

US supreme court to hear arguments in major ‘ghost guns’ case	Garland v VanDerStok first in series of high-profile cases justices will hear in what is set to be contentious term The US supreme court will hear arguments in a case involving the regulation of -ghost guns- – firearms without serial numbers that are built from kits that people can order online and assemble at home. Garland v VanDerStok is the first in a series of high-profile arguments the court will hear in what is likely to be a contentious term. As ghost guns were increasingly used in crimes – including 1,200 homicides and attempted homicides between 2016 and 2022, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms – the Biden administration issued new rules regulating them in 2022. The new ATF rule classified ghost gun kits as firearms under the Gun Control Act of 1968, the US’s main firearms law – making them subject to the same regulations as all other guns.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/us-supreme-court-ghost-guns	2024-10-08T04:00:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bae31897cede8eabda1c4aa79518c2c7be8c22bf/0_161_7329_4397/master/7329.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5308d050a7e566ebe7be091af1a6fd3f

Project 2025 would ‘unequivocally’ lead to more hurricane deaths, experts warn	Manifesto calls for drastic cuts to federal forecasting of severe storms and aid given to shattered towns and cities With communities still reeling from Hurricane Helene, one of the deadliest storms ever to hit the US, further pain in the form of Hurricane Milton is about to hit Florida. Experts warn such disasters will be deepened if Donald Trump is elected and follows the policy plans of the controversial rightwing Project 2025 manifesto. Under Project 2025, authored by numerous former Trump officials but disavowed by the former president himself, the federal forecasting of severe storms and aid given to shattered towns and cities would be drastically scaled back. Emergency management officials say the cuts would severely worsen the outcomes from a storm like Helene.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/trump-project-2025-hurricanes	2024-10-08T03:00:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/239d4e2362825030c85dbd707f798cac9ab3f0a4/0_226_5220_3132/master/5220.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=68cacbf77f89da6d8826b1bc2e12598c
Court must rule whether Florida’s anti-trans law is the work of ‘political bullies’	Opponents say that law banning medical care for trans youth signed by Ron DeSantis is part of culture war agenda Opponents of a Florida law that bans medical care for transgender youth have told an appeals court that -political bullies-, including the hard-right Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, have stripped families of their right to determine their children’s future. The claim came in a brief to Atlanta’s 11th circuit court of appeals that will issue a final rule in January on the constitutionality of DeSantis’s law prohibiting gender-affirming care for transgender minors and restricting such treatment for adults.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/florida-trans-healthcare-ruling-desantis	2024-10-08T03:00:13-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67fdeff962ebecc31e4c01cd77269fcc4b8efb07/0_36_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b24af87cfa411d862c884a1207ac2c67

Labour won’t be able to rely on ethnic minority voters as ‘bloc’ of support in future, says major report – UK politics live	Thinktank UK in a Changing Europe has publishes major report on attitudes and voting behaviours of ethnic minority Britons Good morning. Labour has already been in office for almost 100 days, but in some respects it still feels like we’re at the start of a new political season. This morning Keir Starmer is chairing his first cabinet since Morgan McSweeeney replaced Sue Gray as the key aide in No 10 (a move which could have radical implications, as Pippa Crerar reports here), this afternoon Tory MPs are holding another ballot to elect their next leader, and, with the conference recess over, MPs are getting down to a busy three months of parliamentary business, with the budget only three weeks away tomorrow. Labour won a big majority at the election, but the big story of politics in recent years is the fragementation of the electorate, and this morning the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe has published a major report on the attitudes and voting behaviours of ethnic minority Britons. For anyone interested in this topic, it has lots of very good data, but two findings in particular stand out. Labour will not be able to rely on ethnic minority voters as a ‘bloc’ of support in the future, the report says. In his introduction James Kanagasooriam, the pollster from Focaldata who produced the data used in the report, says that it is still the case that, overall, ethnic minority Britons are much more likely to vote left than right than white Britons. He says: At the 2024 election, the combined vote share of Labour, the Greens and the Liberal Democrats was 66% among ethnic minorities, while that for the Conservatives and Reform UK was 26%. Among white voters, the equivalent figures were 53% and 41%. Any discussion over Labour’s problems with minority voters and Conservative gains needs to be tempered by these facts. At future elections, Labour cannot rely on ethnic minority voters as a ‘bloc’ of support. It is true that the Labour Party still convinces a far greater proportion of minorities with ‘warm’ views of the party to vote for it than the Conservative Party does. But among many ethnic groups, there is a fundamental disjunction between opinion on the salient issues of the day and voting patterns. Our polling suggests that Labour support among ethnic minorities is an ossified cultural and historical legacy that could disappear very quickly. Having a degree makes white voters more leftwing, but ethnic minority voters more leftwing, the report says. In his introduction Kanagasooriam describes this as the Lee Anderson-Rishi Sunak factor in Tory support. He explains: The demography of right and left is vastly different between white and non-white voters. White voters differ hugely on their educational profile, with non-graduates drifting right over the last 20 years, and graduates to the left. Amongst non-white Britons, graduate level education makes you proportionately more likely to be Conservative. Class cleavages and patterns that have disappeared from the voting patterns of white Britons exist and are indeed getting stronger amongst non-white voters. The Conservative Party will continue to have its esoteric coalition of affluent minorities and nongraduate whites and Labour the opposite. In other words, the Lee Anderson - Rishi Sunak spectrum is a feature, not a bug, of right-wing politics.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/08/labour-keir-starmer-tory-leadership-latest-politics-live-news	2024-10-08T01:17:28-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f312e371cdc8462f0af463e5817b68c979efe8d/0_267_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8a2b7d6f071c621adeadd89c354e0adc

Germans decry influence of English as ‘idiot’s apostrophe’ gets official sanction	Linguistic body has relaxed rules on use of apostrophe to show possession, not traditionally correct in German A relaxation of official rules around the correct use of apostrophes in German has not only irritated grammar sticklers but triggered existential fears around the pervasive influence of English. Establishments that feature their owners’ names, with signs like -Rosi’s Bar- or -Kati’s Kiosk- are a common sight around German towns and cities, but strictly speaking they are wrong: unlike English, German does not traditionally use apostrophes to indicate the genitive case or possession. The correct spelling, therefore, would be -Rosis Bar-, -Katis Kiosk-, or, as in the title of a recent viral hit, Barbaras Rhabarberbar.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/07/germany-influence-of-english-idiots-apostrophe	2024-10-07T12:19:31-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7661f39ffa2235475d11abcaa34bcdf072507d68/0_227_3369_2022/master/3369.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=98e7dc86766823753a656116dba11f02
Suddenly, all MPs know where the Chagos Islands are and what’s best for them | John Crace	Many who last week couldn’t have got within 500 miles of Mauritius on a map now can’t bear it taking the archipelago What a difference a week makes. Just last Wednesday, you could have put money on most MPs being totally clueless about the exact location of the Chagos Islands. Give them a map and many would have better luck being blindfolded. Even a hint wouldn’t have made much difference. Are they east, west, south or north of Mauritius? To be in with a shout, you have to know where Mauritius is. And most MPs wouldn’t get within 500 miles. The Indian Ocean is bigger than you think. And don’t get them started on Diego Garcia.

First Thing: One year after the 7 October attacks	As Israel mourns those killed one year ago today, attacks on Lebanon and Gaza continue. Plus: the aftermath of Hurricane Helene Good morning. One year ago, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people – the deadliest event for Jewish people since the Holocaust. A further 251 were taken hostage. In the months that followed, the Israeli offensive in Gaza laid waste to the densely populated coastal territory and has so far killed almost 42,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities. How many hostages remain in Gaza, one year later? Nearly 100 hostages have yet to return home. While hopes were raised by the release of 117 hostages early in the war, including 105 in an exchange during a brief ceasefire in November 2023, more dead hostages than alive have been found during Israeli operations as the offensive has dragged on. One year later, some families are just learning that their loved ones had been killed in the initial attacks, with their remains still in Gaza. How are the families of hostages coping? -I’ve had enough. A year is just too long. I can’t take it any more,- says Aviva Siegel, who was held hostage for 51 days before being released but whose husband, Keith, is still captive. For the families of the six Thai migrant workers who are still being held, the lack of news has been unbearable. What is happening in Gaza? The Israel Defense Forces has called on residents in the northern Gaza Strip, where 300,000 people are estimated to have remained, to evacuate southward towards the so-called humanitarian zone of al-Mawasi, where an estimated 1 million displaced people are sheltering. One year later, what are conditions like for Palestinians in Gaza? Health workers who volunteered in Gaza say that beyond the airstrikes and military operations that have destroyed much of the territory, malnutrition is a huge problem, as well as worsening sanitation and the limited access to water. Medical supplies are hard to come by, with medics reporting that they are operating without essentials such as surgical gowns and gauze. While polio vaccinations started last month, the brutal reality was that some of the children being vaccinated in the morning would be seen as casualties by the evening, said one doctor.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/07/first-thing-one-year-after-the-7-october-attacks	2024-10-07T05:01:02-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85d4b828df8e3e707165f05df75e7065114325f8/0_0_4888_2933/master/4888.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=28f8c4cec69285dd08a261b6ad0cf74e

Israel’s lack of vision in multi-fronted war may be fatally exposed	After Iranian strikes damage bases and IDF take casualties in Lebanon, experts say Israel’s military doctrine could be found wanting As Israelis approached the beginning of the high holy days last week on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, the news began to circulate. Several IDF units fighting on the border with Lebanon had taken casualties in at least two different locations. Soldiers had died in combat, and many were wounded. The confirmation of the wounded and dead, if not the circumstances served as a stark reminder for Israelis of the blows that come in war, even as Israel’s punishing air offensive has killed hundreds of Lebanese and wounded more. The soldiers’ deaths came after two weeks in which Israel struck a series of blows against Hezbollah, including the assassination of the group’s leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and most of the top leadership.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/06/israel-iran-war-idf-lebanon-military-doctrine	2024-10-06T08:20:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53d846ef7777663f6693cdf042f2c9ecd14373ed/0_213_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=212ac06a0104c3d7abd1188e19f44f75

Harris campaign announces media blitz as Melania Trump gives interview to Fox – live	Donald Trump to speak at an event in Juneau, Wisconsin, his fourth scheduled stop in eight days in the state Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump is scheduled to speak at an event in Juneau, Wisconsin, on Sunday, his fourth scheduled stop in eight days in the state. Republicans are trying to rack up support in Wisconsin, which has only flipped red once in the past 40 years, when Trump won the state in 2016. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz are slated to sit down with major TV personalities this week. Walz is slated to sit down with Fox News’s Shannon Bream on Sunday for his first solo interview. On Monday, he’ll join Jimmy Kimmel Live. On Tuesday, Harris will be in New York for appearances on The View, The Howard Stern Show, and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. After the US supreme court granted Donald Trump significant immunity from prosecution for actions during his presidency, the court is set to embark on its next nine-month term on Monday with public confidence in the court still reeling following the ruling compounded by the ethically dubious conduct of some justices. The White House moved Saturday to quash claims that government officials control the weather, including a far-fetched rumor circulating on social media that Hurricane Helene was an engineered storm to allow corporations to mine regional lithium deposits.

Shattered residents pick up the pieces after Hurricane Helene’s devastation	A week after the storm hit, the scale of the damage is still unknown – and many towns face a long road to recovery After keeping vigil all night, Jason Fesperman, 32, decided it was finally safe to sleep. By 6am last Friday, he figured that the worst of the rain from Hurricane Helene had passed. Jonathan Creek, the normally ankle-deep stream that runs through his backyard in Maggie Valley, North Carolina, had stayed within its banks – though barely. Just over two hours later, his wife Dan woke him in a panic. Heavy rain continued past 9am in Maggie Valley, and by 8.30am, floodwaters were rising fast. Their home was underwater up to the windows.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/06/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-dispatch	2024-10-06T03:00:05-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cef81ba0c3660969bdea9ea04497485837a45fa/0_46_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7d9a37d57f6098d3ee4e1500e50d01a9

Heavy strikes hit southern Beirut and Gaza mosque as Israel targets Hamas and Hezbollah	Explosions heard across Lebanese capital; dozens reported killed with more wounded in hit on central Gaza mosque that Israel says was Hamas base Heavy consecutive strikes hit Beirut’s southern suburbs from late Saturday into Sunday, witnesses said, while Gaza’s civil defence agency said 24 people were killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a mosque in central Gaza early on Sunday. The strike on the mosque, near the Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, came as the war between Israel and Hamas in the Palestinian territory approaches its first anniversary on 7 October. Witnesses said the number of casualties could rise as the mosque was being used to house displaced people, while the Israeli military said it was being used as a Hamas command centre.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/06/heavy-israeli-strikes-hit-beirut-as-21-reportedly-killed-in-gaza-mosque-attack	2024-10-05T23:09:56-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecd7ec8470dabd7767daa77145be5feb91dbaebf/23_0_2496_1499/master/2496.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=54c5ab9c0995270471dcb2c4af02013d

Parkrun at 20 years old: how a gentle jog turned into a 5km Saturday morning obsession	The event, which is celebrating its anniversary today, has grown into a global phenomenon – and made us feel a whole lot better Twenty years ago, on a windy, autumnal Saturday morning, 13 runners showed up to a park in south-west London for an event called the Bushy Park Time Trial. A 5km course was plotted and the organiser, Paul Sinton-Hewitt, a computer programmer who grew up in South Africa, bought washers from a hardware store to hand out as finish tokens. The times were tapped up on a laptop afterwards in a local Caffè Nero. This Saturday, the weather hadn’t much improved – overcast, with the sun straining to peek through – and the venue was the same: picturesque Bushy Park with its resident red deer squaring up, ready to rut. But pretty much everything else about the impromptu get-together has evolved. Since 2008, it has been known as Parkrun and there are now 2,500 weekly events – all 5km, all free – in 22 countries, everywhere from the slopes of Mount Etna to 25 UK prisons to the Falkland Islands. In a typical week, around 350,000 people will take part. Runner’s World hails it a -global phenomenon-.	https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/05/parkrun-at-20-years-old-how-a-gentle-jog-turned-into-a-5km-saturday-morning-obsession	2024-10-05T13:15:32-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67c502ff5689f3dc66e76c75801f22002edd2c34/918_1390_6804_4082/master/6804.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0893e5a4c568d46fca20b90e0d72b71a

Waiters around the UK should be starting to receive a £200m-a-year bonanza thanks to a new law that means every penny paid in tips, including service charges, on a restaurant bill will have to go to staff. Yet exactly how much of the money will end up in servers’ pockets is unclear. The law was changed because some restaurants took service charges as part of their profits or to pay for overheads such as lighting.	https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/oct/05/waiter-sohos-cafe-society-confused-after-law-changes-on-tipping	2024-10-05T11:22:37-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b396c0cc4049d2116fa5726285f4b77d0bfdefae/0_541_8139_4883/master/8139.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=48bbcdfb8d05761094b880ba8ba29cc8

Wealthy, white and rightwing: the Tory members holding the party’s future in their hands	The electorate for the Conservative leadership contest likes a winner, but lately has had trouble picking one The Conservative party is more than just 121 MPs. It’s also tens of thousands of ordinary members. The £39 a year they pay to belong might not entitle them to any real say on the party’s policies, but it does give them the right to help select its candidates and, even better, its leader. Quite how many individual blades make up the Tory grassroots these days, we won’t know until we learn the result of the membership ballot, which starts on 31 October. In 2019, when Johnson was elected leader, it came in at 159,000. And in 2022, when Liz Truss got the nod, it had actually risen to 172,000. But that was considerably down on the 254,000 who got to choose between Davids Cameron and Davis back in 2005 and way off the 2.8 million members that the party claimed to have at its postwar peak in the mid-1950s.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/05/wealthy-white-and-rightwing-the-tory-members-holding-the-partys-future-in-their-hands	2024-10-05T10:31:46-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0259ef94d3210d378e5119acf9d9857df769923/0_350_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6485a8bcff272b48fd532baa02264425

Escalation with Iran could be risky: Israel is more vulnerable than it seems	Intelligence analysis of Tehran’s attack suggests that much-touted Israeli missile defences are not, in fact, impregnable In the aftermath of Iran’s attack on Israel on Tuesday night, Israeli officials claimed their defences had stood firm. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Iran had launched more than 180 missiles, but few details about the damage were released and the US’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the attack -appears to have been defeated and ineffective-. But as Israel prepares its retaliation, analysts believe those initial reports could have been misleading – and could change the calculus of Israel’s response if it fears getting into a bout of protracted -missile ping-pong- with Iran, especially should Tehran choose softer targets in the future.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/05/escalation-with-iran-could-be-risky-israel-is-more-vulnerable-than-it-seems	2024-10-05T09:38:48-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/884fe00fab030e4f8fe0b53646aa773b4e1a67a5/142_0_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b10eef5e809f16f3c4d8be77caf7071d

Israeli strikes hit Beirut as key route out of Lebanon cut off | First Thing	Israel has ordered people in 20 more towns in southern Lebanon to evacuate immediately. Plus: the future of the death penalty in Japan Good morning. As Hezbollah continued to attack northern Israel, the Israeli military launched a series of strikes on southern Beirut in one of the most intense bombardments on the city since the campaign began last week. The New York Times and Axios have reported that Hashem Safieddine, the most likely candidate to replace Hassan Nasrallah as leader of Hezbollah and the head of its executive council, was the target of the strikes. The first airstrike by an Israeli jet in the West Bank since the second intifada: In addition to the attacks in Lebanon, an Israeli airstrike on a refugee camp in Tulkarm in the West Bank killed at least 18 people, including two children. The Israeli military claimed the airstrike killed a local Hamas leader. One year after the 7 October attacks: After one year of war, Israel is facing mounting diplomatic isolation. Pew Research found in May that although most Americans still sympathised with Israel, those under 30 did not, and seven in 10 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents had little or no confidence in the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. How will Israel respond to Iran? The former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak has predicted Israel is likely to mount a large-scale airstrike against Iran’s oil industry and possibly a symbolic attack on a military target related to its nuclear program. Who else is campaigning for Harris? Liz Cheney, one of Donald Trump’s most prominent conservative critics, spoke to undecided voters in Ripon, Wisconsin, on Thursday, asking them to -reject the depraved cruelty- of Trump. Meanwhile, Bruce Springsteen has endorsed Harris, calling Trump -the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime-. What is Tim Walz up to? In a final push to engage Muslim voters ahead of the election, Walz joined a virtual summit hosted by a Muslim advocacy group and called for an end to the war in Gaza. He pledged that if elected, the Harris administration would work -side by side- with Muslim Americans.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/04/first-thing-israeli-strikes-hit-beirut-key-route-lebanon-cut-off	2024-10-04T05:24:59-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d1604f7398daed78982b99beec806397dddc769/0_27_5500_3303/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=00533ffdba7e7d5aa26f8262c8396406

UK Palestinians on the nightmare of watching war unfold from afar	One year on, we speak to those who have lost more than 50 relatives and who call some ministers’ support for the Israeli government ‘shameful’ In September 2023, 45-year-old Mohammed Ghalayini travelled to Gaza from Manchester, where he had lived since 2004, to visit family. He was still there on 7 October when Hamas’s attack on Israel killed 1,200 people. In Israel’s subsequent bombardment of Gaza – which to date has killed more than 41,000 people – he and his family were displaced multiple times, faced shortages of food and water, and endured the relentless sound of drones. Ghalayini is now back in the north of England, but nearly a year into Israel’s war in Gaza, he says every day still brings bad news – whether from family members in WhatsApp messages, or in updates on Facebook, which has become like an -obituary page-.

A previous rally allegedly saw Hezbollah flags waved. One of the changes, having listened to the parliamentary debate, as I did, obviously there was a lot of concern around debt, and that concerned me greatly. And so we’ve made a bit of a tweak in the agency, that if the agency was ever to pursue a debt against a participant, it would need to be signed off by me first, and so that puts a whole lot of safety nets through the process to kind of make it be really clear that raising any debt against a participant would be an absolute last resort. We’re really clear that plan managers know what their expectations are. They know what they’ve got to be absolutely assisting participants. They should be in a really good place to know what you can and can’t claim for. One of the things they sign up for to be a plan manager is being compliant with the NDIS legislation.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/oct/04/australia-news-live-pro-palestine-rally-police-qld-election-youth-justice-teeth-dentists-healthcare-cost-of-living-ntwnfb	2024-10-03T13:54:59-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed48fc478ea24334f2bf4d4c0a19664c2965d97d/369_76_6420_3854/master/6420.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=92fddb25416d1347f1589564a52958d6

What are the risks involved in Israeli options for retaliatory strikes on Iran?	Israel has several possible targets including military, economic or even nuclear sites, but all come with caveats Israel has several options if its leaders want to launch retaliatory strikes against Iran, and while western leaders have urged restraint, a significant assault is expected. Possibilities could include strikes against military, economic or even nuclear targets, although Joe Biden said he had told Benjamin Netanyahu’s government the US would not support the last option. Iran has relatively weak air defences and it is expected it would struggle to prevent Israeli missiles or an air force bombing run, as was revealed on 19 April. Then, Israel, responding to Iran’s previous missile barrage, damaged part of Iran’s best air defence system, a Russian S-300, in the military-industrial city of Isfahan. It was a strike intended to showcase Iran what Israel was capable of.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/03/what-are-the-risks-involved-in-israeli-options-for-retaliatory-strikes-on-iran	2024-10-03T10:13:28-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b4209904db5606b015ade7aaa008e9b124d0e37/72_0_2892_1735/master/2892.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d80ffd2e818c81650668867ec539ffd0

Tories challenge other Labour ministers to follow Keir Starmer in paying back donations – UK politics live	The prime minister said he’d paid back £6,000 worth of gifts and hospitality, including Taylor Swift tickets and his wife’s rented clothing Good morning. Yesterday Keir Starmer made the surprise announcement that he has paid back £6,000 worth of gifts and hospitality, including Taylor Swift tickets and rented clothing for his wife, received since he became prime minister. The news overshadowed reports about what happened on his visit to Brussels to meet the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen (also important – here’s our story), but No 10 felt they had to put the news out yesterday because the donations were all being revealed in the latest update to the Commons register of members’ interests published yesterday. However, as is often the case when a politician under pressure over ethics/transparency makes a concession to critics/the media/public opinion, Starmer has now opened himself up to a whole new bout of questions. The Conservative party (which has a lot of experience of donation scandals) is on the case, and last night it issued this statement. Day after day more and more comes out about the scandal at the top of Keir Starmer’s government. This scandal has become a complete distraction from the job of governing. It appears Starmer will only be transparent when his backs against the wall. This announcement today poses more questions than it answers. Why did Starmer take these freebies in the first place? Why haven’t Angela Rayner and other senior party members not paid back donations?	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2024/oct/03/keir-starmer-angela-rayner-donations-labour-conservatives-uk-politics-news-live	2024-10-03T01:15:34-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83a806fdc65c6089a7752958823504796248be97/0_0_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4329cc32e447d1896d8b9c6726436372

Gulf leaders support Palestine – but many would not mind seeing Israel challenge Iran	The escalating Middle East conflict could create a dangerous vacuum – or an opportunity – for several states The coincidental timing of an emergency meeting of Gulf foreign ministers in Doha with a visit to the same city by the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, for talks with Qatar’s emir raises questions about how the Gulf states will react if Israel pushes ahead with its plan to use its recent military success not just to weaken Iran, but reorder the Middle East. This Sunni coalition of six Gulf monarchs is not naturally well disposed to Iran or its Shia proxies, and only in 2016 labelled Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation. But they also oppose further Israeli escalation, and believe it is ultimately only Washington that has the means to restrain the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/03/gulf-leaders-support-palestine-but-many-would-not-mind-seeing-israel-challenge-iran	2024-10-02T21:00:06-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acf40ffd21301285a47601fa5e0a56588424f14e/0_83_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d8cd5a4eb0f10ed8d35fa3bb37fcc1bd

Former Nintendo factory in Kyoto opens as nostalgia-fuelled gaming museum	Museum features consoles from 1983’s Famicom to 2017’s Switch, as well as honouring Nintendo’s pre-video-game era Traditionally, visitors to Kyoto in October come for momijigari, the turning of the autumn leaves in the city’s picturesque parks. This autumn, however, there is a new draw: a Nintendo museum. The new attraction, which opens on Wednesday, is best described as a chapel of video game nostalgia. Upstairs, Nintendo’s many video game consoles, from 1983’s Famicom through 1996’s Nintendo 64 to 2017’s Switch, are displayed reverently alongside their most famous games. On the back wall, visitors can also peer at toys, playing cards and other artefacts from the Japanese company’s pre-video-game history, stretching back to its founding as a hanafuda playing card manufacturer in 1889. Downstairs, there are interactive exhibits with comically gigantic controllers and floor-projected playing cards.	https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/oct/02/former-nintendo-factory-in-kyoto-opens-as-nostalgia-fuelled-gaming-museum	2024-10-02T04:07:38-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90dfb7e994ac23040f863ff9e261ed7282bd0e40/0_0_5746_3448/master/5746.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b88f21aa00a448f3a338672aa4ad12de

Doug Diny, who donned a workperson’s hat and gloves to move the drop box, claimed he did so because he was worried the box, which had not yet been fully installed and did not have any ballots in it, could have been tossed in the river.

After weeks and months of being assailed by Donald Trump’s dystopian evocation of a country on the verge of self-destruction, amplified by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s dire warnings of democracy in peril, here was something very different.

Tory leadership candidates in key face-off at party conference – UK politics live	Jenrick, Badenoch, Cleverly and Tugendhat to all get 20 minutes to pitch their vision to members Good morning. There are plenty of more important things in politics than who becomes the next Conservative leader – two thirds of voters don’t even care, according to Ipsos polling, including almost a third of people who backed the party at the election – but if you are interested in the outcome, today is the most important day in the contest so far. Over the past century most people elected Conservative leader have also been prime minister at some point, so it is normally a consequential choice. Although the four-day conference has, in effect, been a long husting, this morning we’re getting the key face-off. All four candidates are delivering a 20-minute speech in the conference hall. A platform speech to a big audience is always a challenge, but the candidates face two particular difficulties this morning. The truth is this. If we’re to tackle the immense challenges we face, if we’re to restore the public’s trust, we must build something new. A new Conservative party. That is what I call for today. Nothing less than a new Conservative Party built on the rock of our oldest values and best traditions. If I become our leader, this is what – together – we will build. The Conservatives have to be the party of wealth creation. Wealth is not a dirty word. It supports jobs and families. It pays for our schools, for our health service. We should encourage it. Let’s be enthusiastic; relatable; positive; optimistic. Let’s sell the benefits of a Conservative government with a smile. We will not win back voters by pretending to be something we’re not. We win back voters by being honest, by being professional, by being Conservative.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/02/tory-party-conference-jenrick-badenoch-cleverly-tugendhat-starmer-brussels-uk-politics-news-latest	2024-10-02T00:54:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24b7adfb022855c19c11606304eb71a9d3ee375b/0_97_3543_2128/master/3543.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6efaf132294f123945d6079bced10879

Who were England’s 2024 rioters? – podcast	Racist chants rang out, and homes, businesses and hotels housing asylum seekers were attacked – for a week this summer English towns and cities seemed on the brink of chaos. Josh Halliday reports on what we know so far about the people at the centre of the violence From Aldershot to Southport, riots broke out in English towns and cities this summer. Mosques, homes, shops and cars were attacked. A library was looted. Drivers were stopped and interrogated about their ethnicity, police officers were attacked. In a matter of days, however, many rioters found themselves in court and the violence stopped abruptly. Josh Halliday was in court to hear what many of the rioters, including children, said about why they had caused such havoc. He explains to Helen Pidd how the Guardian’s data team tracked the court filings of 500 rioters to glean information that helped build a picture of the people who terrified communities.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/audio/2024/oct/02/who-were-england-2024-rioters-podcast	2024-10-01T19:00:26-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b14b9ac022293409448d8b1bedd195da6db628b/0_186_6480_3888/master/6480.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ac3fba2487f16f75947296f5e052a0f

Targeted support could reduce infant mortality gap across England, study finds	Researchers say interventions could address key factors, such as smoking, but ‘structural changes’ also needed Four key factors have been identified that together account for more than one-third of the inequalities in infant deaths between the most and least deprived areas of England. Researchers say targeted interventions to address these factors – teenage pregnancy, maternal depression, preterm birth and smoking during pregnancy – could go a significant way to reduce inequalities, although higher-level structural changes to address socioeconomic inequality will also be necessary.	https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/oct/02/targeted-support-could-reduce-infant-mortality-gap-across-england-study-finds	2024-10-01T16:30:23-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a464d87bcefe96b2e3e71acd79d93ef5ea22c0ed/0_171_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4d8bb8028e6bccad1012f04da8655c10

Stopping Iran’s attack would have forced Israel to use sophisticated – and expensive – defences	Despite launching 180 ballistic missiles, Iran is likely to have wanted to keep most of its stock in case of a full-blown war with Israel Iran’s decision to launch about 180 high-speed ballistic missiles at Israel indicates that Tehran sought to inflict serious damage in Tuesday’s night attack, unlike the well-telegraphed drone and missile attack in April. Their sheer speed makes ballistic weapons challenging to intercept, but the initial reports of no fatalities within Israel and one in the West Bank would suggest despite the numbers of missiles launched it was a military failure, though some of the weapons or fragments appear to have struck the ground.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/stopping-iran-attack-would-have-forced-israel-to-use-sophisticated-and-expensive-defences	2024-10-01T13:06:12-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/859573648bd5c30b9f5ad946f08413669d18712e/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=081eb332d1716c4a8e12f3d683944cc6

War risks reigniting tensions between Lebanon’s kaleidoscope of communities	If Hezbollah is substantially diminished, there could be an opportunity to rebalance power in the country once again To drive away from Beirut’s Mediterranean coastline is to climb, up into the rugged, unrelenting ridges of Mount Lebanon. The limestone mountain range that traverses huge lengths of Lebanon lent the country not just its name but beauty, diversity – and a combustible political culture that risks being inflamed again as Israeli forces invade. For centuries before modern Lebanon was established, its mountains were a natural barrier to invading armies. For the region’s religious minorities – especially Christians and Druze – they became a sanctuary. Ensconced in remote mountain villages, the kaleidoscope of communities that would eventually form the Lebanese nation developed distinct identities, histories and anxieties over their own survival. Lebanon, one of it great historians, Kamal Salibi, wrote, was -a house of many mansions-.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/war-risks-reigniting-tensions-lebanon-kaleidoscope-of-communities	2024-10-01T09:56:38-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f664117d8718745b6731dc162b5729749bcaffed/0_288_8640_5184/master/8640.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25a9341311cc52af723bd204a0d27cc8

He said he weighed Schubarth’s age and lack of a criminal record with a sentence that would deter anyone else from trying to -change the genetic makeup of the creatures- on the Earth.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/01/sheep-cloning-montana-hunting-prison	2024-10-01T05:41:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca4e36fd2989588ea16491073c76057825c38d82/0_394_5610_3367/master/5610.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f5809821146b20ae9cc849ee729dd997

Martin Lewis says energy price cap is a ‘pants cap’	Consumer champion urges consumers to head to a price comparison website to find a cheaper deal The consumer champion Martin Lewis has said that the energy price cap should be called the energy -pants cap- because there are much cheaper energy deals available. The cap is adjusted every quarter by Ofgem, the energy regulator for Great Britain, and imposes a maximum on how much suppliers can charge customers for each unit of gas and electricity. On Tuesday it increased by nearly £150 to the equivalent of £1,717 a year for an average dual-fuel household paying by direct debit.	https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/oct/01/martin-lewis-energy-price-cap-cheaper-deal	2024-10-01T05:30:59-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ace4e88c325edcf693fb98769dfc94bf0c695ab/0_387_5755_3453/master/5755.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3c6a2cbddc08a7129048e392ea0aaa58

Doctors issue stark warning as Louisiana reclassifies abortion pills	Officials class mifepristone and misoprostol as ‘controlled substances’ – which medics say could imperil women’s lives Two common abortion pills are, as of Tuesday, classified as -controlled substances- in Louisiana, due to a first-of-its-kind law that medical professionals warn will endanger the lives of women by restricting medication used to treat postpartum hemorrhage and other conditions. Louisiana, which already bans abortion, passed a law reclassifying mifepristone and misoprostol as schedule IV drugs – a designation typically reserved for drugs that carry a risk of abuse or dependence. People caught with the drugs without a valid prescription could face up to five years in prison, although pregnant women who procure it for their own use are exempted from punishment under the law.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/01/louisiana-abortion-pills	2024-10-01T04:00:48-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/947a87eeb829147dc028d23f310e278485ee0dc2/0_223_6004_3602/master/6004.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8badf58c3f48e0c055e2b50373a2ce53

First Thing: Israel launches invasion into southern Lebanon	Israel says ‘heavy fighting’ is under way as it targets Hezbollah. Plus, the Picasso in the cellar Good morning. Israeli forces crossed the border into southern Lebanon early on Tuesday morning, the first Israeli ground invasion into the country since 2006. Why is Israel launching the offensive now? It comes after two weeks of airstrikes, which killed the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on Friday, and a series of deadly explosions to pagers and walkie-talkies that Israel hopes has weakened the agility and organization of Hezbollah. There is also little political incentive for Benjamin Netanyahu to let up, as targeting Hezbollah has given the embattled Israeli prime minister a political boost. What does the invasion mean for the stability of the region? Fears of a wider regional conflict, sparked by the Hamas attacks on 7 October, are closer than ever. The US has called for de-escalation. But, as Joe Biden prepares to leave the White House, Israel’s strongest ally appears to have little leverage. Meanwhile, the reformist-led government of Hezbollah’s backer Iran said it had no plans to send troops to Lebanon, but it was coming under domestic pressure from hardliners.

Tory leadership rivals turn on Jenrick over claims SAS ‘killing, not capturing, terrorists’ – UK politics live	Tugendhat and Cleverly echo criticisms from Labour and the military as the Tory conference gears up for another day Good morning. In a leadership contest, sometimes the dynamic changes because one candidate has a postive breakthrough moment (like David Cameron did in 2005, when his passionate, no-notes speech to the Tory conference turned him almost overnight into the favourite). But more often the odds shift because someone has messed up. Kemi Badenoch’s campaign faltered this week after her maternity pay gaffe. And now Robert Jenrick, the bookmakers’ favourite, has also made an error serious enough to cost him support. Yesterday he released a video claiming that that UK special forces are -killing rather than capturing- terrorists because of fears that European laws would free any detained assailants. As Rajeev Syal, Jessica Elgot and Dan Sabbagh report, he has been condemned for saying this by Labour and by figures in the military. No, I don’t. I think what he said is wrong, and I’m afraid demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of military operations and the law of armed conflict. I’m extremely concerned that such words should not be seen in any way to encourage people to take any action other than surrender to British forces when asked to do so. You’re going to have to ask Robert to justify that statement. That’s not something which I have heard, that’s not something which I’m comfortable repeating. When we have a threat to the UK, this lunacy of being unable to render people across borders or arrest people in countries whose police forces are unacceptable, means that we are more often than not forced into taking lethal action than actually raiding and detaining.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/01/tory-leadership-rivals-turn-on-jenrick-sas-claims-tugendhat-cleverly-badenoch-tory-conference-uk-politics-live	2024-10-01T00:54:59-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbbea68be56598eb4b28034a85439fcda821a091/0_278_8192_4915/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2636c4fc4403b03a5a5849a93ac83988

‘Everything is dead’: Ukraine rushes to stem ecocide after river poisoning	Russia is suspected of deliberately leaking chemical waste into a river, with deadly consequences for wildlife Serhiy Kraskov picked up a twig and poked at a small fish floating in the Desna River. -It’s a roach. It died recently. You can tell because its eyes are clear and not blurry,- he said. Hundreds of other fish had washed up nearby on the river’s green willow-fringed banks. A large pike lay in the mud. Nearby, in a patch of yellow lilies, was a motionless carp. -Everything is dead, starting from the tiniest minnow to the biggest catfish,- Kraskov added mournfully. Kraskov is the mayor of the village of Slabyn, in Ukraine’s northern Chernihiv region. The rustic settlement – population 520 – escaped the worst of Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion. But the war arrived last week in a new and horrible form. Ukrainian officials say the Russians deliberately poisoned the Seym River, which flows into the Desna. The Desna connects with a reservoir in the Kyiv region and a water supply used by millions.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/ukraine-seim-river-poisoning-chernihiv-ecocide-	2024-09-30T21:00:20-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5ca9f02f0fafbfbfa14eb70873dc173e54ea9bb/358_663_6362_3817/master/6362.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f1e6b8f7e2a7ae59de68810097db8b6f

Coles and Woolworths have leapfrogged their peers in profitability – these charts prove it	In 2008, the profits of Australia’s grocery duopoly were in line with overseas supermarkets. By 2024 they are among the highest in the world Sixteen years ago, the Rudd government ordered an inquiry into the supermarket sector amid rising public discontent about grocery prices. The sector was already highly concentrated with Coles and Woolworths enjoying a collective 65% share of the market, as the Franklins business withered and upstart Aldi was still in its early stage of expansion in Australia.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/01/coles-and-woolworths-have-leapfrogged-their-peers-in-profitability-these-charts-prove-it	2024-09-30T08:00:05-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ba97c9437100211153a9e1e4f6bb7ca918860af/0_198_7752_4653/master/7752.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72c14012a5670bb241cec35aa2e510f0

As rumours grow of a stop Badenoch campaign, Tories cannot risk a stitch-up	Whispers at party conference suggest a surprise candidate could join Robert Jenrick in leadership race’s final two There are four candidates for Conservative leader plying the conference with themed hats and tote bags – but only two are sucking all of the oxygen. It is no accident of scheduling that Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch were the ones on the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, much to the chagrin of their rivals. Reason would then dictate they would be the final two selected by Tory MPs to face the party members’ vote. If that transpires, the outcome would be very unpredictable. Jenrick has undergone a dramatic makeover and won the backing of the most MPs but he is virtually unknown to the wider public. Badenoch is the straight-talking renegade who is more of the members’ darling but who terrifies many of her parliamentary colleagues.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/30/stop-kemi-badenoch-campaign-rumours-tories-analysis	2024-09-30T06:53:32-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/177cf0197b6e6299ef6da117370c4b1816b532fb/304_51_2591_1555/master/2591.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=510c15dc7ed2a9a0eb5fa1c2cd555643

Austrian parties to begin talks on forming government after far-right win	Exit polls show Freedom party’s election gains came thanks to strong support among younger voters Austria’s main parties are preparing to begin tense wrangling to form a government amid warnings about the country’s democracy after the far right’s watershed victory in a general election that saw angry voters punish centrist incumbents over migration and inflation. On Sunday the anti-Islam, Kremlin-friendly Freedom party (FPÖ) scored its strongest result since its founding after the second world war by former Nazi functionaries and SS officers with just over 29% of the vote. The outcome surpassed expectations and beat the ruling centre-right People’s party (ÖVP) by nearly three percentage points.

Biden to address Hurricane Helene damage as Trump tries to turn it into campaign issue – US politics live	President to speak about response to storm; Trump to hit campaign trail in Georgia after accusing Biden and Harris of turning blind eye to destruction Good morning, US politics blog readers. After churning across the southern US and causing massive destruction and dozens of deaths in North Carolina, Georgia and elsewhere, Hurricane Helene appears set to collide with the presidential campaign. Donald Trump will speak this afternoon in Valdosta, Georgia about the storm, undoubtedly with an eye on turning the swing state’s voters away from Kamala Harris. The former president has already made the hurricane’s destruction into an attack line on the Democrats, reportedly accusing Joe Biden of -sleeping- as the storm raged. Speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania yesterday he also accused Harris of turning a blind eye to the destruction. Biden plans to speak from the White House at 10.30am ET about his administration’s response to the storm, while Harris has announced the cancellation of campaign events in Las Vegas today so she can return to Washington DC and be briefed on the storm’s impact at Fema headquarters. She’ll arrive just after 5pm. Harris’s economic policies are more popular with voters than Trump’s, new polling commissioned by the Guardian finds. The vice-president laid out her plans in a major speech last week. The vice-presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz is set for tomorrow evening, with both candidates preparing for what is currently the last scheduled debate before the election. Israel may or may not be on the verge of launching a ground invasion of Lebanon.

Hamas said on Monday the leader of its operation in Lebanon, Fatah Sharif Abu al-Amine, had been killed in an Israeli airstrike in the country’s south, with Lebanon’s national news agency reporting that the bombing struck a Palestinian refugee camp. What’s happening in Israeli politics? The opposition lawmaker Gideon Saar rejoined the government on Sunday, a step that is likely to strengthen the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

It’s 105F (41C) in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson, about 20 miles away from the bustle of tourists on the Vegas strip. Front yards have small pebbles instead of grass, and signs that welcome the start of autumn seem premature in the sweltering heat. Andrew Clarke knocks on the door of a ranch-style house.

Jenrick tells Tory conference it’s ‘leave or die’ as he ramps up calls for UK to exit ECHR – UK politics live	The former immigration minister, currently the bookmakers’ favourite to become leader, will take part in a Q&amp;A at the Tory party conference today Labour has called for an investigation into £75,000 of donations to Tory leadership contender Robert Jenrick, saying it had -serious concerns- about the money’s ultimate origin, PA Media reports. PA says: Jenrick, the frontrunner for the Conservative leadership, received three donations of £25,000 in July from The Spott Fitness, a fitness coaching app provider. As first reported by the Tortoise news website, the company’s latest accounts show it has no employees, has never made a profit and has more than £300,000 of debts, and in January it registered a loan from Centrovalli, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands. Our party’s survival rests on restoring our credibility on immigration. If we continue to duck and dance around this question our party has no future. Despite what others might falsely claim, we’ve never had a legal cap on legal migration. Unless we introduce one – where no visas will be issued unless net migration is in the tens of thousands or lower – we will be powerless to end the cycle of broken promises. Anyone who is not prepared to commit to a specific cap just doesn’t understand the depth of public anger.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/30/robert-jenrick-kemi-badenoch-conservative-party-conference-uk-politics-news-live-updates	2024-09-30T00:33:30-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a4dd2f6bc34b6d9dcb2b05972391d9505547762/745_70_6257_3755/master/6257.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=05affbfcd0b2d41b013e882497e4bbce

Middle East crisis live: Israel continues bombardment of Lebanon as Hezbollah mourns leader’s death	More than 1,000 people killed in Lebanon and one million displaced by Israeli strikes, Lebanese minister says Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the conflict in the Middle East. Israel has continued its attacks on Lebanon, with its military claiming to have hit dozens of Hezbollah targets in the past hours, a day after the Lebanese militant group confirmed its leader Hassan Nasrallah had been killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut. More than 1,000 people have been killed in Lebanon and more than 6,000 wounded as a result of Israeli attacks in the past two weeks, the health ministry said, and about one million Lebanese people have been displaced by the strikes, including hundreds of thousands since Friday, Nasser Yassin, the minister coordinating the government’s crisis response, has told Reuters. The Lebanese ministry of public health reported last night that the Israeli attacks across Lebanon yesterday killed 33 people and injured 195 others, according to Wafa, the Palestinian news agency. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has confirmed the death of Brig Gen Abbas Nilforoushan, deputy commander of IRGC operations. He was killed in the Israel’s air strikes on Lebanon on Friday which also killed other senior Hezbollah figures, including the group’s leader Hassan Nasrallah. In its statement mourning Nilforoushan’s killing, the IRGC condemned -crimes of the Zionist regime- in Lebanon and praised his role in defending the -resistance front- and Iran. It didn’t vow revenge against Israel. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has said Lebanese people are the new target of -Israel’s policy of genocide, occupation and invasion.- The Turkish leader, who has been highly critical of Israel’s ongoing assault on Gaza, said children were among Lebanese civilians who have been -murdered- by -brutal- Israeli strikes conducted on Lebanon this week. -By the grace and power of God, the blows struck by the Resistance Front on the worn-out, deteriorating body of the Zionist regime will become even more crushing,- said Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei about Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. He went on to add: -The foul-natured Zionist regime has not become victorious by carrying out this atrocity.- Iran’s parliament speaker, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, commenting on the killing of Nasrallah, said on Sunday that what Iran terms -resistance groups- will continue to confront Israel with the help of Iran, according to Iranian state media. Iran has called for the UN security council to meet over Israel’s assault on Lebanon and across the region. Joe Biden ordered the Pentagon to enhance America’s defence posture in the region. He said: -The United States fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and any other Iranian-supported terrorist groups.- UN secretary general António Guterres said he is -gravely concerned by the dramatic escalation of the events in Beirut in the last 24 hours-. He went on to add: -This cycle of violence must stop now. All sides must step back from the brink.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/29/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-bombardment-lebanon-hezbollah-hassan-nasrallah-latest	2024-09-29T00:33:49-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/069368af9afa369a52f22d68dabf30eaf6c45494/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3a20c1d8a0d4ee7410cffb47fba068cc

‘World of horrors’: families huddle on Beirut’s streets amid the bombs	Residents of Lebanon’s capital flee their homes and seek shelter as the death toll from Israel’s airstrikes rises Gunshots fired into the air, women wailing in the streets, the ever-present buzz of drones and the distant thud of Israeli airstrikes: this was the sound of mourning in Beirut on Saturday. Hassan Nasrallah, who led Hezbollah for 32 years, was dead, killed in an Israeli airstrike on Dahieh, in the southern suburbs of Beirut, the day before. For many in Lebanon, his killing had been unimaginable. But Israel’s war with Hezbollah had long surpassed what was previously thought possible. Pagers had exploded in hands, walkie-talkies blew up in belts and Israeli warplanes killed hundreds in half a day. The death of Nasrallah was one more blow to the Lebanese psyche, already struggling to grasp soaring death tolls and, for some, the loss of their home overnight.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/28/world-of-horrors-families-huddle-on-beiruts-streets-amid-the-bombs	2024-09-28T12:25:51-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e868600619a275d3bdf336c4abf96549eecf4f6/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a48dad94232565775e4248b4f2d42074

Senior Tories cast doubt over Boris Johnson’s plan to ‘invade the Netherlands’	Former prime minister’s claims about wanting to seize Covid vaccines being held in the EU ‘may have been a joke’ Senior Tories have cast doubt on Boris Johnson’s claim that he seriously considered invading the Netherlands to seize vaccines during the pandemic, saying the story had obviously been overblown and re-heated to boost sales of his memoirs. The former prime minister says in his new book, Unleashed, that he asked senior members of the armed forces about the possibility of conducting an -aquatic raid- on a warehouse in Leiden in March 2021 in order to get hold of 5m doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine which he believed the EU did not want to be exported to the UK.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/28/senior-tories-cast-doubt-over-boris-johnsons-plan-to-invade-the-netherlands	2024-09-28T09:41:43-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9f2ec98a48f7da9f2d4c100ddbb4b2d8d34af89/0_7_4919_2951/master/4919.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2e58cd1cbd1d77619e54997a962b7eea

New College has made headlines since January 2023, when the rightwing governor, Ron DeSantis, vowed to transform it from a university known for liberal values into a conservative institution, and installed a new board of trustees including the rightwing culture warrior Christopher Rufo.

Russia-Ukraine war live: six reported killed in Sumy after Russian strikes on hospital	Ukraine’s interior minister said one person killed in initial attack before the site was hit again during the evacuation At least six people were killed Saturday morning following two consecutive Russian strikes on a medical centre in Sumy, a city in northeastern Ukraine. Ihor Klymenko, Ukraine’s interior minister, said on Telegram that one person died in the initial shelling that destroyed several floors of the hospital – but during the evacuation of the hospital’s patients, Russian forces struck again, killing more. A policeman was one of the six confirmed dead. China and Brazil on Friday pressed ahead with an effort to gather developing countries behind a plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine – an effort that Zelenskyy has dismissed as one that serves Moscow’s interests. Seventeen countries attended a meeting on the sidelines of the UN general assembly chaired by China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, and Brazilian foreign policy adviser Celso Amorim. Wang told reporters they discussed the need to prevent escalation in the war, avoid the use of weapons of mass destruction and prevent attacks on nuclear power plants. Zelenskyy, in a speech to the assembly earlier this week, questioned why China and Brazil were proposing an alternative to his own peace formula. Proposing -alternatives, half-hearted settlement plans, so-called sets of principles- would only give Moscow the political space to continue the war, he said. US secretary of state Antony Blinken, speaking after a meeting with Wang, underscored strong US concerns about China’s support for Russia’s defence industrial base. He told reporters that China, while saying it seeks an end to the Ukraine conflict, -is allowing its companies to take actions that are actually helping Putin continue the aggression. That doesn’t add up.- South Korea’s foreign minister said Russia was engaging in illegal arms trade with North Korea, reiterating statements by the US, Ukraine and independent analysts that Pyongyang is supplying rockets and missiles in return for economic and other military assistance from Moscow. Misuse of Russia’s right to veto as a permanent member of the UN security council is hindering the UN’s efforts to end war, foreign minister Cho Tae-yul said during the UN general assembly on Saturday. Finland will place a key Nato base less than 200 kilometers (125 miles) from its border with Russia, -sending a message- to its eastern neighbour, the defence ministry said Friday. Finland became a Nato member last year, dropping decades of military non-alignment after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. A Russian drone may have breached the national airspace of Nato member Romania for -a very brief period of under three minutes- overnight during an attack on neighbouring Ukraine, the Romanian defence ministry said on Friday. Three people were killed in the attack, according to Ukrainan officials. Russia’s FSB security service is investigating three foreign journalists for reporting in parts of Russia’s Kursk region occupied by Ukrainian forces, bringing the total of such investigations to 12.

If the numbers offer a glimpse of the toll that last week’s wildfires took on this northern Portuguese municipality – four people dead, at least seven injured, 25,269 hectares burned and 81 homes damaged – they cannot convey the sense of fear and loss that the 26 metre-high flames brought with them.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/27/absolute-chaos-counting-the-cost-of-a-deadly-wildfire-in-northern-portugal	2024-09-27T04:38:00-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3897b18dd689bafcc061ebe055bd76f8d7cd65ca/0_448_6425_3855/master/6425.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2647bbe9274a0287fe68d8e0a09db97b

Anti-immigration mood sweeping EU capitals puts strain on bloc’s unity	From Germany’s border checks to France’s vow to restore order, rejection of open borders could threaten Schengen zone In 2015, when more than 1.3 million people headed to Europe, mostly fleeing a brutal war in Syria, the response of Germany’s then chancellor, Angela Merkel, was to say -Wir schaffen das- (-We can manage this-), and open the country’s borders. Less than a decade later, and faced with a flow of irregular arrivals less than 10% of what it was at the peak of the bloc’s migration crisis, EU capitals are increasingly saying, -No, we can’t.- Or, perhaps more accurately, -We won’t.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/27/anti-immigration-mood-sweeping-eu-capitals-puts-strain-on-blocs-unity	2024-09-27T04:24:52-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/124fd3d4fac518343f47a84f072ef7557c01fe0f/0_0_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25ef6ee128261bfc388d27f6972366f4
Stalking victims left at ‘serious risk’ by police failures, report finds	Damning report by police chiefs in England and Wales reveals systemic failures in support for victims and calls for change Systemic failures in the way police deal with stalkers are leaving victims at -serious risk- with some given wrong and -potentially dangerous- advice, a damning report by police chiefs in England and Wales has found. Ten months after a coroner warned that stalking victims were facing a -postcode lottery- of support following the death of Gracie Spinks at the hands of her stalker, an internal examination has found evidence of the risks of stalking being downplayed, officers failing to join the dots between stalking incidents and a lack of training and confusion over what constitutes stalking. A lack of assessments may be leaving some victims at serious risk. Laws and guidance for police are -confusing and inconsistent-. There is a lack of understanding by police of the scale and types of stalking in their area.

At least three killed as Hurricane Helene makes landfall | First Thing	Hurricane Helene is expected to bring life-threatening storm surges as high as 20ft. Plus, Eric Adams charged Good morning. Hurricane Helene made landfall as a category 4 hurricane in the Florida Big Bend region around 11.10pm ET on Thursday, one of the strongest hurricanes on record to hit Florida. The storm weakened to a category 1 overnight. How dangerous is a storm surge? As a hurricane approaches a coast, the churning winds force ocean water up onto land; atmospheric pressure from the storm also helps squeeze the water ashore. The shallower the continental shelf, the higher the threat of a dangerous surge. Water is heavy, and it can move fast in a surge, sweeping people to their deaths, throwing about boats and vehicles, and pulverizing structures. Follow our live blog here. What did Netanyahu say? -We are continuing to strike Hezbollah with full force, and we will not stop until we reach all our goals – chief among them the return of the residents of the north securely to their homes.- He addresses the UN today. What is the scale of the war? Israeli airstrikes have killed about 700 people since Monday – with that day representing the highest death toll in a single day in Lebanon since the civil war of 1975-90 – and reports have suggested Israel is making plans for a ground offensive.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/27/first-thing-at-least-3-killed-as-hurricane-helene-makes-landfall	2024-09-27T02:54:30-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd96f91fe267b38e206fd5e50b7a5e1879a3c60d/0_302_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6d760f1b1452963b5299934e4467d31c

New leader of Scottish Conservatives to be announced – UK politics live	Second largest group in Holyrood will announce leader who will take over from Douglas Ross Labour MP Emily Thornberry, asked about the prime minister meeting potential future US president, has said that Donald Trump -styles it out somewhat- with alleged racism. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee chair said: If he’s president and he starts caging Mexican children, then that needs to be called out. We are actually in a really strong position now, in that if you think about all the other G7 countries, we are a country that we have just had an election, we have a progressive Government with a large majority and stability in front of us - a good five years of the same leader. And if you look at the other G7 countries, they don’t necessarily have that. Donald Trump may be the president of the United States in a couple of months’ time so of course, it’s important to have meetings with him and to build a relationship with him. Whatever criticisms one may have of Donald Trump, the point is that the office of president is one that needs to be properly respected and the Americans are very close friends of ours.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/27/new-leader-scottish-conservatives-keir-starmer-labour-uk-politics-live	2024-09-27T01:27:10-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0d3769e338c4d59d03a47154f04c5143396b320/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d1d875842b3d0fe18b751f6997bb3fb5

Middle East crisis live: Israeli and US officials discuss Lebanon ceasefire proposal on sidelines of UN general assembly	The meeting comes after Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel would not stop its attacks on Hezbollah despite calls for a temporary truce Israeli and US officials have met to discuss a US-backed ceasefire proposal with Hezbollah, the office of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late on Thursday. The meetings – which happened in New York on the sidelines of the UN general assembly, would continue in the days ahead, Netanyahu’s office said, adding that they appreciated the US efforts. Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel -will not stop- its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon despite calls from the US, France and other allies for an immediate three-week ceasefire. The Israeli prime minister told reporters that his government’s policy was clear as he landed in New York on Thursday. -We are continuing to strike Hezbollah with full force, and we will not stop until we reach all our goals,- Netanyahu said. The US and France called for a 21-day temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah to make way for broader negotiations. A joint statement calling for -a diplomatic settlement- of the crisis was also endorsed by the UK, Australia, Canada, the European Union, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. It called for an urgent cessation of hostilities, which presented -an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation-. Lebanon’s minister for foreign affairs, Abdallah Bouhabib, has said his country is enduring a crisis that -threatens its very existence-. Speaking at the UN general assembly, he has said that his government welcomed yesterday’s ceasefire plan raised by the US and France – and demanded it be implemented. US officials hope to persuade Netanyahu to accept the ceasefire proposal by the time he addresses the UN general assembly on Friday. They argue that a pause in the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah could also provide a breathing space in which to revive long-stalled negotiations with Israel and Hamas over the release of Israeli hostages in return for a truce in Gaza. Hezbollah has yet to respond to the call for a truce, although it and its backer, Iran, have previously insisted it would halt its strikes only if there is a ceasefire in Gaza. Israeli airstrikes continued in Lebanon on Thursday, in which health authorities said 92 people had been killed. Two people were killed and 15 others injured, including a woman in critical condition, after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on Thursday, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. Israel said it carried out a strike that it said killed one of the heads of the Hezbollah air force unit, Mohammad Surur. Hezbollah later confirmed his death.

UK returning to ‘responsible global leadership’, Keir Starmer to tell UN – UK politics live	The UK’s prime minister is due to give a speech to the UN’s general assembly later Good morning. Keir Starmer spoke at the United Nations security council yesterday, but today he is speaking at the UN’s general assembly (UNGA). In some respects these are chaotic meetings – world leaders queuing up to give speeches one after another, often over-running their times slots, not necessarily having much positive impact – but that does not mean it’s not a big gig for a debut PM. According to advance briefing, Starmer will say the UK is returning to -responsible global leadership- because it is in British interests to address problems around the world. He will say: War, poverty and climate change all rebound on us at home. They make us less secure, they harm our economy, and they create migration flows on an unprecedented scale.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/26/uk-politics-labour-keir-starmer-un-general-assembly-speech	2024-09-26T00:55:01-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a83cf541703c61e5981ca7ce5d768d69fd6d7b8/388_170_3359_2016/master/3359.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=711ddcb70b6c71afc7d9dabdbbda8a38
