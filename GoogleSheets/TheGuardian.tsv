Trump refuses to say whether he wants Ukraine to win war against Russia	During the presidential debate Trump refused to back a victory for Kyiv, opening himself up to renewed attacks over his closeness to Putin Donald Trump sidestepped a direct question at Tuesday evening’s presidential debate on whether he wanted Ukraine to win in its war against Russia, underlining concerns that a second Trump administration could suspend military support for Kyiv. Asked directly by ABC’s David Muir on whether or not he wants Ukraine to win the war, he did not answer the question and said simply: -I want the war to stop.- He focused on the war’s human toll by saying that people were being killed -by the millions,- a number that hasn’t been confirmed by any country or international organisation.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/11/us-presidential-debate-donald-trump-ukraine-war	2024-09-10T21:51:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f6bb30dd97c4ebea0bd5559aed56cdcb765b6d5/0_29_2775_1665/master/2775.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bc067f043b5fe2241b8fb34ae1d2e85b
Trump reels off falsehoods on abortion and immigration in debate with Harris	Presidential candidates meet for first time in fiery face-off as moderators fact-check Trump’s statements Kamala Harris and Donald Trump sparred on Tuesday in a contentious presidential debate that repeatedly went off the rails, as Trump pursued bizarre and often falsehood-ridden tangents about crowd sizes, immigration policy and abortion access. The Philadelphia debate marked arguably the most significant opportunity for both Harris and Trump since Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race in July, and the event began cordially enough. Harris crossed over to Trump’s podium to shake his hand and introduce herself, an acknowledgement that the two presidential nominees had never met face to face before Tuesday night.

Trump fumbles debate question about Harris’s race and revisits Central Park Five	Ex-president appears to defend earlier call for death penalty and struggles to account for comments on vice-president During the presidential debate on Tuesday, Donald Trump appeared to defend his decades-old calls for the reinstatement of the death penalty after five Black and Latino teenagers known as the Central Park Five were wrongfully convicted of rape in New York. When moderators asked the former president and Kamala Harris to speak on the topic of race in America, Trump struggled to account for his previous remarks questioning Harris’s racial identity – and to deal with his fraught history on the subject.

Trump-Harris debate live: presidential nominees to face off in high-stakes showdown	Harris and Trump expected to go on attack when debate kicks off at 9pm ET, as polls show one of tightest US election races ever Good evening, US politics blog readers, and thanks for joining us as we cover tonight’s debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, which we expect to be a milestone in what has already been a historically tumultuous presidential race. The two contenders are set to square off for 90 minutes at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, with ABC News hosting and their anchors, David Muir and Linsey Davis, moderating. The Democratic and Republican candidates are meeting as polls indicate a neck-in-neck race between them, particularly in the seven swing states expected to decide the winner. This will be Harris’s first debate against Trump since she became the Democratic standard bearer. Joe Biden and Trump faced off in June, but the president put in such a poor showing that it sparked a plunge in his poll numbers and a Democratic pressure campaign that contributed to his decision to end his bid for a second term. Though Harris has been vice-president since 2021, she has done only one formal interview since launching her presidential campaign, and polls have indicated that voters are looking to find out more about her plans, if elected. This debate could present her with the opportunity to do that – while, for Trump, he’ll be given the chance to make the case for his return to the White House. Will either candidate deliver a knockout blow to the other? Biden certainly received one when he encountered Trump just over two months ago, though he was far from the only candidate to emerge from a debate with their campaign hanging by a thread. Will Trump say something insensitive about Harris’s racial identity? Just days after she launched her campaign, the former president claimed that the vice-president was not really Black, sparking outrage. What will Harris say about her policies? She inherited a campaign from Biden, but has slowly deviated from some of his proposals. Look out for anything she has to say about US support to Israel, and her previous stances toward immigration – a subject Trump is sure to bring up.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/10/harris-trump-presidential-debate-updates	2024-09-10T15:44:31-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dee6de38a9282a6105cc4a04617a2016276d0d3e/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b35e7fbf64d30a0fe9ba02a62582d59b

‘We’ll get the blame’: tensions simmer within Labour over winter fuel cut	While Commons rebellion was small-scale, behind the scenes, anger over handling of the policy is said to run high In the end, the vote to cut the winter fuel allowance passed easily. Hundreds of loyalist Labour MPs tramped through the lobbies to back the government’s controversial plan. No 10 will hope the heat has gone out of the issue. But despite dodging a major rebellion, plenty in government were not taking much comfort from the result.

Family of Ethel Rosenberg say US document proves she was no Soviet spy	Sons whose mother was executed with her husband Julius in 1953 say newly released document proves innocence The family of Ethel Rosenberg, who was sent to the electric chair along with her husband, Julius, in 1953 after being convicted of spying for the Soviets at the height of the Red Scare, have called on Joe Biden to formally exonerate her after a newly released document appeared to show that the US government knew she was not a spy. The couple maintained their innocence until the end and the case of the Rosenbergs has long been seen as a possible miscarriage of justice.

First Thing: Harris and Trump make final preparations as Philadelphia debate looms	Polls neck and neck as the presidential candidates prepare to clash in Tuesday’s ABC debate. Plus, inside the global organ trade Good morning. At 9pm EST tonight, on a debate stage in Philadelphia, weeks of rigorous preparation and breathless analysis will be road-tested with reality, as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump go head-to-head in their first presidential debate.

DoJ warns states over voter purges – as it happened	Pew report says 49% of voters would choose Harris, with the same number planning to vote for Trump; justice officials remind states about voting laws The statement of support for Kamala Harris by a group of retired top military officials comes a day before the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, and the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, will host a congressional gold medal ceremony honoring the 13 service members killed in the chaotic 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal. Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans have tried to blame Harris for the Afghanistan pullout, including in a report by House GOP lawmakers today. Our investigation reveals the Biden-Harris administration had the information and opportunity to take necessary steps to plan for the inevitable collapse of the Afghan government. At each step of the way, however, the administration picked optics over security. Without involving the Afghan government, he and his administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban that freed 5,000 Taliban fighters and allowed them to return to the battlefield. This chaotic approach severely hindered the Biden-Harris administration’s ability to execute the most orderly withdrawal possible and put our service members and our allies at risk.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/09/trump-harris-presidential-debate-election-latest-updates	2024-09-09T15:59:56-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b37b1f5c23d472eae975f0b6381b9599ea3ae4a7/0_104_4639_2783/master/4639.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=37a29180bf181d8f6a97df5c0f5510b0

Middle East crisis: Israeli strikes on Syria kill at least 25 people, war monitor says – as it happened	Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the dead include civilians as well as soldiers and ‘Syrians working with pro-Iran groups’ The UN human rights chief has said that ending the war in Gaza is a priority and asked countries to act on what he called Israel’s -blatant disregard- for international law in the occupied Palestinian territories. -States must not – cannot – accept blatant disregard for international law, including binding decisions of the (UN) security council and orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), neither in this nor any other situation,- the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Turk, said in a speech at the opening of the UN human rights council in Geneva. The court considers that the violations by Israel of the prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force and of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination have a direct impact on the legality of the continued presence of Israel, as an occupying power, in the occupied Palestinian territory. The sustained abuse by Israel of its position as an occupying power, through annexation and an assertion of permanent control over the occupied Palestinian territory and continued frustration of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, violates fundamental principles of international law and renders Israel’s presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful. Forcible evictions, extensive house demolitions and restrictions on residence and movement. The transfer by Israel of settlers to the West Bank and East Jerusalem and maintenance of their presence. Its failure to prevent or to punish attacks by settlers. Restricting the access of the Palestinian population to water. Israel’s use of the natural resources in the occupied Palestinian territory.

Weather tracker: Francine looking likely to be next Atlantic hurricane	An area of low pressure in the Gulf of Mexico is moving landward, and is expected to bring intense rainfall Francine could soon be the next to be ticked off the list of Atlantic hurricane storm names this week. On Friday, a broad area of low pressure emerged in the Gulf of Mexico, designated as Invest 91L. An -invest- – a shorthand for -investigative area- – refers to a region of atmospheric disturbance, characterised by low pressure and thunderstorms, and is closely monitored for its potential to evolve into a tropical cyclone.
