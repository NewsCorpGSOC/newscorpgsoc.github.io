First Thing: Trump to announce 25% aluminum and steel tariffs as China’s levies kick in	US allies criticize Trump’s plans as harmful for all parties.

Donald Trump has said he will announce new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the US on Monday that would affect -everybody-, including its largest trading partners, Canada and Mexico, in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul. How have US allies reacted? Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, said tariffs would harm European economies but also the US, given the level of economic ties. -It means if you put tariffs on a lot of sectors, it will increase the costs and create inflation in the US. Is it what your people want? I’m not so sure,- Macron said. How are markets reacting? Gold hit an all-time high of $2,900 per ounce, as trade war fears spark a dash for safe assets. Major US indexes – the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq – had modest gains in pre-market trading. What else did Unicef say?

Minister defends plan to broadcast footage of deportation of illegal workers – UK politics live	Angela Eagle defends government plan to broadcast deportations as Home Office launches new immigration raids The Labour MP Oliver Ryan is to meet the government chief whip to decide on any sanctions over his membership of a WhatsApp group that featured racist, sexist and other offensive comments, Angela Eagle has said. Peter Walker has the story. Good morning. Politicians like to claim that they are completely different from their opponents, because to win elections they need dividing line issues, but in truth the similarities can be striking too, because they end up facing the same challenges, and the electorate does not change much either. This Labour government is not the same as the last Conservative one. But at times it has sounded like Rishi Sunak (it adopted his signature anti-smoking legislation wholesale), Liz Truss (ministers constantly stress that growth is the number one priority) and even Boris Johnson (after the negativism of last year’s budget, there is a pivot towards more optimism). And today it it is sounding a bit like Theresa May in her -hostile environment- phase as home secretary. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, is expected to join an early morning raid this week targeting illegal working, while the government will broadcast footage of deportations, a number of them involving foreign criminals, from detention to removal centres and on to waiting planes … Downing Street is planning to go beyond simply taking the fight to Reform. -We don’t think it’s enough just to look strong on migration, we actually need to be strong.

Emmanuel Macron hosts AI summit, while EU braces for Trump tariffs – Europe live	Tech conference will also mark first visit to Europe for new US vice-president JD Vance Responding to Trump’s comments on aluminium and steel tariffs overnight, the EU has just said that it had not received any official notification yet, but insisted there was no justification of any such move and it would be ready to respond if needed. A spokesperson for the European Commission said: We will not respond to broad announcements without details or written clarification. The EU sees no justification for the imposition of tariffs on its exports. We will react to protect the interests of European businesses, workers and consumers from unjustified measures. In general: The imposition of tariffs would be unlawful and economically counterproductive, especially given the deeply integrated production chains the EU and U.S. established through transatlantic trade and investment. Tariffs are essentially taxes. By imposing tariffs, the U.S. would be taxing its own citizens, raising costs for business, and fuelling inflation. Moreover, tariffs heighten economic uncertainty and disrupt the efficiency and integration of global markets.

Ukraine war live: Zelenskyy ready for talks if given ‘an understanding that US and Europe will not abandon us’	Ukrainian president’s comments came as Donald Trump indicated he had been in contact with Russia’s Vladimir Putin Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he would be ready for talks in any format if he has -an understanding that America and Europe will not abandon us-. Chinese President Xi Jinping has accepted Russia’s invitation to Moscow to attend second world war commemorations, Tass state news agency reported on Monday. Trump’s national security adviser Mike Waltz said on Sunday that senior US diplomats would be in Europe this week -talking through the details of how to end this war and that will mean getting both sides to the table-. In an interview on NBC Waltz said the Russian economy was not doing well and that Trump -is prepared to tax, to tariff, to sanction- Moscow to get Putin to the negotiating table. He added that the Trump administration is looking to use this week’s engagements to begin talks on clawing back some of the United States’ assistance to Ukraine nd said European allies would need to take a greater role in supporting Ukraine. Russia’s deputy foreign minister said Moscow had yet to receive a good offer to start talks on Ukraine, in remarks published on Monday. -It is important that words be backed up by practical steps that take into account Russia’s legitimate interests, demonstrating a readiness to eradicate the root causes of the crisis and recognise the new realities,- Mikhail Galuzin told Ria state news agency in an interview. -Concrete proposals of this nature have not yet been received,- he said. Russia launched an overnight drone attack on Kyiv, injuring a woman and damaging several houses in the northeastern city of Sumy, Ukrainian officials said on Monday. The Ukrainian military said on Monday that it had shot down 61 out of 83 drones with 22 more likely downed by electronic warfare. Russia said on Sunday that its forces had captured the eastern Ukrainian village of Orikhovo-Vasylivka, near the strategic military hub of Chasiv Yar that Moscow is attempting to seize. An explosion on Sunday on an oil tanker at a port in north-west Russia forced the crew to evacuate and was being investigated, the country’s federal shipping agency said.

Middle East crisis live: returning Palestinians ‘shocked’ by ‘complete scale of destruction’ of northern Gaza	Unicef says many displaced people had hoped their homes had been spared, but have returned to total devastation Welcome back to our live coverage of the latest news from the Middle East. Displaced Palestinian families who have returned to northern Gaza since the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas came into effect last month have been -shocked- by the -complete scale of destruction- of their homes and neighbourhoods, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef). The families that I’ve spoken to this week here in the north of Gaza have been shocked by what they have returned to. They’ve been shocked by the complete scale of this destruction. Even after seeing photos and videos from the south, they hoped that their homes, their neighborhoods, their communities, maybe had been spared. Egypt will host an Arab summit on 27 February to discuss what it said were -serious- developments for Palestinian people, according to the country’s foreign ministry. Egypt has rejected Donald Trump’s plans – condemned as ethnic cleansing - to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank to neighbouring countries such as Egypt and Jordan. Speaking on Sunday, the US President repeated his pledge to take control of the Gaza Strip. -I’m committed to buying and owning Gaza. As far as us rebuilding it, we may give it to other states in the Middle East to build sections of it. Other people may do it through our auspices. But we’re committed to owning it, taking it, and making sure that Hamas doesn’t move back. There’s nothing to move back into. The place is a demolition site. The remainder will be demolished,- he told reporters. A spokesperson for Israeli prime minster Benjamin Netanyahu said that an Israeli delegation arrived in Qatar on Sunday for further ceasefire talks between Hamas and Israel. Reuters reports that indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas on the next stage of the ceasefire are set to begin this week.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/10/middle-east-crisis-live-palestinians-complete-destruction-northern-gaza-latest-news	2025-02-09T23:51:54-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85754371c4999963567a264f47c0e1179e33efc7/0_209_6260_3757/master/6260.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7b4acfd65ee2f2a9931be04665e88d68
Monday briefing: Why the brutal fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo could spiral into wider war	In today’s newsletter: As Rwandan-backed M23 rebels seize more territory and the humanitarian crisis worsens, what’s the background to the war and prospect of peace? Good morning. Over the weekend, the presidents of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda – Félix Tshisekedi and Paul Kagame – were among those who took part in a regional summit aimed at ending the resurgent violence in eastern DRC. The summit ended with a call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. But while there was a lull in the fighting yesterday, many fear that a ceasefire is less likely than escalation to a wider regional war. Rwanda does not officially admit to its involvement in the latest episode of the long-running and devastating conflict in eastern DRC. But M23, an armed group with Rwanda’s tacit and practical support, has taken the capital of North Kivu province, Goma, and is now moving south to expand the territory under its control. At stake is control of a mineral-rich region of crucial strategic significance, and the fate of civilians there who are frequently the subject of ethnically targeted attacks – but also the question of whether national borders can act as any sort of constraint. Arms trade | Britain’s system for controlling arms exports is broken, subject to political manipulation and has seen conduct that crossed the threshold into complicity with war crimes, a former UK diplomat has claimed. Mark Smith said officials were instructed to manipulate findings on the misuse of UK arms by allies. Immigration | The Home Office is launching a fresh wave of immigration raids as Labour attempts to counter the growing political threat from Reform UK. Amid anger from critics who believe the approach echoes Theresa May’s -hostile environment- regime, the government will broadcast footage of deportations from detention to removal centres and on to waiting planes. Israel-Gaza war | Israeli forces have withdrawn from the strategic corridor that divides northern and southern Gaza, as part of a ceasefire plan that has brought a fragile pause to the 16-month war. Despite the withdrawal – and the release of hostages and prisoners – little progress has been made on negotiating the second phase of the deal. Air pollution | More than 1,100 people a year in the UK are developing the most prevalent form of lung cancer as a result of air pollution, the Guardian can reveal. Health experts, cancer charities and environmental campaigners said the UK findings were -devastating- Trump tariffs | Donald Trump has said he will announce new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the US on Monday that would affect -everybody’, including its largest trading partners Canada and Mexico, in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/10/monday-briefing-why-the-brutal-conflict-in-the-democratic-republic-of-congo-could-spiral-into-wider-war	2025-02-09T22:53:17-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80e2fafb43e0d8e758c182d76562fdb8d12436d5/0_352_5651_3392/master/5651.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40778a090c4c3570294644c7f90a0d05

‘Finally this is justice’: the Assad torture survivors who guard their former jail	Men imprisoned and abused at the notorious Palestine branch detention centre return to the facility as free men The first thing the three militants did on entering Syria’s notorious Palestine branch prison as free men was to search for their former solitary confinement cells. They crossed under the towering iron gates and barbed wire at the edge of the Damascus complex after the fall of Bashar al-Assad and headed immediately to the squalid cells just a few feet wide where they had spent years huddled in the dark, staring at the back of the heavy metal doors and drawing on the walls. Mahmoud Chtawi said that when he entered he lifted his head to gaze up at the 10-storey concrete building just to prove to himself that he could. For decades, anyone passing the facility run by military intelligence was terrified to even steal a glance. He headed to find cell number 15, firing off rounds of bullets in celebration when he did. He then decided to spend the night inside his former cell to -process the memories- of his time there.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/10/syria-assad-torture-survivors-guard-their-former-jail	2025-02-09T21:00:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb79033552b4b44223afec7b082db828dd66c8ec/0_127_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b983ed59b02e39e1268446933989d34e

But it has faced opposition from the Twentieth Century Society, which has submitted a listing application to Historic England that could prevent its destruction.	https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/feb/09/artists-decry-irresponsible-plans-to-demolish-brutalist-midlands-tower	2025-02-09T05:00:01-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1675043452506aa08903f4c958cc7d55486fa4ab/299_706_3208_1926/master/3208.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b189fb3f8d69a37c8d5a9932be378284
Trump’s claim that Mexican cartels and government are allied is not reality	Corruption in Mexico is a problem, experts say, but any claim the two are linked shows a lack of comprehension Mexico breathed a sigh of relief this week when Donald Trump delayed his threatened tariffs by a month, apparently swerving away from an economic crisis at the last moment. But one aspect of the spat still rankles: the Trump administration’s vague but shocking accusation of an -intolerable alliance- between Mexico’s government and organised crime.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/09/trump-mexico-organised-crime-corruption	2025-02-09T04:30:49-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c94f705fcf2575e541cb1779b4084c10c60a85a3/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d1ddf1dc924f9f17a776983641825f68

US Democrats call for more aggressive tactics against Trump and Musk: ‘We’re going to be the opposition’	As Trump aims to dismantle large swaths of US government, growing outcry from Democrats appears to be having an effect When organizers announced a -Nobody Elected Elon- protest at the treasury department’s headquarters in Washington – in response to the revelation that Elon Musk’s -department of government efficiency- (Doge) had accessed sensitive taxpayer data – not a single Democratic lawmaker had agreed to attend. But as public outrage mounted over Donald Trump’s brazen assault on the federal government, the speaking list grew. In the end, more than two dozen Democratic members of Congress including Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, spoke at the event, which drew hundreds of protesters outside on a frigid Tuesday last week.

Nigel Farage has been a threat to every recent UK prime minister. But this is something new	Reform has surged in the polls, panicking both Labour and the Conservatives. It’s a trap, and the risks are high Nigel Farage is making trouble again. Reform, his latest political vehicle, has surged in the polls, moving into first place with some pollsters, and ruffling feathers on Labour back benches. While Farage has caused headaches for every prime minister since David Cameron, his recent rise is something new. Reform scored an average of almost 25% in January polls, past the peaks achieved by Ukip or the Brexit party in earlier parliaments. And while past Farage surges were spikes driven by circumstances – European parliament elections, the EU referendum, the collapse of Theresa May’s ­government – the current rise is more sustained. This Farage boom is no bubble.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/08/nigel-farage-reform-uk-labour-conservatives	2025-02-08T09:08:58-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27cb4b7895a349500e0a756d1b6e692923974cb0/0_202_8192_4915/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e434bb7a8998d89aaa5e2f4d8c0c0705

Carson’s book, Crooked Cross, predicted the scale of the Nazi threat and is to be republished for the first time this spring, ahead of the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war. Controversial in its day, her novel had to walk a careful path to avoid the accusation that it was alarmist about the Fuhrer’s aims.

In what was a fraught and contentious Senate confirmation hearing last week, Patel, Trump’s pick to head the FBI, made a point to describe some of the racism he has faced in the US as the son of Indian Gujarati immigrants.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/07/trump-kash-patel-fbi-extremists	2025-02-07T07:00:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f7569406ceb05675d0d574ac994c14c0dfbc8d0/0_93_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3fe7307632cac476eaea8474463036cf

A hardline approach to law and order. A purge of -gender ideology- and -wokeness- from the nation’s schools. Erosions of academic freedom, judicial independence and the free press. An alliance with Christian nationalism. An assault on democratic institutions. The -electoral autocracy- that is Viktor Orbán’s Hungary has been long revered by Donald Trump and his -Make America Great Again- (Maga) movement. Now admiration is turning into emulation.

Even Donald Trump’s allies have admitted that his proposal for the US to -take over- Gaza and for Palestinians to make their homes elsewhere was an idea he had only tinkered with before Tuesday evening, when it tumbled out to the obvious surprise of his closest aides. One of the very few constituencies to welcome the proposal – which if enacted would amount to the effective ethnic cleansing of the territory – was Israel’s rightwing pro-settler movement and their allies in the US.

They won’t be in Downing Street, and it has been described by some people as an away days, but it is not one of those away days that involves a spa hotel in the countryside. They will be somewhere in Whitehall apparently, but being out of Downing Street should provide a change of scene. One of the problems the government needs to address soon is what to do about the rising cost of working-age people on sickness and disability benefits. A recent inquiry by the Lords economic affairs committee found that that there are 3.7m, people of working-age on health-related benefits – up 1.2m on the figure five years ago – and that incapcity and disability benefits are costing almost £65bn, more than the government spends on defence. Kendall said that some people on sickness and disability benefits who think they could not do a job probably could work with the right support. Asked about a DWP survey saying 49% of people on these benefits think they will never be able to work, Kendall said: I don’t blame people for thinking that they can’t, because they’re stuck on a waiting list for treatment. They haven’t had the proper support that they might need from the job centre or the skills that they need to get the jobs, we’ve also got to create more jobs in the areas that need them most. So I’m under no illusions about the scale of the challenge that we’ve got. I believe more of those people could work. But even if we just start with those who say they can, we need to do more to get them back into work. She said that the government’s drive to cut waiting lists would make a difference. She said: When 2 in 5 of people on sickness and disability benefits are stuck on an NHS waiting list, we’ve got to drive those down. That’s why health secretary Wes Streeting has got a big plan to drive down that backlog, get people the help they need. She said there were some people claiming sickness and disability benefits who were -taking the mickey-. Asked if she agreed with people who think that too many claimants are just pretending they cannot work, she replied: If you speak to people here today, you will know that many of them have either just lost jobs that they desperately miss, or really want to get back into to work once they’ve got their health condition under control. So I think that there are many more people who want to work. I have no doubt, as there always have been, there are people who shouldn’t be on those benefits who are taking the mickey and that is not good enough - we have to end that. She suggested that some young people might have to adjust more to having to work. Asked if she agreed that some conditions were being over-medicalised, and that people were taking time off for anxiety when in the past that might just have been regarded as normal worry, she replied: I think there is genuinely a problem with many young people, particularly the Covid generation. But we can’t have a situation where doing a day’s work is in itself seen as stressful. I went to visit one of my local supermarkets recently to see the brilliant work they’re doing with the charity to get young people into work. And we saw two things. One was young people with genuine mental health problems who the supermarket was doing great stuff to help them get work and stay in work.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/07/liz-kendall-benefits-welfare-angela-rayner-grenfell-tower-uk-politics-live-news-updates	2025-02-07T01:30:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea5ab1324564526581acc8830e74948b8a15cbba/469_297_4649_2791/master/4649.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1bd8ada294a19cc9ca6d1d3d6a760b98
US politics live: Trump administration sued by largest government workers’ union over dismantling of USAid	American Federation of Government Employees and American Foreign Service Association seeks order to block ‘unconstitutional actions’ Good morning, Donald Trump has signed an executive order authorising unprecedented and aggressive sanctions against the international criminal court (ICC), accusing the body of -illegitimate and baseless actions- targeting the US and Israel. Leaders of the southern California city of San Clemente, which lies between Los Angeles and San Diego, are partnering with US Customs and Border Protection to place surveillance cameras along the city’s beach to detect boats carrying passengers attempting to enter the country without authorization. -People have observed pangas crammed with illegal aliens, hitting our beach, and then scattering in the community or jumping into a van, which is parked nearby and ready to receive them,- Knoblock told the LA Times. The largest US government workers’ union and an association of foreign service workers sued the Trump administration on Thursday in an effort to reverse its aggressive dismantling of the US Agency for International Development. The lawsuit, filed in Washington, DC federal court by the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Foreign Service Association, seeks an order blocking what it says are -unconstitutional and illegal actions- that have created a -global humanitarian crisis- Donald Trump demanded the -termination- of 60 Minutes, a staple of US broadcast news. The move is a continuation of the president’s vendetta against the media that also included baseless claims that money from the country’s beleaguered foreign aid body had been illicitly funding news organisations. Trump said: -CBS should lose its license, and the cheaters at 60 Minutes should all be thrown out, and this disreputable ‘NEWS’ show should be immediately terminated.- Donald Trump’s shutdown of USAid has already had disastrous effects on humanitarian aid and development programmes around the world, but it has also ceded ground to the US’s chief rival, China, analysts have said. -[The US is handing] on a silver platter to China the perfect opportunity to expand its influence, at a time when China’s economy is not doing very well,- said professor Huang Yanzhong, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. The NCAA changed its participation policy for transgender athletes on Thursday, limiting competition in women’s sports to athletes assigned female at birth. The move came one day after Donald Trump signed an executive order intended to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports. Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly gave Donald Trump a -golden pager- during their meeting in Washington DC this week, in an apparent reference to Israel’s deadly attack against Hezbollah in Lebanon last year.In photos circulating online, the golden pager can be seen mounted on a piece of wood, accompanied by a golden plaque that reads in black lettering: -To President Donald J. Trump, Our greatest friend and greatest ally.

Middle East live: Netanyahu applauds Trump’s ‘bold’ ICC sanctions	Israeli PM thanks Trump for executive order; Amnesty chief says sanctions seek to ‘destroy what the international community has painstakingly constructed’ Hello, and welcome to our live coverage of developments in the Middle East. It’s nearly XY am in Gaza and Jerusalem and if you are just tuning in, there is plenty to catch up on. Rights activists have strongly criticised Donald Trump’s sanctioning of the international criminal court (ICC). The US president’s announcement, in which he claimed the court had targeted the US and its close ally, Israel, came two days after he declared the US would take over Gaza and envisioned the area as the -Riviera of the Middle East-. Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the ICC, which accuses the ICC of having -engaged in illegitimate and baseless actions- targeting the US and its -close ally- Israel. It said the court -abused its power- by issuing -baseless- arrest warrants targeting Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and its former defence minister, Yoav Gallant. Trump has doubled down on his proposal to -take ownership- of Gaza despite widespread opposition. In a Truth Social post, Trump said the Palestinian territory would be -turned over- to the US by Israel after it concludes its military offensive against Hamas. Netanyahu, who is in Washington, said it is -worth listening carefully- to Trump’s proposal. Globally, the proposal to relocate 2.3 million Palestinians to other countries has provoked outrage. Trump’s proposal would -squash- the ceasefire and -incite a return of fighting-, Egypt’s foreign ministry said. Russia called Trump’s proposal -counterproductive- and accused him of fuelling -tension in the region-. China’s foreign ministry said Beijing opposed the forced transfer of people in Gaza. Pakistan described Trump’s plan as -deeply troubling and unjust-, while Iran said it -categorically rejected and condemned- Trump’s proposal. US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Palestinians in Gaza are -going to have to live somewhere else in the interim-, describing Gaza as -not habitable- in comments that appeared to walk back on Trump’s proposal about transferring Palestinians permanently to neighbouring countries. Rubio will travel to Europe and the Middle East next week, a senior State Department official said Thursday. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, ordered the military to prepare plans to allow Palestinians -who wish to leave- Gaza to exit. Asked who should take the residents of Gaza, Katz said it should be countries who have opposed Israel’s military operations since the 7 October attacks, he said. He also claimed that Spain, Ireland, and Norway, who all last year recognised a Palestinian state, are -legally obligated to allow any Gaza resident to enter their territories-. In violation of a ceasefire deal, Israel said late on Thursday it had struck two sites in Lebanon that allegedly contained weapons of the Hezbollah group. Israeli forces -conducted a precise strike in Lebanese territory on two military sites that contained Hezbollah weapons, which were in violation of the ceasefire agreement,- the army said in a post on X. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) warned the agency faces an -existential threat- after Israel formally banned it from operating on its territory. Philippe Lazzarini also described Trump’s Gaza proposal as -totally unrealistic-, adding: -We are talking about forced displacement. Forced displacement is a crime, an international crime. It’s ethnic cleansing.- Human Rights Watch warned that Trump’s proposal could move the US -from being complicit in war crimes to direct perpetration of atrocities-. Forced or coerced displacement is a crime against humanity, illegal under the Geneva conventions, to which Israel and the US are signatories. -Governments should together make clear their strong opposition to Trump’s call for forced displacement in Gaza and take action to prevent further atrocities against the Palestinian people,- said HRW Middle East and North Africa director Lama Fakih. At least 47,583 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli attacks since October 2023, according to the Palestinian health ministry on Thursday. The ministry’s latest daily update also said that a total of 111,633 have now been injured. Israel informed the United Nations human rights council (UNHRC) that it is formally withdrawing from the body. Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said the decision was reached -in light of the ongoing and unrelenting institutional bias against Israel in the human rights council.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/07/middle-east-live-donald-trump-gaza-benjamin-netanyahu-icc-latest-news-updates	2025-02-06T22:33:43-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ef2ce4c2dfd01567cbd6b7325a4ffbfadd39632/0_191_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ebe76f0385018b48de6c2d179c98a0fd

US cedes ground to China with ‘self-inflicted wound’ of USAid shutdown, analysts say	Sudden suspension of aid funding a ‘perfect opportunity’ for Beijing to fill the gap and grow its own soft power Donald Trump’s shutdown of USAid has already had disastrous effects on humanitarian aid and development programmes around the world, but it has also ceded ground to the US’s chief rival, China, analysts have said. The result of the sudden 90-day suspension of USAid funding – which accounts for 40% of global foreign aid – has been chaos: employees locked out of offices, humanitarian shipments left to rot, and lifesaving assistance stopped. Around the world, development programmes previously assisted by the USAid are panicking, warning of disastrous risks of escalating famine, death and disease.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/07/donald-trump-usaid-shutdown-impact-china-relationship-funding	2025-02-06T20:30:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6fe6db214c9f90b535828ac31e05d615514331e/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c9e8013b82c0195c85288251ee642427

Follow the latest news live Dutton coy on what public servant jobs he will slash if he wins election Peter Dutton, of course, says he wants to cut the size of the federal government and has promised to slash civil service jobs in what appears to be an attempt to live up to the Howard dictum. It’s a huge mistake for a centre-Right party to assume that a disgruntled conservative has -nowhere else to go-. That arrogant attitude cost the Liberal party in Australia dear in the 2022 election. In the UK they now have Reform to go to. These are the invariable default definitions trotted out. Yet the reality often falls short, and that creates a credibility deficit. The voting public will no longer accept the excuse that taxes would be higher under leftwing governments as a substitute for actual tax relief under conservative ones. Central to the success of future centre-right governments will be their capacity to actually deliver on tax and smaller government – and not just talk.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/feb/07/northern-territory-remote-services-funding-labor-coalition-election-donald-trump-gaza-plan-reaction-ntwnfb	2025-02-06T12:14:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b2f67c91f8b5b8a6af4b0c1f887f5c1002cceef/0_68_6509_3908/master/6509.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3f93846e879d56f4d927655fdd8ed944

Trump might want to revive America’s imperial heyday – but does his base?	The president’s Gaza proposal is a signal that old-school, blunt-force US expansionism seems to be back in fashion Donald Trump’s proposal that the US take ownership of the Gaza Strip, expel and resettle the people there, and turn Gaza into a -Riviera of the Middle East- has outraged Palestinians, shocked the international community and even confused many of his own conservative voters. Yet the announcement seems like yet another sign that the president, while sometimes distancing himself from the neoconservative foreign policies that entangled the US in Iraq and Afghanistan, is willing to pursue – or at least entertain pursuing – an undisguised US imperialism that has more in common with the expansionism of Teddy Roosevelt and Andrew Jackson, the 19th and early-20th century presidents associated with some of American’s most brazen and violent conquests.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/06/trump-gaza-netanyahu-imperialism-roosevelt-jackson	2025-02-06T04:00:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed4af8d716991a64907dcb1e479a01a9a3b39f3d/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2541b675309b8e197e9c4a67a16206a6

Thursday briefing: The outlandish plan to turn Gaza into a ‘riviera of the Middle East’	In today’s newsletter: Donald Trump’s proposal is an attempt to reshape political reality that has historical precedent, explains architect and researcher Eyal Weizman Good morning. Donald Trump’s suggestion that Palestinians should be forced out of Gaza so that it could be rebuilt as a US-run -Riviera of the Middle East- is so outlandish that many have returned to the reminder that we should beware of taking what he says too literally. And, it’s true, the comments don’t seem as if they came on the back of a detailed feasibility study; White House officials spent much of yesterday trying to walk his comments back. But it’s also true that his proposal, which if enacted would amount to an unambiguous case of ethnic cleansing, tells us something about who Trump understands to be the stakeholders in Gaza’s future: not Palestinian civilians, but the United States, Israel, and the contractors who could make it happen. And the idea has so delighted the Israeli right that it is easy to see how, even if no American soldier ever sets foot in Gaza, it creates the space for serious discussion of the same project by other means.

Middle East crisis live: White House walks back Trump’s Gaza ‘takeover’ comments in face of widespread international anger	Secretary of state Marco Rubio says Trump comments should not be seen as ‘hostile move’; Netanyahu says ‘remarkable idea’ should be pursued Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that there was nothing wrong in Donald Trump’s idea of displacing Palestinians from Gaza after the US president’s proposal drew international criticism.

Peace through strength is a concept Israel shares with the United States, Netanyahu said. -The only way to get peace, and enduring peace, is by being very, very strong,- he said, according to a readout of the meeting. -And with our alliance and your support, including the decision … of supplying Israel the much-needed tools for our defense, we are a lot stronger than we’ve ever been.- The UN said forcible deportation of people from occupied territory is -strictly prohibited- under international law, while Human Rights Watch said the policy would be a -moral abomination-. Amnesty International condemned Donald Trump’s comments as -inflammatory, outrageous and shameful-. International law experts said it could amount to a war crime or crime against humanity. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Gaza was -an integral part of the State of Palestine- and that -we will not allow the rights of our people … to be infringed on-. The estimated death toll in Gaza since the start of Israeli operations in the territory after the 7 October attacks reached 47,552, according to the Palestinian ministry of health on Wednesday.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/06/middle-east-crisis-live-white-house-walks-back-trumps-gaza-takeover-comments-in-face-of-widespread-international-anger	2025-02-05T22:35:25-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff709adc79faf9b774aab35fd222c4c819b79682/0_71_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=88b64fbaed0db1dfaf351258124d9508

Trump’s plan to own Gaza a throwback to 19th-century imperialism	It does not seem to occur to US administration that to the rest of the world they seem to be advocating a second Nakba Donald Trump’s vision of Gaza as a US-administered Riviera stripped of Palestinians indulges the fantasies of Israel’s extremist right, but also, if taken seriously, builds on an expansionist foreign policy that Trump has articulated since he took on the presidency. The outlook is more akin to mid-19th century US imperial thinking than the era of isolationism his election appeared to herald. Indeed the one moment Benjamin Netanyahu did not look delighted at Tuesday’s joint press conference was when Trump, negotiating in real time, referred to the US as being opposed to Israeli ownership of Gaza.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/trumps-plan-to-own-gaza-chimes-of-19th-century-imperialism	2025-02-05T09:46:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82d0146aa21e3b8a3516520a688a31f39c1bd8a3/306_635_6183_3712/master/6183.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=edfea944c8380254a9d1d1d92ff53862

RFK Jr’s claim about Black people’s immune systems is ‘unscientific and terrifying’	Kennedy’s hearing signifies how close a man with medically racist beliefs is to becoming the US’s leading health official During Robert F Kennedy Jr’s Senate confirmation hearing on 30 January, Angela Alsobrooks, a Democratic senator from Maryland, pressed the nominee on his past claims that Black people have a stronger immune system than white people, and thereby should receive vaccines on a different schedule than them. -What different vaccine schedule would you say I should have received?- Alsobrooks, who is Black, asked the health secretary nominee. Kennedy then referenced a -series of studies- showing that -to particular antigens, Blacks have a much stronger reaction-. The exchange is cause for alarm for many, as it signified how close a man who holds medically racist beliefs was to becoming the country’s leading health official. Dr Richard Kennedy – an author of the study referenced at the hearing, who is not related to Kennedy – told NPR that while it’s true the immune response to vaccination can vary by race, sex and -potentially dozens of other factors-, the data does not support a change in vaccine schedule based on race.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/rfk-jr-hearing-black-people-immune-systems	2025-02-05T07:00:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/294ec248c43050e9123072395aae5c8e5dcd54a4/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b81978fc9efefe58777fc783bccc5148

Government rejects claim Chagos deal to cost £18bn amid growing Labour backlash – UK politics live	Foreign policy set to dominate PMQs amid unease over deal with Mauritius and Trump’s Gaza comments Good morning. PMQs is normally mostly about domestic politics, but today – despite the government doing its best to promote an announcement about a £2.65bn investment in flood defences – foreign policy may well dominate. That is partly because of President Trump, and his desire to leave office with the US territorially bigger than it was when it arrived (something that went out of fashion in most parts of the respectable world around the end of the 19th century). Last night Keir Starmer had dinner with the prime minister of Denmark, the country that has sovereignty over Greenland, and late last night No 10 put out a statement that slightly firmed up Starmer’s support for Denmark in its determination to see off Trump’s plan to buy/annex the vast, frozen island. More on that soon. This reporting is incorrect. The figures being quoted are entirely inaccurate and misleading. A person familiar with the views of one cabinet minister said they did not understand why the UK was agreeing to pay large sums of money to Mauritius at a time when the Treasury was telling UK government departments to prepare for spending cuts. A second person familiar with a different cabinet member’s views said Starmer should cancel the deal. Both suggested Starmer was acting on legal advice from Attorney General Richard Hermer. Making calls on this story to contacts in government last night, it became clear to me that some of the most senior people in government are opposed to this deal … Just looking through the words in my notebook, -terrible-, -mad-, -impossible to understand- – those are the words I can use, at least at this time of day on air. But there are other words in my notebook. And these are from very senior government sources. One MP who fears Nigel Farage’s outfit could be closing in on their marginal seat told Playbook the treaty would be -Reform rocket fuel.- -How am I supposed to tell my constituents that we took away their winter fuel allowance to pay a foreign country to take our sovereign territory?- they messaged to say.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/05/pmqs-chagos-islands-trump-gaza-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-uk-politics-live	2025-02-05T01:39:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06f1d3c3d7f167878498ab50e00929a92170270b/0_241_4940_2964/master/4940.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ca0642c9f5b1f81e3bfeefdcebe4bb5f

How the world’s richest man laid waste to the US government	Elon Musk has achieved astonishing power in Trump’s administration – and spent the weekend wielding it Since declaring his support for Donald Trump in July of last year and subsequently spending more than $250m on his re-election effort, Elon Musk has rapidly accumulated political influence and positioned himself at the heart of the new administration. Now as prominent as the president himself, he has begun to make use of that power, taking actions that could affect the health of millions of people, gaining access to highly sensitive personal data and attacking anyone who opposes him. Musk, the world’s richest man and an unelected official, has achieved an astonishing level of power over the federal government. Over the weekend, workers with Musk’s -department of government efficiency- (Doge) clashed with civil servants over demands for unfettered access to the computer systems of major US government agencies in a breakneck series of confrontations. When the dust settled, several top officials who opposed the takeover had been pushed out, and Musk’s allies had gained control.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-elon-musk-federal-government	2025-02-04T11:52:24-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/153a0c447760596072c83ad7ac0d282977bda122/0_136_4109_2467/master/4109.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=042e0ef1f9f5255f0aca6a429bbc820d

In this Trump era of shakedown diplomacy, everything has a price	Friends and allies of the US president will say his recent tariff threats delivered quick wins, but he may find there are no winners in a trade war As the world reels from the first three weeks of Donald Trump’s shakedown diplomacy, it is divided between those who marvel at this display of raw American economic hegemony, and those who fear that the US’s president, fatally misreading how the globe has changed since his first term, is storing up trouble that will diminish the US as an economic and moral force in four years’ time. At one level Trump’s antics are wearily familiar. After all, the last rites of the 70-year-old liberal world order were also read when Trump came to power in 2017, before that order was briefly disinterred under Joe Biden. The diplomatic pearls were collectively clutched when Trump 1.0 threatened to pull out of Nato, launched a trade war with China, introduced a travel ban on mainly Muslim countries, and withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation trade agreement championed by Barack Obama. In 2019 Trump dropped the threat of a 5% tariff in return for Mexico sending 6,000 militarised police to the southern border. Grievances, and bargains, have always animated Trump’s thinking.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/in-this-trump-era-of-shakedown-diplomacy-everything-has-a-price	2025-02-04T08:22:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a726668bb3d94b624fc479e88c91803807ce29b/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42f35e6ec17d14d7c76dce942479aa18

Trump personally ordered firings of special counsel prosecutors	Exclusive: move to purge those who worked for Jack Smith came from Trump, sources say, in show of unchecked power The US justice department fired more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on the criminal cases against Donald Trump hours after the president directly ordered it from the Oval Office, according to two people familiar with the intervention. The move to purge people who worked for former special counsel Jack Smith had ostensibly come from the acting attorney general, James McHenry, who sent the formal termination notices that said they could not be trusted to implement Trump’s agenda.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-jack-smith-special-counsel-prosecutors-firings	2025-02-04T03:00:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0776e26d7469aabda4b7d90baaf584b286f1823/0_440_8256_4952/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3867b07a4b95e75f432f2d8bcd339397
Scientists brace ‘for the worst’ as Trump purges climate mentions from websites	Trump administration pulling references online ‘won’t make crisis’ stop impacting Americans’ lives, say experts Donald Trump’s administration has started to remove or downgrade mentions of the climate crisis across the US government, with the websites of several major departments pulling down references to anything related to the climate crisis. Climate scientists said they were braced -for the worst-. A major climate portal on the Department of Defense’s website has been scrapped, as has the main climate change section on the site of the Department of State. A climate change page on the White House’s website no longer exists, nor does climate content provided by the US agriculture department, including information that provides vulnerability assessments for wildfires.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-climate-change-federal-websites	2025-02-04T03:00:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f06133fa24a4e1366e5cabeeb4a898f0da1b3e94/0_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1957e265c42a6b72ab896d36c3a5bd16
Netanyahu hoping to ‘redraw map’ of Middle East in Washington DC ceasefire talks with Trump – Israel-Gaza war live	Israeli PM in Washington for talks with US president as Hamas says it is ready to discuss details of second phase of ceasefire and hostage releases Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the latest news from the Middle East. Today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in Washington for talks with US President Donald Trump about the ceasefire in Gaza. Trump said on Monday he did not known whether the ceasefire deal in Gaza was going to last. -I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,- he told reporters. Hamas is ready to begin talks on the details of a second phase of the ceasefire, two officials from the group told the AFP on Monday. -We are waiting for the mediators to initiate the next round of negotiation,- said one. Israel continued its operations in the West Bank city of Jenin for a 14th consecutive day, with dozens of homes demolished and at least 25 people killed, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa The Palestinian ministry of health said the Israeli military had killed at least 70 people, including 10 children in the West Bank, since the beginning of 2025. More than 545,000 Palestinians are estimated to have crossed from southern Gaza to northern Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect, according to figures by the UN. The Trump administration has asked congressional leaders to approve transfers of roughly $1bn worth of bombs and other military hardware to Israel, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing US officials. The sales would include 4,700 1,000-pound bombs as well as armoured bulldozers built by Caterpillar. The head of Amnesty International, Agnes Callamard, said the ceasefire should not erase the events of the last 15 months and that Israel should held accountable for -genocide-. -If you have any sense of the future, you need a reckoning for the past,- she told Al Jazeera. The office of Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said the ongoing Israeli military operation in the occupied West Bank amounts to -ethnic cleansing- and urged the US to intervene. A spokesperson said the presidency -condemned the occupation authorities’ expansion of their comprehensive war on our Palestinian people in the West Bank to implement their plans aimed at displacing citizens and ethnic cleansing-. A car bomb killed at least 15 people in the northern Syrian city of Manbij. The attack was the second in three days and the deadliest since Bashar al-Assad was deposed in December. The office of the president vowed that those responsible would be help accountable.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/04/benjamin-netanyahu-donald-trump-israel-gaza-middle-east-ceasefire-latest-live-news	2025-02-04T02:54:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a18271bda488f2f0ee5861668d403ec200bb0fb1/0_72_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f7868134d28da8a88c0c4bbd518ef1ab
Labour dropped plan to ban foreign donors after Waheed Alli intervened, book claims	Peer who gave gifts to Keir Starmer is said to have blocked ban on potential Elon Musk donations to Reform UK Labour reportedly dropped a plan to ban foreign political donations after an intervention from Waheed Alli, the Labour peer who paid for Keir Starmer’s clothes and glasses. The plan would have scuppered any potential donations from the billionaire Elon Musk to Reform UK. It would have made it illegal to donate unless donors were registered to vote in the UK or via companies owned by people based in Britain.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/04/labour-dropped-plan-ban-foreign-donors-waheed-alli-intervened-book-claims	2025-02-04T01:38:57-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fc45f3f92d3b76d5c4175eb442bac7617a01827/541_319_2493_1496/master/2493.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=269f7f1eaa07ec1846e94c5009b78a0d
Reform UK overtakes Labour for first time in national opinion poll – UK politics live	Trend shows support for Nigel Farage’s Reform UK has grown significantly since general election Good morning. A good rule of thumb in political reporting is that any news story about voter intention polling is wrong. That is because news stories, by definition, are what’s what new and what’s different, and polls that show anything unusual (or at least anything significantly unusual) are probably outliers. In polling, what matters is the trend (because polls are a reliable guide to voting trends) but not so much the actual numbers (where polling is much more hit and miss). So it it is with some reservation that we start with YouGov polling, for the Times and Sky News, showing Reform UK in first place, and ahead of Labour for the first time in a national opinion poll. It has Reform UK on 25%, Labour on 24% and the Conservatives on 21%.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/04/latest-live-uk-politics-news-labour-reform-tory-conservatives-keir-starmer	2025-02-04T01:30:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ce7dbc5a63bc37033987f48a5f49ba3247aea66/0_164_4929_2957/master/4929.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1da340d05b6e227e3e21a5c1ff06947a

Trump to pause Canada tariffs for at least 30 days as China levies set to take effect Tuesday – live	Canadian PM Justin Trudeau says he had ‘good call’ with US president, as Mexico tariffs paused too Donald Trump’s administration has confirmed plans to merge the US international aid agency USAid into the state department in a major revamp that would shrink its workforce and align its spending with Trump’s priorities. The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, declared himself the acting administrator of the agency and employees have been locked out of its Washington DC headquarters, while others have been suspended. Trump announced he’s planning to appoint Michael Ellis and the deputy director of the CIA. Ellis is a close Trump ally and worked in the president’s previous administration and helped fight allegations of collusion with Russia in the 2016 election. The Trump administration is opening new investigations into allegations of antisemitism at five US universities including Columbia and the University of California, Berkeley, the Education Department announced Monday. The US Senate on Monday confirmed Chris Wright, a fracking executive, to be Donald Trump’s energy secretary. The vote was 59-38. Wright, 60, the CEO of Liberty Energy since 2011 has said he will step down from the company once confirmed. He wrote in a Liberty report last year that he believes human-caused climate change is real, but that its hazards are -distant and uncertain-. He has also said that top-down governmental policies to curb it are destined to fail. The US interior department has unveiled a suite of orders aimed at carrying out Donald Trump’s agenda to maximise domestic energy and minerals production and slash red tape, Reuters reports. In a statement, the agency said interior secretary Doug Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota, signed six orders on his first day in office. US President Donald Trump has invited Indian prime minister Narendra Modi to visit the White House next week, a White House official said, hours after a US military plane departed to return deported migrants to the country. Senator Susan Collins, a republican from Maine, said she’ll vote to confirm Tulsi Gabbard as the director of national intelligence. Collins is a key swing vote and her support brings Gabbard’s nomination close to being sealed. Trump is reportedly mulling an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education, in alignment with mandates from Elon Musk’s -department of government efficiency- to slash federal agencies. Musk’s Doge reportedly accessed administration systems for the federal Small Business Administration. It has also reportedly accessed secure information at USAid and the Treasury department. According to Wired, Musk has reportedly deployed six young men to lead Doge’s efforts to access federal government data. The Trump administration made plain its intent to merge USAid with the state department under Musk’s supervision. Employees were barred from the agency headquarters today, after the website was shuttered over the weekend. Several democrats cried foul, calling the act illegal and denouncing Musk. The Trump administration may today begin using an obscure 18th-century law to deport undocumented migrants without first going through the courts. Darren Beattie, a former White House official who wrote, -Competent white men must be in charge if you want things to work,- is reportedly set for a top role at the state department.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/feb/04/donald-trump-tariffs-live-blog-news-updates-canada-trudeau-mexico-china	2025-02-03T18:50:35-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c6c32f7de6d46668cfb725059f5a2f0e8ff0662/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=57c8c39923efef51a60d05e4860c4c9e

Starmer’s EU dinner date a big moment in tricky tightrope act	Domestically and on the world stage, the PM faces a series of challenges as he resets UK’s post-Brexit relationship Whichever way you slice it, Keir Starmer’s invitation to dinner in Brussels is a big moment. For the first time since Brexit, the UK prime minister is sitting down for an informal summit with the 27 EU leaders. Five years on from its departure from the bloc, the UK has a Labour government populated with politicians who are far more sympathetic to Europe than their Conservative predecessors. Starmer was a committed remainer who spent years steering his party towards endorsing a second referendum. Most of the cabinet privately think Brexit was an act of self-harm — and David Lammy, the foreign secretary, has reportedly been arguing that the UK should now rejoin the customs union.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/03/starmers-eu-dinner-date-a-big-moment-in-tricky-tightrope-act	2025-02-03T10:07:45-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c3a1fe20aab7905fd7ef18421044fd29d6c5d22/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fa5221c9359123c0157eb2a15056d3c8

In the first two weeks of his return as president, Trump has, like his first term, issued orders to open up more American land and waters for fossil fuel extraction and started the process to yank the US from the Paris climate agreement. -We will drill, baby drill,- said Trump, who has promised to cut energy and electricity prices in half within 18 months.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/03/trump-war-on-clean-energy-big-oil	2025-02-03T03:00:39-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4692017038050d670d846cb0365ac4ff2bcfa5b3/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=60028ce25095472afb904a7d603f0aa4

Ron DeSantis tried to crusade against undocumented students.

‘Vicious cycle’: far-right parties across Europe are inspiring imitators	Hardline agendas, especially on immigration, are copied by mainstream conservatives in vain effort to win back votes Far-right parties could become the largest force on the right in Europe within a decade, experts have said, as mainstream conservative parties look to copy their hardline agendas, especially on immigration, in a vain effort to win back votes. Germany’s conservatives last week sparked fury when their leader, Friedrich Merz, the country’s likely next chancellor, broke a longstanding pledge by relying on far-right votes to adopt a non-binding motion urging a drastic immigration crackdown. The leader of Alternative für Deutschland, Alice Weidel, hailed -a historic day for Germany- as the Bundestag, for the first time in its history, passed a vote with the backing of her party, which is second in the polls weeks before this month’s elections.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/01/vicious-cycle-far-right-parties-across-europe-are-inspiring-imitators	2025-02-01T05:23:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4915bc32566be05f06e4d18bcc20b5a5fc357434/0_407_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4bacd9be57590359b3fb0dbc2cebcff1

Simon & Schuster imprint will no longer ask authors to obtain blurbs for their books	Publisher says expecting authors, agents and editors to secure blurbs can create ‘an incestuous and unmeritocratic literary ecosystem that often rewards connections over talent’ When you buy a new book, you can usually expect to see praise from other authors emblazoned on its cover.

But soon we may not see so many of these author blurbs – Sean Manning, publisher of Simon &amp; Schuster’s flagship imprint in the US, has written an essay for Publishers Weekly explaining that as of this year he will -no longer require authors to obtain blurbs for their books-.	https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/31/simon-schuster-us-imprint-authors-blurbs-books	2025-01-31T09:27:59-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d43f8ba0fcd502759c6eaae34477607818759d9/0_128_3854_2314/master/3854.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=10de228e4820ceb3fb90fd9869ae7511

Trump baselessly blames ‘diversity’ and Democrats for deadly DC plane crash | First Thing	Sixty-seven people die in deadliest US air tragedy since 2001. Plus, Israeli-Hamas deal leads to release of eight hostages and 110 prisoners Good morning. Donald Trump used the plane crash in Washington DC to attack his political enemies, claiming Democrats were responsible for declining standards in air traffic control and that the disaster -could have been- caused by diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies at the Federal Aviation Administration. What details have emerged about the passengers? As many as 14 figure skaters and coaches were onboard the plane, as well as other Americans and citizens of several other countries. How did Democrats respond to Trump’s rant? Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic House minority leader, said Trump used the collision to -peddle lies, conspiracy theories, and attack people of color and women without any basis whatsoever-. He continued: -Have you no respect for the families whose lives have been turned upside down?- What is the death toll of the war? At least 47,460 people have been killed in the Israeli offensive, according to Gaza health officials, but a study published in the Lancet says the true number is about 41% higher. How many hostages have been released? Fifteen since the ceasefire began on 19 January.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/31/first-thing-trump-baselessly-blames-diversity-and-democrats-for-deadly-dc-plane-crash	2025-01-31T03:55:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f99f1403eddda91ece62fd87cde432fa67e1810/0_336_5043_3026/master/5043.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3bdafec776f0445ac02c020c021c4216

Tory bid to celebrate Brexit anniversary marred by spat between Badenoch and Patel over party’s migration record – UK politics live	Kemi Badenoch issues rebuke to Priti Patel after former home secretary defends rise in migration since Brexit Good morning. It is five years to the day since the UK left the European Union. Despite complaints from some of the pro-Brexit papers, Keir Starmer and the government are not planning anything today to mark the occasion – which is not surprising because polling suggests only 11% of the population believe that it has been a success, and most people know think that, when voters followed the advice of Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Nigel Farage, they made a mistake. Still, in some parts of British politics Brexit has long ceased being a policy option, and become more of a cult, and some supporters of Brexit have been marking the anniversary with statements defending the policy. But, in the Conservative party, that has all gone a bit haywire. Five years ago today, the Conservatives honoured the democratic will of the British people and Got Brexit Done. Since then, our country has reaped the benefits—securing new trade deals with dynamic, fast-growing markets across the world and reclaiming sovereignty from Brussels. This has allowed us to reform or revoke 2,500 EU laws, ensuring Britain’s future is shaped by our own parliament.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/31/brexit-politics-tory-kemi-badenoch-priti-patel-keir-starmer-live-latest-news	2025-01-31T01:29:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f249e0eab725ff7f432527f7c52516c5a820164/33_459_2315_1389/master/2315.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e01c6fb84ff41eec33067680e6ee257f
Delays to post-Brexit border checks may have let diseased chicken enter UK	Exclusive: Officials admitted in 2023 there were ‘no current border checks’, as salmonella and other illnesses surged UK health bosses privately admitted that a lack of border inspections in the wake of Brexit had left British consumers exposed to diseased meat, an investigation has found. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism has previously uncovered a host of failings in the government’s handling of outbreaks of drug-resistant salmonella, particularly that linked to supermarket chicken from Poland. Illnesses connected to the outbreaks – which also affected eggs – peaked at different points between 2020 and 2024, while border checks that were supposed to be in place post-Brexit were being repeatedly delayed.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/31/delays-to-post-brexit-border-checks-diseased-chicken-uk	2025-01-31T01:27:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2532e2d438c6dcf85049779fbbdd10fd55db9d2/0_229_4689_2813/master/4689.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eea0a65fe02408ed0e738babb43d79a5

Washington DC plane crash live: flight data and cockpit voice recorders recovered, officials say	National Transportation Safety Board announces recorders are now at a lab for evaluation; operation to recover bodies continues Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Wednesday’s night’s collision between a regional passenger jet and a military helicopter near Washington DC’s Reagan airport. The flight data and cockpit voice recorders have been recovered from the American Airlines flight, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has announced, and they are now at the NTSB’s labs for evaluation. With the 67 people aboard both the American Airlines flight and the army Black Hawk helicopter all presumed dead, the collision is being called -the deadliest aviation disaster- in the US since 2001. At least 28 bodies have been recovered from the Potomac River, with recovery operations ongoing. A day before Wednesday night’s midair collision near Reagan airport, a different jet there had to abort its landing and make a second approach after a helicopter appeared near its flight path, the Washington Post reported. The US army saw an increase in very serious aviation incidents during the last fiscal year, with 15 flight and two ground incidents that resulted in deaths of service members, destruction of aircraft, or more than $2.5m in damage to the airframe, the Associated Press reported, Donald Trump and members of his administration claimed, without evidence, that diversity efforts at the FAA under the Biden and Obama administration could be to blame for the crash, with Trump specifically claiming that the FAA had been accused of being -too white,- and suggesting efforts to hire Americans with disabilities were irresponsible. Trump signed an executive order that rolls back diversity initiatives to stop -woke policies- in federal aviation. The Trump administration’s choice to draw an unfounded connection between a deadly tragedy and diversity initiatives at a press conference sparked broad condemnation from Democratic politicians. They called the comments -disgusting,- -despicable,- and -racist,- with Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries saying that Trump was -blaming women and people of color for the deadly plane crash.- As many as 14 skaters and coaches, including two 16-year-olds and a married pair of world champions, were onboard the American Airlines plane. The Skating Club of Boston said Jinna Han and Spencer Lane, both aged 16, and the Russian-born ice skating coaches and former world champions Yevgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, who were husband and wife, were on the flight.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/31/washington-dc-plane-crash-live-flight-data-and-cockpit-voice-recorders-recovered-officials-say	2025-01-30T18:28:45-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3748ed9af0e94997caf2a79eb9847e0b925d0e68/0_43_4992_2995/master/4992.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2413bcf7502e0ebdedd284b648309532

Kidnapped Spanish man rescued using photo of steering wheel	Man sent coordinates and photo of steering wheel to his girlfriend allowing officers to locate car and rescue him Spanish police have rescued a man who was kidnapped and bundled into the boot of a car after he managed to alert his girlfriend by sending her a photo of the vehicle’s steering wheel and a set of coordinates. On 23 January Policía Nacional officers in the Andalucían province of Málaga received a report that a man had been kidnapped two days earlier on the promenade of the town of Sabinillas.

Trump moves to gut government by offering to buy out 3m federal workers | First Thing	Memo says aim is to retain only those employees who are ‘reliable, loyal, trustworthy’. Plus, 85% of Greenlanders reject US advances Good morning. The Trump administration has offered buyouts to almost all of the roughly 3 million people who work for the US government if they leave their jobs by 6 February in exchange for seven months’ salary, as the White House attempts to gut the civil service. What are the details? The email had the same subject line – -Fork in the road- – as one sent by Elon Musk to employees at Twitter in 2022 when he bought the social media platform. It asked interested workers to reply with the word -Resign-. How did the employees’ union react? The American Federation of Government Employees denounced the offer. It said it was an effort to pressure workers who are not considered loyal to the new administration to leave their jobs – which could cause upheaval in federal programs. What do we know about the death toll so far? Local officials counting casualties into hospital tents said at least 38 were feared dead while other officials and doctors have given death tolls ranging from 15 to 50.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/first-thing-trump-moves-to-gut-government-by-offering-to-buy-out-3m-federal-workers	2025-01-29T04:21:59-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d257fbebf1ad95256ab043fdfe15c3aeea51df0/0_2_4001_2400/master/4001.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=425e446bdc554dc41dc5d5344619ea40

And no wonder, because she is hoping that it will do almost as much work, politically at least, as a budget. Although she has not had to unravel the mega, £25bn tax raising package she announced in October, it suppressed business confidence more than she expected and there now seems to be a Westminster consensus that she included a bit too much gloom powder in the cake mix.

Wednesday briefing: The problems, perils and precedent of ‘cleaning out’ Gaza	In today’s newsletter: After Donald Trump’s remarks, renewed alarm about what will follow the first phase of the ceasefire Good morning. Donald Trump presented his proposal as one rooted in a concern for the safety of Palestinians: it was time to find many of the residents of Gaza somewhere else to live. -I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing at a different location where they can maybe live in peace for a change,- he said. -You’re talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing and say: ‘You know, it’s over.’- That was more than stream of consciousness: Trump doubled down on his comments on Monday. But the idea of -cleaning out- Gaza is not welcomed by the Palestinians who live there – or the countries that Trump has in mind as their new home. And if they were to be forced to leave after Gaza was devastated by the Israeli military, it would appear to be a clear case of ethnic cleansing.

Louvre’s decision to move Mona Lisa is a misguided act of snobbery	Crowds give life to the Paris museum and the painting is a silent, compelling mystery at the heart of the hubbub What a wonderful headache for a museum to have. The Louvre in Paris gets so many visitors it is taking drastic measures to cope, which include moving its most famous treasure to a dedicated space where fans can visit without entering the main museum at all. It will no longer suck the oxygen from other art. Nearly 9 million visitors a year stream through the Louvre and it’s believed 80% of them are looking for Leonardo da Vinci’s portrait of Lisa Gherardini del Giocondo, better known as La Gioconde, better still as the Mona Lisa. I’m worried the Louvre is trying to solve a problem that is not really a problem. Ask Britain’s museums if high visitor numbers are a bad thing: they still haven’t recovered their pre-pandemic crowds. The decision, dramatically announced by Emmanuel Macron, to move the Mona Lisa to a special hygienically isolated gallery where les idiots who flock to take selfies in front of it won’t bother more cultured visitors who wish to study art in a hushed atmosphere, is a misguided act of snobbery. It may ruin the Louvre’s ecosystem as a place where high art becomes popular culture.	https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jan/28/louvres-decision-to-move-mona-lisa-is-a-misguided-act-of-snobbery	2025-01-28T11:57:34-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce1fdb682db5613f2299e7e4efa91b547ee881f7/0_118_5447_3268/master/5447.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a807182f6370aeb60ad606bd4207cc88

At the center of the case in question is Andrew Taake, 36, of Houston, Texas, who assailed police with bear spray and a metal whip when a mob of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol in early 2021 in a desperate attempt to keep him in office at the end of his first presidency, according to prosecutors.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/28/jan-6-rioter-pardon-andrew-taake	2025-01-28T02:00:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7548df2fd1b1cca2da3cb1f8d91917345ae1e40/0_233_7000_4202/master/7000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4c93799be03f74e38a338b6854ceb530

Middle East crisis live: Netanyahu planning to meet Trump next week as US president repeats aim to move Palestinians from Gaza	Israeli prime minister could visit White House as soon as next week, making him the first foreign leader to meet Trump since his inauguration Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the latest events in the Middle East. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is planning to meet US President Donald Trump in Washington as early as next week, according to reports, as hundreds of thousands of Palestinian people made their way back into northern Gaza on Monday. US secretary of state Marco Rubio held a call with Jordan’s King Abdullah on Monday, two days after a suggestion by Donald Trump that Jordan and Egypt should take more Palestinians from Gaza. -The Secretary and King Abdullah discussed implementation of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, the release of hostages, and creating a pathway for security and stability in the region,- the state department said in a statement. Trump’s weekend remarks were not mentioned. Lebanese officials say firing by Israeli troops has killed two people and injured 17 in the second day of deadly protests in southern Lebanon. Residents displaced by the 14-month war between Israel and Hezbollah on Monday again attempted to return to villages where Israeli troops remain. On Sunday, 24 people were killed and more than 130 injured when Israeli troops fired at protesters. Israel said on Monday that it had arrested two Israelis suspected of spying for Iran, including one accused of handing the country classified information obtained during his military service. Tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem were set to lose education, healthcare and other services provided by UN agency Unrwa as an Israeli ban on the organisation takes effect on Thursday. Eight of the 26 hostages yet to be released under the first phase of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas are dead, Israel has confirmed. A Hamas delegation has arrived in Cairo to discuss the implementation of the Gaza ceasefire deal, the group said in a statement. The EU’s foreign ministers have agreed to a -roadmap- to ease current sanctions on Syria, a move welcomed by the country’s government.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/28/israel-gaza-netanyahu-trump-hamas-palestinians-middle-east-latest-live-news	2025-01-27T23:33:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64dff35b74022795939d2f256cd5875dbb0fbc4e/0_62_3360_2016/master/3360.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9c64645370c6e3fa95d70b4b52f99896
Tuesday briefing: How an unknown Chinese startup wiped $593bn from the value of an AI giant	In today’s newsletter: the US had a huge head start on artificial intelligence – but now a low-cost rival from Hangzhou has turned the industry on its head Good morning. Since the emergence of ChatGPT, OpenAI’s groundbreaking artificial intelligence tool, American companies have appeared to have a huge head start in the development of the most significant technology of its generation. But now a small Chinese rival has emerged that appears to match what OpenAI and the other US giants can do at a much lower cost, and without the same hunger for computing power that has made the chip manufacturer Nvidia the most valuable company in the world. The result was a stunning collapse in the value of Big Tech stocks yesterday – and a $593bn fall in the value of Nvidia, the biggest in the US stock market’s history. Gaza ceasefire | Tens of thousands of Palestinians flooded back into northern Gaza on Monday after Israel opened military checkpoints that had divided the strip for more than a year, ending a forced exile from homes and loved ones that many feared could become permanent. UK security | Hindu nationalism, misogyny and the -manosphere- have been identified as breeding grounds for extremism in a leaked government report commissioned after last summer’s riots. The -rapid analytical sprint- also dismissed claims of -two-tier policing- as a -rightwing extremist narrative-. Auschwitz | Elderly former inmates of Auschwitz gathered for perhaps the final time on the 80th anniversary of the concentration camp’s liberation. In remarks at the event, four survivors warned world leaders against the danger of rising antisemitism. Roman Abramovich | An offshore scheme appears to have helped companies owned by the billionaire Roman Abramovich avoid duties potentially amounting to tens of millions of dollars. Abramovich’s lawyers denied he had knowledge of or was personally responsible for any alleged tax evasion. Local government | Bristol city council could become the first local authority in England to collect black rubbish bins only once every four weeks.
