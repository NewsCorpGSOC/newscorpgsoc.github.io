First Thing: Harris and Trump make final preparations as Philadelphia debate looms	Polls neck and neck as the presidential candidates prepare to clash in Tuesday’s ABC debate. Plus, inside the global organ trade Good morning. At 9pm EST tonight, on a debate stage in Philadelphia, weeks of rigorous preparation and breathless analysis will be road-tested with reality, as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump go head-to-head in their first presidential debate. What do the polls say? One recent national New York Times/Siena College poll found that Trump was up one percentage point over Harris – a difference within the survey’s three-percentage point margin of error. What are the debate’s rules? Tuesday’s event, hosted by ABC, will take place under the same rules that governed the Trump-Biden debate, with candidates’ microphones being muted when it is their opponent’s turn to speak.

The Israel Defense Forces said it -struck significant Hamas terrorists, who were operating within a command and control centre embedded inside the humanitarian area in Khan Younis-. What is the humanitarian cost of the war? Since the 7 October attack, when Hamas killed about 1,200 people and took 250 hostage, the Israeli assault on Gaza has killed more than 40,000 people, decimated infrastructure and housing, displaced at least 90% of the population, and brought widespread malnutrition and famine to the coastal strip.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/10/first-thing-harris-and-trump-make-final-preparations-as-philadelphia-debate-looms	2024-09-10T03:19:00-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d266ba26dfc7aa4066c66dbfaf3181eb381840be/26_49_3181_1910/master/3181.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=99277f58b956fcb76b1118ecb683e53a

Anti-Maduro campaign ‘stronger than ever’ after Venezuelan election, says Machado	Opposition leader María Corina Machado said exile of key figure Edmundo González ‘changes absolutely nothing’ The Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has insisted the campaign to end Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian rule is -stronger than ever-, but the banishing of one of its key figures to Spain has thrown many supporters off balance. Edmundo González, who the US and other countries have recognised as the winner of Venezuela’s 28 July presidential election, flew into exile on Sunday after several weeks holed up in the Dutch ambassador’s residence in Caracas. An arrest warrant, seemingly designed to force the retired diplomat to flee, had been issued a week earlier.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/anti-maduro-campaign-venezuela-machado-gonzales	2024-09-09T12:05:59-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70e1a5aa20424514ffe943b55e6b84d6ee79ef41/0_0_5173_3105/master/5173.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c604ed0bd9ddb2e98da46d9cab5dd12

Russia’s shadow oil fleet and Gaza ceasefire plan to top US-UK talks in London	Antony Blinken to meet David Lammy in precursor to Joe Biden’s talks with Keir Starmer in Washington Moscow’s use of a shadow fleet transporting western-sanctioned oil, Ukraine’s call to fire to fire UK-supplied missiles into Russia, and the value of publishing a new version of the US ceasefire plan for Gaza will top US-UK talks in London being attended by Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state. His meeting this week with the British foreign secretary, David Lammy, will make him the most senior US official to visit the UK since Labour’s general election victory in July.

Former head of Lebanese central bank in court on embezzlement charges	Protesters who lost savings in financial crisis demonstrated outside court as Riad Salameh pleaded not guilty The former head of Lebanon’s central bank, Riad Salameh, appeared in court on Monday for the first time since he was arrested last week on charges of embezzling up to $42m (£32m) of public funds. Monday’s hearing is the latest in the long saga of Salameh, once vaunted as a financial wizard who earned Lebanon its reputation as the -Switzerland of the Middle East- during his 30-year tenure. He has since fallen into disrepute and is suspected of engineering a country-wide Ponzi scheme that caused Lebanon’s 2019 financial meltdown and its five-year-long economic crisis.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/lebanon-central-bank-riad-salameh-embezzlement-charges	2024-09-09T07:19:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87f3d427bd91edc2619b228673e94d55dd93d03d/0_158_3405_2043/master/3405.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4b1659d1b1ba7ca48a2b0a0f2548093a

Weather tracker: Francine looking likely to be next Atlantic hurricane	An area of low pressure in the Gulf of Mexico is moving landward, and is expected to bring intense rainfall Francine could soon be the next to be ticked off the list of Atlantic hurricane storm names this week. On Friday, a broad area of low pressure emerged in the Gulf of Mexico, designated as Invest 91L. An -invest- – a shorthand for -investigative area- – refers to a region of atmospheric disturbance, characterised by low pressure and thunderstorms, and is closely monitored for its potential to evolve into a tropical cyclone. Invest 91L is anticipated to encounter more favourable environmental conditions as it progresses northward over the coming days, meandering along the eastern coasts of Mexico and Texas. The National Hurricane Center has now labelled this as a potential tropical cyclone, and it is expected to reach hurricane status before reaching the Gulf coast of the US. It advises that hurricane and storm surge watches will probably be issued on Monday for coastal parts of Texas and Louisiana, with the impacts expected to be felt from Tuesday night.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/weather-tracker-francine-likely-atlantic-hurricane	2024-09-09T01:29:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24cc1827e84491c0c221ac628bc03071cdb1fd63/0_52_3168_1900/master/3168.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1a9b1687edb0a93e205a820382e25175

Late last month the Taliban published new restrictions aimed, it said, at combating vice and promoting virtue.
