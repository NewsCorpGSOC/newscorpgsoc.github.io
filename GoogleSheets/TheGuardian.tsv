Russia’s exiled opposition rocked by claims over hammer attack on Navalny ally	Accusations that another Kremlin critic ordered attack on Leonid Volkov throws scattered opposition into further disarray When Leonid Volkov, a longtime partner of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, was brutally attacked with a hammer outside his home in Lithuania in March, it initially seemed yet another case of the Kremlin hunting down its enemies abroad.

Tories challenge other Labour ministers to follow Keir Starmer in paying back donations – UK politics live	The prime minister said he’d paid back £6,000 worth of gifts and hospitality, including Taylor Swift tickets and his wife’s rented clothing Good morning. Yesterday Keir Starmer made the surprise announcement that he has paid back £6,000 worth of gifts and hospitality, including Taylor Swift tickets and rented clothing for his wife, received since he became prime minister. The news overshadowed reports about what happened on his visit to Brussels to meet the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen (also important – here’s our story), but No 10 felt they had to put the news out yesterday because the donations were all being revealed in the latest update to the Commons register of members’ interests published yesterday. However, as is often the case when a politician under pressure over ethics/transparency makes a concession to critics/the media/public opinion, Starmer has now opened himself up to a whole new bout of questions. The Conservative party (which has a lot of experience of donation scandals) is on the case, and last night it issued this statement. Day after day more and more comes out about the scandal at the top of Keir Starmer’s government. This scandal has become a complete distraction from the job of governing. It appears Starmer will only be transparent when his backs against the wall. This announcement today poses more questions than it answers. Why did Starmer take these freebies in the first place? Why haven’t Angela Rayner and other senior party members not paid back donations?	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2024/oct/03/keir-starmer-angela-rayner-donations-labour-conservatives-uk-politics-news-live	2024-10-03T01:15:34-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83a806fdc65c6089a7752958823504796248be97/0_0_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4329cc32e447d1896d8b9c6726436372

Gulf leaders support Palestine – but many would not mind seeing Israel challenge Iran	The escalating Middle East conflict could create a dangerous vacuum – or an opportunity – for several states The coincidental timing of an emergency meeting of Gulf foreign ministers in Doha with a visit to the same city by the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, for talks with Qatar’s emir raises questions about how the Gulf states will react if Israel pushes ahead with its plan to use its recent military success not just to weaken Iran, but reorder the Middle East. This Sunni coalition of six Gulf monarchs is not naturally well disposed to Iran or its Shia proxies, and only in 2016 labelled Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation. But they also oppose further Israeli escalation, and believe it is ultimately only Washington that has the means to restrain the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/03/gulf-leaders-support-palestine-but-many-would-not-mind-seeing-israel-challenge-iran	2024-10-02T21:00:06-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acf40ffd21301285a47601fa5e0a56588424f14e/0_83_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d8cd5a4eb0f10ed8d35fa3bb37fcc1bd

Taxi carrying Ian Hislop hit by mechanical fault, not gunshot, says Met	Police issue statement a day after cab driver told officers he thought a bullet had shattered his vehicle’s window The Metropolitan police believe a mechanical failure, rather than a gunshot, shattered the window of a taxi carrying the Private Eye editor, Ian Hislop.

Former Nintendo factory in Kyoto opens as nostalgia-fuelled gaming museum	Museum features consoles from 1983’s Famicom to 2017’s Switch, as well as honouring Nintendo’s pre-video-game era Traditionally, visitors to Kyoto in October come for momijigari, the turning of the autumn leaves in the city’s picturesque parks. This autumn, however, there is a new draw: a Nintendo museum. The new attraction, which opens on Wednesday, is best described as a chapel of video game nostalgia. Upstairs, Nintendo’s many video game consoles, from 1983’s Famicom through 1996’s Nintendo 64 to 2017’s Switch, are displayed reverently alongside their most famous games. On the back wall, visitors can also peer at toys, playing cards and other artefacts from the Japanese company’s pre-video-game history, stretching back to its founding as a hanafuda playing card manufacturer in 1889. Downstairs, there are interactive exhibits with comically gigantic controllers and floor-projected playing cards.	https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/oct/02/former-nintendo-factory-in-kyoto-opens-as-nostalgia-fuelled-gaming-museum	2024-10-02T04:07:38-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90dfb7e994ac23040f863ff9e261ed7282bd0e40/0_0_5746_3448/master/5746.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b88f21aa00a448f3a338672aa4ad12de

Mayor in Wisconsin removes ballot drop box as tensions rise over voting method	Wausau mayor says he worried box could be tossed in river, as boxes remain fixture of debate over state administration A Wisconsin mayor removed a ballot drop box from outside city hall and relocated it indoors last week – a performance that underscores the tensions and misinformation that surround election administration and the topic of ballot drop boxes in the state. Doug Diny, who donned a workperson’s hat and gloves to move the drop box, claimed he did so because he was worried the box, which had not yet been fully installed and did not have any ballots in it, could have been tossed in the river. The city has since re-installed the dropbox outside the Wausau municipal building.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/02/election-wisconsin-mail-ballot-box	2024-10-02T03:00:36-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffc5a9dabe00fa44a2e5b0c4b53a54e9d86ecf98/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=840211e29160d1a9bf2b35ad4b3014c9

After weeks and months of being assailed by Donald Trump’s dystopian evocation of a country on the verge of self-destruction, amplified by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s dire warnings of democracy in peril, here was something very different.

Tory leadership candidates in key face-off at party conference – UK politics live	Jenrick, Badenoch, Cleverly and Tugendhat to all get 20 minutes to pitch their vision to members Good morning. There are plenty of more important things in politics than who becomes the next Conservative leader – two thirds of voters don’t even care, according to Ipsos polling, including almost a third of people who backed the party at the election – but if you are interested in the outcome, today is the most important day in the contest so far. Over the past century most people elected Conservative leader have also been prime minister at some point, so it is normally a consequential choice. Although the four-day conference has, in effect, been a long husting, this morning we’re getting the key face-off. All four candidates are delivering a 20-minute speech in the conference hall. A platform speech to a big audience is always a challenge, but the candidates face two particular difficulties this morning. The truth is this. If we’re to tackle the immense challenges we face, if we’re to restore the public’s trust, we must build something new. A new Conservative party. That is what I call for today. Nothing less than a new Conservative Party built on the rock of our oldest values and best traditions. If I become our leader, this is what – together – we will build. The Conservatives have to be the party of wealth creation. Wealth is not a dirty word. It supports jobs and families. It pays for our schools, for our health service. We should encourage it. Let’s be enthusiastic; relatable; positive; optimistic. Let’s sell the benefits of a Conservative government with a smile. We will not win back voters by pretending to be something we’re not. We win back voters by being honest, by being professional, by being Conservative.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/02/tory-party-conference-jenrick-badenoch-cleverly-tugendhat-starmer-brussels-uk-politics-news-latest	2024-10-02T00:54:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24b7adfb022855c19c11606304eb71a9d3ee375b/0_97_3543_2128/master/3543.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6efaf132294f123945d6079bced10879

Walz and Vance clash over abortion and immigration in vice-presidential debate	VP candidates serve up less drama than Harris-Trump debate but still have a few gaffes in policy-driven discussion Tim Walz and JD Vance took to the stage on Tuesday night for a vice-presidential debate that served up less drama than September’s presidential debate, but offered revealing differences on abortion, school shootings, and immigration. Three weeks ago Kamala Harris and Donald Trump had endured a contentious hour-and-a-half, with an emotional Trump being goaded into ranting about the number of people who attend his rallies and declaring the vice-president to be a -Marxist-, before reportedly threatening to sue one of the debate moderators.

Who were England’s 2024 rioters? – podcast	Racist chants rang out, and homes, businesses and hotels housing asylum seekers were attacked – for a week this summer English towns and cities seemed on the brink of chaos. Josh Halliday reports on what we know so far about the people at the centre of the violence From Aldershot to Southport, riots broke out in English towns and cities this summer. Mosques, homes, shops and cars were attacked. A library was looted. Drivers were stopped and interrogated about their ethnicity, police officers were attacked. In a matter of days, however, many rioters found themselves in court and the violence stopped abruptly. Josh Halliday was in court to hear what many of the rioters, including children, said about why they had caused such havoc. He explains to Helen Pidd how the Guardian’s data team tracked the court filings of 500 rioters to glean information that helped build a picture of the people who terrified communities.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/audio/2024/oct/02/who-were-england-2024-rioters-podcast	2024-10-01T19:00:26-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b14b9ac022293409448d8b1bedd195da6db628b/0_186_6480_3888/master/6480.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ac3fba2487f16f75947296f5e052a0f

The practice of exploring the riverbank for archaeology is permitted only with a permit from the Port of London authority (PLA), which owns much of the shoreline.

Stopping Iran’s attack would have forced Israel to use sophisticated – and expensive – defences	Despite launching 180 ballistic missiles, Iran is likely to have wanted to keep most of its stock in case of a full-blown war with Israel Iran’s decision to launch about 180 high-speed ballistic missiles at Israel indicates that Tehran sought to inflict serious damage in Tuesday’s night attack, unlike the well-telegraphed drone and missile attack in April. Their sheer speed makes ballistic weapons challenging to intercept, but the initial reports of no fatalities within Israel and one in the West Bank would suggest despite the numbers of missiles launched it was a military failure, though some of the weapons or fragments appear to have struck the ground.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/stopping-iran-attack-would-have-forced-israel-to-use-sophisticated-and-expensive-defences	2024-10-01T13:06:12-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/859573648bd5c30b9f5ad946f08413669d18712e/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=081eb332d1716c4a8e12f3d683944cc6

War risks reigniting tensions between Lebanon’s kaleidoscope of communities	If Hezbollah is substantially diminished, there could be an opportunity to rebalance power in the country once again To drive away from Beirut’s Mediterranean coastline is to climb, up into the rugged, unrelenting ridges of Mount Lebanon. The limestone mountain range that traverses huge lengths of Lebanon lent the country not just its name but beauty, diversity – and a combustible political culture that risks being inflamed again as Israeli forces invade. For centuries before modern Lebanon was established, its mountains were a natural barrier to invading armies. For the region’s religious minorities – especially Christians and Druze – they became a sanctuary. Ensconced in remote mountain villages, the kaleidoscope of communities that would eventually form the Lebanese nation developed distinct identities, histories and anxieties over their own survival. Lebanon, one of it great historians, Kamal Salibi, wrote, was -a house of many mansions-.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/war-risks-reigniting-tensions-lebanon-kaleidoscope-of-communities	2024-10-01T09:56:38-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f664117d8718745b6731dc162b5729749bcaffed/0_288_8640_5184/master/8640.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25a9341311cc52af723bd204a0d27cc8

Doctors issue stark warning as Louisiana reclassifies abortion pills	Officials class mifepristone and misoprostol as ‘controlled substances’ – which medics say could imperil women’s lives Two common abortion pills are, as of Tuesday, classified as -controlled substances- in Louisiana, due to a first-of-its-kind law that medical professionals warn will endanger the lives of women by restricting medication used to treat postpartum hemorrhage and other conditions. Louisiana, which already bans abortion, passed a law reclassifying mifepristone and misoprostol as schedule IV drugs – a designation typically reserved for drugs that carry a risk of abuse or dependence. People caught with the drugs without a valid prescription could face up to five years in prison, although pregnant women who procure it for their own use are exempted from punishment under the law.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/01/louisiana-abortion-pills	2024-10-01T04:00:48-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/947a87eeb829147dc028d23f310e278485ee0dc2/0_223_6004_3602/master/6004.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8badf58c3f48e0c055e2b50373a2ce53

First Thing: Israel launches invasion into southern Lebanon	Israel says ‘heavy fighting’ is under way as it targets Hezbollah. Plus, the Picasso in the cellar Good morning. Israeli forces crossed the border into southern Lebanon early on Tuesday morning, the first Israeli ground invasion into the country since 2006. Why is Israel launching the offensive now? It comes after two weeks of airstrikes, which killed the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on Friday, and a series of deadly explosions to pagers and walkie-talkies that Israel hopes has weakened the agility and organization of Hezbollah. There is also little political incentive for Benjamin Netanyahu to let up, as targeting Hezbollah has given the embattled Israeli prime minister a political boost. What does the invasion mean for the stability of the region? Fears of a wider regional conflict, sparked by the Hamas attacks on 7 October, are closer than ever. The US has called for de-escalation. But, as Joe Biden prepares to leave the White House, Israel’s strongest ally appears to have little leverage. Meanwhile, the reformist-led government of Hezbollah’s backer Iran said it had no plans to send troops to Lebanon, but it was coming under domestic pressure from hardliners.

Tory leadership rivals turn on Jenrick over claims SAS ‘killing, not capturing, terrorists’ – UK politics live	Tugendhat and Cleverly echo criticisms from Labour and the military as the Tory conference gears up for another day Good morning. In a leadership contest, sometimes the dynamic changes because one candidate has a postive breakthrough moment (like David Cameron did in 2005, when his passionate, no-notes speech to the Tory conference turned him almost overnight into the favourite). But more often the odds shift because someone has messed up. Kemi Badenoch’s campaign faltered this week after her maternity pay gaffe. And now Robert Jenrick, the bookmakers’ favourite, has also made an error serious enough to cost him support. Yesterday he released a video claiming that that UK special forces are -killing rather than capturing- terrorists because of fears that European laws would free any detained assailants. As Rajeev Syal, Jessica Elgot and Dan Sabbagh report, he has been condemned for saying this by Labour and by figures in the military. No, I don’t. I think what he said is wrong, and I’m afraid demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of military operations and the law of armed conflict. I’m extremely concerned that such words should not be seen in any way to encourage people to take any action other than surrender to British forces when asked to do so. You’re going to have to ask Robert to justify that statement. That’s not something which I have heard, that’s not something which I’m comfortable repeating. When we have a threat to the UK, this lunacy of being unable to render people across borders or arrest people in countries whose police forces are unacceptable, means that we are more often than not forced into taking lethal action than actually raiding and detaining.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/01/tory-leadership-rivals-turn-on-jenrick-sas-claims-tugendhat-cleverly-badenoch-tory-conference-uk-politics-live	2024-10-01T00:54:59-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbbea68be56598eb4b28034a85439fcda821a091/0_278_8192_4915/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2636c4fc4403b03a5a5849a93ac83988

‘Everything is dead’: Ukraine rushes to stem ecocide after river poisoning	Russia is suspected of deliberately leaking chemical waste into a river, with deadly consequences for wildlife Serhiy Kraskov picked up a twig and poked at a small fish floating in the Desna River. -It’s a roach. It died recently. You can tell because its eyes are clear and not blurry,- he said. Hundreds of other fish had washed up nearby on the river’s green willow-fringed banks. A large pike lay in the mud. Nearby, in a patch of yellow lilies, was a motionless carp. -Everything is dead, starting from the tiniest minnow to the biggest catfish,- Kraskov added mournfully. Kraskov is the mayor of the village of Slabyn, in Ukraine’s northern Chernihiv region. The rustic settlement – population 520 – escaped the worst of Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion. But the war arrived last week in a new and horrible form. Ukrainian officials say the Russians deliberately poisoned the Seym River, which flows into the Desna. The Desna connects with a reservoir in the Kyiv region and a water supply used by millions.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/ukraine-seim-river-poisoning-chernihiv-ecocide-	2024-09-30T21:00:20-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5ca9f02f0fafbfbfa14eb70873dc173e54ea9bb/358_663_6362_3817/master/6362.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f1e6b8f7e2a7ae59de68810097db8b6f

Democrats sue Georgia election board over new ballot hand-count rule	Democrats aim for state court to block the rule requiring officials to hand-count ballots cast on election day Democrats sued the Georgia state election board on Monday over a new rule requiring officials to hand-count ballots cast on election day, asking a state court to declare it unlawful and block it from going into effect. The suit, filed in Fulton county superior court by both the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic party of Georgia, takes aim at a rule adopted in a 3-2 vote by the state election board on 20 September.

They must all agree on the total count and ensure that it matches the totals from the machine tabulation. If there is an inconsistency, they are required to determine the reason and correct it, if possible.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/30/democrats-georgia-election-hand-count-lawsuit	2024-09-30T11:52:00-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c7584f6a904460aacdce88e47f6db5c6d751a2d/307_899_4572_2743/master/4572.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=12609dadbc32ad69ee627f08a6f9a1f9

The Himalayas formed about 50m years ago, when the Indian subcontinent smashed into the Eurasian tectonic plate – although recent research has suggested the edges of these plates were already very high before the collision.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/mount-everest-is-having-a-growth-spurt-say-researchers	2024-09-30T08:00:04-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd0a696d6e55c78d5efeed6e6bc423dd81be1288/0_116_3604_2162/master/3604.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1dd2d0db7f05219cdf76c9613bac7c4e

As rumours grow of a stop Badenoch campaign, Tories cannot risk a stitch-up	Whispers at party conference suggest a surprise candidate could join Robert Jenrick in leadership race’s final two There are four candidates for Conservative leader plying the conference with themed hats and tote bags – but only two are sucking all of the oxygen. It is no accident of scheduling that Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch were the ones on the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, much to the chagrin of their rivals. Reason would then dictate they would be the final two selected by Tory MPs to face the party members’ vote. If that transpires, the outcome would be very unpredictable. Jenrick has undergone a dramatic makeover and won the backing of the most MPs but he is virtually unknown to the wider public. Badenoch is the straight-talking renegade who is more of the members’ darling but who terrifies many of her parliamentary colleagues.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/30/stop-kemi-badenoch-campaign-rumours-tories-analysis	2024-09-30T06:53:32-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/177cf0197b6e6299ef6da117370c4b1816b532fb/304_51_2591_1555/master/2591.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=510c15dc7ed2a9a0eb5fa1c2cd555643

Austrian parties to begin talks on forming government after far-right win	Exit polls show Freedom party’s election gains came thanks to strong support among younger voters Austria’s main parties are preparing to begin tense wrangling to form a government amid warnings about the country’s democracy after the far right’s watershed victory in a general election that saw angry voters punish centrist incumbents over migration and inflation. On Sunday the anti-Islam, Kremlin-friendly Freedom party (FPÖ) scored its strongest result since its founding after the second world war by former Nazi functionaries and SS officers with just over 29% of the vote. The outcome surpassed expectations and beat the ruling centre-right People’s party (ÖVP) by nearly three percentage points. The centre-left opposition Social Democratic party (SPÖ) turned in its worst-ever performance with 21% while the Greens, junior partners in government, sank to just 8%.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/austria-election-talks-forming-government-far-right-freedom-party-win	2024-09-30T06:01:43-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/371a530c1a7bfc2c99a0be9764be452a4ee402b3/0_0_4872_2923/master/4872.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f286b6502648adaa030c0f7ff3afe14f
Biden to address Hurricane Helene damage as Trump tries to turn it into campaign issue – US politics live	President to speak about response to storm; Trump to hit campaign trail in Georgia after accusing Biden and Harris of turning blind eye to destruction Good morning, US politics blog readers. After churning across the southern US and causing massive destruction and dozens of deaths in North Carolina, Georgia and elsewhere, Hurricane Helene appears set to collide with the presidential campaign. Donald Trump will speak this afternoon in Valdosta, Georgia about the storm, undoubtedly with an eye on turning the swing state’s voters away from Kamala Harris. The former president has already made the hurricane’s destruction into an attack line on the Democrats, reportedly accusing Joe Biden of -sleeping- as the storm raged. Speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania yesterday he also accused Harris of turning a blind eye to the destruction. Biden plans to speak from the White House at 10.30am ET about his administration’s response to the storm, while Harris has announced the cancellation of campaign events in Las Vegas today so she can return to Washington DC and be briefed on the storm’s impact at Fema headquarters. She’ll arrive just after 5pm. Harris’s economic policies are more popular with voters than Trump’s, new polling commissioned by the Guardian finds. The vice-president laid out her plans in a major speech last week. The vice-presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz is set for tomorrow evening, with both candidates preparing for what is currently the last scheduled debate before the election. Israel may or may not be on the verge of launching a ground invasion of Lebanon.

First Thing: Hamas says Israeli airstrike has killed head of its operation in Lebanon	Fatah Sharif Abu al-Amine has reportedly been killed in an Israeli attack in the south. Plus, New Zealand reclaims haka world record Good morning. Hamas said on Monday the leader of its operation in Lebanon, Fatah Sharif Abu al-Amine, had been killed in an Israeli airstrike in the country’s south, with Lebanon’s national news agency reporting that the bombing struck a Palestinian refugee camp. What’s happening in Israeli politics? The opposition lawmaker Gideon Saar rejoined the government on Sunday, a step that is likely to strengthen the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. What did Netanyahu tell the UN? On Friday he shrugged off global appeals for a ceasefire in a defiant speech delivered barely an hour before massive airstrikes targeting Hezbollah’s leader levelled several apartment blocks in Beirut.

Concerns over Gender Queer book dismissed by Australian classifications board as anti-LGBTQ+, court hears	Barrister acting for Bernard Gaynor says board failed to engage with submissions – but counsel for minister of communications suggests some lacked context The Australian classifications board made a -broadbrush dismissal- of over 500 submissions calling for a ban of the book Gender Queer by labelling those submissions as anti-LGBTQ+, a court has heard.

Jenrick tells Tory conference it’s ‘leave or die’ as he ramps up calls for UK to exit ECHR – UK politics live	The former immigration minister, currently the bookmakers’ favourite to become leader, will take part in a Q&amp;A at the Tory party conference today Labour has called for an investigation into £75,000 of donations to Tory leadership contender Robert Jenrick, saying it had -serious concerns- about the money’s ultimate origin, PA Media reports. PA says: Jenrick, the frontrunner for the Conservative leadership, received three donations of £25,000 in July from The Spott Fitness, a fitness coaching app provider. As first reported by the Tortoise news website, the company’s latest accounts show it has no employees, has never made a profit and has more than £300,000 of debts, and in January it registered a loan from Centrovalli, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands. Our party’s survival rests on restoring our credibility on immigration. If we continue to duck and dance around this question our party has no future. Despite what others might falsely claim, we’ve never had a legal cap on legal migration. Unless we introduce one – where no visas will be issued unless net migration is in the tens of thousands or lower – we will be powerless to end the cycle of broken promises. Anyone who is not prepared to commit to a specific cap just doesn’t understand the depth of public anger.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/30/robert-jenrick-kemi-badenoch-conservative-party-conference-uk-politics-news-live-updates	2024-09-30T00:33:30-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a4dd2f6bc34b6d9dcb2b05972391d9505547762/745_70_6257_3755/master/6257.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=05affbfcd0b2d41b013e882497e4bbce

Middle East crisis live: Israel continues bombardment of Lebanon as Hezbollah mourns leader’s death	More than 1,000 people killed in Lebanon and one million displaced by Israeli strikes, Lebanese minister says Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the conflict in the Middle East. Israel has continued its attacks on Lebanon, with its military claiming to have hit dozens of Hezbollah targets in the past hours, a day after the Lebanese militant group confirmed its leader Hassan Nasrallah had been killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut. More than 1,000 people have been killed in Lebanon and more than 6,000 wounded as a result of Israeli attacks in the past two weeks, the health ministry said, and about one million Lebanese people have been displaced by the strikes, including hundreds of thousands since Friday, Nasser Yassin, the minister coordinating the government’s crisis response, has told Reuters. The Lebanese ministry of public health reported last night that the Israeli attacks across Lebanon yesterday killed 33 people and injured 195 others, according to Wafa, the Palestinian news agency. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has confirmed the death of Brig Gen Abbas Nilforoushan, deputy commander of IRGC operations. He was killed in the Israel’s air strikes on Lebanon on Friday which also killed other senior Hezbollah figures, including the group’s leader Hassan Nasrallah. In its statement mourning Nilforoushan’s killing, the IRGC condemned -crimes of the Zionist regime- in Lebanon and praised his role in defending the -resistance front- and Iran. It didn’t vow revenge against Israel. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has said Lebanese people are the new target of -Israel’s policy of genocide, occupation and invasion.- The Turkish leader, who has been highly critical of Israel’s ongoing assault on Gaza, said children were among Lebanese civilians who have been -murdered- by -brutal- Israeli strikes conducted on Lebanon this week. -By the grace and power of God, the blows struck by the Resistance Front on the worn-out, deteriorating body of the Zionist regime will become even more crushing,- said Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei about Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. He went on to add: -The foul-natured Zionist regime has not become victorious by carrying out this atrocity.- Iran’s parliament speaker, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, commenting on the killing of Nasrallah, said on Sunday that what Iran terms -resistance groups- will continue to confront Israel with the help of Iran, according to Iranian state media. Iran has called for the UN security council to meet over Israel’s assault on Lebanon and across the region. Joe Biden ordered the Pentagon to enhance America’s defence posture in the region. He said: -The United States fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and any other Iranian-supported terrorist groups.- UN secretary general António Guterres said he is -gravely concerned by the dramatic escalation of the events in Beirut in the last 24 hours-. He went on to add: -This cycle of violence must stop now. All sides must step back from the brink.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/29/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-bombardment-lebanon-hezbollah-hassan-nasrallah-latest	2024-09-29T00:33:49-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/069368af9afa369a52f22d68dabf30eaf6c45494/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3a20c1d8a0d4ee7410cffb47fba068cc

Starmer visit to Brussels could lead to overhaul of Brexit deal	Prime minister hopes to use talks with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen this week to prepare for a reset in the spring Keir Starmer will use a meeting with the European Commission president this week to pave the way for a springtime overhaul of Britain’s Brexit deal, amid warnings that closer ties will be essential in his government’s desperate search for growth. The prime minister will meet Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels on Wednesday. However, it comes with home secretary Yvette Cooper still vehemently opposed to an agreement that would allow young people to move more freely between Europe and the UK – a measure that EU diplomats regard as key to unlocking more serious talks in the spring.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/29/starmer-visit-to-brussels-could-lead-to-overhaul-of-brexit-deal	2024-09-28T23:00:25-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6432c6fa722329e8dfa1170b6ed7510828f0d4c0/1305_262_2357_1414/master/2357.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=617d36308bf538b7a02bf926bd1d6c38
The UK will get hotter and drier for plants... except in Manchester	Thanks to the city’s famously rainy climate, trees suffering in the south can be moved, says the Royal Horticultural Society The climate is changing British gardens everywhere.

‘World of horrors’: families huddle on Beirut’s streets amid the bombs	Residents of Lebanon’s capital flee their homes and seek shelter as the death toll from Israel’s airstrikes rises Gunshots fired into the air, women wailing in the streets, the ever-present buzz of drones and the distant thud of Israeli airstrikes: this was the sound of mourning in Beirut on Saturday. Hassan Nasrallah, who led Hezbollah for 32 years, was dead, killed in an Israeli airstrike on Dahieh, in the southern suburbs of Beirut, the day before. For many in Lebanon, his killing had been unimaginable. But Israel’s war with Hezbollah had long surpassed what was previously thought possible. Pagers had exploded in hands, walkie-talkies blew up in belts and Israeli warplanes killed hundreds in half a day. The death of Nasrallah was one more blow to the Lebanese psyche, already struggling to grasp soaring death tolls and, for some, the loss of their home overnight.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/28/world-of-horrors-families-huddle-on-beiruts-streets-amid-the-bombs	2024-09-28T12:25:51-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e868600619a275d3bdf336c4abf96549eecf4f6/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a48dad94232565775e4248b4f2d42074

New College has made headlines since January 2023, when the rightwing governor, Ron DeSantis, vowed to transform it from a university known for liberal values into a conservative institution, and installed a new board of trustees including the rightwing culture warrior Christopher Rufo. That board in turn appointed DeSantis’s -close ally- Richard Corcoran as the new college president, in which role he makes a $699,000 salary.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/28/new-college-of-florida-hosting-extremist-writer-steve-sailer	2024-09-28T05:00:03-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2d483de0ff3098cf82d6ac26b1968b8aa154376/1640_406_3360_2016/master/3360.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4febcd6f52ce7c5dc71505205e41ad28

Russia-Ukraine war live: six reported killed in Sumy after Russian strikes on hospital	Ukraine’s interior minister said one person killed in initial attack before the site was hit again during the evacuation At least six people were killed Saturday morning following two consecutive Russian strikes on a medical centre in Sumy, a city in northeastern Ukraine. Ihor Klymenko, Ukraine’s interior minister, said on Telegram that one person died in the initial shelling that destroyed several floors of the hospital – but during the evacuation of the hospital’s patients, Russian forces struck again, killing more. A policeman was one of the six confirmed dead. China and Brazil on Friday pressed ahead with an effort to gather developing countries behind a plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine – an effort that Zelenskyy has dismissed as one that serves Moscow’s interests. Seventeen countries attended a meeting on the sidelines of the UN general assembly chaired by China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, and Brazilian foreign policy adviser Celso Amorim. Wang told reporters they discussed the need to prevent escalation in the war, avoid the use of weapons of mass destruction and prevent attacks on nuclear power plants. Zelenskyy, in a speech to the assembly earlier this week, questioned why China and Brazil were proposing an alternative to his own peace formula. Proposing -alternatives, half-hearted settlement plans, so-called sets of principles- would only give Moscow the political space to continue the war, he said. US secretary of state Antony Blinken, speaking after a meeting with Wang, underscored strong US concerns about China’s support for Russia’s defence industrial base. He told reporters that China, while saying it seeks an end to the Ukraine conflict, -is allowing its companies to take actions that are actually helping Putin continue the aggression. That doesn’t add up.- South Korea’s foreign minister said Russia was engaging in illegal arms trade with North Korea, reiterating statements by the US, Ukraine and independent analysts that Pyongyang is supplying rockets and missiles in return for economic and other military assistance from Moscow. Misuse of Russia’s right to veto as a permanent member of the UN security council is hindering the UN’s efforts to end war, foreign minister Cho Tae-yul said during the UN general assembly on Saturday. Finland will place a key Nato base less than 200 kilometers (125 miles) from its border with Russia, -sending a message- to its eastern neighbour, the defence ministry said Friday. Finland became a Nato member last year, dropping decades of military non-alignment after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. A Russian drone may have breached the national airspace of Nato member Romania for -a very brief period of under three minutes- overnight during an attack on neighbouring Ukraine, the Romanian defence ministry said on Friday. Three people were killed in the attack, according to Ukrainan officials. Russia’s FSB security service is investigating three foreign journalists for reporting in parts of Russia’s Kursk region occupied by Ukrainian forces, bringing the total of such investigations to 12. The three, Kathryn Diss and Fletcher Yeung from Australia’s ABC News and Romanian journalist Mircea Barbu, are being investigated for illegally crossing the Russian border, state news agency Ria Novosti reported.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/28/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-putin-latest-news	2024-09-28T00:44:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eee381ef4c6ec3d72a8e51097bf4f2bbfcbe0af3/0_250_8640_5184/master/8640.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9db2efa71e9c893fb00be18cbaaab2dc

At least three killed as Hurricane Helene makes landfall | First Thing	Hurricane Helene is expected to bring life-threatening storm surges as high as 20ft. Plus, Eric Adams charged Good morning. Hurricane Helene made landfall as a category 4 hurricane in the Florida Big Bend region around 11.10pm ET on Thursday, one of the strongest hurricanes on record to hit Florida. The storm weakened to a category 1 overnight. How dangerous is a storm surge? As a hurricane approaches a coast, the churning winds force ocean water up onto land; atmospheric pressure from the storm also helps squeeze the water ashore. The shallower the continental shelf, the higher the threat of a dangerous surge. Water is heavy, and it can move fast in a surge, sweeping people to their deaths, throwing about boats and vehicles, and pulverizing structures. Follow our live blog here. What did Netanyahu say? -We are continuing to strike Hezbollah with full force, and we will not stop until we reach all our goals – chief among them the return of the residents of the north securely to their homes.- He addresses the UN today. What is the scale of the war? Israeli airstrikes have killed about 700 people since Monday – with that day representing the highest death toll in a single day in Lebanon since the civil war of 1975-90 – and reports have suggested Israel is making plans for a ground offensive.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/27/first-thing-at-least-3-killed-as-hurricane-helene-makes-landfall	2024-09-27T02:54:30-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd96f91fe267b38e206fd5e50b7a5e1879a3c60d/0_302_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6d760f1b1452963b5299934e4467d31c

New leader of Scottish Conservatives to be announced – UK politics live	Second largest group in Holyrood will announce leader who will take over from Douglas Ross Labour MP Emily Thornberry, asked about the prime minister meeting potential future US president, has said that Donald Trump -styles it out somewhat- with alleged racism. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee chair said: If he’s president and he starts caging Mexican children, then that needs to be called out. We are actually in a really strong position now, in that if you think about all the other G7 countries, we are a country that we have just had an election, we have a progressive Government with a large majority and stability in front of us - a good five years of the same leader. And if you look at the other G7 countries, they don’t necessarily have that. Donald Trump may be the president of the United States in a couple of months’ time so of course, it’s important to have meetings with him and to build a relationship with him. Whatever criticisms one may have of Donald Trump, the point is that the office of president is one that needs to be properly respected and the Americans are very close friends of ours.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/27/new-leader-scottish-conservatives-keir-starmer-labour-uk-politics-live	2024-09-27T01:27:10-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0d3769e338c4d59d03a47154f04c5143396b320/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d1d875842b3d0fe18b751f6997bb3fb5

Middle East crisis live: Israeli and US officials discuss Lebanon ceasefire proposal on sidelines of UN general assembly	The meeting comes after Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel would not stop its attacks on Hezbollah despite calls for a temporary truce Israeli and US officials have met to discuss a US-backed ceasefire proposal with Hezbollah, the office of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late on Thursday. The meetings – which happened in New York on the sidelines of the UN general assembly, would continue in the days ahead, Netanyahu’s office said, adding that they appreciated the US efforts. Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel -will not stop- its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon despite calls from the US, France and other allies for an immediate three-week ceasefire. The Israeli prime minister told reporters that his government’s policy was clear as he landed in New York on Thursday. -We are continuing to strike Hezbollah with full force, and we will not stop until we reach all our goals,- Netanyahu said. The US and France called for a 21-day temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah to make way for broader negotiations. A joint statement calling for -a diplomatic settlement- of the crisis was also endorsed by the UK, Australia, Canada, the European Union, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. It called for an urgent cessation of hostilities, which presented -an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation-. Lebanon’s minister for foreign affairs, Abdallah Bouhabib, has said his country is enduring a crisis that -threatens its very existence-. Speaking at the UN general assembly, he has said that his government welcomed yesterday’s ceasefire plan raised by the US and France – and demanded it be implemented. US officials hope to persuade Netanyahu to accept the ceasefire proposal by the time he addresses the UN general assembly on Friday. They argue that a pause in the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah could also provide a breathing space in which to revive long-stalled negotiations with Israel and Hamas over the release of Israeli hostages in return for a truce in Gaza. Hezbollah has yet to respond to the call for a truce, although it and its backer, Iran, have previously insisted it would halt its strikes only if there is a ceasefire in Gaza. Israeli airstrikes continued in Lebanon on Thursday, in which health authorities said 92 people had been killed. Two people were killed and 15 others injured, including a woman in critical condition, after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on Thursday, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. Israel said it carried out a strike that it said killed one of the heads of the Hezbollah air force unit, Mohammad Surur. Hezbollah later confirmed his death. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi movement said it had targeted the northern Israeli town of Safed with dozens of rockets on Thursday in response to Israeli attacks on Lebanon. Later on Thursday, air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and across central Israel. The IDF said the sirens were triggered by a missile fired from Yemen, which it said was intercepted by Israel’s Arrow missile defence system.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/27/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-war-hamas-middle-east-news-latest-updates	2024-09-26T23:26:30-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a20ef191343a34134591c54621c701795bc799a/0_546_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6424944b481a47db51bb8d69e60d3236

Keir Starmer spoke at the United Nations security council yesterday, but today he is speaking at the UN’s general assembly (UNGA). In some respects these are chaotic meetings – world leaders queuing up to give speeches one after another, often over-running their times slots, not necessarily having much positive impact – but that does not mean it’s not a big gig for a debut PM. According to advance briefing, Starmer will say the UK is returning to -responsible global leadership- because it is in British interests to address problems around the world. He will say: War, poverty and climate change all rebound on us at home. They make us less secure, they harm our economy, and they create migration flows on an unprecedented scale.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/26/uk-politics-labour-keir-starmer-un-general-assembly-speech	2024-09-26T00:55:01-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a83cf541703c61e5981ca7ce5d768d69fd6d7b8/388_170_3359_2016/master/3359.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=711ddcb70b6c71afc7d9dabdbbda8a38

Victorian Farmers Federation splits from national body over Keep the Sheep rally	VFF chair Emma Germano says the National Farmers Federation is conducting ‘policy by press release’ and no longer represents Victorian farmers The Victorian Farmers Federation has split from the National Farmers Federation, citing the latter’s unilateral support for a rally focused on the phase-out of live sheep export, policy development -by press release-, and diminished value for Victorian farmers. The VFF chair, Emma Germano, on Thursday informed the NFF president, David Jochinke, a past president of the VFF, of the state farming body’s decision. It comes two weeks after hundreds of farmers rallied outside the federal parliament to protest against the federal government’s decision to phase out sheep live exports.

When you left the conference on Tuesday afternoon, the place was buzzing. Delegates talking about Keir Starmer’s speech. Trying to get on the guest list to the hottest parties. Then on Wednesday morning, you find that half the conference has disappeared. Just vanished. And those that remain appear to be wandering round in circles. Hungover, trying to work out what’s going on. In search of some existential meaning. Most striking is the lack of queues for food. Though that could be down to the fact there is no food in the food concessions. Even the conference staff have given up. It’s every man and woman for themselves. Give it a few more hours and people will be eating each other.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/25/keir-starmer-gone-half-delegates-with-him-zombie-apocalypse	2024-09-25T07:37:28-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/755a938ea00a782c1338b9d6d8bbb7c6e45eecc9/0_59_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ce11da9aa157ae2914da5b50e17fbc3d

Starmer says Tories should apologise for winter fuel payments cut ahead of possible conference defeat – UK politics live	Labour party delegates expected to condemn decision to means-test winter fuel payments as prime minister says Conservatives should apologise Good morning. Keir Starmer is in New York, where he will be addressing the United Nations general assembly (UNGA) later, but the Labour party conference still has half a day to go in Liverpool. Starmer gave a series of media interviews before he left and they are playing out this morning. Speaking to Susanna Reid for ITV’s Good Morning Britain, he refused four time to apologise to pensioners for the cut in winter fuel payments. Delegates will debate the decision at the conference this morning, and they are expected to support a motion championed by the Unite union condemning the decision. On ITV Starmer was asked if he would apologise to a pensioner like Chrissy, who has arthritis and who told the the programme she was dreading winter because her fuel bills would go up by £40 a month, and she would lose the winter fuel payment. Starmer dodged the question, and instead said: Well, I am really concerned that we’ve been put in this position. When you inherit an economy with £22bn missing, it is a really difficult set of choices. The people who should be saying sorry are the last government who left a hole of £22bn, and they should be sorry for that and they should apologise for that.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/25/keir-starmer-labour-party-conference-winter-fuel-payments-conservatives-un-uk-politics-news-latest	2024-09-25T00:37:44-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68934201a6f978d3b4580f87b62f5fa92a3853e4/0_123_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0156a24a67a286591a20cea8e6ddc456

Being overweight, genetics and a lack of exercise contribute to type 2 diabetes, which is the most common form.

Special counsel can file oversized motion on Trump election interference case	Judge Chutkan grants Jack Smith 180-page motion on presidential immunity for ex-president’s federal court case Special counsel Jack Smith can file an oversized, 180-page motion on presidential immunity in Donald Trump’s Washington DC federal court election interference case, a judge ruled Tuesday. Judge Tanya S Chutkan’s decision stems from prosecutors’ 21 September request to exceed the typical 45-page limit for opening motions and oppositions. Smith’s motion must be filed by Thursday and will include both legal arguments and evidence and could provide additional insight into Trump’s efforts to throw out election results, though it is unclear when the public might be able to see that material given that it’ll initially be filed under seal.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/24/trump-election-intereference-case-presidential-immunity-motion	2024-09-24T14:41:35-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e023a95494046621a2d64282686f5697dffe483f/698_0_7991_4800/master/7991.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5fa43105353bf301e66a76fbc3f38ebe

Starmer needs the public’s trust to be able to make the hard choices to come	Labour needs voters to believe politics can make their lives better not that politicians are all the same, hence why the donations row was so damaging When Keir Starmer wanted to inject a moment of levity into his first speech as prime minister at Labour conference, he told a story about visiting a holiday cottage in the Lake District where the owner joked about wanting to push him down the stairs. As lighter moments go, it had a dark edge. It is British humour, of course, but there is a reason it made an impression on Starmer – it’s a microcosm of what he and his closest advisers see as their greatest threat: the cynicism and disdain with which ordinary people view politicians. The view that they are all the same, all on the take. The widespread lack of trust that politics can make lives better.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/24/starmer-needs-the-publics-trust-to-be-able-to-make-the-hard-choices-to-come	2024-09-24T11:29:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b9cad5327df068ea83e2e78a5df8e612b53a0aa/0_103_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3ef26f51a3ec1221a1e5e3b46c00dc1d

Escalation suggests Israel gambling on bombing Hezbollah into ceasefire	Efforts to bring peace to Gaza prove fruitless as Israel increases airstrikes on Lebanon and Hezbollah return fire with deadlier missiles It is now clear that last Tuesday’s exploding pager operation was just a first step. What is now unfolding is an Israeli strategy of military escalation against Hezbollah, premised on the risky belief that the militant group can be bombed into a ceasefire before fighting in Gaza ends. Monday’s wave of airstrikes in southern Lebanon killed at least 558 people and displaced many thousands, and there is little sign of the campaign slowing. Israel’s air force has said it had dropped 2,000 bombs in 24 hours – and there can be little doubt that this is now a full-on war, though it is not yet an all-out conflict.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/24/escalation-suggests-israel-gambling-on-bombing-hezbollah-into-ceasefire	2024-09-24T10:25:10-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/181bac92fc9d2630b25627adb41c377fcbae3a46/0_279_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=57d0a3dc1e42c1385a5bd064fbeb99b0

Biden to address UN leaders for final time; Trump to campaign in Georgia – live	Biden will make one of the final big speeches of his presidency at 10am ET to the UN general assembly in New York; Trump to speak in Savannah, Georgia, later today Good morning, US politics blog readers. Joe Biden will make one of the final big speeches of his presidency at 10am ET today, when he addresses the UN general assembly in New York. The annual gathering of world leaders is a significant moment for any president, but even more so for Biden, because he’s due to depart the White House in January. His administration has not given many hints of what he might say, but in his speech, you can expect him to make the case for his handling of everything from climate change to Israel’s invasion of Gaza, and potentially the escalating crisis in Lebanon. Donald Trump, meanwhile, will be in Savannah, Georgia, to give a speech at 1pm billed as discussing his policy on taxation and manufacturing. The ex-president’s economic proposals have centered on a combination of tariffs and tax cuts that he argues would lower prices for consumer, after several years of high inflation under Biden. Economists aren’t so sure, and chances are Trump veers away from the subject anyway – he’s known to go off topic throughout his speeches. We’ll be keeping an eye on what both men have to say. Antony Blinken may soon become the latest Biden administration official to be held in contempt. The Republican-led House foreign affairs committee has demanded he testify today, but he has reportedly told them he is busy with the UN general assembly, and when the committee meets beginning at 10.15am, they may vote to sanction him. A scandal brews in New York City’s suburbs. The New York Times reported yesterday that freshman Republican congressman Anthony D’Esposito gave part-time jobs to both his lover and his fiancee’s daughter, which may be a violation of House ethics rules. A vote in the House on a short-term funding measure to prevent a government shutdown is expected on Wednesday.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/24/biden-trump-harris-election-updates	2024-09-24T06:08:39-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a6dde6c43e4f0b4ed5a65f60f4c547df8d17d81/0_213_6637_3981/master/6637.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6d550f21180a355b725956b08786817c

Russia-Ukraine war live: War could be ‘closer to end’ than people think says Zelenskyy	Ukraine president says Vladimir Putin is ‘afraid’ of Ukraine’s Kursk occupation We are restarting our live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine and will give you the latest updates throughout the day. Here are the latest developments: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he believes the war with Russia is -closer to the end- than many believe and called on allies to strengthen Ukraine’s army. In excerpts of an interview with ABC News’ Good Morning America, set to be broadcast in full on Tuesday, the president said: -I think that we are closer to the peace than we think … We are closer to the end of the war.- He added: -That’s why we’re asking our friends, our allies, to strengthen us. It’s very important.- Zelenskyy told ABC that Vladimir Putin is -afraid- of Ukraine’s Kursk operation, in which it has taken more than 1,000 square km of Russian territory. Zelenskyy is in the US to attend sessions at the UN general assembly as well as to present a -victory plan- to US President Joe Biden and presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. After a bipartisan meeting with members of the US Congress, Zelenskyy said -decisive action now could hasten the just end of Russian aggression against Ukraine next year-. The US played a -critical role- in protecting freedom around the world, he said in a Telegram post, and praised the US Congress and both main parties for their -unwavering commitment to this cause-. His comments came as Republican presidential candidate Trump suggested Zelenskyy wanted Harris to win the November election. -I think Zelenskyy is the greatest salesman in history. Every time he comes into the country, he walks away with 60 billion dollars,- Trump said at a rally in Pennsylvania. -He wants them [the Democrats] to win this election so badly.- Trump said if he wins the election, he would call Putin and Zelenskyy and urge them to reach a deal to end the war. Zelenskyy also held talks in New York with German, Indian and Japanese leaders on Monday trying to shore up support for Kyiv’s war efforts. -We talked about how to make a just peace closer,- Zelenskiy said on his Telegram messaging app after meeting with German chancellor Olaf Scholz. -The main thing is to maintain unity.- He said he had discussed energy aid with Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida, and that Delhi and Kyiv were -dynamically developing- their relations after a meeting with prime minister Narendra Modi. Jails controlled by Russia are deliberately withholding medical care for Ukrainian prisoners, with doctors in one prison even taking part in what it called -torture-, according to a commission mandated by the UN rights council. The commission, set up by the Human Rights Council to investigate violations in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion, had already concluded that Moscow’s occupying forces were using torture -systematically-. But in his oral report to the council, commission chair Erik Mose said torture had become a -common and acceptable practice-, with Russian authorities acting with -a sense of impunity-. Russian forces launched the latest of a series of strikes on Ukraine’s southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia on Monday evening, killing one person, regional governor Ivan Fedorov said. A city official, quoted by public broadcaster Suspilne, put the injury toll at five, including a 13-year-old girl. Strikes on the city earlier in the day and the previous night wounded at least 23. Russian forces have begun storming the eastern Ukrainian town of Vuhledar, a stronghold that has resisted Russian attack since the beginning of the war, according to Russian war bloggers and state media. Russian state media said the hilltop town in the Donetsk region, which some cast as a fortress due to its enduring resistance to Russian attack, was caught in a pincer movement by Russian forces and that battles were under way in the east of the settlement. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the UN general assembly, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said it was clear that Russia was receiving new weapons, including Iranian missiles despite Tehran’s repeated denials.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/24/volodymyr-zelenskyy-russia-ukraine-war-live-latest-news-updates	2024-09-24T00:28:59-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbf614bd650644494a5d3c99f33ba3460d0a0f1d/0_98_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8d93a3728782cd674552c1dc1baa709b
Starmer to deliver Labour conference speech with left alarmed by plan for crackdown on benefit fraud – UK politics live	PM to deliver message of qualified optimism but expected announcement on benefit fraud concerns left of party Good morning. Keir Starmer is giving his speech to the Labour confernece this afternoon and, as the Guardian reports, his overall message will be one of qualified, long-term optimism. Another leader might have dressed this message up in poetic rhetoric, but Starmer will be using a straightforward cliche, telling the audience -there’s light at the end of the tunnel-. He will say: The truth is that if we take tough long-term decisions now, if we stick to the driving purpose behind everything we do: higher economic growth - so living standards rise in every community; our NHS facing the future - waiting lists at your hospital down; safer streets in your community; stronger borders; more opportunities for your children; clean British energy powering your home; making our country more secure ... then that light at the end of this tunnel, that Britain that belongs to you, we get there much more quickly. The legislation will allow fraud investigators to compel banks to hand over information about people’s finances if there is a suspicion they are claiming benefits they are not entitled to. It will also give them powers of -search and seizure- of people’s property in cases involving organised criminal gangs that are exploiting the benefits system.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/24/keir-starmer-labour-conference-speech-latest-live-politics-news	2024-09-24T00:27:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb7ea441523fac097a2dee348bb6171242af5b80/0_184_4991_2994/master/4991.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ed14d32bf1087a00612cb2e3fe773d0e

As it meets against backdrop of Israel’s bombing of Lebanon, is UN too broken to be fixed?	Supporters say UN mediation has prevented even worse outcomes, but security council is stuck in vicious circle As diplomats from nearly 200 member states gather in New York this week for the United Nations general assembly against the backdrop of a massive Israeli bombing campaign in southern Lebanon, a nagging question to be addressed is whether the UN is too broken to be fixed. UN officials are facing three intractable conflicts, in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan. While it remains one of the most important humanitarian organisations on Earth, organising relief efforts for refugees, natural disaster victims and others in dire need, the UN’s principal security body appears to be powerless to intervene in some of the world’s most grinding conflicts.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/24/israel-lebanon-un-general-assembly-united-nations	2024-09-24T00:02:54-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3353a56c8310ce2f2c807ba55034a46939ef64f8/0_126_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e3a8932277be4d22f21d063adc835ae6

Roads were heavily congested with civilians desperate to flee the assault. Iran’s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has accused Israel of seeking to create a wider conflict that Iran does not want to get directly dragged into.

Housing | Nationwide, Britain’s biggest building society, is to let first-time buyers borrow up to six times their earnings in what has been labelled a -gamechanging- move that ramps up the mortgage price war. Environment | Rich countries could raise $5tn, five times the money that poor countries are demanding in climate finance, through windfall taxes on fossil fuels, ending harmful subsidies and a wealth tax on billionaires, research by the pressure group Oil Change International has shown. NHS | Nurses in England have rejected the 5.5% pay rise they were given for this year, in a move that may lead to further strikes in pursuit of higher salaries.

Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus may have been co-written by forgotten dramatist	Exclusive: Scholar names Henry Porter as likely co-author of 1604 play after linguistic clues in his surviving work Scholars have long suggested that Christopher Marlowe had a collaborator for the comic scenes of his classic play Doctor Faustus, although his name alone is on the 1604 published edition. Now a largely forgotten dramatist, Henry Porter, has emerged as the likely co-author, based on comparative linguistic evidence that has been unearthed from his surviving play. Doctor Faustus is a tragic story of vanity and greed, in which a scholar sells his soul to the devil in return for knowledge and power. The tragedy is mirrored by scenes of comic horseplay that are now thought to have been written by Porter, who was described by a contemporary as -the best for comedy amongst us-.	https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/sep/24/christopher-marlowe-doctor-faustus-play	2024-09-23T22:00:30-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eb4f9d9f6f1b99ef0c35d6e8fdbb25c09ad2ae2/0_8_1584_950/master/1584.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=020a3147cc0fe6205de22f526576edde

If you had thought that maybe today was the day when you made that call to Dignitas, then think again. Cancel that flight to Zurich. At least postpone it. Things might not be quite as bad as you had been led to believe. Or rather, they are that bad but there is some small flicker of hope if you can hold on long enough. There will be pain in the short and medium term. There’s no avoiding that. Try to think of it as character building. But possibly, just possibly, you might come through. We happy few. Blinking into the light of the promised land. This was Rachel Reeves’s day. And she knew everything was going to be just fine the moment she woke up to find that Liz Truss had posted yet another cry for help on X. You can now follow the Trusster’s mental decline in real time on social media. It’s got so bad that she now films herself in front of a bookcase where everything is arranged by colour.

Because that will elect somebody who will deny you any voice in the future of the United States … If you really care about Gaza, vote to have a voice, so you can do something about it. And then, be ready to turn out into the streets, in the millions, and fight for it.’-	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/23/jane-fonda-youth-vote-kamala-harris-climate-change	2024-09-23T03:00:37-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13e2efa1ced9d1779623561c5644061e03db4507/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cf642ff23c2f53978b1a186e003f2816

Russia-Ukraine war live: Volodymyr Zelenskyy in New York to meet and address UN	Ukraine president to present proposals for ‘victory plan’ to Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump Hello and welcome to the Ukraine live blog. I’m Yohannes Lowe and the time in Kyiv has just gone past 10:30am. Here are the latest developments: Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived in the US on Sunday for a crucial visit to present Kyiv’s plan to end two-and-a-half years of war with Russia. The Ukrainian president will present his proposals – which he calls a -victory plan- – to President Joe Biden, as well as presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and will also attend sessions at the UN general assembly. The visit comes after a summer of intense fighting, with Moscow advancing fast in eastern Ukraine and Kyiv holding on to swathes of Russia’s Kursk region. Kyiv has for weeks pressed the west to allow it to use delivered long-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia – so far to no avail. The Ukrainian president urged his partners to help achieve -a shared victory for a truly just peace-, in a post on X with his nightly video address. -This fall will determine the future of this war,- Zelenskyy said in the address, delivered from a plane. Ukrainian media later reported he landed in New York. He is also due to visit Washington later in the week. The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, indicated that delicate negotiations with the White House to allow Ukraine to use Storm Shadow missiles inside Russia are ongoing, arguing it was a time for -nerve and guts-. The apparent encouragement to Biden comes just over a week after Lammy and the prime minister, Keir Starmer, visited the US president in the White House but failed to resolve the sticking point between two countries. Speaking at a fringe event at the Labour party conference in Liverpool on Sunday, Lammy said it was -a critical time for nerve and guts and patience and for fortitude on behalf of allies who stand with Ukraine-. At least 16 civilians were injured, including a 15-year-old boy, on Sunday evening as a result of Russian airstrikes on the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, Ukrainian officials said on Monday. Rescuers evacuated residents from several damaged apartment buildings, Ukraine’s interior ministry said on Telegram. The ministry said that according to preliminary information Russia used its KAB guided aerial bombs to strike Zaporizhzhia. Russia launched new strikes in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv which hit high-rise apartment buildings, leaving at least 21 wounded in a second consecutive night-time attack, authorities said. The bombs fell on Saturday night on the district of Shevchenkivsky, north of the centre of Kharkiv, which is the second-largest Ukrainian city, local governor Oleh Syniehubov said. A firefighter was killed by a Ukrainian drone in Russia-controlled Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine, the Russian emergencies ministry said on Sunday. The drone’s explosives detonated when Vyacheslav Glazunov, 33, was extinguishing a fire in the Novoaidar district triggered by fallen drones, the ministry said on Telegram. Another two firefighters were injured, it added.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-volodymyr-zelenskyy-new-york-latest-news-updates	2024-09-23T00:34:57-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7285ace841a1848a84dd0167896d1195f8daaf7/0_106_4148_2490/master/4148.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=411ec171adb07841c5f2e1a716b0ea75

Middle East crisis live: IDF urges some residents of southern Lebanon to evacuate amid strikes on Hezbollah targets	Israeli military spokesman says it began striking militant group’s targets after indications Hezbollah was preparing to fire on Israeli territory Welcome to our live coverage of Israel’s war in Gaza and the wider Middle East crisis. The Israeli military said on Monday it was conducting extensive strikes against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon and urged villagers in the country’s south near areas used by the militant group to evacuate. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said it had in recent days dealt Hezbollah -a series of blows it could not have imagined-. The Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said operations would continue until it was safe for evacuated people on the northern Israeli side of the border to return. Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, said Israel did not want a war with Lebanon but that it had a right to self-defence. Israel’s civil defence agency, meanwhile, ordered all schools in the country’s north to close. Israel’s chief of the general staff, Herzi Halevi, said the military was well prepared for the next stages of fighting, which were coming in the next few days. -We will do whatever it takes to removes threats against Israel,- he said in a televised statement. Israeli forces raided the office of global news channel Al Jazeera in the occupied West Bank on Sunday and issued a 45-day closure order. The Israeli military said it closed the Al Jazeera TV office in Ramallah because it incited -terror-, an accusation the network vehemently denies. At least 41,431 Palestinian people have been killed and 95,818 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said. An Israeli airstrike killed at least seven people in the Kafr Qasem school in Beach camp – which was sheltering displaced families – in Gaza City on Sunday, Palestinian health officials said. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said 12 people had been arrested for being operatives collaborating with Israel and planning acts against Iran’s security. The arrests were in six different Iranian provinces, it said. Israel is examining a plan to use siege tactics against Hamas in northern Gaza, Benjamin Netanyahu was quoted by several Israeli media outlets as saying. The prime minister’s office did not respond to a request for comment. The reports on Sunday cited unnamed sources at a closed parliament committee meeting.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/23/middle-east-crisis-live-hezbollah-israel-war-lebanon-evacuations-latest	2024-09-22T22:49:16-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dd8298b1f51433b64da05cafed12022cd9d0e9d/0_239_5052_3031/master/5052.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1b43d4f9844cf674bf3de23902a95fb4
Monday briefing: Will Labour lift the gloom at its first conference in power?	In today’s newsletter: The party have been criticised for being too pessimistic while Keir Starmer has been rocked by a scandal over freebies. Can the party reset their message to the public in Liverpool? • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. Since the party won the election in July, Labour’s messaging has been downcast. Abandoning the high spirits that followed their seismic victory, Keir Starmer has opted for gloom-laden predictions of hard times ahead. The prime minister’s message to the country late last month was that -things will get worse before they get better-. Coming into office and immediately setting expectations so low is a political risk – if there was ever a moment to lead with hope and optimism, critics argue, it is now. As Labour’s annual party conference kicks off in Liverpool, there are big questions about whether the government will move on from the pessimism that has characterised their first few months in power, and steer the tone and tenor of the conversation on to something else. In a conversation in yesterday’s Observer, the prime minister was keen to stress that he offers more than just doom and gloom, with plans to provide a vision for what Britain could be. Israel-Gaza war | Seven people have been killed after an Israeli airstrike hit a school housing displaced people in western Gaza City, Palestinian health officials said. Meanwhile, Hezbollah has said it has entered an -open-ended battle of reckoning- with Israel after launching a series of rocket attacks on the north of the country as world powers implored both sides to step back from the brink of all-out war. Politics | Rachel Reeves will announce that she has ordered investigations into more than £600m worth of Covid contracts awarded under the Conservatives as Labour struggles to get back on the front foot over questions of ethics. Sudan | The UN secretary general, António Guterres, is -gravely alarmed- at reports of a full-scale assault on the Sudanese city of al-Fashir by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and has called on its leader to halt the attack immediately, according to Guterres’ spokesperson. Business | Fifty pubs a month closed for good across England and Wales in the first half of this year, with experts warning that tax rises in 2025 could make it even harder for some businesses to keep their doors open. Inflation | The price of petrol and diesel in the UK is falling at the fastest pace this year, with households paying about £4 less to fill up a family car than they did a month ago.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/23/monday-briefing-will-labour-lift-the-gloom-at-its-first-conference-in-power	2024-09-22T22:46:54-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/123c8e37f8bf27eb34c6a7110e708f86e6779cd8/0_293_6232_3742/master/6232.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b4fb45f636c3db117a95bf7aae290453

Greens may bristle at comparison but their RBA interest rate cut ultimatum is Trumpist	No government institution is entirely at arm’s length, but an intervention by Jim Chalmers would likely be calamitous The Greens may bristle at the comparison, but their demand for the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, to order the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates now is Trumpist. Nick McKim, the Greens’ economic spokesperson, says his party won’t support the Albanese government’s RBA reforms unless or until interest rates fall. Given the central bank governor, Michele Bullock, has repeatedly said a cut to its cash rate is unlikely in the near term, Chalmers must use his existing powers to make it happen.

News live: Chalmers reveals $149bn cut to national debt under Labor; Australia overtakes Russia in Asia influence rankings	Treasurer Jim Chalmers says gross debt at the end of 2023-24 was $907bn. Follow the day’s news live Australia has jumped one place in the Lowy Institute’s annual Asia Power Index, largely due to Russia going backwards as a result of its war in Ukraine. The think tank ranks 27 countries and territories to rank their relative power in Asia. It is based on 131 indicators across eight broad themes: military capability, defence networks, economic capability, economic relationships, diplomatic influence, cultural influence, resilience and future resources. For the first time, experts surveyed for the Asia Power Index judged that China is better able to deploy rapidly and for a sustained period in the event of an interstate conflict in Asia. This increase in ranking, Australia’s second since the inception of the Asia Power Index (it surpassed South Korea in 2020), is more a function of Russia’s decline since 2018 than Australia’s rise.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/sep/23/australia-news-live-politics-debt-cut-chalmers-labor-russia-asia-influence-rankings-weather-fire	2024-09-22T14:39:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9be0b449e50bd54383c8fae1b66c8bae947617da/0_261_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ab73cfe2ac895605d6b4028ae2991d40

Labour delegates long to celebrate, but ministers can’t quite feel the joy | John Crace	The party should be toasting its landslide, but instead a state of near-paralysis seems to have set in We may need to have a rethink. Over the last few days it seemed to have become apparent that Keir Starmer wasn’t very good at the politics of being a politician. Taking the free suits and glasses. Being slow to realise this could make him look hypocritical. Sitting back while different factions within the Labour party elite kick lumps out of one another. Making a mess of the winter fuel allowance. Unsure whether he was making cuts or means-testing benefits. Unable to move on from days of bad media. Generally looking a tad on the dim side. Now not so much. Come the start of Labour’s party conference in Liverpool, Keir was a man on a mission. Willing to learn from his mistakes. Ready to do whatever needed to be done. And what needed to be done was … nothing. It’s usual for the prime minister to make himself available for TV interviews on the Sunday politics shows during conference.

CBeebies at the Baftas? Awards aim to revive magic of kids’ TV	Categories will boost visibility of shows in a new, fractured media landscape Children’s television was once a thriving, fantastical realm, peopled by Wombles, Tweenies and Danger Mouse – not to mention a car called Brum, an engine called Ivor and a dog called Roobarb – and British-made shows were available every day on the major terrestrial channels. Since then, the magic has largely retreated to the margins of broadcasting. But the embattled landscape is to receive a high-profile boost from Bafta, the Observer has learned. After prolonged campaigning from influential figures such as the former PlaySchool presenter Floella Benjamin, the children’s maths whiz Johnny Ball, the Dr Who writer Russell T Davies and Anne Wood, a veteran creator of worldwide hits such as Teletubbies, Bafta is to recognise the inventive work that is still entertaining Britain’s children. The British Academy has created three high-profile awards to sit alongside the trophies it hands out to adult television shows. The new categories will go some way to replace Bafta’s abandoned children’s TV awards event.	https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/sep/22/cbeebies-at-the-baftas-awards-aim-to-revive-magic-of-kids-tv	2024-09-22T04:00:07-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3a1b4dca0b74438d2f5f65fa3353b2513226eb6/0_222_2413_1447/master/2413.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ea6eeb2d7add6e5fa287c8772cc1aef2

Thousands of Morales’s supporters have been making the 190km (120-mile) march from the town of Caracollo to La Paz, the political capital, where they are due to arrive on Monday. Clashes broke out earlier this week as counterprotesters tried to stop them with rocks and tear gas. Roughly 40 people have been injured.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/22/bolivia-evo-morales-protest-luis-arce	2024-09-22T03:00:07-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3952cbb1ae4f4e6539eba9d36211e734b8e7cc5c/0_590_5436_3262/master/5436.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=91ec261b0ec261b02331f010835f9e21

Middle East crisis live: Overnight barrage of Hezbollah rockets launched into Israel, IDF says	Hezbollah launches widespread attacks across northern Israel on Sunday, with some landing near the city of Haifa The United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, has warned of an -imminent catastrophe- in the Middle East. -With the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is no military solution that will make either side safer,- she wrote in a brief statement on X. Hospitals in northern Israel have been instructed to transfer their operations to facilities with extra protection from rocket and missile fire, the health ministry said on Sunday. Rambam hospital in Haifa will transfer patients to its underground, secure facility, the ministry said. Meanwhile, the military’s Home Front Command said schools and other educational institutions and activities would not be permitted in the north until at least Monday at 6pm local time. The death toll from an Israeli airstrike that targeted Hezbollah military commanders in Beirut’s southern suburbs has risen to 45, Lebanon’s health ministry said on Sunday, updating an earlier toll of 37 from the Friday attack. News broadcaster Al Jazeera said on Sunday morning that Israeli forces raided its bureau in the West Bank’s Ramallah city with a military order to close it for 45 days. The Qatar-based channel aired live footage of the Israeli troops entered the channel’s office and handed over a closure order to one of the Al Jazeera TV staff. Al Jazeera’s West Bank bureau chief, Walid al-Omari, reported that Israeli troops brought a truck to confiscate documents, devices and office property. In a statement, the Palestinian Journalists’ Syndicate condemned the raid, saying -this arbitrary military decision is considered a new violation against journalistic and media works-. The US state department has urged Americans in Lebanon to leave the country while commercial options remain available. -At this time, commercial flights are available, but at reduced capacity. If the security situation worsens, commercial options to depart may become unavailable,- it added. The death toll from an Israeli strike on Saturday on a school-turned-shelter in Gaza city included -13 children and six women-, one of whom was pregnant, said civil defence agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal. The Gaza health ministry said at least 22 had died as a result of the strike.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/22/middle-east-crisis-live-hezbollah-israel-lebanon-gaza-latest-news-updates	2024-09-22T00:33:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c403d90a501ce31eaaddfff817af74e2d65a796/0_273_5756_3454/master/5756.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=89e1d754fd1746a17d07c3fe1acdc14c
Starmer says he wants to give ‘hope’ he can deliver ‘massively different and better country’ – Labour conference live	Labour conference opens as PM sees approval ratings plunge amid warnings on economy and controversy over freebies and Sue Gray Good morning. The last time Labour held a conference after a summer general election was in 2017. The party lost, but because Jeremy Corbyn did much better than expected, conference ended up feeling like a victory party. This time Keir Starmer won a landslide. But early messaging from the government has focused on the dire economic inheritance, and the need for tough decisions in the budget, Starmer’s approval ratings have plunged, and the past week has been dominated by controversy caused by unforced errors (freebies, and feuding about Sue Gray). It is too early to assess the mood of Labour, holding its conference in Liverpool as a party of government for the first time in 15 years, but no one is describing it as pure celebratory. In an interview with the Observer ahead of the conference, Starmer said he would protect public services from further austerity. I was running a public service when the coalition government went down the austerity route. It did a huge amount of damage to our public services and we are still feeling the damage even now. So we are not going down the road of austerity. We’ve got to deal with the problems we’ve inherited, that’s what we are doing. What we’ll set out at conference is the why. What do you get for this? The hope, the changed Britain. This would be a massively different and better country, real sunny uplands stuff. But to get there we have to do the tough thing to start with.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/22/keir-starmer-angela-rayner-labour-party-conference-latest-live-news	2024-09-22T00:25:24-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/117611b8ecba27af4689f5a2dfb0ed4e3ab64887/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f29b156511465c431e7bdea4455079cc

Putin regime will collapse without warning, says freed gulag dissident	Vladimir Kara-Murza and his wife, Evgenia, speak of his time in a Siberian jail and why the truth about Russia will come out The last time I met Evgenia Kara-Murza, it was a grim day in early March. The timing couldn’t have been worse. As we spoke, Alexei Navalny’s coffin was being lowered into the frozen ground in a Moscow cemetery. Meanwhile Evgenia’s husband, Vladimir Kara-Murza, was still incarcerated in a Siberian prison cell almost identical to the one in the Arctic Circle in which Navalny had been found dead, presumed murdered. The parallels were eerie. Because Vladimir, a journalist turned political activist, was not just also loathed and feared by the Kremlin and imprisoned on spurious charges, he’d also been poisoned – twice – targeted by the same FSB (Federal Security Service) unit that had poisoned Navalny.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/22/putin-regime-will-collapse-without-warning-says-freed-gulag-dissident	2024-09-21T21:00:01-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c688a92461a3dc19bb5834a13f2786e10c9b0a0/0_121_4390_2634/master/4390.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25ce6077a2687a5945ca8346dcba1736

Supreme court’s Chevron decision adds ambiguity to cannabis law: ‘It’s a mess’	Decision that weakened power of government regulatory agencies sows confusion to already chaotic cannabis law A recent supreme court decision that weakened the power of US government regulatory agencies such as the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has added additional confusion to America’s already chaotic cannabis law.

Another of the law firm’s clients in question, the archdiocese of New Orleans, is offering clergy molestation victims less than 10% of what they are requesting in a bankruptcy settlement, in part by arguing the so-called -lookback window- law doesn’t apply to more than 600 abuse claims.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/21/louisiana-catholic-church-sexual-abuse-victims-lawsuit-window	2024-09-21T04:00:40-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b10508b3d29cfbe71539145307b47f70a62a5c1/0_4_5100_3059/master/5100.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=66079d038e0df2add9eaa1180aef93c8

However, the -painful- budget taking place on 30 October adds a fair bit of uncertainty to the mix.	https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/sep/21/uk-savers-better-deal-banks-cut-interest-rates	2024-09-21T00:00:35-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43fcabd27b1d0ee34f6e646699c5582867169e2f/0_164_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6b863ad5f7de8c6ddaa7d3ec0cbee47e

Is Labour on track to meet its promises on the environment?	Though the party has plenty to celebrate at its first conference in power for 15 years, there is much work to do to on net zero When Keir Starmer arrives in Liverpool this weekend promising an upbeat tone to Labour’s first conference in power for 15 years, he will boast of his party’s strong start to its first 82 days in government. In just the last two months, the new government has made more green reforms than Rishi Sunak did in his entire premiership and Labour has plenty to celebrate: it has taken the first steps to crack down on water companies and clean up our filthy rivers; stopping oil and gas licences, and withdrawing support for a new coalmine; setting up a new renewable company, Great British Energy; a green light for new on and offshore windfarms; and an international charm offensive to signal renewed UK leadership in climate and nature diplomacy; alongside a host of smaller changes.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/21/is-labour-on-track-to-meet-its-promises-on-the-environment	2024-09-20T23:00:32-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a33da6273526dd6f43df16882b80f7f43db9ca3e/0_201_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ed7c4218dc4038e8922662f9086a99ac

‘Stop doing dumb stuff,’ economist warns as housing affordability in Australia slips	Saul Eslake says decades of ‘bad policies’ have inflated demand as report finds about 20% of households effectively ‘locked out’ of the market Housing affordability has deteriorated over the past year to reach its worst level since records began in 1995. First home buyers now rely on wealthy families or high-income jobs to enter the market, according to the latest housing affordability report from PropTrack. Driven by high mortgage rates and increasing home prices, affordability further deteriorated this financial year to the point where a median-income household earning about $112,000 could afford just 14% of homes sold – the smallest share since records began. This share has declined from 43% in just three years.

Israel conducted dozens of strikes across southern Lebanon on Thursday night, hours after Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, threatened retribution and -punishment- for the unprecedented attacks that blew up pagers and walkie-talkies bought by the group. What has Israel said about the explosions? It has not commented but announced, just hours before Tuesday’s pager attacks, that it was broadening its war aims to return Israelis who had been evacuated from the north. Does X still use the tags? No, it now uses a -community notes- peer review feature and has weakened its approach to content moderation under Elon Musk’s ownership. What limitations are there to the study? It was conducted during the 2020 election, when Trump supports were more against the platform.

Fears of chaos as Georgia election board considers last-minute voting changes	Republican majority eager for hand-counts of voting tallies, which experts say are time-consuming and unreliable The Georgia state election board is set to meet on Friday and consider another round of last-minute election changes that could cause delays and confusion after election day in a critical battleground state. The Republican majority on the board is expected to approve a rule that would require three people in every precinct to check machine-vote tallies by hand-counting the election results. Voting experts have long warned that hand-counts are time consuming, costly, and less reliable than machines. It’s a process that nonetheless has been favored by conservative activists who doubt the results of the 2020 election.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/20/georgia-state-election-board-meeting	2024-09-20T03:00:09-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f561546ffa3b7b1cc3cd5e6166393ddc69aae3c/0_153_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b9da389a056e233467e960627f0f2a43
Harris to condemn Trump in Georgia after news of abortion-related deaths	Vice-president to speak after news broke that two women died after being unable to access procedure legally in state Kamala Harris will give remarks on Friday in the Atlanta area about Donald Trump’s role in the abortion bans that now blanket much of the United States, days after news broke that two Georgia mothers died after being unable to access legal abortions and adequate medical care. In the weeks since becoming the Democratic nominee for president, Harris has made reproductive rights a central part of her campaign. She has toured the country to highlight the healthcare consequences of the 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade, which paved the way for more than a dozen states to ban almost all abortions.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/20/trump-harris-election-abortion-georgia	2024-09-20T03:00:08-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/968c682f0de5e782289ef72c13cbd9ff1de0b80e/0_14_5472_3282/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e8f96c166b65b7005839e9c792a350a4
Labelling Trump’s lies as ‘disputed’ on X makes supporters believe them more, study finds	Study says tagging posts with false claims on election fraud may make Trump voters more likely to think they’re true Labelling tweets featuring false claims about election fraud as -disputed- does little to nothing to change Trump voters’ pre-existing beliefs, and it may make them more likely to believe the lies, according to a new study. The study, authored by John Blanchard, an assistant professor from the University of Minnesota, Duluth, and Catherine Norris, an associate professor from Swarthmore College, looked at data from a sampling of 1,072 Americans surveyed in December of 2020. The researchers published a peer-reviewed paper on their findings this month in the Harvard Kennedy School’s Misinformation Review.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/20/trump-tweets-false-label-credibility-supporters	2024-09-20T03:00:07-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f40834f6f369ed7baab302f74b845193f7a732f/0_0_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ae0ca13be90bdb44482bfcb5235572e6
Trump bemoans lack of support from Jewish voters as claims of ally’s antisemitism emerge – US politics live	Republican candidate claims Israel would cease to exist if Harris wins as explosive allegations emerge that North Carolina’s Mark Robinson referred to himself as a ‘black Nazi’ Good morning and welcome to our blog covering US politics in the run-up to the presidential election following another tumultuous evening where Donald Trump bemoaned a lack of support from Jewish voters just hours after allegations emerged that a Republican ally had referred to himself as a -black Nazi- on a pornography website. Trump failed to mention the claims in a CNN report against Mark Robinson, North Carolina’s Republican gubernatorial nominee, during a speech on Thursday at the Israeli-American Council national summit in Washington. If I don’t win this election - and the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that if that happens because if 40%, I mean, 60% of the people are voting for the enemy - Israel, in my opinion, will cease to exist within two years. Harris sat down with Oprah Winfrey on Thursday for a -virtual rally- that included a wide-ranging sit-down interview, during which Harris attacked Trump’s stance on reproductive rights and pledged to sign a border security bill thwarted by Senate Republicans. On Friday, the vice-president will be attending campaign events in the swing states of Georgia and Wisconsin. In the evening, Trump will be in another swing state – Arizona –at a town hall event. He will appear alongside Monica Crowley, a commentator and former assistant secretary for public affairs, and Chad Wolf, who was an acting secretary for public affairs in his administration.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/20/donald-trump-mark-robinson-kamala-harris-us-politics-live	2024-09-20T02:01:02-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a04f253d5d56aefddd2bf3f7c511c0e1eea0f29/0_0_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ed93d3c379ddb391fd81ac9f92bdfe24

Russia-Ukraine war live: Italy calls for ‘fair peace’ and says defence of Ukraine must not lead to world war	Italian foreign minister announces new weapons for Ukraine but warns of risks as conflict escalates Italy is about to send another Samp-T anti-missile system to Ukraine, foreign minister Antonio Tajani said on Thursday, underlining the need, however, to avoid entering war with Russia. -We are sending a new Samp-T (anti-missile system) to protect hospitals, schools, universities … for this country that was attacked by Russia,- Tajani told Radio 24. Ukraine’s offensive into the Russian border region of Kursk diverted about 40,000 Russian troops away from the frontline, Zelenskyy said on Thursday. Kyiv launched its Kursk offensive on 6 August in a bid to pull Moscow’s forces away from eastern Ukraine, where the Russian army has captured a string of villages in recent months. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had captured the village of Heorhiivka, east of the city of Kurakhove, in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. The General Staff of Ukraine’s military, in an afternoon report, referred to the village as one of several engulfed by fighting. Popular Ukrainian military blog DeepState said the village was in Russian hands. In his nightly video address, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine’s forces had -managed to diminish the occupiers’ assault potential in Donetsk region,- though the situation remained difficult in areas subjected to the heaviest attacks, near Kurakhove and another key Russian target, the city of Pokrovsk. Russian forces hit a geriatric care home in the Ukrainian city of Sumy and targeted its energy sector in a new wave of airstrikes on Thursday, killing at least one civilian, Ukrainian officials said. During a daytime strike on the northern city, a Russian guided bomb hit a five-storey building, regional and military officials said. One person was killed and 12 wounded, the interior ministry said. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said rescue teams were checking to see whether people were trapped under rubble. Images from the site shared alongside the ministry’s post showed elderly patients evacuated from the damaged building lying on the ground on carpets and blankets. The UN human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine said attacks on the power grid probably violated humanitarian law while the International Energy Agency said in a report that Ukraine’s electricity supply shortfall in the critical winter months could reach about a third of expected peak demand. Moscow has repeatedly attacked the Sumy region, which borders Russia’s Kursk region, the site of a major Ukrainian incursion in which Kyiv says it seized over 100 settlements. Zelenskyy will meet Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House next week in what is likely to be his last such visit before US elections that could upend Washington’s policy on Kyiv. Zelenskyy is expected to share a -victory plan- with the US leaders to end the war with Russia during the visit on 26 September – as Kyiv frets that a second Donald Trump presidency could loosen US commitment to Ukraine. In a separate announcement, Zelenskyy said he would also meet Trump. Ramzan Kadyrov, the powerful leader of Russia’s Chechen Republic, accused Elon Musk on Thursday of disabling a Tesla Cybertruck that he claimed to have received from the billionaire last month. Kadyrov, who has ruled Chechnya with an iron fist for over 17 years, shared a video in August of him driving around in the electric vehicle with what appeared to be a machine gun mounted on its roof. Kadyrov said he received the vehicle from Musk, a claim that the Tesla owner called a lie on his social media platform, X. -Now, recently, Musk remotely disabled the Cybertruck,- said Kadyrov in a post on his Telegram account. It was not possible to independently verify Kadyrov’s claims.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/20/russia-ukraine-war-live-italy-calls-for-fair-peace-and-says-defence-of-ukraine-must-not-lead-to-world-war	2024-09-20T00:25:50-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e5709aa65502db4119e2c6389e7c40edfd97c7d/0_282_4357_2614/master/4357.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f2daaa170459707c37ceebfe6c779f89
