Farage reprises his favourite moans at his latest not-so-special announcement | John Crace	Just when it seemed the press conference couldn’t get any more underwhelming, Nige introduced his new councillors It’s getting to be quite a habit. Reform send out an invitation to attend a press conference with the promise of a -special announcement-. The media attend with high expectations only to be rewarded with a crushing sense of anticlimax. One special announcement turned out to be a 30-minute whinge from Nigel Farage about some local elections being cancelled. Another was the news that Andrea Jenkyns would be standing for mayor in Greater Lincolnshire. Not even Andrea’s friends give much of a toss about that. Fair to say, then, that expectations were not high for Monday’s latest special announcement. But we travelled to the Royal Horseguards hotel in Westminster in hope. Maybe this time … A fatwa on Rupert Lowe. That would be news. Perhaps the hapless ex-Tory MP Jonathan Gullis had been let in out of the cold. Only a few weeks ago he was saying how hard it was for someone who had gone out of his way to make enemies to get a job. Could it be that Nige had taken pity on him and offered him the chance to return to parliament at the Runcorn byelection?	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/17/farage-reprises-his-favourite-moans-at-his-latest-not-so-special-announcement	2025-03-17T11:39:18-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34e1aa9abf106afc1d6745e400ea5ffcaa937a02/0_0_5906_3544/master/5906.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=87d7bd661f3c775ec680ed96af848c31

Nearly half of Australia’s year 6 students can’t swim 50 metres or tread water for two minutes	‘Range of factors’ behind fall in swimming skills to below national benchmarks, including cost of lessons, researchers say Nearly half of all year 6 students are falling below Australian swimming and water safety benchmarks for their age group and their swimming skills are not improving in high school, new research shows. National guidelines recommend all Australians -should be able to float or tread water for two minutes and swim continuously for 50 metres- by the age of 12. But Royal Life Saving Australia found teachers estimated that 48% of students were unable to perform these skills and 39% of students were still unable to by year 10. By age 17, the benchmark recommends 50% of students -be able to float or tread water for five minutes and swim continuously for 400 metres- – but the report warned that teachers generally observed -little improvement- in swimming skills after year 7.

Trump to attend Kennedy Center for board meeting after Vance booed by audience – US politics live	President to visit arts venue in his capacity as chair, telling reporters ‘we have to straighten it out’ Good morning and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news over the next few hours. We start with news that president Donald Trump will visit the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Monday after ousting its leadership, taking over as chair, and seeking to put his stamp on the renowned arts institution. President Donald Trump has said he has no intention of creating exemptions on steel and aluminum tariffs and said reciprocal and sectoral tariffs will be imposed on 2 April. Last month, Trump raised tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum to a flat 25%, without exemptions or exceptions, in a move that was designed to help US industry while contributing to an escalating trade war, Reuters reported. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump said reciprocal duties on US trading partners would come alongside auto duties. As Trump and Putin prepare to speak, there have been concerns that the settlement being pushed for by the Trump administration would look a lot like an outright Russian victory, at the expense of Ukraine and its allies in Europe. Trump and Putin last week set off further alarm bells in Kyiv by exchanging friendly words, as the new US administration cosies up to Moscow while attacking Ukraine with threatening language and the withdrawal of some military support. For weeks, Donald Trump and Republicans have insisted that social security, Medicaid or Medicare would not -be touched-. Now Musk has suggested the programs would be a primary target. The US defense department webpage celebrating an army general who served in the Vietnam war and was awarded the country’s highest military decoration has been removed and the letters -DEI- added to the site’s address. On Saturday, US army Maj Gen Charles Calvin Rogers’s Medal of Honor webpage led to a -404- error message. The URL was also changed, with the word -medal- changed to -deimedal-. Federal employees in a little-known office dedicated to tech and consulting services were at work on the afternoon of 3 February when Elon Musk tweeted about their agency for the first time. -That group has been deleted,- Musk wrote. Trump’s administration is being accused by activists of a quid pro quo as it attempts to fast-track a controversial fossil fuel pipeline proposal in Michigan that would in part be built by a donor with deep financial ties to the president. Trump’s second term is more direct, determined and intentional, and includes the cultural equivalent of precision airstrikes against the mostly liberal residents of Washington DC, the Guardian’s David Smith writes. Trump on Saturday invoked the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since the second world war, granting himself sweeping powers under a centuries-old law to deport people associated with a Venezuelan gang. Hours later, a federal judge halted deportations under the US president’s order. What is the Alien Enemies Act and can Trump use it to deport gang members?	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/mar/17/donald-trump-kennedy-center-jd-vance-tariffs-ukraine-immigration-us-politics-live-news	2025-03-17T03:02:58-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5456a4735a6bab136a20827512a65b7c7d4e1e3a/271_4_5721_3434/master/5721.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=20188b8c195c99de6e7cad60c2c5061a

The state department has said that the two-decade-old President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar), which is estimated to have prevented 25m early deaths, is exempt from the cancellation of most US overseas aid. But the program is heavily reliant on logistical support from the US Agency for International Development (USAid), which has seen most of its projects killed off.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/17/hiv-aids-pepfar-christians-trump	2025-03-17T03:00:23-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5739afdad9206a76ef1ae674faeb692d5148edcc/0_166_4971_2983/master/4971.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=af93e8f91f2379f4d49cacc61ce56837
Starmer urged to introduce wealth tax instead of cutting disability benefits – UK politics live	Diane Abbott says a wealth tax of 2% on people with assets over £10m would raise £24bn a year Peter Walker has more from Diane Abbott’s interview on the Today programme this morning. Good morning. -You want me to cut £1bn. Shall I take £100 each off 10 million people, or £1,000 each off 1 million people?- The former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke is credited with coming up with this explanation of what big number spending cuts actually mean, but every chancellor has probably thought the same. Diane Abbott, the Labour leftwinger and mother of the Commons, has said urged the government to impose a wealth tax as an alternative to cutting disabilty benefits. In an interview on the Today programme, asked what she would do instead, Abbott replied: I would introduce the wealth tax. If you brought in a wealth tax of just 2% on people with assets over £10m, that would raise £24bn a year. That’s what I would do. Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, has joined those expressing concerns about the plans. In an article for the Times, he says: I would share concerns about changing support and eligibility to benefits while leaving the current top-down system broadly in place. It would trap too many people in poverty. And to be clear: there is no case in any scenario for cutting the support available to disabled people who are unable to work. Abbott has said that opposition to the government’s plans for disability benefit cuts is not just coming from the left. In her interview on the Today programme, she said she agreed with what Burnham is saying, and she said she also agreed with Ed Balls, who said last week that cutting benefits for those most in need was not something Labour should be doing. Abbott, Burnham and Balls were three of the candidates in the 2010 Labour leadership contest. A fourth, Ed Miliband, is also reported unhappy about the cuts, although as a cabinet minister he has not spoken out publicly. Emma Reynolds, a Treasury minister, has said the government is -for the time being not going to come forward with a wealth tax-. She said this in an interview on the Today programme, when asked if the government would be following Abbott’s advice. Reynolds said the government had already raised taxes affecting wealthy people. Reynolds urged Labour MPs and others to wait for the details of the plans before coming to a verdict on them. In comments implying the final proposals might not be as draconian as some of the pre-briefing has implied, she said: Some colleagues are jumping to conclusions about our plans before they’ve heard them. So I just urge them to be patient. She said there would always be a safety net for those most in need. She said: We’ll set out further details, but the severely disabled and the most vulnerable will always get support, and there will always be a safety net. The Resolution Foundation thinktank has said that the government’s proposed disability cuts are likely to fall disproportionately on the poor. In a statement it says: The government is reportedly focusing on cutting incapacity and disability benefits to stem rising spending and support more people into work. But while the system needs reform, Ministers appear to be focused on cutting personal independence payments (Pip) – a benefit that isn’t related to work. The foundation warns that cutting Pip by £5bn in 2029-30, for example by raising the threshold to qualify for support, could see around 620,000 people losing £675 per month, on average. The Foundation adds that 70 per cent of these cuts would be concentrated on families in the poorest half of the income distribution.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/17/keir-starmer-labour-welfare-disability-cuts-latest-live-politics-news	2025-03-17T02:44:00-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05d4ed4cd6740e0e5575e15e65ba72e58c7937c5/7_276_4688_2812/master/4688.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e8fce104c316dbe3a264315cebb6f002

Houthis and US both vow escalation after wave of deadly American airstrikes in Yemen – Middle East crisis live	US says airstrikes are intended to deter rebel group from attacking Red Sea shipping Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in the Middle East. The US and Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen are both vowing escalation after the US launched a wave of deadly airstrikes on Saturday with the stated aim of deterring the rebel group from attacking Red Sea shipping. The UN humanitarian aid organisation for children, Unicef, has warned that 1 million children in Gaza -are struggling to survive without basic necessities- amid the ongoing Israeli blockade on all aid. At the beginning of the month, Israel cut off humanitarian supplies to Gaza, claiming it was part of an effort to pressure Hamas into accepting a change in the ceasefire agreement to allow for the release of hostages without an Israeli troop withdrawal. -Hundreds of thousands lack clean water and sanitation. Water is a basic human right that no one should be denied,- Unicef said in a post on X on Monday. Iran will respond to a letter by Donald Trump -after full scrutiny,- foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said on Monday. Last week, an Emirati official brought a letter from the US president proposing nuclear talks with Tehran, which Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected, saying such a proposal was -deception- from Washington. The Lebanese army has said three Syrians were killed yesterday evening after fighting on the Lebanon-Syria border near the Qasr-Hermel area. -Military units responded to the sources of the fire with appropriate weapons, reinforced their deployment, and maintained security,- the Lebanese army said. -Contacts continue between the army command and the Syrian authorities to maintain security and stability in the border area.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/mar/17/middle-east-houthis-us-yemen-israel-gaza-palestine-latest-live-news-updates	2025-03-17T01:48:37-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65b3aabac712cc2a53579634c8e3131d39303a39/0_381_5721_3433/master/5721.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bfb13cbbba71968e754e95e578e63f1b

Cummings, who was once a sworn enemy of Farage during the EU referendum as he battled to keep control of the leave campaign, is reported to have met the Reform leader to discuss Whitehall reform, which allies said was the strongest sign yet that Farage was taking seriously the idea of becoming prime minister.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/16/nigel-farage-dominic-cummings-friendly-chat-donald-trump-elon-musk	2025-03-16T06:46:32-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5db79822f233e947757fa69c519c008574911b4e/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=81ba7b34f4472407eb85932c266048e1

‘A cultural embarrassment’: anger as male sculptor commissioned for statue of suffragist	Planning application reignites row over statue on Edinburgh’s Royal Mile of Elsie Inglis, Scottish suffragist and maternal health pioneer Edinburgh’s Royal Mile and its surrounding streets are not short of monuments. In a 30-minute round trip, visitors can rub the nose of Greyfriars Bobby, spit on the Heart of Midlothian and touch David Hume’s toe, all thought to bring good luck. On the way, they might stop for a selfie with Wojtek the Bear, an honorary member of the Polish army who went on to live in Edinburgh Zoo, while the Scott Monument, built to honour Sir Walter, looms overhead. According to campaigners, though, there is something missing: women. There are no freestanding statues of women in the city centre, and only a handful in the surrounding area. So when a fundraiser was launched in 2017 to secure a Royal Mile statue for Elsie Inglis, Scottish suffragist and maternal health pioneer, it quickly gained momentum. But when plans were finally unveiled last month, a bitter row was reignited about the choice of a male sculptor and his vision for the statue.	https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/mar/16/anger-male-sculptor-commissioned-statue-suffragist-edinburgh-elsie-inglis	2025-03-16T01:00:13-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20960aa258ff9aa9329901cf89bf96940e9750ae/961_307_4369_2623/master/4369.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4ee2acb7ba9382b9673aeb23d85130f9

As cyberwarfare threat looms, cashless Nordic nations go back to banknotes | Miranda Bryant	Nordic countries were early adopters of digital payments. Now, electronic banking is seen as a potential threat to national security In 2018 a former deputy governor of Sweden’s central bank predicted that by 2025 the country would probably be cashless. Seven years on, that prediction has turned out to be pretty much true. Just one in 10 purchases are made with cash, and card is the most common form of payment, followed by the Swedish mobile payment system Swish, launched by six banks in 2012 and now ubiquitous.

Keir Starmer is likely to spend much of today preparing for the online summit of European leaders who might be part of the -coalition of the willing- prepared to help contribute to Ukraine’s defence in the event of a peace deal. But Russia’s response to the US/Ukraine ceasefire plan has not been promising, as Jakub Krupa on his Europe live blog, where he is covering all today’s developments in this story. Domestically, it is not much easier for the PM either. This morning we learned that the economy shrank in January. Julia Kollewe is covering all this in detail on the business live blog. During the cabinet meeting, ministers voiced their frustration that such difficult welfare cuts are coming so soon after the raid on the aid budget, according to the people. They said how difficult the cuts would be to sell to the Labour parliamentary party. One person said some ministers are on resignation watch, depending on the shape of the final package. A Labour lawmaker said Anneliese Dodds — who quit as development minister after the aid cut — won’t be the last to leave government as politicians are asked to stomach difficult cuts. A third person noted that Labour was planning a benefit cut that even George Osborne, the architect of the most recent phase of Conservative austerity, didn’t make. We will set out our plans for welfare reform, but it is absolutely clear that the current system is not working for anyone. It is not working for people who need support, it’s not working to get people into work so that more people can fulfil their potential, and it’s not working for the taxpayer when the bill for welfare is going up by billions of pounds in the next few years.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/14/rachel-reeves-welfare-disability-cuts-labour-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live-news	2025-03-14T02:23:08-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c6f8f0ab8b9a78185e85888c16cdb396646ffb2/0_0_1911_1147/master/1911.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cb5e24a64ff4a10ab1fa7499d8e4eb79

Schumer decision to vote for Republican funding bill a ‘huge slap in the face’, says AOC - US politics live	Senate working to avert partial government shutdown before midnight deadline Here’s a little more on the comments to reporters by congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. According to a post on X by Kadia Goba, political reporter at Semafor, Ocasio-Cortez said: There are members of Congress who have won Trump held districts in some of the most difficult territories in the United States; who walked the plank and took innumerable risks in order to defend the American people … just to see some Senate Democrats even consider acquiescing to Elon Musk. I think it is a huge slap in the face, and I think that there’s a wide sense of betrayal.- Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, said that he will vote to allow the deeply partisan Republican spending bill become law because a government shutdown would do more harm. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told reporters that Senator Chuck Schumer’s statement was -a huge slap in the face, and I think that there’s a wide sense of betrayal.- Stocks plunged again after Trump’s threat to impose a 200% tariff -on all wines, Champagnes, and alcoholic products- from European Union countries if the trading bloc makes good on its threat to retaliate for steel and aluminum tariffs announced by the US president by adding a 50% tariff on American products, including Kentucky bourbon. In a letter sent to the president of Columbia University and the co-chairs of its board of trustees on Thursday, the Trump administration’s antisemitism taskforce demanded nine specific changes to university policies and structures before negotiations over federal funding would begin. Columbia announced the same day it received the letter that it had complied with item one on the list of demands: expelling and suspending pro-Palestinian student protesters who occupied a campus building last year or took part in a Gaza Solidarity encampment. Representative Raúl Grijalva died after a long battle with cancer, his office announced on Thursday. His seat will remain vacant until at least September. In 1996 a federal judge found the legal provision now being used to target Mahmoud Khalil unconstitutional. She was Donald Trump’s sister.

Labour’s manifesto promise to remove members of the House of Lords who vote in parliament’s second chamber by birthright was the most straightforward change.

How many ministers does it take to deliver a speech on efficiency savings? | John Crace	Keir Starmer says he loves civil servants so much he is abolishing NHS England to give them more time to do other things Call it Project Chainsaw. It usually takes a government a couple of years or so to blame the government for stopping it from achieving what it wants to do. Keir Starmer has got there in eight months. There again, most governments have a clear plan when they get into office, so maybe it takes them longer to notice. With a few honourable exceptions, Labour never had that vision – all their focus had been on winning the election – so maybe without the distraction of having a plan that was being blocked, it took them less time to blame the government for being the problem. Here things took a further turn to the meta. How many people does it take to deliver a speech on cutting the size of the state and making efficiency savings? There appears to be no upper limit. Because it felt as if we had been drip fed most of the speech over the previous four days. So much so that for much of its duration it felt as if you already knew it word for word. Ministers need to be careful what they ask for when they talk of making efficiencies.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/13/how-many-ministers-does-it-take-to-deliver-a-speech-on-efficiency-savings-nhs-england	2025-03-13T09:59:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be83907e174baff15664b236152a6dfe98aa6852/0_347_5237_3144/master/5237.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=de92b6752346159ae28e41260e64ea45

US arrests more immigrants in February 2025 than any month in last seven years	Guardian data analysis shows administration transformed immigration enforcement in only a few weeks US immigration enforcement officials arrested more people in the first 22 days of February 2025 than in any month over the last seven years, according to a Guardian review of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data. The Guardian review, which analyzed DHS data from the first month of Donald Trump’s presidency, in addition to interviews with immigration lawyers, advocates and former Ice officials, show how the administration has transformed immigration enforcement in the US within just a few weeks.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/13/us-immigration-arrests-february-2025	2025-03-13T04:00:03-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e0a012ed46dace7d3624514a5faf534694a15e1/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=796fa16475acea0efcf6bf30de0dd808
Trump threatens further tariffs as EU, Canada retaliate for those already in place – US politics live	Trump said he would impose additional penalties if the EU follows through with its plan to enact counter tariffs on some US goods next month The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, is expected in the coming weeks to start a sweeping overhaul of the judge advocate general’s corps as part of an effort to make the US military less restricted by the laws of armed conflict, according to two people familiar with the matter. The changes are poised to have implications across the military, as Hegseth’s office considers changes to the interpretation of the US rules of engagement on the battlefield to the way that charges are brought under the military justice system. China on Thursday called for -dialogue- with Washington to resolve spiralling trade tensions that have seen the world’s two largest economies impose a slew of tariffs on each other’s imports. -China has always advocated that China and the United States should adopt a positive and cooperative attitude towards differences and controversies in economic and trade fields,- commerce ministry spokesperson He Yongqian told a weekly news conference. US secretary of state Marco Rubio has arrived in Canada for two days of talks with the top diplomats of the G7. Rubio will probably be hearing a litany of complaints about Trump’s decisions from countries in the G7 – notably host Canada, to which Trump has been most antagonistic with persistent talk of it becoming the 51st US state, additional tariffs and repeated insults against its leadership. Donald Trump has accused Ireland of stealing the US pharmaceutical industry and the tax revenue that should have been paid to the US treasury, in a blow to the Irish premier, Micheál Martin, who had hoped to emerge unscathed from a visit to the White House marking St Patrick’s Day. The US president showed grudging respect for Martin, alternately ribbing and complimenting him, while also launching several broadsides against the EU. Chuck Schumer, leader of the Senate’s Democratic minority, said that Democrats will not provide the necessary votes to adopt a partisan funding bill passed by House Republicans, which includes cuts to vital services and programmes. To avoid a shutdown on Friday, Schumer said, the Senate should pass a temporary measure and then negotiate a longer-term measure that can garner bipartisan support. Rather than take Schumer up on his offer to negotiate, Republicans quickly rolled out a social-media strategy to blame him for shutting down the government by not accepting the Republican effort to ram through the partisan funding bill. US district judge Tanya Chutkan granted a request by 14 state attorneys general for discovery in a suit against Elon Musk and his so-called -department of government efficiency- (Doge) service to uncover the -parameters of Doge’s and Musk’s authority-, and the identities of Doge personnel. The federal judge Beryl Howell has blocked an executive order that Donald Trump signed last week directing agencies to terminate contracts and no longer interact with Perkins Coie, a law firm that worked with Democrats during the 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns. The Trump administration quietly cleared all remaining migrants from the American military base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba this week. The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, defended the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the United States who took part in student protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza, by claiming, without evidence, that the Columbia graduate student was -a big supporter of Hamas-. As his administration moves to gut the Department of Education, Trump levied an attack on employees at federal agency, accusing them of being lazy.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/mar/13/donald-trump-tariffs-canada-eu-us-politics-latest-news-updates	2025-03-13T03:09:19-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dc6c92202b9cf2dc4ed22e97ef068360e0e0a6e/896_228_5464_3280/master/5464.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2e82d09643b4b0f63587caf2ca6a60a5

Keir Starmer to outline reforms of ‘overcautious, flabby state’ in civil service speech – UK politics live	PM will give a speech shortly, followed by a Q&amp;A with the media Good morning. All prime ministers, sooner or later, get frustrated when they realise that the central government machine isn’t as effective as they would like. They arrive thinking that if they tell their officials to do something, it will happen, and they find out that it’s not that simple. When talking about this, they normally combine their criticism of the system with comments about how the individual civil servants with whom they work personally are excellent. Keir Starmer has arrived at this stage more quickly than some of his predecessors and this week there have been a series of announcements about shaking up Whitehall. Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister, has said measures will be taken to ease out officials who are under-performing. On Tuesday Starmer told cabinet that the government should be taking more responsibility for decisions, and not outsourcing them to regulators. And today Starmer is going to say that the state has become -bigger, but weaker-. We need to go further and faster on security and renewal. In such uncertain times, people want a state that will take care of the big questions, not a bigger state that asks more from them. We need to be operating at maximum efficiency and strength. I believe in the power of the state. I’m not interested in ideological arguments about whether it should be bigger or smaller. I simply want it to work. I saw the state at its best in our response to the riots last summer. It was dynamic, strong and urgent. But for the most part, that’s not the state that most people will recognise. I heard from a family business owner in Wales that builds homes for first-time buyers. During the consultation delays and the lengthy planning application, the cost of resources went up. The regulations held him back for so long that he lost the site. Business unable to grow because of red tape. Families unable to buy because an overcautious flabby state got in the way. No person’s substantive time should be spent on a task where digital or AI can do it better, quicker and to the same high quality and standard.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/13/keir-starmer-speech-civil-service-ai-labour-benefit-cuts-conservatives-uk-politics-latest-news	2025-03-13T02:39:26-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fdf818ca250b7e9ae0fa630f6bbd772d755d79b/0_742_2527_1516/master/2527.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=14e093fa70cedc2214b2a4846f72d7ce
Chris Minns and NSW police minister should face inquiry over ‘fake terrorism plot’ and antisemitic attacks, critics say	Questions raised over whether premier and Yasmin Catley misled parliament over Dural caravan plot as Labor rushed through hate speech and places of worship laws There are mounting calls for an inquiry into whether the New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, and his police minister misled MPs and the public before controversial hate speech and religious worship bills were rushed through state parliament. In February, NSW Labor passed a suite of reforms aimed at curbing antisemitism amid a spate of arson and graffiti attacks which culminated with an explosives-laden caravan being found on Sydney’s outskirts. The government did not directly point to the caravan plot as the reason for the bill.

Ukraine war live: Russian operation in Kursk is in final stage, Kremlin claims, as US negotiators head to Moscow	Russian operation to expel Ukrainian forces in final stage, claims Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, following visit to region by President Vladimir Putin The news comes as US president Donald Trump said on Wednesday that negotiators were headed to Russia -right now- for talks on a possible ceasefire with Ukraine, after Kyiv agreed to a 30-day truce. Ukraine’s army commander-in-chief, Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, suggested his troops were pulling back to minimise losses in Kursk. -In the most difficult situation, my priority has been and remains saving the lives of Ukrainian soldiers. To this end, the units of the defence forces, if necessary, manoeuvre to more favourable positions,- Syrski posted online, in terms typically used to describe a withdrawal. Syrskyi said the Russian military was suffering huge personnel and equipment losses while trying to achieve -political gains- by attempting to oust Ukrainian troops. Sudzha is the largest settlement that Ukraine seized in Kursk, and the Ukraine-based Deep State open-source mapping project showed earlier on Wednesday that Kyiv was no longer in full control of it. -The enemy is using assault units of airborne troops and special operations forces to break through our defences, oust our troops out of the Kursk region and move fighting to the territory of Sumy and Kharkiv regions,- Syrskyi said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Kyiv was doing -as much as possible- to protect its soldiers. -The Russians are clearly trying to put maximum pressure on our troops, and our military command is doing what it has to do,- the Ukrainian president told a press conference in Kyiv. -We are preserving the lives of our soldiers as much as possible.- Donald Trump suggested he could target Russia financially as Ukraine’s president urged him to take strong steps if Moscow failed to support a 30-day ceasefire agreed between Ukrainian and US delegations meeting in Saudi Arabia. Washington, Kyiv and Europe are waiting for Moscow’s response to the proposal, and US envoys are expected to hold talks with Putin by the end of the week. The Kremlin has not publicly said whether or not it supports an immediate ceasefire. If Putin refuses, Trump said he could -do things financially that would be very bad for Russia-. Zelenskyy said he expected strong measures from the Washington if Russia rejected the ceasefire proposal. -I understand that we can count on strong steps. I don’t know the details yet but we are talking about sanctions [against Russia] and strengthening Ukraine.- The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Washington wanted Moscow’s agreement with no strings attached. -That’s what we want to know – if they’re prepared to do it unconditionally,- Rubio said on a plane heading to a G7 meeting in Canada. -If the response is yes, then we know we’ve made real progress, and there’s a real chance of peace. If their response is no, it would be highly unfortunate, and it’ll make their intentions clear.- The US threats came as the French defence minister, Sébastien Lecornu, told a press conference in Paris that a ceasefire announcement could come as soon as Thursday and that Europe would have to be prepared to help enforce it. Defence ministers from Europe’s five leading military powers – the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland and France – met in the French capital on Wednesday to discuss the formation of a -reassurance force- that would guarantee peace in Ukraine if a settlement was agreed. Lecornu said they were -hoping to see a ceasefire tomorrow- and that 15 countries were willing to contribute to a force of up to 30,000 personnel that would permanently secure Ukraine’s airports, ports and infrastructure.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/mar/13/ukraine-war-live-blog-updates-ceasefire-russia-trump-zelenskyy-putin-updates	2025-03-12T22:37:30-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b5f59b7c56cfe77110c0a5be4b7087a1dd3ee4/0_0_3127_1877/master/3127.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8644276188efc29bffabc48e89411a86

Australia news live: Leonardo DiCaprio speaks up for WA forest; Wong warns Russia against ‘bullying behaviour’	Actor posts his opposition to a bauxite mine that he says threatens rare bettongs. Follow today’s news live Leonardo DiCaprio has drawn the world’s attention to the government’s decision to allow the mining company South32 to clear native forest in WA’s jarrah forests for bauxite mining. The actor claimed the operation at Boddington could threaten the critically endangered woylie (or brush-tailed bettong) and that the government was prioritising -mining development over environmental protection-. The mining company @south_32 is set to clear 9,600 acres of this old growth forest, which is home to threatened species like the Critically Endangered Woylie. This operation will destroy critical habitat for over 8,000 species, 80% of which are found nowhere else on Earth. While native forest logging was banned in Western Australia in 2024, clearance of native forests for mining is still allowed due to separate government policies that prioritize mining development over environmental protection. I don’t think Australians respond very well to that kind of bullying behaviour from anybody, and certainly not from Russia ... we would consider any request, and that is the sensible thing to do. We have an interest in the UN Charter not being undermined by a permanent member of the security council. These are rules which keep us all safe, and we have to continue to work to defend them. We continue to advocate, alongside so many others in the international community and in Europe for a just and enduring peace, a fair resolve for Ukraine.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/mar/13/australia-news-live-energy-prices-cost-of-living-tariffs-steel-aluminium-election-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-ntwnfb	2025-03-12T12:39:19-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ee0ae7b80e5e5e0a0390868602cb5715971cc6f/0_198_4090_2453/master/4090.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=949f791ac8c3d8834af2f2710e82d818

The fruit of flattery is tariffs, but Trump-wrangler Starmer stays circumspect | John Crace	Trying to find meaning in the meaningless, Labour finds itself in a trade war. At least Reform are still giving comic relief Well, that went well, didn’t it? Weeks of finding ever more ingenious ways to flatter the US president. Extolling the brilliance of Donald Trump being able to tie his own shoelaces. -That’s incredible, Mr President. No one has ever managed to do that so beautifully.- No chance for flattery has been passed up. It is now the sign of the highest IQ not to be able to speak in joined-up sentences. To change your mind at a moment’s notice. Yet at all times, Keir Starmer has remained a paragon of obsequiousness. Not a word out of place. And what do we get for it? The occasional hint of recognition from the Donald. Which we cling to. Attempting to find meaning in something essentially meaningless. Something that came with little thought. And now we also are landed with 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium. A reward for obeisance. That’s the thing with Trump. He gets angry if he’s disrespected but has nothing but contempt for those who humour him.

Cautious Zelenskyy keeps cards close to his chest as Ukraine ceasefire proposed	Ukrainian president would not be drawn on details of proposed deal and also steered clear of criticising Trump at press briefing As journalists filtered out of the presidential administration in central Kyiv on Wednesday afternoon after a 30-minute press conference with president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the general consensus was that he had not said anything that would immediately make for a dramatic headline. That, it seems, was the point. Eager to show the White House that Ukraine is onboard for negotiations and not an obstacle to Donald Trump’s desire to bring peace, Zelenskyy seems to be trying to erase the memories of the nightmare meeting in the White House two weeks ago.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/12/cautious-zelenskyy-keeps-cards-close-to-his-chest-as-ukraine-ceasefire-proposed	2025-03-12T09:28:03-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d5e2652e86f673370550c6a402570400468ed3b/0_288_7626_4576/master/7626.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40c2739e3d91bcb7d3d747833d562be0

Rodrigo Duterte’s arrest could be telling blow in the Philippines’ dynastic feud	Former president was surrendered to The Hague amid a row between his family and that of the current president Few expected things to move so quickly. Supporters of the Philippines’ former president Rodrigo Duterte barely had time to protest before he was jetted off to The Hague to face charges of crimes against humanity in relation to his country’s so-called -war on drugs-. According to activists, this bloody crackdown has seen as many as 30,000 people killed since 2016. The charges brought against the former leader are the culmination of years of work by activists, lawyers and victims, who documented abuses committed under his government, often at great personal risk. But Duterte arguably would not have been surrendered to The Hague if it weren’t for his family’s dramatic feud with that of Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the current president.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/12/rodrigo-dutertes-arrest-could-be-telling-blow-in-the-philippines-dynastic-feud	2025-03-12T09:04:04-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90deae29fe3edb782e35b15446bbe2cf4dcb3c3c/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ced7bd8d36b0c070320eebf3d7978e6c

Sydney writers’ festival 2025: tallying authors’ views on Israel-Gaza ‘tokenistic and unfortunate’, organisers say	After the shock resignation of the festival’s chair, the Sydney writers’ festival unveils its starry 2025 program in ‘an incredibly polarised environment’ Over the past two years, programming a writers’ festival has become one of the most politically fraught undertakings in the Australian cultural sphere. Both Sydney and Melbourne writers’ festivals have seen board members resign over programming decisions, while Adelaide and Perth have fended off calls for the de-platforming of speakers on both sides of the Israel-Gaza conflict. Literary events are traditionally lauded for their -restraint, reason and tolerance in the face of opposing views- – but writers’ festivals are now issuing safety tips and employing security as they navigate -the frontier between social media’s echo chambers of outrage and the traditional public square’s conventions-, the University of Melbourne journalism academic Denis Muller observed in the Conversation last year, after the resignation of the Melbourne writers’ festival’s deputy chair, Leslie Reti.

Art of a deal: how UK and France led dogged effort to repair US-Ukraine ties – for now	Over 11 days of breakneck diplomacy, Kyiv was convinced of need to pacify Trump, but reset may be all too brief The 11 days of whiplash-inducing diplomacy British and French officials endured to repair shattered relations between Washington and Kyiv, and for the first time put Donald Trump’s trust in Vladimir Putin to the test, could go down as one of the great feats of diplomatic escapology. The dogged fence-mending may yet unravel as multiple hurdles remain, principally the outstanding question of Ukraine’s security guarantees, but for the first time, in the words of Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, the ball is in Russia’s court. Putin, by instinct cautious, has preferred watching from the sidelines, suppressing his delight as Trump denounced Volodymyr Zelenskyy to his face in the White House and wreaked subsequent vengeance by stopping all military aid and then pulling some US intelligence.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/12/uk-france-repair-us-ukraine-ties-trump-zelenskyy-russia-putin	2025-03-12T04:53:37-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8caf163bac8ef5ddb23a373a230bf15583296700/474_145_4259_2555/master/4259.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=94c42303b1564d6a05d80ad445aa07f8

DoJ official says she was fired after refusing to restore Mel Gibson’s gun rights	Elizabeth Oyer claims justice department senior ‘bullied’ her due to Trump’s relationship with actor sentenced for domestic violence in 2011 The pardon attorney of the US justice department was recently fired after refusing to recommend that Mel Gibson be allowed to own guns again, a right denied since the actor, director and prominent ally of Donald Trump was sentenced to probation for domestic violence in 2011, the New York Times reported.

She told the Times she had been working on a project to restore gun ownership rights to some people convicted of crimes and misdemeanors, a power held by the justice department but not often used.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/11/doj-official-fired-mel-gibson-gun	2025-03-11T07:13:57-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48b8c37aa76e8e3ea25420e1d1b054a913002fc7/0_128_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=11742932f69780cdada5904687729920

He was trying to move on with his life.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/11/hassan-diab-canada-professor-convicted-elon-musk	2025-03-11T03:00:37-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d755bb7714aff8de9b2d3a73f98de4d02dd9e029/0_0_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5d3dc1ada4acf439621494faa58bd21f

Minister rejects claim that planning reforms designed to penalise farmers – UK politics live	Housing minister defends reforms in planning bill ahead of publication saying they are not aimed at farmers Good morning. The government’s planning and infrastructure bill is being published later today, and in an article for the Times Angela Rayner, the deputy PM and housing secretary, claims it will be -a major step forward in getting Britain building again-. The measures in the legislation have already been well publicised and Rayner sums them up like this. A new road for Norwich was set to make life easier for 44,000 homeowners, speeding up journeys to East Anglia’s biggest hospital and creating 33,000 new jobs. But it was delayed by spurious legal challenges for two years until the case was dismissed as having no logical basis. This government gave it the green light last week. The many organisations that must be consulted in the planning process are also putting up unnecessary obstacles. A row over balls hit from a cricket club has delayed 139 new flats in Bradford. The wait for a development consent order increased by 65 per cent between 2012 and 2021. It now takes around four years to get a decision on major infrastructure. We have been supportive of many of the Government’s changes to planning policy, but giving councils more power to reduce the value of land is a step too far, especially in the context of such a challenging outlook for farmers and the inheritance tax fiasco. This is not about people blocking development, it’s about the state paying the market price for land. We need more houses and more economic development, but not at the cost of basic principles. We are obviously and very clearly not setting out to target agricultural land. The land use framework we’re consulting on currently will ensure that prime agricultural land is protected, and food security is protected. I see this power being used in particular, to much greater effect – and that’s where I want to see it come forward – specifically in urban areas, on previously developed brownfield land where regeneration projects with a significant public interest can be unlocked more easily.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/11/angela-rayner-planning-reform-farmers-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live	2025-03-11T02:41:11-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8a38d1b73f4893a5302601fa0b83a1031369f41/0_67_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f35ecbaefa67bf2ea99c99743e16456c

With global instability rising, it’s never been more important to show a united front with our Commonwealth friends – and to stand together against Trump senselessly turning the screws on his allies, whether that’s Canada, the UK or Europe. Responding to the trade war along the North American border, our Prime Minister must stand in solidarity against Trump’s bullying and visit Ottawa in a joint show of strength. Starmer must be clear that Trump’s threats against Commonwealth nations’ sovereignty are unacceptable.

After tossing aside decades of alignment with Europe against Russian aggression, the US president suspended military assistance and intelligence to Kyiv and said on Friday he finds it -easier- to work with Russia than Ukraine.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/09/trump-ukraine-russia-explainer	2025-03-09T01:00:48-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/424ac903f8735f52d4cb26d0b0d06bb4ca0d2c75/0_150_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3f20cfbc13ae67ca7d9cca3b128c5f13
Ukraine war live: Zelenskyy says Ukraine ‘fully committed’ to talks ahead of US meeting in Saudi Arabia	Ukrainian president backs negotiations despite Trump’s comments while calling for more sanctions on Russia after deadly missile attack Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine is -fully committed- to having a constructive dialogue with US representatives in Saudi Arabia next week, even as Donald Trump said he found it -easier- to deal with Russia than with Ukraine in efforts to end the war. -Realistic proposals are on the table. The key is to move quickly and effectively,- the Ukrainian president said on X ahead of his trip to Saudi Arabia next week. Three people were killed and seven others injured in a drone attack early on Saturday in the city of Bogodukhiv, the military head of the eastern Kharkiv region, Oleg Synegubov, said. Russia fired two missiles and 145 drones at Bogodukhiv, Ukraine’s air force said. The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said on Saturday that appeasement towards Russia was leading to more tragedy in Ukraine. -This is what happens when someone appeases barbarians,- Tusk wrote on X. -More bombs, more aggression, more victims. Another tragic night in Ukraine.- The Russian defence ministry announced the recapture of Viktorovka, Nikolayevka and Staraya Sorochina in its Kursk region. According to DeepState, an online military tracker linked to the Ukrainian army, the Russian move followed a -breach- in Ukrainian defence lines near the town of Sudzha, which is under Kyiv’s control. An army source interviewed by Ukrainska Pravda newspaper said that the Ukrainian soldiers were trying to -stabilise the situation- but the Russian troops had -completely cut off the supply lines-. Moscow’s defence ministry on Saturday said its air defence systems had destroyed 31 Ukrainian drones over the previous night. A Ukrainian drone attack also targeted Russia’s Kirishi oil refinery and falling debris caused damage to a reservoir, the governor of the north-western Leningrad region, Aleksandr Drozdenko, said. A civilian was injured by a drone attack in Belgorod district near the Ukraine border, the local governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, wrote on Telegram. Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said his country would consider taking part in a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine. The Australian leader spoke on Saturday with his UK counterpart, Keir Starmer, who has joined France in trying to rally a -coalition of the willing- to protect any ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war. -Both of our nations are very clear about our support for Ukraine, and it of course is too early – you can’t have peacekeeping forces without having peace,- Albanese told a news conference. -I certainly have said very clearly, publicly, repeatedly, that we would give consideration to participating in any peacekeeping mission in the Ukraine.- Australia will send a senior representative to a chiefs of defence meeting in Paris on Tuesday to discuss future backing for Ukraine, Albanese said.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/mar/09/ukraine-war-live-volodymyr-zelenskyy-us-trump-putin-saudi-arabia-talks-news	2025-03-09T00:42:34-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95d1b3526ffefd6b39f120ebb23895c09fcca33c/752_552_5248_3149/master/5248.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ae8bb59cedf1a28e163596b052a9134f

Covid, five years on: UK ‘still not ready to protect the population’	Scientific triumphs were made in the battle against the pandemic, but the memories and lessons are already in danger of being lost On 9 March 2020, Martin Landray was studying the likely impact of Covid-19 as it started to sweep Britain. What was needed, he realised, was a method for pinpointing cheap, effective drugs that might limit the impact of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that was filling UK hospitals with ­dangerously ill patients. Within 10 days, Landray – working with Oxford University colleague Peter Horby – had set up Recovery, a drug-testing programme that involved thousands of doctors and nurses working with tens of ­thousands of Covid-19 patients in UK hospitals.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/09/covid-five-years-on-uk-still-not-ready-to-protect-the-population	2025-03-08T22:00:44-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/362748b882f56f3de141f115fc20f2052b747926/0_97_6013_3609/master/6013.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6a9f33ec35cbedc7263a2164145e2cc5

The 99-page bill would provide a slight boost to defense programs while trimming non-defense programs below 2024 budget year levels.

Ukraine war live: 11 killed in Donetsk as Russia steps up attacks after Trump defends Putin	High-rise apartment blocks in centre of Dobropillia town hit in attack a day after US suspended intelligence sharing with Kyiv Welcome to our live coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. Here’s a snapshot of the latest to bring you up to speed. At least 11 people were killed and 30 wounded in Russian strikes on eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region late on Friday, the country’s emergency service said on Saturday, raising the earlier death toll of four. Russia carried out huge ballistic missile and drone strikes across Ukraine a day after the US stopped sharing intelligence with Kyiv which had previously given advance warnings of attacks. The strikes came early on Friday as a Ukrainian delegation prepared to meet with US counterparts in Saudi Arabia next week for talks about a possible end to the war, report Luke Harding and Dan Sabbagh. In a post on Truth Social, Donald Trump appeared to criticise Russia’s latest bombardment. The US president posted: -Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely ‘pounding’ Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED.- Separately, Trump said after the strikes that Vladimir Putin was -doing what anybody would do-. -I think he wants to get it [the war] stopped and settled and I think he’s hitting them harder than he’s been hitting them and I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now,- he told reporters in the White House. Trump also said he found it -easier- to deal with Russia than with Ukraine in efforts to end the war and that he trusted Putin, the Russian president. -I believe him,- Trump said. -I’m finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine and they don’t have the cards. It may be easier dealing with Russia.- Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded to Russia’s strikes by calling for a truce covering air and sea. -The first steps to establishing real peace should be forcing the sole source of this war, Russia, to stop such attacks,- the Ukrainian president said on Telegram. Moscow has rejected the idea of a temporary truce, which has also been proposed by Britain and France. US aerospace company Maxar Technologies disabled Ukraine’s access to its satellite images after a request from the Trump administration. Maxar said it had contracts with the US government and dozens of allied and partner nations and -each customer makes their own decisions on how they use and share that data-. Zelenskyy’s approval rating in Ukraine has risen by 10 percentage points since his White House spat with Trump, a survey by a leading Ukrainian pollster showed on Friday. The poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology – conducted from 14 February to 4 March – found 67% of respondents trusted Zelenskyy in March, up from 57% a month earlier. Iran’s foreign ministry denied accusations by Emmanuel Macron that Tehran had supplied equipment to Russia for use in the Ukraine war, calling the French president’s remarks -baseless and false-.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/mar/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-putin-trump-zelenskyy-donetsk-latest-news-updates	2025-03-07T23:24:21-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95c56436f78f6dc030eeff0bf69145ba3fa1ebc6/0_232_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d9980de2f7c5171d35c786b7e6d5c522

The Ukraine crisis has accelerated a reset of UK-EU relations – but will it last?	Trump’s abandonment of Ukraine has led even Farage to praise Starmer’s lead role in European diplomacy Barely a day passes, it seems, without Keir Starmer talking to another European leader or preparing for a continental summit.

One thing is certain: the optics of engagement have changed. Starmer never shared Boris Johnson’s almost active pride in stoking a row with Brussels, but particularly before the election his advisers were wary of reminding voters about his past as a diehard remainer.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/07/ukraine-crisis-reset-uk-eu-relations-diplomacy-trump	2025-03-07T08:00:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13816260df258c8912e77529ffe9b48154e5091e/501_616_3819_2291/master/3819.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=977a9460e7a8055241762f28eb14c7ad

More than a million salmon dumped after ‘unprecedented’ mass mortality at Tasmanian fish farms	Bob Brown Foundation’s drone footage appears to show farm workers pumping live salmon into a tub carrying dead fish and then sealing it At least 1 million salmon died at Tasmanian fish farms and were dumped at landfill sites and rendering plants in February in what authorities and the industry described as an -unprecedented- mass death triggered by a bacterium outbreak. The revelation that waste facilities in Tasmania’s south received more than 5,500 tonnes of dead salmon last month – equivalent to about 1.07 million full-grown Atlantic salmon, or 8% of total annual production in the state – followed weeks of reports of fatty chunks of fish washing up on beaches in the Huon Valley and on Bruny Island.

China vows action over ‘arbitrary’ tariffs as Trump pauses measures against Canada and Mexico – US politics live	Foreign minister calls measures ‘two-faced acts’ Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the coming hours. We start with news that the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said China will continue to retaliate against the United States’ -arbitrary tariffs- despite pausing similar action against Canada and Mexico. Trump told his cabinet secretaries that they are in charge of hiring and firings at their agencies, not Elon Musk. The House has voted to censure Democratic congressman Al Green for disrupting Trump’s address to this week’s joint session of Congress. The motion was approved with 224 votes in favor and 198 opposed, with 10 Democrats in support. In an escalation of his pressure campaign, Trump said the US will not fight for Nato allies who don’t spend enough on their own defense. US district judge Beryl Howell ruled on Thursday that Donald Trump’s firing of a Democratic member of the National Labor Relations Board was illegal and ordered that she be reinstated to her post. Axios reports that the state department is hunting for evidence that foreign students who express support for Palestinians under Israeli occupation while studying in the US are -pro-Hamas-, and can have their visas revoked, based on an AI review of their social media accounts. Trump thanked a reporter for the partisan outlet Breitbart for asking him a friendly question in the Oval Office, which teed him up to attack Democrats. The White House excluded non-partisan reporters from Reuters and the Associated Press to make room for Breitbart and One America News, two pro-Trump outlets. Trump signed an executive order on Thursday evening to establish a -strategic bitcoin reserve-, a day before meeting with executives from the cryptocurrency industry at the White House. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who reportedly endured a profanity-laced tirade from Trump, was asked about his foreign minister’s comment that dealing with the US was now -a psychodrama-. -How would you characterize it?- a reporter asked. -Thursday-, Trudeau replied.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/mar/07/donald-trump-tariffs-china-canada-mexico-us-politics-live-news	2025-03-07T02:57:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0de3ed9765049cf579b50c80481a6572917893d2/0_251_5719_3432/master/5719.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a32b249129293bd6db6db0d5df94fec9

Taiwan hails ‘historic’ TSMC deal with US, but will it lose the ‘silicon shield’ protecting it from China?	The producer of the world’s most advanced chip technology is investing on US soil but some fear that could reduce the leverage Taiwan holds to ensure its future security TSMC’s chief executive, CC Wei, smiled broadly as he stood next to Donald Trump in the White House on Monday, announcing what he said was the biggest foreign direct investment on US soil in history. His company – the producer of most of the world’s most advanced semiconductors – would boost its existing $65bn US presence by a whopping $100bn. For TSMC the deal meant they would avoid massive tariffs Trump had flagged for the global chip industry.

Inside the Islamic State prisons the west is trying to forget – podcast	Michael Safi travelled to north-east Syria to speak to IS foreign fighters imprisoned there. And discovered that a change in the US administration, and USAid funding cuts, means there is a growing fear of prison breaks A few weeks ago, Michael Safi travelled to north-east Syria, an area controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. Here, suspected foreign fighters for Islamic State – including those from Britain – have for years been imprisoned without charge and with no idea of when they would be released. Few prisoners in the camp say they are IS members. Michael and fellow journalist, Will Christou, spoke to a former British surgeon from Leicester who told a surprising story of being ‘tricked’ into crossing into Syria from Turkey. They also met an Australian prisoner, who admitted to being an IS member, and whose family for years did not know his whereabouts.	https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/mar/07/inside-the-islamic-state-prisons-the-west-is-trying-to-forget-podcast	2025-03-06T19:00:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5db91da0e1ae59a151f1403ae387bb12d777e1a4/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=31c5d93a0e37f651a593d93fd0f18fc8

Key court hearing as Alabama threatens prosecutions over abortion support	Experts say victory for state could give green light for other states to attack those who help women travel for procedure A bellwether test of states’ ability to prosecute people over abortions that take place across state lines will hold a critical hearing on Wednesday, when Alabama abortion rights supporters will square off against the state attorney general over his threats to prosecute groups that help women travel for the procedure. In the months after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, clearing the way for Alabama to ban virtually all abortions, Alabama attorney general Steve Marshall repeatedly suggested that abortion rights activists who help people go out of state for abortions could be charged as participants in an illegal conspiracy. The Yellowhammer Fund, an abortion fund that helped people pay for the procedure, and the West Alabama Women’s Center, a former abortion clinic that pivoted to providing services like miscarriage management, joined with other abortion rights advocates to sue Marshall over his comments.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/05/alabama-court-hearing-abortion	2025-03-05T03:00:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dea029afeebd9d9beb743179befb1a8c9adc884/0_179_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d18df9255f0a2fda5fade74b04ce1aed

Minister says welfare budget ‘unsustainable’ amid reports Reeves has earmarked billions in cuts – UK politics live	Justice secretary said there is a ‘moral case’ for getting people into work when asked about the chancellor’s reported plans Good morning. Three weeks today Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, will present her spring statement. Originally this was not meant to involve budget-scale changes for plans to tax or spending (Reeves says she is only going to have one proper budget a year, in the autumn, to ensure stability), but changes to the country’s economic situation mean this statement is going to be more consequential than originally intended and this morning the BBC is running a story that looks like classic Treasury pitch rolling. The markets don’t like surprises and, while exact details of budget announcements are kept secret until the chancellor speaks to MPs, the Treasury invests a lot of effort in ensuring that people have a rough idea of what’s coming. According to a report by the BBC’s economics editor Faisal Islam, Reeves is going to announce cuts, worth several billions pounds, particularly affecting welfare. He says: The Treasury will put the proposed cuts to the government’s official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), on Wednesday amid expectations the chancellor’s financial buffer has been wiped out. Sources said -the world has changed- since Rachel Reeves’s Budget last October, when the OBR indicated she had £9.9bn available to spend against her self-imposed borrowing rules. Clearly the world has changed a lot since the autumn Budget. People are watching that change happen before their eyes. The Office for Budget Responsibility will reflect that changing world in its forecasts later this month and a changing world will be a core feature of the chancellor’s response later this month. This is the Labour party. The clue is in the name. We believe in work. We know that there are many people who are currently receiving state support for being out of work who want to be in work. We know that we have too many of our young people currently out of work, not in education, employment or training. It is right that a Labour government strains every sinew to make sure that the support is available to prevent people from leaving the labour market or, if they have left the labour market, to help them get back. We’ve seen a huge rise in that welfare budget. We know that there are millions of people who are out of work in our country who want to be in work. It is absolutely morally the right thing to do to support people, to make sure either they don’t leave the labour market, or if they have, they’re supported to get back into it.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/05/rachel-reeves-welfare-budget-spring-statement-pmqs-labour-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-news-uk-politics-live	2025-03-05T01:23:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ebe1389c6c5f4b6686a58a386eddef45b65dc9b/0_97_4127_2477/master/4127.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=890ae1635d150bf8d4ffe531dfe49d93
Arab leaders endorse Gaza rebuild scheme as alternative to Trump’s plan to ‘take over’ region – Middle East crisis live	Egyptian-devised $53bn proposal follows outrage at US president’s suggestion to force Palestinians to relocate from territory A slow convoy of a dozen ambulances and buses brought 25 wounded and sick Palestinian children from Gaza and across Israel on Tuesday, past the heavily armed forces that bombarded the territory for 15 months, and that may be about to start again.

Wednesday briefing: The view from ​Russia as ​Trump upends the world order	In today’s newsletter: Pjotr Sauer explains Russia’s response to the new Trump administration following a fraught week in global relations Good morning. In his address to Congress last night, Donald Trump recited a letter from Volodymyr Zelenskyy offering to return to the negotiating table – and warmly welcomed the tone of discussions his administration has held with Russia. -We’ve received strong signals that they are ready for peace,- he said. -Wouldn’t that be beautiful?- That was not the first sign of Trump’s faith in Vladimir Putin’s promises – but it served to underline what is surely the most radical US foreign policy shift in a generation. Whether parroting Kremlin talking points on Zelenskyy’s democratic credentials, making false claims that Ukraine started the war or cutting off vital military aid to Kyiv, the US president has created a dynamic that would have scarcely been believable six months ago. Killed women count | Nearly one in 10 of all women who died at the hands of men in the UK over the past 15 years were mothers killed by their sons, a report reveals. The statistics have led to calls for the government to take specific action to tackle matricide. Tariffs | Justin Trudeau has claimed the aim of a -dumb- trade war launched by Donald Trump is to usher in the -complete collapse- of the Canadian economy and make it easier for the US to annex Canada. Leading stock market indices fell sharply, with the US benchmark S&amp;P 500 losing all its post-election gains, as the US slapped 25% taxes on Canadian and Mexican goods and hiked tariffs on China. Scams | An organised network operating from the former Soviet state of Georgia has scammed thousands of savers from the UK, Europe and Canada out of $35m (£27m) after they fell for fake celebrity adverts on Facebook and Google. The scheme was revealed in a leak of call centre data covering more than 1m recordings. Gaza | Arab leaders have endorsed a $53bn (£42bn) plan to rebuild Gaza under the future administration of the Palestinian Authority (PA), in a rushed attempt to present an alternative to Donald Trump’s idea for a property development-style plan. The Arab League presented the plans at a summit in Cairo.

More than 170 mothers killed by their sons in 15 years in UK, report reveals	Number is nearly one in 10 of all women killed by men, leading to calls for government action to tackle matricide Nearly one in 10 of all women who died at the hands of men in the UK over the past 15 years were mothers killed by their sons, a report reveals. Data analysing the deaths of 2,000 women killed by men since 2009 has given an unprecedented insight into the hidden scourge of matricide, with more than 170 mothers killed by their sons. 61% of women were killed by a current or former partner, 9% of women were killed by their sons, 6% by other family members, 15% by other men they knew and 10% by someone they did not know. Of the 213 women killed by a close family member, 80% were mothers killed by sons. Nearly half of women were stabbed, 27% strangled and 17% hit with a blunt instrument. In 16% of cases, a man used kicking, hitting or stamping as the weapon. In almost a quarter of cases, more than one form of violence was used. Overkill – the use of excessive, gratuitous violence beyond that necessary to cause the victim’s death – happened in 59% of femicides. Leicestershire had the highest rate of femicide over the period, followed by Merseyside, the West Midlands, Greater Manchester and London. Killed women involved in prostitution were younger and less likely to have been born in the UK. Children witnessed at least 163 femicides, while 37 women were killed alongside 53 children, most commonly by their father.

‘A real injustice’: mothers killed by their children is still a hidden issue in UK	Research shows that mothers are seen as a ‘safe space’ for their offspring – nearly all of them sons – to use violence The thought of mothers being abused or killed by their own children – the people they have carried, cared for and nurtured since birth – is something of an underexamined and almost taboo issue in Britain. There is a slowly growing body of research into why children under 18 use violent behaviour towards their parents. There is an even smaller body of research showing why adults – nearly all of them sons – do the same.

First Thing: US suspends all military aid to Ukraine after Trump-Zelenskyy row	The drastic move came as JD Vance claimed that attracting US economic interest to Ukraine was the country’s best bet at security. Plus, the date by which the majority of adults globally will be overweight Good morning. The Trump administration has halted all US military aid to Ukraine, blocking the delivery of ammunition, vehicles, and other equipment as it pressures Kyiv to agree to a peace deal. What has the vice-president, JD Vance, said? That the US having financial interest in Ukraine is the best way to guarantee the country’s security. The comments come amid the minerals deal Washington wants Kyiv to sign. How do Americans feel about Ukraine? 52% of Americans said they -personally support- Ukraine, while only 4% of back Russia, a poll last week found. 44% said they do not support either. A separate poll conducted after the confrontation found that 49% said Trump and JD Vance had a stronger argument over the value of diplomacy with Russia. The 2Way poll also found that 62% thought Zelenskyy’s remarks at the White House were offensive – and 55% said Ukraine needed to negotiate and end the war. What about Mexico? The country’s president is expected to announce her response on Tuesday morning.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/04/first-thing-us-suspends-military-aid-ukraine-trump-zelenskyy-row	2025-03-04T03:30:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3deb44ed65c4f8071763ada2b533faf110d35d29/0_0_5770_3462/master/5770.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ebf716713b25c5dabdd4c5f9b66004b4

Trump to address Congress as policy decisions divide nation – US politics live	President expected to ask for more money for immigration crackdown as Democrats invite fired federal workers to speech Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. My name is Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news over the next few hours. We start with news that president Donald Trump will stand before a joint session of Congress today to give an accounting of his turbulent first weeks in office as a divided nation struggles to keep pace. The Trump administration has suspended delivery of all US military aid to Ukraine, blocking billions in crucial shipments as the White House piles pressure on Ukraine to sue for peace with Vladimir Putin. The decision affects deliveries of ammunition, vehicles, and other equipment including shipments agreed to when Joe Biden was president. It comes after a dramatic blow-up in the White House on Friday during which Donald Trump told Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he was -gambling with- a third world war. The Ukrainian president was told to come back -when he is ready for peace-. US vice-president JD Vance said that the best way to protect Ukraine from another Russian invasion is to guarantee the US has a financial interest in Ukraine’s future. -If you want real security guarantees, if you want to actually ensure that Vladimir Putin does not invade Ukraine again, the very best security guarantee is to give Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine,- Vance said in the interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity which aired Monday night. China and Canada unveiled retaliatory measures against the US after Donald Trump imposed his sweeping tariffs plan at midnight US time, despite warnings it could spark an escalating trade war. US tariffs have come into force of 25% against goods from Canada and Mexico, the US’s two biggest trading partners, and 20% tariffs against China – doubling the levy on China from last month. The duties will affect more than $918bn-worth (£722bn) of US imports from Canada and Mexico. The US health department told employees on Monday they could apply for early retirement over the next 10 days and should respond to a request for information on their accomplishments of the past week, according to emails seen by Reuters. Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, who oversees the so-called -department of government efficiency-, are spearheading an unprecedented effort to shrink the federal bureaucracy, including through job cuts. The US Senate has confirmed Linda McMahon as the nation’s next education secretary, entrusting the former wrestling executive with a department marked for dismantling by Donald Trump. The 76-year-old billionaire businesswoman and longtime Trump ally was approved 51-45, reflecting deep divisions over her qualifications and the administration’s education agenda. McMahon, who previously led the small business administration during Trump’s first term, now faces the paradoxical task of running an agency while simultaneously working toward its potential elimination. Two alleged leaders of a criminal organization suspected of smuggling 20,000 people without permanent legal residency into the US from Guatemala have been arrested in Los Angeles, federal prosecutors said on Monday. Eduardo Domingo Renoj-Matul, known as -Turko-, and his lieutenant, Cristobal Mejia-Chaj, were taken into custody Friday and have pleaded not guilty to multiple charges related to smuggling migrants across the border over five years, the US attorney’s office said. A federal judge ordered the men, who themselves are in the country illegally, jailed without bond until their trial in April.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/mar/04/donald-trump-congress-speech-ukraine-tariffs-democrats-federal-workers-us-politics-live-news	2025-03-04T02:52:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e385535968c59d843c6994afe48c3642d3edc59d/0_163_6000_3601/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c05084401e49dc4339b3c339fc4c6819

Starmer won’t be derailed from Ukraine plan, Rayner says, amid claims Trump’s aid decision ‘humiliated’ PM – UK politics live	Few hours after Starmer’s statement to Commons on Monday, White House suspended all military aid to Ukraine Good morning. Yesterday Keir Starmer had a comfortable two hours in the Commons during which MPs from all sides praised him, lavishly and sincerely, for the leadership he has shown on Ukraine, trying to hold the US and Europe together, while mobilising European efforts to build up support for Ukraine. There were probably only two moments when Starmer lashed out; first at Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, whom he accused of fawning over Vladimir Putin; and then at Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminser, whom he accused of being a keyboard warrior (in response to a question from a Labour MP who was even more critical). The attack on Flynn came about half an hour after Flynn asked a perfectly reasonable question. Unfortunately, it has been reported this afternoon that President Trump is set to meet American aides to discuss withdrawing military aid to Ukraine. Are those reports something that the prime minister recognises, and, if so, what impact will that have on the timetable to which he and President Macron are currently working? I have not seen reports of the United States withdrawing support for Ukraine, and, as I understand it, that is not its position.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/04/keir-starmer-ukraine-plan-donald-trump-aid-labour-conservative-uk-politics-latest-news	2025-03-04T01:12:34-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2baf10edcd01a6346a3265d1a3647d31816d139e/0_259_7775_4665/master/7775.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=76b42ddc4272d30109c864d899ad9c19
