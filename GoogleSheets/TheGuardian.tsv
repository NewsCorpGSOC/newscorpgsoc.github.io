Cause of South Korea plane crash unclear as officials focus on bird strikes	Experts say bird strikes are relatively common and should not have been enough to cause landing gear failure No one knows for certain what caused Jeju Air flight 7C2216 to crash, killing all but two of its 181 passengers and crew. As darkness fell at Muan international airport in South Korea and officials fielded questions from distraught relatives of the dead, the most likely explanation was that the plane had been struck by one or more birds, triggering a sequence of events that prevented the pilot from deploying the landing gear. Aviation officials focused on bird strikes – and, to a lesser extent, the weather – as the most probable cause, even as some experts said the relatively common phenomenon would not have been enough to cause a catastrophic failure of the landing gear.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/29/cause-of-south-korea-plane-crash-unclear-bird-strikes-landing-gear	2024-12-29T08:37:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/995c199518186f55d2d7edfcfc7d2c207dc08f43/0_202_5336_3203/master/5336.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fb472537199ef5f4e3ca9da26bbdc933

South Korea plane crash: all except two are presumed dead on Jeju Air flight carrying 181 people, say authorities – live updates	South Korea facing worst domestic civil aviation disaster after Boeing 737-800 with 175 passengers and six crew skidded off runway and hit wall at Muan airport Dozens are feared dead after a plane skidded off the runway while attempting a landing without landing gear at Muan international airport in South Korea on Sunday morning The exact casualty figures have not yet been tallied, though authorities are provisionally reporting that 28 people are believed to have died, according to news agency Newsis. Fire officials have warned that given the severe damage to the aircraft, the number of casualties could rise. Jeju Air flight 2216 from Bangkok to Muan was carrying 181 people – 175 passengers and six crew – when it came down, skidded along the runway and hit fencing and a wall around the perimeter before catching fire. Rescues are underway, with two people brought out of the wreckage so far. Emergency services are continuing their search operation. The Boeing 737-800 may have suffered a bird strike that caused the landing gear to fail, according news agency Yonhap. The flight had reportedly attempted one landing before being forced to -go-around- when the landing gear failed to lower normally. South Korea’s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, has ordered -all available equipment and personnel to be mobilised- for the rescue operations at Muan international airport in the country’s south-west and is heading to the crash site, about 300km from the capital, Seoul. The pilot of Jeju Air flight 2216 from Bangkok appeared to be attempting a belly landing after the plane’s landing gear failed to deploy properly, Yonhap is reporting.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/29/south-korea-plane-crash-casualties-reported-after-jeju-air-flight-veers-off-runway-at-muan-airport-live-updates	2024-12-29T01:09:56-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/470559518cf35b65bd8d6e9b828d563f02a1f00d/0_117_1400_840/master/1400.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=001b79d0ae7302e544233bafa7723932

Visitor numbers to the African country lag far behind its neighbours due to lack of infrastructure and national planning. Now some are starting to demand changes At the top of the Ado-Awaye hills lies a lake suspended 433 metres above sea level. Local people say the lake is named Iyake (Yoruba for -crying woman-) after a weeping, barren woman who fell in the water hundreds of years ago, conferring on it powers of fertility. This belief in the divine is evident in the foothills, where a huge boulder is emblazoned with the words, written in golden letters: -Here we come: African Jerusalem.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/28/beaches-beer-and-a-rare-suspended-lake-why-cant-nigeria-attract-more-tourists	2024-12-28T10:55:58-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc82b6cc062e5133fb06e3889e0dd8dd984753a1/0_428_5712_3427/master/5712.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ce0c19a12118f8634369ea0df53a72f2

Among the many odd things to come out of Donald Trump’s political movement – see ear bandages, doomed boat rallies and rubbish dancing – one that could be here to stay is more prosaic: the creation of a series of rightwing marketplaces and products seeking to capitalize on anti-establishment fervor. In recent years a number of platforms have sprung up to sell conservative-made items, from -anti-woke- dog food to pro-America lipstick, in a pushback against what they claim is -cancel culture- in the US – and what others might see as a fairly cynical attempt to cash in on rightwing Americans’ political beliefs.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/28/anti-woke-shopping-public-square	2024-12-28T04:00:38-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/813227a42e73850ffaae14cc699c1bdfa38a24cd/0_12_3257_1955/master/3257.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8420f666a1ee8ae97897183465488cc6

But the night before, someone had been discreetly sticking posters to walls and lamp-posts. They bore the image of a young Ukrainian woman, dressed in a traditional embroidered shirt, smashing a bouquet over a Russian soldier’s head. -I don’t want flowers,- read the slogan. -I want my Ukraine.- Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service accused American and British spies of trying to provoke attacks against Russian military bases in Syria in a bid to force the evacuation of the bases, the state-run RIA news agency said on Saturday. The SVR gave no evidence for its allegation. North Korean troops deployed in Russia’s Kursk region are suffering heavy losses and being left unprotected by the Russian forces they are fighting alongside, according to Ukraine, while the US says Russian and North Korean generals see the soldiers as -expendable-. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Friday that said Russian troops were sending the North Koreans into battle with minimal protection and that the North Koreans were taking extreme measures to avoid being taken prisoner. -Their losses are significant, very significant,- the Ukrainian president said in his nightly video address. The Biden administration pledged to approve fresh military aid to Ukraine, including crucial air defence systems. John Kirby, the US national security communications adviser, said the promised US security assistance package was expected to be announced -in the next couple of days-, though it was unclear how much it will include. Slovakia has confirmed its readiness to host any peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, despite Kyiv’s accusation that it is playing into the hands of Vladimir Putin.

Why speech could be a target for the anti-abortion movement in 2025	The anti-abortion movement is looking at ways to control information about how and where to obtain abortions The next front in the US abortion wars may be what people are allowed to say about it. More than two years after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in the case Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, US abortions are on the rise, thanks in large part to the spread of abortion pills and travel across state lines. This has infuriated anti-abortion advocates, who have proposed policies to help the incoming Trump administration curtail the mailing of abortion pills and targeted individuals and groups that help women get out-of-state abortions. In a sign of how the issue is pitting states against one another, Texas earlier this monthsued a New York-based doctor who allegedly provided a telehealth abortion to a Texan woman.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/27/speech-anti-abortion-movement	2024-12-27T05:00:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3faa1b222876c0d70ea72aacd0080fcdda7a70da/0_230_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=102a7eeda3b3c7791c3d521762a1450d

The novel, inspired by the life of the prophet Muhammad, became the focus of a fierce global debate about freedom of speech when Iran’s then-supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, placed a bounty on Rushdie’s head due to its supposed blasphemy.

Middle East crisis live: 14 security personnel killed in Syria after clash over former prison officer	Security personnel and three armed men killed in Tartous province after forces sought to arrest officer linked to Sednaya prison, says Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza and developments in the Middle East more widely. Fourteen security personnel from Syria’s new authorities and three armed men were killed in clashes in Tartous province when forces attempted to arrest an officer linked to the notorious Sednaya prison, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Five journalists were killed when their vehicle was struck in the vicinity of Al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat in central Gaza, health authorities said. Palestinian media and local reporters said the vehicle was marked as a media van and was used by journalists to report from inside the hospital and Nuseirat camp. The journalists worked for the Al-Quds Al-Youm television channel. The Israeli army said its air force attacked the vehicle in a -targeted manner- and that members of the Islamic Jihad militant group were inside. In a separate incident, five people were killed and 20 wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a house in Gaza City’s Zeitoun neighbourhood early on Thursday, medics with the Gaza health authorities reported. They warned the death toll could rise as many people remained trapped under the rubble. A baby girl has frozen to death in Gaza, the third to die from the cold, in Gaza’s tent camps in recent days, doctors said. The father of three-week-old Sila, Mahmoud al-Faseeh, wrapped her in a blanket to try to keep her warm in their tent in the Muwasi area outside the town of Khan Younis, but it was not enough, he told the Associated Press. On Wednesday, Hamas and Israel traded blame over their failure to conclude a ceasefire agreement despite progress reported by both sides in past days. Israel’s air and ground offensive has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry. It says more than half the fatalities have been women and children, but does not say how many of the dead were fighters.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/26/middle-east-crisis-live-security-personnel-killed-syria-sednaya-prison-gaza-israel-latest-updates	2024-12-26T01:01:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72f05a5ccbd2dadff383da682b82c435e555053e/0_189_4300_2580/master/4300.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=69afe26c36e9247d0b915814451b6dd5
Russia-Ukraine war live: Ukrainian military says it shot down 20 of 31 drones launched by Russia overnight	11 ‘imitator drones’ did not reach their targets after active engagement from the Ukrainian military, it said Hello – Welcome to the Guardian’s blog covering the Russia-Ukraine war. Joe Biden has asked the US defence department to continue its surge of weapons deliveries to Ukraine, describing Russia’s Christmas Day attack against some of Ukraine’s cities and its energy infrastructure as -outrageous-. Christmas morning in Ukraine was overshadowed by a massive Russian aerial attack using cruise missiles to target energy infrastructure across the country, which Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned as -inhuman-. The attack left half a million people in Kharkiv region without heating, in temperatures just a few degrees Celsius above zero, while there were blackouts in the capital, Kyiv, and elsewhere. Ukraine’s air defences downed 59 of 78 Russian missiles and 54 of 102 drones launched overnight and on Wednesday morning, the Ukrainian military said. British prime minister Keir Starmer has also condemned the Russian attack launched on Ukraine’s energy grid, which killed one person. Nato member Romania said it had not detected any Russian missile passing through its airspace to target Ukraine, as claimed by Kyiv. Russia’s Federal Security Service claimed on Thursday that it had foiled several plots by Ukrainian intelligence services to kill high-ranking Russian military officers and their families in Moscow. It claimed four Russian citizens allegedly involved in the plots had been detained. Ukraine’s SBU intelligence service has claimed responsibility for the killing of Igor Kirillov, chief of Russia’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection troops, who died after a bomb attached to an electric scooter exploded outsided his apartment building on 17 December. A Russian cargo ship that sank on Tuesday in the Mediterranean Sea was the target of an -act of terrorism-, according to the vessel’s owner. The Ursa Major sank while it was sailing through international waters between Spain and Algeria, leaving two crew members missing. The Ukrainian navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk said Russia faced -systemic problems- in maintaining its fleet but gave no indication that Kyiv was involved in the incident. Falling debris from a Ukrainian drone that was shot down caused an explosion and a fatal fire in a shopping centre in the city of Vladikavkaz in Russia’s North Ossetia region, the local governor said on Wednesday. One woman was reported to have been killed inside the shopping centre. Russia’s foreign ministry said Australia had been in contact about the possible capture by the Russian army of an Australian citizen fighting with Ukrainian forces.

Calls for Labour to honour pledge to toughen anti-hunt laws	Government urged to ban trail hunting as data suggests illegal foxhunting is still widespread in England and Wales Animal welfare campaigners are calling on ministers to keep to a pledge to toughen anti-hunt laws, as figures suggest illegal foxhunting remains widespread in England and Wales. Almost 20 years since the Hunting Act 2004 was brought in by Tony Blair’s government, the League Against Cruel Sports (Lacs) – the animal welfare charity that was the driving force behind the original ban – says its data evidences how stronger legislation is required to close loopholes and prohibit trail hunting, which campaigners say has been used as a smokescreen for illegal foxhunting. Trail hunting is where dogs follow an animal-based scent.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/26/calls-for-labour-to-honour-pledge-to-toughen-anti-hunt-laws-england-wales-foxhunting	2024-12-25T21:00:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d79ad735bc7ffcfc2d5c744ea633045490ddf1b/0_183_3795_2277/master/3795.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2ccbcf3f7724c19b6a6f2d9cc5ea28b2

The teen who gave away 21,600 pairs of shoes and set a record: ‘I’m doing this because it makes me feel good’	Augustus Holm helped organize a San Diego footwear drive that earned a Guinness World Record – and it started from an idea he had when he was 13 Some 18-year-olds who take time off from their studies after graduating high school head off to travel, learn a new language or gain employment. Augustus Holm gathered some friends, gave away more than 21,600 pairs of shoes to families in need and set a world record that he hopes lends even more credibility to his future philanthropic efforts.

Tuesday briefing: What Reform UK might get from Elon Musk’s $100m – and what he might want in return	In today’s newsletter: With rumours of the political party courting a game-changing investment, people are asking not only what they might do with the money, but what the tech titan might get in return Good morning. I don’t know how long Elon Musk spent mulling over his rumoured suggestion that he might give $100m to Reform, but since it amounts to about 0.02% of his total wealth, I imagine it will have taken about as much time as most people spend mulling over a Christmas book token for their favourite nephew. But if $100m is chicken feed for the world’s richest man, it is enough money to be transformative for Nigel Farage and his cohorts – and for UK politics more generally. In the weeks since the story first broke, a growing chorus has urged Labour to update the rules on political donations to limit the influence of international money on British political parties. Meanwhile, Reform have unsurprisingly forgotten about their general view of foreigners who don’t understand British culture, and suggested that this might just be the start.

Russia-Ukraine war live: North Korea preparing to send more troops to Russia, says South Korea	Troops and weapons, including suicide drones, to be shipped to Russia to support war against Ukraine, say Seoul’s joint chiefs of staff Hello and welcome to the Ukraine live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest from the conflict. We start with news that South Korea’s military said on Monday that it has detected signs of North Korea preparing to send more troops and weapons, including suicide drones, to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. Russian president, Vladimir Putin met the Slovakian prime minister, Robert Fico, in the Kremlin on Sunday, a rare visit by a European Union leader to Moscow, as a contract allowing for Russian gas to transit through Ukraine nears expiry. Russia has captured two more villages in east Ukraine, the latest territorial gains for Moscow’s advancing army. The defence ministry said on Telegram on Sunday that its troops had -liberated- the villages of Lozova in the north-eastern Kharkiv region and Krasnoye – called Sontsivka in Ukraine. Zelenskyy told Ukraine’s diplomats on Sunday that the country will have to fight to persuade allies to allow it to take up Nato membership, but has described the goal as -achievable- as it searches for security guarantees to protect it from Russia. Nato secretary general Mark Rutte said he considered the sometimes harsh criticism of German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to be unjustified, news wire DPA reported. Although Germany has been a vital ally of Ukraine, its hesitation in providing long-range Taurus cruise missiles has been a source of frustration in Kyiv, which is battling a foe armed with a powerful array of long-range weaponry. Russian forces executed five Ukrainian prisoners of war, Ukraine’s parliamentary commissioner for human rights, Dmytro Lubinets, claimed on Sunday. Russian troops shot the five unarmed soldiers after capturing them, Lubinets alleged on Telegram, without providing more details. A video purporting to show the Russian capture of an Australian man fighting for Ukraine on the war’s eastern front has prompted urgent inquiries by Australia’s government. The man, who identified himself as Oscar Jenkins, is struck several times and questioned roughly in Russian in the video, which is circulating on Telegram. Ukrainian drones struck a major Russian fuel depot for the second time in just over a week on Sunday, according to a senior Russian regional official, as part of a -massive- cross-border attack on fuel and energy facilities that Kyiv says supply Moscow’s military.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-north-korea-troops-russia-south-korea-latest-updates	2024-12-23T00:33:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fca852107a99babc97a03e639d350b9421e835a2/119_68_1087_652/master/1087.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=66adf3dc5a94e9b18f40f11bac3195d0
Locals win fight to save mysterious, medieval Spanish chapel from oblivion	Home to vivid 16th-century frescoes, the Ermita de San Jorge is on the brink of being saved from centuries of decay A mysterious, dilapidated and exquisitely painted Spanish chapel into which knights on horseback may have ridden centuries ago to receive a wet and most unusual blessing could be on the verge of salvation after a decades-long campaign by local heritage groups. No one knows much about the crumbling and semi-subterranean Ermita de San Jorge, which sits in a hollow 7 miles (12km) from the city of Cáceres in Extremadura, south-west Spain. Local experts believe it may have been built in the 14th century close to the defensive line erected to guard against possible Muslim incursions after the Christian reconquest, while the only definitively recorded date in its first centuries comes courtesy of Juan de Ribera who decorated the inside of the chapel with vivid biblical frescoes in 1565.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/23/locals-win-fight-to-save-spanish-chapel-from-oblivion-ermita-de-san-jorge	2024-12-23T00:32:16-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9058071ff317451ca6f4b78253a2c281f1c62651/0_16_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ce95de342f13dc1e765ddd478ec2eb0f

Middle East crisis live: Israel orders closure of one of last functioning hospitals in northern Gaza	Head of Kamal Adwan hospital says it is ‘next to impossible’ to obey shut down order due to lack of ambulances to evacuate patients Hello, and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza and developments in the Middle East more widely. Israel late last night ordered the closure and evacuation of one of the last hospitals still partly functioning in northern Gaza. We currently have nearly 400 civilians inside the hospital, including babies in the neonatal unit, whose lives depend on oxygen and incubators. We cannot evacuate these patients safely without assistance, equipment, and time. We are sending this message under heavy bombardment and direct targeting of the fuel tanks, which if hit will cause a large explosion and mass casualties of the civilians inside. Israeli forces have carried out three consecutive attacks overnight on the Gaza Strip, killing at least 11 Palestinians, according to Al Jazeera, which said the military killed four people in two separate air raids in the so-called designated -safe zone- of al-Mawasi. Palestinian news agency Wafa is reporting that four Palestinian people were killed and three others injured after Israel bombed the new camp area northwest of the al-Nuseirat refugee camp. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Phillipe Lazzarani, said there has been in -escalation- in attacks over the past day, with more civlians reported killed and injured. In a post on X, he wrote: -Attacks on schools and hospitals have been commonplace. The world must not become numb.- Jordan’s foreign minister Ayman Safadi is due to meet with Syria’s new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, and -several Syrian officials-, later today in Damascus, Jordan’s foreign ministry said.

Louisiana holds people in prisons past their release date, DoJ lawsuit alleges	State accused of ‘systemic overdetention’ that violates inmates’ rights and costs taxpayers millions of dollars a year Louisiana’s prison system routinely holds people weeks and months after they have completed their sentences, the US justice department alleged in a lawsuit filed on Friday.

Middle East crisis: Israeli strikes kill 17 Palestinians in Gaza – live updates	The strikes came a day after Pope Francis condemned the bombing of children in Gaza as ‘cruelty’ Hello, and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza and developments in the Middle East more widely. Israeli military airstrikes across the Gaza Strip have killed at least 17 Palestinian people, 8 of them at a school sheltering displaced families in Gaza City, medics said. Several people have been injured by Israeli attacks on northern Gaza’s Kamal Adwan hospital, according to Al Jazeera, with Israeli forces reportedly firing directly on the facility’s ICU and maternity ward, as well as at the nearby al-Awda hospital. Hussam Abu Safiya, the director of Kamal Adwan hospital, said the army ordered staff to evacuate the hospital and move patients and injured people toward another hospital in the area. Abu Safiya said the mission was -next to impossible- because staff did not have ambulances to move the patients. -Tonight’s reports of bombardment near Kamal Adwan hospital and order to evacuate the hospital are deeply worrisome. The hospital has been in the midst of fighting for too long and the lives of patients are at risk,- WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote in a post on X late last night. The US military said it mistakenly shot down one of its own fighter aircraft over the Red Sea on Sunday morning, forcing both pilots to eject. Both were rescued, one with minor injuries, after the -apparent case of friendly fire,- which is being investigated, US Central Command said in a statement. The fighter was an F/A-18 Hornet flying off the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman. One of the carrier’s escort ships, the missile cruiser Gettysburg, -mistakenly fired on and hit- the plane, the statement said. The US military carried out airstrikes against a missile storage facility and a command-and-control facility operated by Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen’s capital, Sana’a, on Saturday. The US military’s Central Command said the strikes aimed to -disrupt and degrade- Houthi operations, including attacks against US navy warships and merchant vessels in the southern Red Sea, Bab al-Mandeb and Gulf of Aden. The strike followed a similar attack last week by US aircraft against a command and control facility operated by the Houthis, who control much of Yemen. The US attack on Sana’a came the same day that a Houthi missile struck Israel’s commercial hub Tel Aviv, injuring 16 people in the second such airstrike in days. Turkey has vowed to -do whatever it takes- to ensure its security if the new Syrian administration cannot address Ankara’s concerns about US-allied Kurdish groups it views as terrorist groups, the country’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, said on Saturday. Turkey regards the YPG, the militant group spearheading the US-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants who have fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for 40 years and are deemed terrorists by Ankara, Washington, and the EU. The UN has warned that people living in makeshift shelters might not survive the winter. Nearly 2 million Palestinians have been displaced by Israel’s war on the territory and are struggling to protect themselves from the wind, cold and rain.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/22/middle-east-crisis-israel-airstrikes-gaza-yemen-houthis-latest-updates	2024-12-22T00:38:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/401da4b5622ed52d1a6a4da89df86462c16c3d95/0_0_6195_3719/master/6195.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4c336cad3cfc8424d626bfb1d1d75062

Trump said to see Elon Musk as useful activist after spending deal showdown	Musk’s role in government shutdown drama could be a preview of role he plays for incoming president next year Donald Trump’s relationship with Elon Musk is showing no signs of fraying, even after at times he appeared to eclipse the president-elect’s influence as he bullied House Republicans into paring down their bipartisan spending deal to avert a government shutdown with just hours to spare. The move by Musk to detonate the political equivalent of a nuclear bomb – by demanding that Republicans sink the deal or face a primary challenge – was viewed as a test run of the kind of role Musk might play to pressure Congress once Trump takes office, people familiar with the matter said.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/21/trump-elon-musk-spending-deal	2024-12-21T07:00:21-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9daf267bc83288d5f43e7f0c19ebb6fdb024ca9/236_0_2640_1584/master/2640.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c492f2b084cf8cea62a7b5d1df8b641

Middle East crisis live: 14 injured after Israel fails to intercept missile from Yemen	Missile fell in the Tel Aviv-Jaffa area leaving 14 people with minor injuries; attack comes days after Israel launched deadly strikes on Yemen Israeli airstrikes killed at least 25 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on Friday, Reuters reports, citing medics. The toll included at least eight in an apartment in the Nuseirat refugee camp and at least 10, including seven children, in the town of Jabalia. Hello, and welcome to our live coverage of developments in the Middle East. The Israeli military said its forces had shot a protester during a demonstration against the army’s activities in a village in southern Syria on Friday, injuring him in the leg. Since Islamist-led rebels toppled Syrian president Bashar al-Assad on 8 December Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes on Syrian military facilities in what it says is a bid to prevent them from falling into hostile hands. In a move widely condemned internationally, Israel also sent troops into a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone in the Golan Heights and beyond, calling it a defensive and temporary measure. Gaza’s civil defence rescue agency reported that an Israeli air strike killed 10 members of a family on Friday in the northern part of the territory, including seven children. Violence in the Gaza Strip continues to rock the coastal territory more than 14 months into the Israel-Hamas war, even as international mediators work to negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas Palestinian militants. The Israeli military told the AFP news agency it had struck -several terrorists who were operating in a military structure belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation and posed a threat to IDF troops operating in the area-. Syria wants to contribute to -regional peace-, the country’s new authorities said late on Friday, after a meeting between leader Ahmed al-Sharaa and a US diplomatic delegation. -The Syrian side indicated that the Syrian people stand at an equal distance from all countries and parties in the region and that Syria rejects any polarisation,- the statement said. It said the new authorities wanted to -affirm Syria’s role in promoting regional peace and building privileged strategic partnerships with countries in the region-. The meeting between al-Sharaa - known previously by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani - and the US delegation led by Barbara Leaf, head of the Middle East at the State Department, was -positive-, a Syrian official previously told AFP. Al-Sharaa, the leader of the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group that seized power in Damascus, was previously the target of US sanctions. But after their first formal contact in Damascus on Friday, Washington announced it had dropped a bounty for his arrest. The Iranian government is attempting to salvage some influence with Syria’s new leaders, as Tehran reels from its sudden loss of authority in Damascus after the collapse of the regime of Bashar al-Assad. The Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, is already facing multiple domestic and international crises, including power cuts due to a lack of oil supplies, continued tensions over its nuclear programme and a row about a new law that will toughen punishments for women who do not wear the hijab. But it is the sudden loss of influence in Syria after the fall of Assad to rebel groups that is exercising Iranian officials most.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/21/israel-gaza-war-yemen-syria-lebanon-hamas-hezbollah-middle-east-latest	2024-12-21T00:31:19-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3bdcfce63f5118095370e4d6ee7f6e9a3d04b17/0_367_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=27a25f396cba69ef406e0c8e7ef9fd48

Michael Mosley’s cause of death ‘unascertainable’, coroner says	TV presenter’s death on Greek island in June probably due to heatstroke or a pathological cause, coroner finds A coroner has recorded an open conclusion regarding the -unascertainable- death of the TV presenter Michael Mosley, who died on a Greek island after he went for a walk.

Xi was in Macau to mark the 25th anniversary of its return from Portuguese to Chinese rule on 20 December 1999. In the quarter-century since then, Macau has been run as a special administrative region of China, a semi-autonomous territory with a similar legal status to Hong Kong, but it has traditionally been much more pliant to Beijing’s rule than the former British territory. More than half of its 700,000 population immigrated from China in recent decades.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/20/xi-jinping-urges-macau-to-diversify-economy-away-from-casinos	2024-12-20T06:02:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e6d9d5d3241c2883a30ee0d3e8a71aaf17a4b29/0_438_5344_3209/master/5344.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=20d5b09386476fe9877b4704736cd18b

Exclusive: Major Trump donors who complained of immigrant ‘invasion’ used Mexican workers illegally, sources allege	Experts believe the alleged ‘shuttle support’ program used by Uline – a company owned by billionaires Liz and Dick Uihlein – is likely illegal and exploitative of workers A company owned by two of Donald Trump’s top mega-donors has routinely brought dozens of its workers from Mexico to staff its warehouses in Wisconsin and other locations even though they do not appear to have permission to work in the US, according to a Guardian investigation. Uline – a giant Wisconsin-based office and shipping supply company controlled by billionaires Liz and Dick Uihlein – shuttles in its own workers from Mexico, who are using tourist visas and visas meant for employees who are entering the US temporarily to receive professional training, known as B1 visas. But instead of being part of a dedicated training program, the Mexican employees stay for one to six months and – sources with direct knowledge of the matter allege – perform normal work in Uline’s US warehouses.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/20/uline-mexican-workers-trump	2024-12-20T06:00:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dafa69a273e5a33ac004ec41791cd7c04157a85e/0_282_5255_3154/master/5255.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e7f1ff41bca89eef28c311842a0b7abc

Perhaps the most notable so far: a portion of a transcript from a March 2023 hearing that until now had largely gone unnoticed shows how – before corruption allegations prompted his resignation – David Jones exalted the wisdom of one of the most tendentious rulings made by fellow bankruptcy judge Meredith Grabill with respect to the New Orleans archdiocese’s chapter 11 reorganization.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/20/houston-church-bankruptcy-new-orleans-archdiocese	2024-12-20T05:00:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28dfcf5fdbdf6034836e8db21666ee4294471918/0_134_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4f632ee18066bbe98f2e987ac916f454

First Thing: US Amazon workers go on their ‘largest’ strike amid holiday rush	Employees at seven facilities including in New York, Atlanta and San Francisco take action. Plus, Elon Musk sinks congressional spending bill Good morning – and happy holidays! This is the last First Thing of 2024. We will be back on 2 January. On Thursday morning, workers at seven Amazon facilities across the country went on strike early during the holiday shopping rush, aiming to pressure the retailer into union contract talks. What are the details of the dispute? The union had given Amazon a 15 December deadline to begin negotiations and warehouse workers had recently voted to authorize a strike. Teamsters says Amazon -fails to pay its workers enough to make ends meet- and has -pushed workers to the limit-, despite -obscene profits-. The company reported above-expected revenue growth in the third quarter, with revenue of $158.9bn, 11% higher than the same period in 2023. How disruptive will the strike be? Amazon said it did not expect any effect on its operations during one of the busiest times of the year. Analysts said the company was unlikely to come to the table to bargain as that could open the door to more union actions. Why? Unions represent only about 1% of the Amazon workforce, with the company – one of America’s largest by market cap – accused of anti-union practices. Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, whose personal wealth Forbes estimates to be $239bn. What is the debt ceiling? Congress is in charge of setting the debt limit, which currently stands at $31.4tn.

The Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, is already facing multiple domestic and international crises, including power cuts due to a lack of oil supplies, continued tensions over its nuclear programme and a row about a new law that will make wearing the hijab compulsory for women.

They don’t want any big beasts coming back to mark anyone’s homework.- Let’s hope that in his new job the intelligence he gathers about what is going on in Donald Trump’s administration turns out to a little bit more accurate. One source said that Starmer’s decision to make a political appointment reflected how seriously he takes the UK’s relationship with the US, adding that Mandelson is a -significant figure in his own right-. He’s a big political hitter, well connected in our government, and I think that’s what we need with the Trump administration. He’s very interested in international affairs and foreign policy.

Middle East crisis live: mediators push on with Gaza ceasefire talks amid fresh strikes	Talks in Egypt and Qatar are focused on forging a deal to pause the 14-month-old war and release Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners A senior delegation of US diplomats has arrived in Syria to speak directly to the new Islamist-led rulers, hoping to encourage a moderate, inclusive path and to seek information on missing Americans. It is the first formal US diplomatic mission to Damascus since the early days of the brutal civil war that broke out in 2011 and culminated in a surprise lightning offensive that toppled longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad this month. Israel has launched widespread airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, killing at least nine people in the port city of Hodeidah, and threatened more attacks against the group, which has launched hundreds of missiles at Israel over the past year. There had been reports beforehand that Israel was planning to hit Yemen with force after a recent increase in Houthi attacks, including two in the past week. All references to Syria’s former ruling Ba’ath party will be removed from the country’s education system, the country’s new education minister said. Speaking to Reuters, Nazir Mohammad al-Qadri added that the country’s new leaders will not otherwise change school curricula or restrict the right of girls to learn, saying, -Education is a red line for the Syrian people, more important than food and water … The right to education is not limited to one specific gender. There may be more girls in our schools than boys.- The UK government has said any new Syrian government needs to build a -secure and peaceful- Syria weeks after its president Bashar al-Assad fled the country. Foreign Office minister Anneliese Dodds said British officials had met with the Syrian rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in Damascus and the UK was giving Syria £61m in aid. Thousands of people demonstrated on Thursday in north-east Syria in support of a US-backed, Kurdish-led force that for weeks has been pushing back against Turkey-backed fighters, an AFP correspondent said. The show of support for the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) comes after Islamist-led rebels toppled Syria’s longtime strongman Bashar al-Assad earlier this month. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has accused Israel of -ethnic cleansing- in the Gaza Strip in a report documenting the 14-month conflict published on Thursday. The report documents 41 attacks on MSF staff including airstrikes on health facilities and direct fire on humanitarian convoys, AFP reported. The NGO said it was forced to evacuate hospitals and health centres on 17 occasions. Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia had not been defeated in Syria and that Moscow had made proposals to the new rulers in Damascus over Russia’s military bases there. Putin said he had not yet met with Bashar al-Assad but planned to meet him and said he would ask about the fate of missing US reporter Austin Tice.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/20/middle-east-crisis-live-gaza-ceasefire-talks-fresh-strikes	2024-12-20T00:47:47-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb521c925ffa13fd040c5ff84142eab865e2b43e/0_108_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fe897980a17f3b323383b78b3df9f5da
Russia-Ukraine war live: airstrike on Kyiv following warnings of ballistic missile attack	One killed in attack that reportedly used Kinzhal and Iskander missiles against the Ukrainian capital One person was reported killed on Friday in a Russian missile strike on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, where AFP staff saw smoke rise over parts of the city after a series of explosions. -According to preliminary reports, one person was killed,- the head of the city’s military administration, Sergiy Popko, said on Telegram. Attacks overnight also hit the southeastern city of Kryvyi Rih, badly damaging a two-storey building and injuring six people, according to officials. A man and a teenage girl had been pulled from the rubble and had been hospitalised, the region’s governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded to Putin’s comments about testing a new hypersonic missile above Kyiv -to see what happens-. Zelenskyy said: -Do you think that’s a sane person? Simply scumbags.- Russia has been accused of carrying out a mass cyber-attack on Ukraine’s state registries. Ukrainian deputy prime minister Olha Stefanishyna said on Facebook late on Thursday: -As a result of this targeted attack, the work of the unified and state registries, which are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine, was temporarily suspended.- Stefanishyna said it was clear the attack was -carried out by the Russians to disrupt the work of the country’s critically important infrastructure-. Russia did not immediately comment on the claim. Vladimir Putin has said he was ready to meet Donald Trump and discuss peace proposals as he used a marathon phone-in event to claim that the war in Ukraine had made Russia -much stronger-. The Russian president said during the annual event that Moscow was -ready for negotiations and compromises- to end the fighting, but later he pointed to a maximalist position that would involve keeping Crimea and other occupied territories, Ukraine not joining Nato, and the lifting of sanctions by the west. He also denied that the fall of his key ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria had hurt Moscow’s standing. Zelenskyy said Putin was a fantasiser and accused him of wanting to destroy Ukraine’s army. -He (Putin) is an old fantasiser. He lives in a different world. He lives in his own aquarium I am afraid.- Zelenskyy said he needed both Europe and the United States on board to secure a durable peace, as he huddled with EU leaders at their final summit before Donald Trump’s inauguration. -I believe that the European guarantees won’t be sufficient for Ukraine,- he said after talks with his EU counterparts.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/20/russia-ukraine-war-live-kyiv-airstrike-ballistic-missile-vladimir-putin	2024-12-19T23:58:53-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26cdc5d1cf6022ce18fd68a5299ce33ce6228d99/0_81_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=36db90a9b6d3e53fb6ae6d8b49434eea
Friday briefing: Will the Gisèle Pelicot case finally change how we view violence against women?	In today’s newsletter: For years, Dominique Pelicot drugged his wife and recruited men to rape her. It could be a turning point in social and legal attitudes to sexual assault Good morning. Dominique Pelicot, described as one of France’s worst sex offenders, has been sentenced alongside 50 other men who he recruited to rape his wife, Gisèle Pelicot. Dominique, who was given the maximum sentence possible of 20 years in prison, had been drugging and raping his wife for a decade before he was caught.

The report from the previous one, which went on for 18 months, was published in 2019.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/dec/20/inquiry-to-look-at-huge-task-of-special-educational-needs-reform-in-england-helen-hayes-mp-send	2024-12-19T22:00:05-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45af6dfd3d9f2b206b9c4591fde238203f70cea5/67_871_7001_4201/master/7001.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c0e4bee4ec6a2575358fe98703f213b5
Black anti-racism coordinator excluded from European Commission reshuffle	MEPs warn of systemic inequities in EU executive after Michaela Moua left in ‘lower position’ than white peers A group of left-leaning MEPs have warned of -systemic inequities- after it emerged that the EU executive’s lead official in combating racism, who is a black European woman, was excluded from a reshuffle that left her in a -lower position- than her white peers.

Inside Aleppo, the city Assad left to rot as a lesson in the price of rising up	A decade on from the Guardian’s last visit, it is clear war has ripped the city apart – but there are signs of positive change Bashar al-Assad’s face has been ripped away from posters at the abandoned checkpoint that separates Sheikh Maqsoud, a neighbourhood in the north of Aleppo, from the rest of the city. No cars dare use the wide boulevard any more because the road is still watched by Kurdish snipers allied to the regime. The units retreated into the warren of bombed and burnt-out buildings when Islamist rebel groups launched an unprecedented attack on the city at the end of November, triggering a chain reaction that led to the swift collapse of the Assad dynasty. Civilians hurry past, some with small children in pushchairs, others rolling cooking gas canisters down the road, all trying not to attract undue attention. A man had been shot and killed here the night before, picked off from the upper floor of a windowless apartment block. Aleppo fell to an umbrella of Sunni Arab factions led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) three weeks ago, but the Kurdish units stationed in sheikh Maqsoud had for years refused to lay down their weapons, afraid of what would happen if they surrendered. Now, they appear to be waiting for something to shift in Syria’s new and fragile status quo.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/20/inside-aleppo-the-city-assad-left-to-rot	2024-12-19T21:00:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ffbcc92d2c2691d35730f61ae438918a1cfe9c6/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3a908b1498eca99ebdd6a2fb6af71cd8

Chaos in Congress after Trump rejects spending deal as government shutdown nears – live updates	President-elect torpedoes bipartisan plan with less than 48 hours remaining until government shuts down for holidays Good morning, US politics blog readers. Just yesterday, it seemed like Congress was on the verge of enacting legislation to keep the government running for the next three months and prevent a shutdown that would begin after midnight on Friday. But on X, Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy and other conservatives whose influence grew after Donald Trump won re-election were busy condemning the deal. It was an effort that culminated yesterday afternoon, when the president-elect and JD Vance blew up the negotiations entirely by declaring that the bill should be scrapped and replaced with a new one that also increases country’s debt ceiling – a surprise demand that hadn’t been raised previously. The incoming administration’s opposition blew up the funding compromise, and now it is up to the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, to pick up the pieces, with less than 48 hours remaining until the government shuts down. Needless to say, few in Congress wanted this to happen with the Christmas holiday right around the corner. We’ll find out today if the GOP has it in them to turn the situation around. Here’s what else we are watching today: Democrats appear content to let Republicans own the government funding fiasco, with the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, tweeting that the GOP has -been ordered to shut down the government-.

UK data regulator criticises Google for ‘irresponsible’ ad tracking change	ICO says allowing advertisers to track digital ‘fingerprints’ will undermine consumers’ control over information Britain’s data protection regulator has labelled Google as -irresponsible- for allowing advertisers to track customers’ digital -fingerprints-, amid fears even privacy-conscious users will find the online monitoring technique difficult to block.

Why do Black women consistently vote Democrat?	No other demographic has maintained the level of voter loyalty for a party as Black women have – experts tell us why For decades, Black women have been the most ardent supporters of the Democratic party. Most recently, in the 2024 election, they voted for Kamala Harris at 92%. Since 1972, Black people’s overall support for Democrats has stayed at about 90% during a presidential election, with Black women voting even more Democratic than Black men. No other demographic has maintained that level of voter loyalty for a political party. Donald Trump’s victory over the vice-president, and success with certain voting blocs such as Latino men and white women, has drawn attention to just how differently situated Black women are when compared with other voters.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/19/why-black-women-vote-democrat	2024-12-19T04:00:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfe617387eebedffd9d3637e69ed449d06eb692e/0_0_7700_4623/master/7700.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c025c68b39e64f57ad981ed2aba179f

Plus, Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of genocide for restricting Gaza water supply Good morning. A panel of judges has declared all of the 51 defendants in France’s mass rape case to be guilty, after a three-month trial that sent shockwaves around the world. Who are the men convicted of rape and assault? They include a soldier, a nurse, a butcher, a truck driver, a supermarket worker and dozens more. But the Pelicot children have said they are -disappointed by the low sentences-, Agence France-Presse reports.

First they came for his older brother Amafer, nabbed in broad daylight on the streets of the Mexican city of Morelia. Then they came for his other brother, Armando, grabbed on the outskirts of the capital. That same day, soldiers burst into the family home, beating his younger brothers Solón and Venustiano, as well as his father Jesús – eventually they too would be taken.

Starmer to take questions from liaison committee as No 10 firms up links with incoming Trump administration – UK politics live	Prime minister to be questioned on economy, public services and global affairs as No 10 says he spoke to Trump on the phone on Wednesday Good morning. It is the last day the House of Commons is sitting before the Christmas recess, and the main event will be in a committee room in Portcullis House where Keir Starmer will have his first question session with the liaison committee, the prefects’ club comprising the chairs of all the other Commons select committees. For 90 minutes he will take questions on the economy, public services and global affairs from MPs who know their subjects pretty well. Most of them are Labour MPs, but they include people who have only become select committee chairs because, despite serving on the front bench before the election, they were not appointed ministers, and so it is wrong to assume they are all Starmer loyalists. In theory, 90 minutes of intelligent questioning with the PM should produce a decent amount of news. In the past liaison committee hearings have often failed to get much beyond a rehash of familiar No 10 lines to take, but we live in hope. Relations with the US are almost certain to come up, and Starmer may be asked about an overnight story that suggests Starmer is firming up links with the incoming Donald Trump administration. Yesterday Starmer and Trump spoke on the phone. In its readout, No 10 says: The prime minister began by congratulating President-elect Trump on his recent team appointments and President-elect Trump warmly recounted his meeting with His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in Paris earlier this month. Both agreed on their joint ambition to strengthen the close and historic relationship between the UK and the US. They looked forward to working together on shared priorities, including international security and delivering economic growth and prosperity. Morgan McSweeney travelled to Florida to meet Susie Wiles, the political strategist who masterminded Mr Trump’s re-election campaign and will be his chief of staff in office. Mr McSweeney also had policy discussions in Washington with Mike Waltz, the congressman who has been named as Mr Trump’s next national security adviser. The mood music was very warm. President Trump is nothing but warm about the UK. As the year closes, Team Starmer is confident the UK is in a good position for a strong bilateral relationship with the new presidency.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/19/keir-starmer-questions-liaison-committee-donald-trump-administration-uk-politics-latest-updates	2024-12-19T01:28:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ad911fc8ee3b99d81641bf37755d7a7c5d02c78/41_69_5516_3310/master/5516.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f31ecd6bc8ed6b195b5f106f9e5b83ee
Middle East crisis live: Israel’s ‘long hand’ will reach Houthi leaders, says defence minister	Israel Katz warns leaders of movement after airstrikes hit several areas of Yemen overnight, including power stations near capital Sana’a Hello and welcome to the Middle East crisis live blog. My name is Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news and developments from the region. We start with the news that Israel’s -long hand- will reach the leaders of Yemen’s Houthi movement, its defence minister, Israel Katz, vowed on Thursday, after unleashing airstrikes on several areas of the country overnight. The visiting UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told Agence France-Presse that there is a need for a significant aid boost across Syria after the ousting of Bashar al-Assad. -Across the country, the needs are huge. Seven in 10 people are needing support right now,- Fletcher said, adding, -I want to scale up massively international support, but that now depends on donors. The Syria fund has been historically, shamefully underfunded and now there is this opportunity.- Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said his country and Lebanon would work together on Syria after the overthrow of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad earlier this month. -A new era has now begun in Syria. We agree that we must act together as two important neighbours of Syria,- Erdoğan told a news conference, alongside Lebanese caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati. The Israeli military has ordered another evacuation in central Gaza, even as Israel and Hamas appear to inch closer to a ceasefire agreement. -This is an advance warning ahead of an offensive,- Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee posted on X. The order included four residential block areas in the urban refugee camp of Bureij, where Adraee claimed that Palestinian militants fired rockets toward Israel. UN special envoy Geir Pedersen has called for -free and fair elections- in Syria and urged humanitarian assistance, AFP reports. Addressing reporters at the end of a visit to Damascus, Pedersen said -there is a lot of hope that we can now see the beginning of a new Syria-, which he expressed hope would also include a -political solution- in the Kurdish-held northeast. The US, joined by Arab mediators, is seeking to conclude a long-negotiated ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. A Palestinian official told Reuters earlier today that mediators had narrowed gaps on most of the agreement’s clauses. He said Israel, however, had introduced conditions which Hamas rejected but would not elaborate. At least 45,097 Palestinian people have been killed and 107,244 injured in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said. Of those, 38 Palestinians were killed and 203 injured in the latest 24-hour reporting period, the ministry said.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/19/middle-east-crisis-israel-houthis-yemen-airstrikes-latest-updates	2024-12-19T00:22:49-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da0e4c70c8755fbf3906c8897659c193466985bf/0_251_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9a56fef70d82d1f55b61349eed46c4b9

Russia-Ukraine war live: Zelenskyy says he discussed French troop idea with Macron	Ukrainian leader says presence of forces ‘could contribute to stabilising the path to peace’ Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had held a new discussion with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, on the latter’s proposal to deploy troops in Ukraine as a means to help achieve a stable peace. At least 100 North Koreans deployed to support Russia’s war effort in Ukraine have been killed since entering combat in December, South Korean lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun told reporters on Thursday. Pyongyang has sent thousands of troops to reinforce the Russian military, including to the Kursk border region, where Ukrainian forces seized territory earlier this year. -In December, they [North Korean troops] engaged in actual combat, during which at least 100 fatalities occurred,- Lee said, speaking after a briefing by South Korea’s spy agency. -The National Intelligence Service also reported that the number of injured is expected to reach nearly 1,000.- Despite those losses, the agency also said it had detected signs North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was preparing to train a new special operations force to ship westward. Ukraine struck Russian territory with at least 13 missiles and 84 drones, triggering a fire at the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in the southern Rostov region that burned for hours, Russian officials said on Thursday. Russian air defences shot down 84 drones over Russian regions, including 36 over Rostov region, according to the defence ministry. A Russian missile attack damaged residential buildings and infrastructure in Ukraine’s Sumy and Dnipropetrovsk regions, the Ukrainian military said this morning. There were no immediate reports of causalities. Russia used two Iskander-M ballistic missiles and a Kh-59/69 guided missile in its attack, the air force said. The attack damaged infrastructure, two apartment buildings, a hospital, and a school in Dnipropetrovsk region, its governor Serhiy Lysak said. A missile attack on the northeastern Sumy region damaged nine private residences, regional authorities said. Britain has unveiled £225m (US$286m) in new military aid to Ukraine for next year including drones, boats and air defence systems. The World Bank has approved $2.05bn in funding for Ukraine that includes the first grant from a $20bn US loan fund for Kyiv that is backed by income from frozen Russian sovereign assets.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskyy-french-troop-plan-macron-russia	2024-12-19T00:14:30-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7211c41d680577b246c25aafc79bf2efb53ed05/0_74_3485_2091/master/3485.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ac85b24e2cb0b829c0669f3e9d9f5769

In terms of raw politics, the significance is what may follow from the talks involving the leader of Reform UK, the party’s new treasurer Nick Candy, and Elon Musk at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Monday, immortalised in a photo eagerly released by Farage’s media team.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/dec/18/farage-photo-musk-nick-candy-mar-a-lago-trump-reform	2024-12-18T06:42:38-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2113ce03ca722de6fa9e64d9411abe4b45ed4be/192_60_3752_2251/master/3752.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=20dfb4099e8a0a49c7dd27de61766b47

Trump warns Liz Cheney ‘could be in a lot of trouble’ after Republicans call for FBI investigation – US politics live	President-elect reacts to House subcommittee report calling for former congresswoman to be investigated over January 6 inquiry Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump stayed up late (or woke up early?) to threaten Liz Cheney, the Republican former congresswoman who lost her seat two years ago after breaking with the president-elect. In a post written shortly after three in the morning, Trump said that Cheney -could be in a lot of trouble- over the findings of a Republican controlled House subcommittee that investigated the now-concluded bipartisan panel that held public hearings into the insurrection two years ago. The Republican subcommittee’s report accuses Cheney of witness tampering, saying, -numerous federal laws were likely broken by- the former congresswoman, and -these violations should be investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.- Those aren’t just empty words, considering Trump has nominated loyalist Kash Patel to lead the FBI, and, based on what Republican senators have said publicly so far, he may get confirmed. Here’s what else is happening today: Congress, and particularly House Republicans, are scrambling to pass a short-term government funding bill to ward off a shutdown that will otherwise begin Friday. As usual, many lawmakers do not like the compromises struck in the draft legislation released by Republican House speaker Mike Johnson, and will no doubt pipe up about it throughout today. The New York Times, which has had a fraught relationship with Joe Biden, has published a comprehensive look at what the president has been up to since Trump won re-election. You will learn that he appears older than ever, and even less willing than usual to entertain reporters. Biden has nothing public on his scheduled today, but is in Delaware to mark the anniversary of the car crash that killed his first wife and daughter.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/dec/18/trump-cheney-january-6-politics-latest-updates	2024-12-18T06:09:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4fe341f0ec9a4ffcdac66675dde9858aef672ab/0_193_5796_3478/master/5796.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=136f53c6db4b0a4119975c87c547e150

US violating law to fund Israel despite alleged human rights abuses, lawsuit says | First Thing	Suit claims state department is deliberately bypassing the Leahy law. Plus, New York grand jury charges Luigi Mangione with first-degree murder Good morning. The US state department is facing a new lawsuit – brought by Palestinians and Palestinian Americans – accusing it of deliberately circumventing a decades-old human rights law by continuing to fund Israeli military units accused of widespread atrocities in the occupied Palestinian territories. What is the Leahy law? Enacted in 1997, it was designed to prohibit US assistance to any security forces that the US identifies as being ineligible due to a gross violation of human rights. But, as one former state official told the Guardian earlier this year: -The rules were different for Israel.- What are the aims of the lawsuit? With the death toll in Gaza since last October reportedly approaching 45,000, humanitarian aid to the territory severely restricted, millions of people displaced and infrastructure decimated, the legal challenge demands judicial intervention to force the US to comply with the law. What happens now? The Kremlin has not yet indicated how it will retaliate. But RIA reported that the former president Dmitry Medvedev, now a senior Russian security official, said Ukraine’s military and political leadership faced revenge. What’s the latest on the frontlines? Russian forces took control of the villages of Trudove and Stari Terny in eastern Ukraine, RIA claimed. Meanwhile, North Korean forces have suffered -several hundred- casualties, according to a senior US military official.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/18/first-thing-us-violating-law-by-funding-israel-despite-alleged-human-rights-abuses-lawsuit-says	2024-12-18T04:51:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c44242eeadb3c26992463de49a18ae5d5e40c011/0_25_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1d11c7d61896aabc2e27020f1f7354e9

Reeves says compensating Waspi women not ‘best use of taxpayers’ money’ as backlash grows – UK politics live	Chancellor and PM have both defended not to pay compensation to Waspi women Good morning. Keir Starmer is facing his last PMQs of the year and, if he takes a glance at the papers this morning, he will find that he is being attacked by the Tory papers for not implementing a Jeremy Corbyn manifesto promise. Here are two of the headlines about yesterday’s announcement that the government will not compensate the so-called Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) women – women who lost out because they were not properly notified about the planned rise in their state pension age. The Daily Telegraph has not splashed on the story, but it does have it on the front, under the headline -Labour betrays Waspi women with U-turn on pension payouts-. It is true that, when Corbyn was leader, Labour did promise compensation for the Waspi women. But when the parliamentary and health service ombudsman (PHSO) recommended compensation worth up to £10bn in a report earlier this year, Keir Starmer very deliberately did not commit to implementing this, and his manifesto did not promise Waspi compensation.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/18/pmqs-starmer-badenoch-labour-tories-waspi-women	2024-12-18T01:24:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83775e089b50d6b7e285f2b3afddbdeebd2b9a46/0_286_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f17c6aa392ff0b526c87c23be13d8258
