MI5 files suggest queen was not briefed on spy in royal household for nine years	Documents indicate monarch was informed Anthony Blunt was Soviet agent in 1973, though he confessed in 1964 The late Queen Elizabeth II was not told for almost 10 years that Anthony Blunt, a surveyor of the queen’s pictures and a member of the royal household, had confessed to being a Soviet double agent, previously secret security files suggest. Declassified MI5 documents throw intriguing new light on how the security services closely guarded news that the art historian, of the notorious Cambridge Five spy ring, had confessed in April 1964, with records indicating the queen was only informed in 1973.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/14/mi5-files-queen-elizabeth-spy-in-royal-household-anthony-blunt	2025-01-13T16:01:42-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cf86535ae0dc4f9448bf1e3ad518795a0ae493e/0_112_4096_2457/master/4096.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9d32270703dcb6c3e66dbcc10a8264e7

Where there’s fire, there’s smoke: Los Angeles blazes raise fears of ‘super toxic’ lung damage	Concerns that dangerous fine particle pollution can become embedded in bloodstream and lungs The Los Angeles wildfires have claimed the lives of at least 24 people and have burned more than 100,000 structures. While the focus is understandably on avoiding the flames, another immediate danger lurks across the county and beyond, one more difficult to escape: smoke. The most dangerous component of wildfire smoke is fine particle pollution, also known as PM2.5 or soot. These tiny particles, smaller than one 20th the width of a human hair, can, if inhaled, become embedded in the bloodstream and lungs. It is estimated that about one-third of all particulate matter pollution in the US now comes from wildfire smoke.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/13/los-angeles-wildfires-smoke-exposures	2025-01-13T14:16:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e11173d30a3a548e43b7610a6084197d35f19692/0_122_6443_3866/master/6443.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40daa767f2bc6d83707a67daf5b8ce4b

JD Vance walks back Trump’s pledge to pardon January 6 protesters on day one – US politics live	Incoming vice-president says people who ‘committed violence’ shouldn’t be pardoned as surveys suggest blanket pardons would be unpopular with Americans Good morning, US politics blog readers. We’re one week out from Donald Trump’s inauguration as president, a day on which he has vowed to act like a dictator, and among the long list of things he has promised to do one his first day in office is pardon people convicted or accused of crimes over the January 6 insurrection. The few surveys done of the issue have indicated that a blanket pardon would be unpopular with Americans, and in an interview on Sunday, JD Vance seemed to walk back his boss’s pledge. -If you protested peacefully on January 6th … you should be pardoned-, the incoming vice-president told Fox News. -If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn’t be pardoned, and there’s a little bit of a gray area there, but we’re very much committed to seeing the equal administration of law.- For all the norms he has shattered, Trump would be far from the first American president to make big promises on the campaign trail then find reason not to keep them once he gets the job. We’ll find out what his supporters think of Vance’s comments as the day goes on. Confirmation hearings begin this week for Trump’s cabinet nominees, with the first scheduled for Tuesday. Some nominees, such as senator Marco Rubio to lead the state department, are expected to be approved with little tension. But others, think Pete Hegseth as defense secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr as secretary of health and human services and Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, will spark fights with Democrats. Joe Biden is looking to make the most of his final week as president, beginning with a speech today at 2pm ET from the state department about his foreign policy legacy. Los Angeles firefighters continue to combat blazes in and around the city, amid fears that another bout of gusty and hot weather could fuel more outbreaks.

‘Particularly dangerous’ wildfire weather returns to California and could linger for months, say experts	Forecasters say there won’t be winds as strong as last week’s record-setting gusts, but LA’s dry season will get worse When it comes to forecasting the conditions for catastrophic California wildfires, there are two main ingredients: fuels (think grasses, shrubs, trees – basically anything that’s available for fires to burn) and winds. When analyzing fuels, forecasters look mainly at the levels of drought, along with any recent rains that may help diminish the effect of longer-term drought. With winds, in southern California at least, it’s all about anticipating the Santa Anas – the fierce winds that blow offshore, from the deserts to the coast, bringing loads of dry air with them.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/13/california-wildfire-weather-conditions-forecast	2025-01-13T03:00:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83ce2e71dae054ed77a312a6fc6657edb6c39592/61_0_4881_2929/master/4881.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7852bfe309b81e20b047e966a9d3ef5a

Starmer claims AI could led to ‘golden age of public service reform’, even making services ‘feel more human’ – UK politics live	Government to publish AI opportunities action plan amid backdrop of economic difficulties in UK Good morning. Today the government wants to talk about AI (artificial intelligence). It is due to publish its AI opportunities action plan this morning, Keir Starmer is giving a speech on the topic, and Peter Kyle, the science secretary, is giving a statement to MPs later. The main elements have already been well trailed. Here is the Department for Science’s overnight news release, and here is a story by Robert Booth summing it all up. As usual, though, what the government wants to talk about and what it will end up being forced to talk about are not the same. The macro story that matters most in UK politics at the moment is the rise in UK government borrowing costs (largely driven by global economic developments, and the prospect of what Donald Trump will do when he becomes US president next week), and whether this will lead to fresh spending cuts in the spring. On the business live blog, Julia Kollewe says UK bond yields (borrowing costs) are marginally up again this morning.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/13/keir-starmer-labour-ai-yvette-cooper-tulip-siddiq-latest-politics-news-live	2025-01-13T01:23:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/840d45084eef6a8324b9d6fe2f3351625b814b0b/0_67_3214_1930/master/3214.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=daa6e8378b14630937da06728fc6946f

Tory police cuts are only part of the ongoing crisis affecting victims of crime	Austerity affected courts, prisons and public services while rates of poverty surged, creating the conditions for more crime The period in which clear-up rates for the most serious crimes collapsed coincided with big cuts to police budgets, and the subsequent fall in police officer numbers of about 20,000.

Then, in its final years, it started to reverse the cuts, and pretended -wokery- among law enforcement had diverted officers’ attention.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/13/slashed-police-budgets-crisis-uk-criminal-justice	2025-01-12T22:00:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49e1cf6e1349077f709d642e98f760cc3f56e535/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7facd143edaeaa2a98cd8e49018ecbda

Court ruling on Belgium’s conduct in colonial Africa hailed as turning point	Verdict of crimes against humanity for kidnap of mixed-race children could pave way for wider justice, activists say A historic court ruling that found Belgium guilty of crimes against humanity during its colonial rule of central Africa has been hailed as a turning point that could pave the way for compensation and other forms of justice. Belgium’s court of appeal ruled last month that the -systematic kidnapping- of mixed-race children from their African mothers in Belgian-ruled Congo, Rwanda and Burundi was a crime against humanity. The case was brought by five women who were removed from their Congolese mothers as small children between 1948 and 1953, and who now live in Belgium and France. Each was awarded €50,000 (£42,000) in damages.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/12/court-ruling-crimes-against-humanity-belgium-colonial-africa-hailed-turning-point	2025-01-12T06:01:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70364647ca15d3c05328eaa353bfe0b0582679ec/0_456_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a6120f4d4531ff91b67e24fe640651ce

Silicon Valley’s tycoons are bending the knee to Trump | Blake Montgomery	In 2017, Silicon Valley rebuked Trump’s travel ban. Today, it has reversed course and is bending over backwards with displays of deference to Trump On 28 January 2017, I rushed to the San Francisco international airport (SFO). Like elsewhere in the US that night, demonstrations were growing against a travel ban Donald Trump had issued against visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries. The night was chillier than normal, and I had not brought an adequate jacket. Luckily, the train to the airport was warm, full to the brim with jittery, talkative protesters. The airport itself was a rowdy scene: cabs and Ubers stalled as angry protesters blocked the roads, meters still running; demonstrators in hijabs prayed on their protest signs in baggage claim as others shouted at any arriving flyer coming for their luggage. Trump was the most outrageous man in America then, his election a shock to a wide swath of the world. After a few hours, whispers of a $150bn face floated through the crowd: Sergey Brin, creator and co-founder of Google, was there. At the time, he was the president of Google’s parent company Alphabet, which also owns YouTube.

California fires live: progress made against some LA blazes but thickening smoke prompts ‘health emergency’	Palisades and Eaton fires start coming under control as fierce winds ease but forecasters predict another red flag warning for Monday Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the California wildfires that have devastated six neighborhoods of Los Angeles county, killed at least 11 people and damaged or destroyed more than 12,000 structures. Firefighters finally started gaining control over two major wildfires on the eastern and western flanks of Los Angeles on Friday as fierce winds that supercharged the fires for days eased. The Palisades fire, at 21,317 acres and 8% containment The Eaton fire, at 13,690 acres and 3% containment The Kenneth fire, at 1,052 acres and 50% containment The Hurst fire, at 771 acres and 37% containment The Lidia fire, at 395 acres and 98% containment The Archer fire, at 19 acres and 0% containment Six deaths have been confirmed in the Eaton fire and five in the Palisades. As family members have been alerted to the loss of their loved ones, six of the victims have been publicly identified. Law enforcement officials expect the death toll to rise once weather and fire conditions allow cadaver dogs and detectives into the burn zones. Conditions in the Los Angeles area were forecast to improve through the weekend, with sustained winds slowing to about 20mph (32km/h), gusting between 35-50mph, according to the National Weather Service, a respite from recent wind gusts of 80mph. -It’s not as gusty, so that should help firefighters,- NWS meteorologist Allison Santorelli said, adding that conditions were still critical with low humidity and dry vegetation. Forecasters predicted another red flag warning would be issued for Monday. Fire chief Kristin Crowley criticised city officials over water supply issues and budget cuts that she says hindered her department’s ability to fight the Palisades fire. The water supply has become a focal point, with California governor Gavin Newsom calling for an investigation into the shortage. Newsom has invited Donald Trump to visit the state and tour the the LA wildfires’ devastation. Trump visited the state six years ago in the wake of the Camp fire, the most destructive fire in California history, which hit the town of Paradise. The state of California issued a one-year moratorium preventing insurance companies from canceling or refusing to renew home policies in zip codes impacted by the Palisades and Eaton fires. Fire agencies are investigating whether Southern California Edison’s utility infrastructure sparked a brush fire that is still burning in a Los Angeles suburb, SCE said on Friday, adding no determination has been made. SCE, a unit of US utility Edison International, said in a filing to its regulators that a downed conductor was discovered at a tower associated with its Eagle Rock – Sylmar 220 kV circuit. -SCE does not know whether the damage observed occurred before or after the start of the fire,- it said.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/11/california-fires-la-fires-live-updates-latest-news	2025-01-10T23:16:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80c17a89ee8f6bb37c80659a71ead40b9cf18c8b/0_274_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bcc8f27f6817807d5c7e350012d223d7

Los Angeles officials expect the death toll from the wildfires in the county to continue to rise, as workers comb through incinerated neighborhoods with cadaver dogs. How big are the fires?

Labour has worked very hard to ‘restore economic credibility’, minister says – UK politics live	Culture secretary Lisa Nandy defends chancellor amid economic turbulence Culture secretary Lisa Nandy has said she believes that the Labour government is still -on track- with its ambition for the UK to be -the fastest growing economy in Europe.- Conceding that the budget decision to increase national insurance contributions on employers was -a difficult one for many companies-, she told listeners of the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the government was not going back to the -bad old days- of Tory budgets. She said: We inherited an economy where it was hard to see who had confidence, both to invest, and particularly for consumers to be able to feel that they could spend, given the huge fluctuations that we’d seen, particularly after the Liz Truss/Kwasi Kwarteng mini-budget. The chancellor has been absolutely clear that we are not going back to those bad old days. We have had two interest rate cuts since she became chancellor, and we have worked very hard to restore economic credibility. We are not only confident that we’re on track, but the OECD is confident that we’re on track to become the fastest growing economy in Europe. Culture secretary Lisa Nandy has defended chancellor Rachel Reeves’ visit to China amid economic turbulence Reeves is reported to be considering imposing steeper cuts to public services to repair the government’s finances after a bruising week in which investors drove up the cost of UK borrowing and pushed the pound to a 14-month low Health secretary Wes Streeting has defended the growing use of the private sector to help tackle long waiting lists in England for treatment, but said providers must -pull their weight- and not take resources away from the NHS The co-leader of the Scottish Greens, Patrick Harvie, has said his party was yet to make a -final decision- on whether to back the draft Scottish budget A committee of MPs has criticised the Ministry of Defence for being behind the times on the use of artificial intelligence in the military] The number of people in England and Wales who sought help with energy bills jumped by 20% last year, according to Citizens Advice	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/10/uk-politics-latest-news-labour-rachel-reeves-bond-markets	2025-01-10T00:59:40-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82bfd244683f0c63512c2f4a562dba03a5c8eb20/0_0_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=93cee67ec3ec1500f22d1c068cf7222f
US supreme court to hear arguments in TikTok ban-or-sale case	Latest battle over whether to ban the app will force justices to weigh importance of security with freedom of speech The US supreme court will hear oral arguments over the fate of TikTok on Friday. It’s the latest battle in the long war over whether to ban the tremendously popular social media app in the US – and will force the justices to weigh the importance of national security with the freedom of speech. TikTok and its parent company, Chinese-based ByteDance, asked the supreme court to review the case after a lower court ruled last month to uphold a law to ban the app in the US. That ban is scheduled to go into effect on 19 January, unless ByteDance sells TikTok’s assets to a non-Chinese company. While ByteDance has the option to divest, it claimed in a legal filing that divestiture -is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally-.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/10/us-supreme-court-tiktok-ban-sale-bill	2025-01-10T00:57:21-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f14922a7766f55097b07031906e4c6a7d2bbb37e/1287_854_4733_2840/master/4733.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5e816d41bd3b57dea1c1c6274e43688c

LA fires live updates: at least seven deaths as California wildfires rage and crews battle new fire	Palisades, Kenneth, Eaton fires remain uncontrolled as Los Angeles officials say ‘historic winds’ and extensive droughts have created the ‘perfect storm’ Hello, and welcome to our live coverage of the wildfires in California, where some of the worst blazes in the region’s history have ravaged homes and reduced entire neighbourhoods to ash. I’m Petra Stock. It’s approaching 8pm in Los Angeles and here is a recap of what you need to know. The Palisades fire, at 19,978 acres and 6% containment The Eaton fire, at 13,690 acres and 0% containment The Kenneth fire, at 960 acres and 0% containment The Hurst fire, at 671 acres and 10% containment The Lidia fire, at 348 acres and 60% containment Seven people have died, and more than 10,000 structures have burned, in the Palisades and Eaton fires. Five deaths have been confirmed in the Eaton fire and two in the Palisades. The Palisades fire, which had remained 0% contained since it broke out Tuesday, was 6% contained by 6pm Thursday. A new fire, now called the Kenneth fire, sparked around 3:34pm and quickly ballooned to 960 acres. President Joe Biden has announced that the federal government would pay for 100% of the firefighting needs for the next 180 days. Law enforcement officials are working to issue a curfew for affected burn zones in Los Angeles, in order to combat looting, though it is unclear when it will go into effect. Vice-president Kamala Harris canceled a trip to Singapore, Bahrain and Germany shortly after President Biden canceled a trip to Italy in order to more closely monitor the fires. The California prison system has now deployed nearly 800 incarcerated firefighters to fight the devastating blazes.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/10/la-fires-live-updates-california-los-angeles-wildfires-fire-map-latest-news	2025-01-09T19:36:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91a838607c4536aa6b71519444bdc53cae9d3f72/0_3_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=50d72be040640e281f7eb9279c77eb4b

Out-of-state residents made up vast majority of Kansas abortions in 2023	Rise in abortions and patients from states such as Texas show how access has shifted since Roe’s overturning Kansas providers performed a historic number of abortions in 2023 – and most of them were performed on out-of-state residents – in a sign of just how much the 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade has rewritten the map of abortion access and led women to flee their home states for the procedure.

David Lammy says Trump’s rhetoric can be ‘destabilising’ but threat to invade Greenland won’t happen – UK politics live	Foreign secretary says Trump’s comments should be understood as reflection of his concerns about Arctic security Good morning. For the first time in six months, David Lammy, the foreign secretary, was put up by No 10 to do the morning broadcast interview round – ahead of a speech he is giving later. At PMQs yesterday, perhaps surprisingly, Keir Starmer was not asked about Donald Trump’s suggestion that he might invade Greenland, an autonomous territory that belongs to Denmark. The French and German governments have both condemned Trump’s comments. But, in an interview with the Today programme, Lammy was rather more diplomatic. Lammy said that, although Trump’s language could be -destabilising-, he did not always do what he threatened. Asked about Trump’s comments, Lammy said: I think that we know from Donald Trump’s first term that the intensity of his rhetoric, and the unpredictability sometimes of what he says, can be destabilising. He did it with Nato. But in fact, in practice, he sent more troops to Europe under his administration. He sent the first Javelins [anti-tank weapons] and weapons to Ukraine under his administration. Lammy said that Trump would not use military force to seize Greenland – despite suggesting he might. Asked if the UK should be following France and Germany in saying this would be unacceptable, Lammy replied: Let’s be serious … It’s not going to happen because no Nato allies have gone to war since the birth of Nato which Ernest Bevin, my great predecessor, was part of. Lammy said Trump’s comments should be understood as reflection of his concerns about Arctic security. He explained: Here, I suspect on Greenland, what he’s targeting is his concerns about Russia and China in the Arctic, his concerns about national economic security. He recognises, I’m sure, that in the end, Greenland today is a Kingdom of Denmark. There is a debate in Greenland about their own self determination. But behind it, I think, are his concerns about the Arctic. Of course, the US has troops and a base on Greenland. So it has got a stake in that Arctic region.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/09/uk-politics-labour-conservatives-david-lammy-trump-greenland-latest-updates	2025-01-09T01:13:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22c61051e995e1dc39b88c1bf75d8429f40446ab/98_492_4419_2652/master/4419.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=23e73b51fa9dbc1a4a372ae644056b11

Amber alerts have been extended and will now run until 12 January, meaning a rise in deaths is likely, the agency said. Dr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at the UKHSA, said: We are extending the duration of our cold health alert, since the Met Office are forecasting that the low temperatures we are seeing will continue further into this week, with snow and icy conditions likely to persist. This weather can have a serious impact on the health of some people, including those aged 65 and over and those with pre-existing health conditions, and it is therefore vital that we continue to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are most vulnerable.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2025/jan/09/uk-weather-warnings-snow-ice-sleet-temperatures-fall-transport	2025-01-09T00:40:17-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/108791f99685f0633a60fa0980490f310618e416/0_259_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2c93450e81ae58897127a8551b264b02

California fires live: Los Angeles fighting largest blaze in its history amid water and firefighting shortages	Palisades fire grows to more than 15,000 acres as Eaton and Hurst fires also gain in size; Biden directs DoD to deploy extra firefighters to tackle flames About 1.5 million residents are without power in southern California, with nearly a million of them in Los Angeles County, according to PowerOutage.us, as wildfires continue to rage across the region. The Palisades fire, which is the most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles’ history, has increased in size yet again – now encompassing 15,832 acres. At least two people were killed in the Eaton fire, north of Pasadena which has grown to 10,600 acres and has destroyed more than 100 structures. There have also been -a number of significant injuries-, fire officials said, and -tens of thousands of homes- are affected. About 32,500 residents were under evacuation orders, a drop from the more than 50,000 residents evacuated overnight. The Palisades fire, west of Los Angeles, has grown to 11,802 acres and destroyed more than 1,000 structures, making it the most destructive fire in the city’s history. About 37,000 residents are under evacuation orders. The Hurst fire, in the San Fernando Valley, is close to 500 acres after erupting on Tuesday night. More than 3,000 residents have been ordered to evacuate the area in Sylmar. All Los Angeles fire department air operations in the Palisades have resumed after being grounded due to extreme weather conditions. LAFD helicopters are back to dropping water and hundreds of firefighters continue to be on the scene to help respond to the Palisades fire and Hurst fire, said LA’s mayor, Karen Bass. More than 400,000 power customers were without power, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us. Another 440,000 customers could face similar shutoffs depending on weather conditions. Officials are urging residents across the region to conserve water so there is enough for firefighters to use. Demand was so high that three tanks emptied by Wednesday morning, causing some fire hydrants to dry out. California governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on Tuesday. President Joe Biden warned the recovery -is going to take time- as he attended a briefing with Newsom at a Santa Monica fire station. President-elect Donald Trump blamed Newsom’s environmental policies for the fires.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/08/california-los-angeles-fires-live-updates	2025-01-08T13:58:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea29802fba69f1cf43c2ff2d7beae28d6d1dff47/0_368_5561_3339/master/5561.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d9f68d22674127ce7c46e1ba3c13387b

Biden may preemptively pardon Liz Cheney, Anthony Fauci, after Trump’s threats of revenge – US politics live	Biden confirms he may still opt to protect Trump’s enemies from prosecution, while Trump scrambles to halt sentencing in criminal business fraud case Good morning, US politics blog readers. Joe Biden is in his final days in office, and still has a few pieces of unfinished business to deal with before he hands power to Donald Trump on 20 January. One of them is deciding whether to issue preemptive pardons to political enemies of the incoming president, such as former congresswoman Liz Cheney or Anthony Fauci, who spearheaded the fight against Covid-19 in Trump’s first term. In an interview with USA Today published today – a rare, final sit-down interview by a president who spent much of his term avoiding the press – Biden confirmed he may still opt to protect Trump’s enemies from prosecution, and signaled he would decide based on who the president-elect appoints to top roles in his administration. Meanwhile, Trump is scrambling to halt the sentencing in his criminal business fraud case that is scheduled to take place in a Manhattan court on Friday. Reuters reports that his attorneys have asked the US supreme court to intervene to pause the proceedings, though the New York judge presiding over the case has signaled he is unlikely to sentence the president-elect to jail time. We will let you if the nation’s highest court responds. Trump will this evening trek to Capitol Hill for a strategy meeting with the Republican senators tasked with enacting his administration’s priorities, ranging from mass deportations to extending tax cuts enacted during his first term. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the rightwing Georgia congresswoman, says she will introduce legislation to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the -Gulf of America-, as Trump proposed at a rambling press conference yesterday.

He acknowledged in December that he agreed with some parts of the project, but didn’t say which, claiming he didn’t read it and didn’t have any part in it. -They have some things that are very conservative and very good. They have other things that I don’t like,- he told Time magazine.

Plus, the rise in ‘flaking’ out of social plans Good morning. California has deployed more than 1,400 firefighters in its attempts to quell the -unprecedented- wildfires that have ripped through the state’s south, said the California governor, Gavin Newsom. The fires, which have been fueled by a windstorm, have forced tens of thousands to evacuate their homes, including in affluent neighborhoods in Los Angeles. What are the Santa Ana winds? They’re common during the winter months in southern California, and have driven many of the state’s worst fires.

Malawi sees influx of refugees from post-election violence in Mozambique	Marauding gangs and political unrest since October’s polls have driven thousands of Mozambicans across the border into Malawi, despite its drought, food and fuel shortages On a sunny Saturday afternoon, Manase Madia, 50, shows his Mozambican identity card. Once a sign of pride, he does not know what to believe in any more. Over the past few weeks he has seen houses being burned down, and shops and businesses looted, including his own. He now fears for his family, which has scattered in fear. At a community ground where officials are processing new arrivals before being transferred to a shelter, Madia is one of about 13,000 people who have crossed into Malawi in the past two months, seeking refuge from post-election violence in Mozambique. The arrival of the refugees, albeit in smaller numbers, is reminiscent for people here of the civil war when almost a million Mozambicans sought refuge in the neighbouring southern African nation in the 1980s and early 1990s.	https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jan/08/malawi-sees-influx-of-refugees-from-post-election-violence-in-mozambique	2025-01-08T03:02:59-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80d7b27e8a4d387686361b8e8cc8c41f73312040/422_0_1875_1125/master/1875.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1b523995f15bee171cf50963f7f2e5b4

Top Tory claims Elon Musk ‘may have saved humanity’ as Starmer attacks Badenoch over child safety – UK politics live	Prime minister says if Tories vote for amendment on children’s wellbeing bill, it will show ‘they are more interested in retweets than children’s safety’ as shadow business secretary praises Musk Good morning. Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch will be in the Commons today for the first PMQs of 2025 and the Tory calls for national inquiry into grooming gangs will continue to be near the top of the news agenda. That is because Badenoch is pushing for a vote on the children’s wellbeing and schools bill that would block the legislation and call on the government to set up an inquiry instead. The inquiry element is a procedural red herring because the Conservatives would have voted against the bill anyway. But, if the Speaker does allow a vote on the Tory reasoned amendment, Badenoch will be able to launch a social media campaign accusing Labour of voting against a grooming gang inquiry. The Conservatives are opposed to the bill primarily because it will restrict some of the freedoms enjoyed by academies. But the legislation also contains safeguarding measures that have widespread support, and Starmer has given an interview to the Daily Mirror saying that, if the Tories vote for their amendment, it will show they are more interested in retweets than children’s safety. He told the paper: I would implore any right-thinking Tory MP to vote for the bill because [the Conservative reasoned amendment] would kill the bill, this would kill the legislation. It would kill the provisions for a unique identifying number that will stop children falling through the cracks … No MP should be voting down children’s safeguarding measures. It’s shocking they are even thinking about this as a tactic. It’s the elevation of the desire for retweets over any real interest in the safeguarding of children. The @elonmusk purchase of X may have saved humanity. With X becoming a true freedom of speech platform, the common ground of public opinion is no longer determined by a left-leaning elite.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/08/conservatives-elon-musk-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-child-safety-pmqs-uk-politics-latest-updates	2025-01-08T01:41:29-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e40c507446dd3da2bfcb442b9e4d40b96ddd0146/0_246_7536_4522/master/7536.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6408a15555e5a791a04e82278b6fb357

A fresh weather warning is set to come into force as it is revealed that 300 properties have flooded across England since New Year’s Eve, reports the PA news agency. Dozens of people have been rescued by firefighters across Leicestershire since Monday, Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service said. Homeowners on Belton Road in Loughborough were stranded on the first floor of their semi-detached houses on Tuesday after rising water from the nearby Grand Union canal flooded the street. Patients have been urged to attend A&amp;E alone as NHS hospitals grapple with high demand amid rising flu cases. Several NHS trusts declared critical incidents due to -exceptionally high demands- in emergency departments. Hundreds of schools were closed across the UK on Tuesday, with road and rail links blocked. Manchester, Bristol and Liverpool John Lennon airports were forced to suspend flights because of the conditions. The RAC said Monday was the busiest day for breakdowns this winter.

Wednesday briefing: What Elon Musk’s focus on grooming gangs reveals about alt-right online discourse	In today’s newsletter: The owner of X, who previously said ‘civil war is inevitable’ in Britain, has stoked online unrest with incendiary comments about the UK Good morning. What is a news story in the UK? Whatever Elon Musk says it is. That is the conclusion you might draw, anyway, from the influence of the billionaire Trump adviser’s posts on X claiming that -a quarter-million little girls were – still are – being systematically raped by migrant gangs in Britain-, and demanding a new public inquiry into historic child sexual exploitation in Oldham, Rotherham, Rochdale and elsewhere. There is no reliable basis for the quarter-million figure. In any case, Prof Alexis Jay, the chair of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse in England and Wales that looked extensively at grooming gang scandals and published a series of recommendations in 2022, said yesterday that -we’ve had enough of inquiries, consultations and discussions-, and urged the government to instead implement more of her proposals. But the political energy is still around the idea of a new inquiry as some sort of panacea, and the Conservatives will try to force a vote on one in parliament today. Social media | Meta will get rid of factcheckers, -dramatically reduce the amount of censorship- and recommend more political content on Facebook and Instagram, founder Mark Zuckerberg has said. The suite of changes was met with dismay by critics, who described them as -a full bending of the knee to Trump-. British army | Afghans who were killed by members of the SAS in Afghanistan were described dismissively as having been -flat packed-, according to a former member of the elite force’s sister unit. The soldier, known only as N1799, was giving evidence to an inquiry into the deaths of 80 civilians in Helmand province. California | A fast-moving wildfire erupted in Los Angeles on Tuesday, quickly consuming nearly 3,000 acres and destroying homes in an affluent community along the Pacific Ocean. Amid a significant windstorm across much of southern California, a second unrelated blaze also forced evacuations in a different part of Los Angeles. France | Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of France’s far-right National Front party, who sent shock waves through the country when he made it to the second round of the presidential election in 2002, has died at 96. Drugs | Ketamine could be reclassified as a class A drug by the Home Office after illegal use reached record levels last year. Ministers are seeking -expert advice- on reclassification – it is currently a class B substance – after an estimated 299,000 people reported use of the drug in 2024.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/08/wednesday-briefing-what-elon-musks-focus-on-grooming-gangs-reveals-about-alt-right-online-discourse	2025-01-07T22:52:36-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e5573231a4bfc5fd11849cc4f48a2b5e07932c9/0_94_5665_3400/master/5665.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ac294ec52d863e7a55d44ee0a98d699f

Trump moves to block report on election interference and classified documents cases – US politics live	President-elect’s lawyers ask attorney general to stop release of outgoing special counsel Jack Smith’s report Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump may be less than two weeks away from returning to the White House, but his lawyers are keeping busy with motions to frustrate the final developments in his lingering criminal cases. Yesterday, they asked New York judge Juan Merchan to delay the president-elect’s sentencing on the 34 felony business fraud charges he was convicted of last year, but their motion was denied and the hearing is expected to take place on Friday. The case, brought by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, was the only one of Trump’s four criminal indictments to go to trial before his election victory in November. His prosecution in Georgia for allegedly meddling in the state’s election result four years ago has stalled, likely permanently, while special counsel Jack Smith dropped the charges he brought against Trump for allegedly hiding classified documents, and plotting to overturn the 2020 election. However, justice department regulations mandate that Smith release a report at the end of his investigations, which could bring to light damaging evidence about Trump’s actions. Late yesterday, the president-elect’s attorneys asked outgoing attorney general Merrick Garland to prevent the report’s completion. We’ll let you know if Garland makes his response known today. Donald Trump Jr is scheduled to arrive in Greenland today, the massive island that his father has talked about the United States buying from Denmark. We’ll see how that visit goes. Jimmy Carter will lie in state at the US Capitol today, with Kamala Harris laying a wreath on his casket and eulogizing him at 4.30pm ET. The House of Representatives will vote on the Laken Riley Act, an early step in the forthcoming Republican crackdown on undocumented immigrants that would mandate they be taken into custody by immigration authorities over theft charges.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/07/us-politics-live-trump-justice-department-carter	2025-01-07T06:14:29-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a87998451f37fe2227573f5b7926836d987e38b/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a05ca689298c26c421d7d72fe054dd1d

Congress certified Donald Trump’s presidential election victory yesterday in an event heavy with symbolism, four years to the day since he incited a violent mob in attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat. What were November’s final results? Trump won the electoral college by 312 to 226, and the popular vote by a margin of about 2.5m. What did Harris say yesterday? -I do believe very strongly that America’s democracy is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it,- she told reporters. -Otherwise, it is very fragile, and it will not be able to withstand moments of crisis. And today, America’s democracy stood.- The president, Joe Biden, wrote an op-ed urging Americans not to forget the Capitol attack. What do we know about the quake’s ferocity? The US Geological Survey said the earthquake was centred in the Tibet region at a depth of about 10km (6 miles). It measured the tremor at a magnitude of 7.1, while China recorded it as 6.8.

Child abuse inquiry chair attacks ‘politicisation’ of issue and says new investigation would delay reforms – UK politics live	Prof Alexis Jay says ‘many people, sometimes in a very uninformed way, have waded into the argument’ over whether a further inquiry was needed Good morning. Keir Starmer is basking in praise from liberal, progressive Britain today for the way he hit back at calls for a new inquiry into child sexual abuse scandals, and the way they are being driven by inflammatory and false claims by Elon Musk and other rightwingers on X. But Tory Britain has yet to be persuaded, and the rightwing papers are promoting the Conservative party’s (very dubious) claim that Starmer was smearing anyone opposed to child rape as far-right. This morning Prof Alexis Jay stepped into this argument. As the main chair of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA), the eight-year, all-encompassing inquiry into child sexual abuse in Britain, she has as much authority on this subject as anyone. Today she clearly came out against calls from Musk, Reform UK, the Tories and others for a new national inquiry focusing specifically on rape or grooming gangs. No, I don’t agree with that, in the sense of requiring further and more detailed national inquiries into child sexual exploitation. We have learned quite a lot from those reviews that have already been undertaken. I think that the time has passed for more inquiries. We’ve had enough of inquiries, consultations and discussions, and especially for those victims and survivors who’ve had the courage to come forward … They clearly want action, and we have set out what action is required, and people should just get on with it, locally and nationally. I would not attribute that to everyone, but I’ve certainly been very unhappy about the politicisation of child sexual exploitation and child sexual abuse in the way that many people, sometimes in a very uninformed way, have waded into the argument.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/07/child-abuse-grooming-gangs-elon-musk-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live-updates	2025-01-07T01:14:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/981d9fd4f58f51b0473b6ae2ce0d6ada5159dc1e/0_301_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=85d64bd110195bb1473385fe74ccc762

Tuesday briefing: How Britain has coped with an Arctic blast	In today’s newsletter: Widespread flooding, snow and power outages have left thousands of households and travellers facing the aftermath of a cold snap – with more disruption to come Good morning. British winters have grown markedly milder over the past century: analysis has shown that the average UK winter has gotten 1C warmer and 15% wetter in the last century. Last February was the warmest in recorded history. There have been fewer and fewer snow days and the Met Office found that ground frost periods are three weeks shorter compared to the 1970s. Canada | Justin Trudeau has said he will step down as Canada’s prime minister. His resignation throws open the doors to a fierce political battle to be the country’s next leader, with polls showing the Liberals losing badly to the official opposition Conservatives. Child sexual exploitation | Keir Starmer has condemned Elon Musk’s increasingly erratic attacks on the government, suggesting that his -lies and misinformation- on grooming gangs were amplifying the -poison- of the far right. Ministers meanwhile promised to implement a key demand of a 2022 child sex abuse inquiry so that professionals who do not report claims of abuse will be sanctioned. US politics | The US Congress certified Donald Trump’s presidential election victory on Monday, in an event heavy with symbolism four years to the day since he incited a violent mob to disrupt a similar ceremony. Kamala Harris presided over a joint Senate and House of Representatives session to validate the result. Foster care | The UK is facing a fostering crisis where retiring carers are not being replaced by younger people, while the number of children entering care homes is rising, a charity has warned. The decline in foster carers is due to the impact of the pandemic, the costof living crisis, biological children staying at home for longer, spare rooms being used as home offices and changing family situations, Barnardo’s children’s charity said. Tibet | A magnitude 6.8 earthquake has struck near one of Tibet’s holiest cities, the China Earthquake Networks Centre has said, killing 53 people, injuring 62 and damaging buildings around Shigatse, according to state media.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/07/tuesday-briefing-how-britain-has-coped-with-an-arctic-blast	2025-01-06T22:34:35-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99894d56e5d340c61cd130ff0b7d0d2f538e2dea/0_366_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d3bb5fa4c5ed304567b96230e54ab9b7

Congress to certify Trump’s election win four years after insurrection – US politics live	Senate and House to convene in joint session to certify results four years after Trump’s supporters stormed Capitol Good morning, US politics blog readers. It is January 6, the legally designated day when the Senate and House of Representatives convene in a joint session to certify the results of the presidential election – in this case, Donald Trump’s victory two months ago. Today’s meeting comes four years after the then-president’s supporters stormed the Capitol after he addressed them outside the White House, a historic attack that Trump’s successor, Joe Biden, tried and ultimately failed to have him prosecuted over. There’s no sign that a repeat of those events will take place this year. Washington DC is socked in by a snowstorm that’s snarled roads across parts of the east coast and midwest, the Capitol is under heavy guard, and, unlike the Republicans who in 2021 tried to used procedural moves to block Biden from taking office, no congressional Democrats have signaled plans to object to Trump’s re-election during the session. The session is set to begin at 1pm ET, with Kamala Harris presiding in her role as president of the Senate. Once Trump’s victory is certified, it will clear the way for his inauguration two weeks from today, on 20 January. Trump on Sunday said he will support efforts by Republicans in Congress to pass one massive piece of legislation that will enact many of his campaign promises, including better fortifying the country’s borders and removing taxes on tips. There had been some debate among the GOP over whether to split those priorities up into separate bills, but with that decided (for now), expect Republicans to spend the next several months getting that legislation through Congress. Biden wrote on opinion piece for the Washington Post, in which he encouraged Americans not to forget the insurrection that took place four years ago today. Seven US states in the midwest and east coast have declared emergencies as a big winter storm blows through.

Trump and Republicans plot radical policy agenda in one ‘big, beautiful bill’	House speaker says party seeks single piece of legislation covering tax cuts, immigration and military spending Donald Trump is working with top Republicans in Congress to devise a single -big, beautiful bill- that will contain all of his major policy ambitions – including a clampdown on immigration, tax cuts, and increased military spending in an attempt to supercharge his radical agenda as he embarks on a second presidency. The plan to pile all of Trump’s main policy goals into one mega-bill, against the wishes of some top congressional Republicans, raises the prospect of months of potentially bruising political in-fighting needed to secure its passage. Though the Republicans hold both chambers of Congress, their margin in the House is the slimmest in almost a century.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/06/trump-republicans-policy-agenda-bill	2025-01-06T03:00:47-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b22e9f8eae97b94047d7960010182dec306dd52/0_19_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8e3d72b726b661084f8232c232331277

Convicted January 6 rioters anticipate Trump pardons four years after US Capitol attack | First Thing	‘We’re excited that we have our country back,’ one convicted man said. Plus, Adrien Brody wins Golden Globe for The Brutalist Good morning. Once back in power, Donald Trump has promised he will pardon people prosecuted over the assault on the Capitol four years ago today. Carried out by a mob of Trump’s supporters after he had addressed them outside the White House, the 6 January 2021 attack brought political violence into the halls of Congress and has been linked to nine deaths among police and rioters. How many have been charged? The justice department has charged more than 1,500 people, nearly 600 of whom have faced felony charges of assaulting or impeding law enforcement. How popular would the move be? For all the enthusiasm among Trump’s supporters, a December poll from Monmouth University found that 61% of respondents would disapprove of Trump pardoning people convicted of attacking the Capitol. What do we know about the attack? Jabber’s truck displayed an IS flag. A rifle he used in the shootout was bought privately from someone who did not know what he had planned. Officials said Jabbar – who wore body armor and a helmet – had fashioned a homemade device meant to suppress the noise of gunshots fired by the rifle. What do authorities believe about the motive? Indications suggest Jabbar fell into extremism after marital and financial woes.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/06/first-thing-convicted-january-6-rioters-anticipate-trump-pardon-us-capitol-attack	2025-01-06T02:46:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21466ef563ff78864d7783feecef3d3b336ce875/0_185_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ee0ba5980be86089357d585b859fe2ec

Firms that donated to Republican party avoided tariffs in Trump first term – study	President-elect has threatened to levy tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China, which can burden businesses With Donald Trump threatening to impose steep tariffs upon his return to office this month, US firms are bracing for impact. But an analysis of Trump’s last presidency identified one way to boost their chances of avoiding the levies: donating to the Republican party. While the initial stage of the president-elect’s tariff agenda is designed to hit America’s largest trading partners – Canada, Mexico and China – it is US firms that pick up the bill, paying duties imposed on the goods they buy from these markets.

Middle East crisis live: Israel and Hamas wrangle over potential ceasefire and hostage deal	Disagreements over deal continue as Palestinian officials say more than 100 people died over the weekend due to Israeli bombardments Israel and Hamas are wrangling over the details of a potential deal to halt Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip and return hostages home, as Palestinian officials said intensified Israeli bombardments had killed more than 100 people over the weekend. A Hamas official said the group had approved a list of 34 Israeli hostages to be returned as part of a deal that could eventually lead to a ceasefire, Reuters reported. But Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office swiftly issued a statement on Sunday saying Hamas had not provided such a list. Israeli military airstrikes continued throughout the Gaza Strip on Sunday, with an airstrike killing five people in a house in the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza and another killing four in Jabalia in the territory’s north, Gaza health officials said. Later in the day, an airstrike hit a police station in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, killing five people, medics said. It was not immediately clear if all the people who were killed were police officers. At nightfall, medics said an Israeli airstrike had killed three people in Bureij camp in central Gaza, bringing Sunday’s death toll to 17. Two Palestinians, including a 17-year-old boy, were killed by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank on Sunday, according to the Palestinian Fatah party and the Palestinian health ministry. Palestinian media said Israeli forces opened fire on the home of a 37-year-old man in a town south of Jenin. The health ministry said the 17-year-old was killed in an Israeli raid in Askar camp in Nablus. The Israeli military said its forces killed an armed militant in the West Bank, confiscated weapons and dismantled an explosives manufacturing laboratory. Separately, it said it was looking into reports that a 17-year-old was killed. Social order in Gaza is likely to collapse further if Israel goes ahead with its threat this month to end all cooperation with the UN refugee agency for Palestinians (Unrwa), Louise Wateridge, its senior emergency officer, has warned. Gunmen opened fire on vehicles, including a passenger bus, on Monday near a village in the occupied West Bank, killing three people and injuring at least seven others, the Israeli military and emergency services said. -Paramedics have confirmed the deaths of three victims, including two women and a man,- emergency service provider Magen David Adom said, while the military reported that troops were -pursuing the terrorists- who carried out the attack near the village of Al-Funduq. Antony Blinken will meet his European counterparts Thursday in Rome on Syria, as the west looks to engage the new Islamist-led leadership.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike last year while inside the militant group’s war operations room, according to new details on Sunday disclosed by a senior Hezbollah security official, the Associated Press reports. -His eminence [Nasrallah] used to lead the battle and war from this location,- Wafiq Safa told a news conference on Sunday near the site where Nasrallah was killed. A series of Israeli airstrikes flattened several buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs on 27 September last year, killing Nasrallah.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/06/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-hamas-potential-ceasefire-hostage-deal	2025-01-06T00:35:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0052fde5a74082653f33e9a3d98220081e145a08/0_183_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e0c0dcb1664b6b87dc40d3ecfcf3284c

How Elon Musk’s X became the global right’s supercharged front page	Musk has now used X as a platform to make aggressive interventions in US politics – and in those of other countries As a business proposition, Elon Musk’s ownership of X, formerly known as Twitter, has so far been a disaster: since he acquired X in late 2022, the social media company, according to one estimate, has lost nearly 80% of its value. As a political proposition, however, Musk’s purchase may turn out to be one of the shrewdest investments of all time. Every week, the platform seems to supercharge a news issue that comes to dominate conservative discourse – and often mainstream discourse, as well – with real political repercussions.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/04/elon-musk-x-trump-far-right	2025-01-04T04:00:48-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/822c87019ee72cf98aa27a9fd638d9986db64840/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2df10c2df844ea0079039e74eae31cfc

First Thing: Arrest of South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol fails amid security force standoff	Anti-corruption officials say they were blocked by 200 presidential personnel. Plus, FBI says New Orleans terror suspect acted alone Good morning. South Korea’s political crisis took a dramatic turn on Friday when investigators were forced to abandon an attempt to arrest the impeached president, Yoon Suk Yeol, after a tense standoff with his security forces. What are the details of Friday’s standoff? Local media reports said anti-corruption officials – who are leading a joint team of police and prosecutors – entered the compound to find themselves blocked by troops under the control of the presidential security service. What happened on 3 December? Yoon declared martial law in an attempt to root out what he described as -anti-state, pro-North Korean- forces – a reference to opposition MPs in the national assembly. He did not provide any evidence for those claims, however. He was forced to lift the order six hours later after lawmakers forced their way past troops into the parliament building to vote it down. What do we know about the New Orleans attack suspect? It’s understood Jabbar was born and raised in Texas, served in the US army 2007-2015, and in 2022 was $27,000 behind on house payments, he said in court documents. Jabbar’s brother told AP that in recent months he’d isolated himself. Why didn’t steel bollards stop the attack? Seven years ago, officials began installing barriers at intersections in the French Quarter of the city. But the steel bollards were in the process of being replaced over New Year’s Eve.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/03/first-thing-arrest-of-south-korean-president-yoon-suk-yeol-fails-amid-security-force-standoff	2025-01-03T02:32:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa19edbf0482114c05b6dac6818d0ae662ff4005/0_0_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=37343acafc9f657f0c3d835c4b097dc5

Streeting defends pace of plans for adult social care reform – UK politics live	Ministers to launch historic commission to reform ‘failing’ system amid warnings the NHS risks being overwhelmed Wes Streeting has set out overnight for the Guardian his view on the new Labour government’s proposal for adult social care reform. The health secretary wrote: By 2050, there will be 4 million more people aged 65+ in England than today. If we do nothing, real social care costs are expected to nearly double by 2038, compared with 2018 numbers. Many more people will be left without the care they need, the burdens will fall on the health service and our NHS will be overwhelmed. We can’t keep paying a heavier and heavier price for failure. Our NHS can’t afford to keep bearing a heavier burden. We can’t afford not to act. Labour took a lot of flak in the general election campaign for not spelling out in more detail our plans for a National Care Service. I was honest about the reason why – general election campaigns are where plans for social care go to die. If anyone is going to help us to break the cycle of bad politics, knock heads together, and forge the national consensus I think we need on social care, it is Louise Casey. And that work will begin in April. It will report initially next year. And within three years I hope we will have built the consensus we need to build a national care service fit to meet the challenges for older and disabled people in the 21st century.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/03/wes-streeting-adult-social-care-reform-elon-musk-uk-politics-live-updates	2025-01-03T01:12:38-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1de800d53bf6061d31c375d7b1b4a6347a48125/0_304_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=70f8f898159a73578eb8d97244c6d434

To outsiders, the unexpected combination may seem baffling. But to Yoon’s supporters, America represents more than an ally: it’s a perceived ideal.

The question New Orleans investigators hope to answer: will there be another attack?	The FBI says the attacker acted alone, but links to Islamic State mean further violence can’t be ruled out As investigators examine the terrorist attack in New Orleans on Wednesday, they will be hoping to answer three questions: who was responsible? How was the attack executed? And why? All will be vital to answering the most pressing question of all: will there be another attack in the immediate hours or days to come? Their first priority will have been to identify the attacker. The FBI has said it believes Shamsud-Din Jabbar, the 42-year-old who drove a pickup truck into a crowd celebrating the new year, acted alone. He hired a vehicle, procured an assault rifle, as well as body armour and ammunition. He also fabricated what appeared to be several pipe bombs containing plastic explosives, which he may have pre-positioned to target police.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/02/the-question-new-orleans-investigators-hope-to-answer-will-there-be-another-attack	2025-01-02T09:35:41-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0f1e097fd9c32615a175d2239bdd7b52175f4c4/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ee642f1606deacdaf9cb135a9bbf45a2

Automatic voter registration may be an answer to UK’s troubling turnout gap	Experts say evidence from abroad shows AVR is effective – and it’s one of several proposals to try to boost voting A healthy democracy depends on people participating in it. In the UK, the proportion of people doing so is falling. Voter turnout in general elections stayed above 70% from 1945 through to 1997, hitting more than 80% in 1950 and 1951. But it collapsed to 59.4% when Tony Blair won his second term in 2001, and though it rose again between 2010 and 2019, it has not reached the 70% mark since 1997. In the 2024 election, turnout fell to 59.7%. The decline has been acute enough to trigger concern among Labour officials. Before July, the Guardian revealed they were drawing up plans to introduce automatic voter registration (AVR). In the election, when it came around, just 52% of adults living in the UK exercised their right to vote – the lowest proportion since universal suffrage was introduced. Crucially, this statistic counts all adults eligible to vote in the UK, not just those registered on the electoral roll.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/01/automatic-voter-registration-uk-turnout-gap-elections	2025-01-01T09:26:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53be2671a1f2793c6ebd77c914bd06516bd643fe/0_0_4122_2474/master/4122.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=00501a5a13da57650ec21cb5180ac23a

Trump aims to crush legal curbs on his climate rollback – but it may not be easy	The president-elect said he will ‘stop the wave of frivolous litigation from environmental extremists’ but the ability to block suits will be limited, experts say Donald Trump has promised to deregulate the energy sector, boost fossil fuels, dismantle environmental rules and otherwise attack climate progress.

There are more than 30 accountability lawsuits active around the US brought by states and municipalities accusing fossil fuel interests of covering up the climate risks of their products or seeking damages for impacts. -Climate deception lawsuits against big oil have a clear path forward no matter who is in the White House.-	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/31/trump-climate-policy	2024-12-31T06:00:48-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdaa1d355d84382dc7ad32fa75554786fb4cdb0d/0_110_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c4475419da773eafb4622b0094fc40b7

Melbourne doctor formed cult before using god-like status to rape members’ children	Pradeep Dissanayake forced members to give him money and send hourly messages of praise before he sexually abused two girls, court of appeal says A Melbourne skin doctor established a Buddhist-Christian cult and used his -godlike status- to rape his followers’ children while forcing them to give him money and send hourly text messages of praise.
