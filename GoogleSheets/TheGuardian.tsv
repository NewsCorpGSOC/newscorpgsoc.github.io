Japan’s complex defence alliances built up over years as protection against China could be put at risk in a Trump-launched trade war Arguably, no country in Asia has better reason to be in a state of anxiety over the return of Donald Trump to the White House than Japan, since the US has been the linchpin of Japanese foreign and security policy since the second world war.

The annual defense authorization bill usually gains strong bipartisan support and has not failed to pass Congress in nearly six decades, but the Pentagon policy measure in recent years has become a battleground for cultural issues.

Farage’s photo with Musk and Nick Candy defines his Trump tribute act era	Eight years after an awkward ‘bad boys of Brexit’ snap at Trump Tower’s lift, Reform’s leader is a Mar-a-Lago insider As a photo it is visually striking and politically resonant: Nigel Farage, the man who loudly proclaims he will be the UK’s next prime minister, alongside two extremely rich supporters, all bathed in the golden glow of his hero Donald Trump. In terms of raw politics, the significance is what may follow from the talks involving the leader of Reform UK, the party’s new treasurer Nick Candy, and Elon Musk at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Monday, immortalised in a photo eagerly released by Farage’s media team.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/dec/18/farage-photo-musk-nick-candy-mar-a-lago-trump-reform	2024-12-18T06:42:38-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2113ce03ca722de6fa9e64d9411abe4b45ed4be/192_60_3752_2251/master/3752.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=20dfb4099e8a0a49c7dd27de61766b47

Trump warns Liz Cheney ‘could be in a lot of trouble’ after Republicans call for FBI investigation – US politics live	President-elect reacts to House subcommittee report calling for former congresswoman to be investigated over January 6 inquiry Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump stayed up late (or woke up early?) to threaten Liz Cheney, the Republican former congresswoman who lost her seat two years ago after breaking with the president-elect. In a post written shortly after three in the morning, Trump said that Cheney -could be in a lot of trouble- over the findings of a Republican controlled House subcommittee that investigated the now-concluded bipartisan panel that held public hearings into the insurrection two years ago. The Republican subcommittee’s report accuses Cheney of witness tampering, saying, -numerous federal laws were likely broken by- the former congresswoman, and -these violations should be investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.- Those aren’t just empty words, considering Trump has nominated loyalist Kash Patel to lead the FBI, and, based on what Republican senators have said publicly so far, he may get confirmed. Here’s what else is happening today: Congress, and particularly House Republicans, are scrambling to pass a short-term government funding bill to ward off a shutdown that will otherwise begin Friday. As usual, many lawmakers do not like the compromises struck in the draft legislation released by Republican House speaker Mike Johnson, and will no doubt pipe up about it throughout today. The New York Times, which has had a fraught relationship with Joe Biden, has published a comprehensive look at what the president has been up to since Trump won re-election. You will learn that he appears older than ever, and even less willing than usual to entertain reporters. Biden has nothing public on his scheduled today, but is in Delaware to mark the anniversary of the car crash that killed his first wife and daughter.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/dec/18/trump-cheney-january-6-politics-latest-updates	2024-12-18T06:09:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4fe341f0ec9a4ffcdac66675dde9858aef672ab/0_193_5796_3478/master/5796.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=136f53c6db4b0a4119975c87c547e150

US violating law to fund Israel despite alleged human rights abuses, lawsuit says | First Thing	Suit claims state department is deliberately bypassing the Leahy law. Plus, New York grand jury charges Luigi Mangione with first-degree murder Good morning. The US state department is facing a new lawsuit – brought by Palestinians and Palestinian Americans – accusing it of deliberately circumventing a decades-old human rights law by continuing to fund Israeli military units accused of widespread atrocities in the occupied Palestinian territories. What is the Leahy law? Enacted in 1997, it was designed to prohibit US assistance to any security forces that the US identifies as being ineligible due to a gross violation of human rights. But, as one former state official told the Guardian earlier this year: -The rules were different for Israel.- What are the aims of the lawsuit? With the death toll in Gaza since last October reportedly approaching 45,000, humanitarian aid to the territory severely restricted, millions of people displaced and infrastructure decimated, the legal challenge demands judicial intervention to force the US to comply with the law. What happens now? The Kremlin has not yet indicated how it will retaliate. But RIA reported that the former president Dmitry Medvedev, now a senior Russian security official, said Ukraine’s military and political leadership faced revenge. What’s the latest on the frontlines? Russian forces took control of the villages of Trudove and Stari Terny in eastern Ukraine, RIA claimed. Meanwhile, North Korean forces have suffered -several hundred- casualties, according to a senior US military official.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/18/first-thing-us-violating-law-by-funding-israel-despite-alleged-human-rights-abuses-lawsuit-says	2024-12-18T04:51:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c44242eeadb3c26992463de49a18ae5d5e40c011/0_25_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1d11c7d61896aabc2e27020f1f7354e9

Reeves says compensating Waspi women not ‘best use of taxpayers’ money’ as backlash grows – UK politics live	Chancellor and PM have both defended not to pay compensation to Waspi women Good morning. Keir Starmer is facing his last PMQs of the year and, if he takes a glance at the papers this morning, he will find that he is being attacked by the Tory papers for not implementing a Jeremy Corbyn manifesto promise. Here are two of the headlines about yesterday’s announcement that the government will not compensate the so-called Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) women – women who lost out because they were not properly notified about the planned rise in their state pension age. The Daily Telegraph has not splashed on the story, but it does have it on the front, under the headline -Labour betrays Waspi women with U-turn on pension payouts-. It is true that, when Corbyn was leader, Labour did promise compensation for the Waspi women. But when the parliamentary and health service ombudsman (PHSO) recommended compensation worth up to £10bn in a report earlier this year, Keir Starmer very deliberately did not commit to implementing this, and his manifesto did not promise Waspi compensation.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/18/pmqs-starmer-badenoch-labour-tories-waspi-women	2024-12-18T01:24:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83775e089b50d6b7e285f2b3afddbdeebd2b9a46/0_286_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f17c6aa392ff0b526c87c23be13d8258

Rachel Reeves: improving services more important than Waspi women payout	Chancellor says high cost of compensation cannot be justified because most of women affected had known pension changes were coming Improving public services is a higher priority than spending £10bn compensating Waspi women, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said, as MPs and campaigners criticised the decision to reject the watchdog’s recommendation for a flat-rate compensation scheme. Her comments came after campaigners accused Labour of hypocrisy for having promised to compensate women hit by the rising state pension age. The parliamentary ombudsman had recommended paying out £1,000 to £2,950 to each of the more than 3 million women affected.	https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/dec/18/rachel-reeves-improving-services-more-important-than-waspi-women-payout	2024-12-18T01:06:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44323d4df6f8c7f8a2ebc44094258ab75088ad83/330_641_5065_3039/master/5065.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=227181b830678dde81cf7675a00282fe

Middle East crisis live: hopes for Israel-Gaza ceasefire deal rise as officials express cautious optimism	Israeli negotiating team has travelled to Qatar with Hamas, US and Arab officials all suggesting a deal may be within reach On Tuesday an Israeli negotiating team travelled to Qatar while a report from Reuters – denied by his office and Egypt – said that the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was planning to travel to Cairo for talks. Instead, Netanyahu’s office said he had toured a buffer zone inside Syria that was recently seized by Israeli forces after the fall of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, which he said would remain under Israeli control for the foreseeable future. A ceasefire between Turkey and the U.S.-backed Kurdish Syrian forces (SDF) around the northern Syrian city of Manbij has been extended until the end of this week, state department spokesperson Matthew Miller has said. Washington brokered an initial ceasefire last week after fighting that broke out earlier this month as rebel groups advanced on Damascus and overthrew the rule of Bashar al-Assad. Geir Pedersen, the UN’s special envoy for Syria, however, has warned that the conflict -has not ended-, highlighting the clashes between the Turkish-backed and Kurdish groups. Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Israeli forces will stay in a buffer zone on the Syrian border, seized after the ouster of Syria’s President Bashar Assad, until another arrangement is in place -that ensures Israel’s security.- Netanyahu made the comments from the summit of Mount Hermon about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border with the Israel-held Golan Heights. Israeli lawmakers narrowly approved the country’s 2025 state budget in an initial vote. The 59-57 vote in the Knesset – the Israeli parliament – to pass the wartime austerity budget in its first of three readings. A UN refugee agency official said that about one million Syrian refugees are expected to return to the country in the first six months of 2025, with thousands of people already having returned to the country mostly from Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, said his country’s forces will maintain -security control- over the devastated Gaza Strip, even after the war is over, with Israeli soldiers able to act with -full freedom of action- over the territory. At least 45,059 Palestinian people have been killed and 107,041 injured in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement. Of those, 31 Palestinians were killed and 79 injured in the latest 24-hour reporting period, the ministry said. At least 10 people were confirmed killed in an Israeli airstrike on a house in Gaza City that destroyed the building, while further north in the town of Beit Lahiya at least 15 people were reportedly killed while they were sheltering in a house. Ahmed al-Sharaa, the leader of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group that toppled Assad, said all rebel factions would -be disbanded and the fighters trained to join the ranks of the defence ministry- during a meeting with members of the minority Druze community. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the bloc would send an ambassador back to Damascus. -We are ready to reopen our delegation, which is the European embassy, and we want this to be fully operational again,- she said. Kallas added that the EU would aim to help authorities restore basic services like electricity, water and infrastructure.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/18/israel-gaza-ceasefire-talks-middle-east-netanyahu-hamas-syria-lebanon	2024-12-17T23:44:28-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b0a7032305ea058206289fafd5cb8df94e85d05/0_25_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=01621d4376bf39c66a3c97bd0b6d9fa9

Wednesday briefing: The world waits after Ukraine assassinates top Putin general in Moscow	In today’s newsletter: Kyiv assassinated Igor Kirillov inside enemy territory, in its most audacious operation since the war began – how will Russia respond? Good morning. In the early hours of yesterday morning, Russian general Igor Kirillov and his deputy were killed when a bomb concealed in an e-scooter detonated as they left an apartment. Ukraine’s SBU security service swiftly claimed responsibility for the attack, which stands as one of the most audacious assassinations of a senior Russian military figure since the war began almost three years ago. Russian authorities arrested a 29-year-old citizen of Uzbekistan early today, the news agency Tass reported, citing the FSB, the country’s domestic spy agency.

The US and UK go further in their accusations and say Russia is using another toxic agent, chloropicrin, first employed to gruesome effect in the trenches of the first world war. Behind the effort are the radiological, chemical and biological defence troops of the Russian ministry of defence, known as RKhBZ.

US voters believe Trump will get more done than Biden – but also trust his government less	Survey finds voters think Trump will be an effective president, but don’t believe his administration will share accurate information Donald Trump won a second White House term in November’s election thanks to voters’ attaching higher priority to having an effective president than one who was trustworthy, fresh polling has suggested. A post-election survey conducted by Scheon Cooperman Research, in conjunction with George Washington University’s graduate school of political management, has concluded that voters believe Trump’s second presidency will be more effective in getting things done – even though they trust his administration less to share accurate information. And Trump not only failed to deliver on some of his more prominent campaign promises during his first term from 2017 to 2021, including a southern US border wall for which Mexico would pay – he also botched the federal response to the deadly Covid-19 pandemic.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/17/trump-biden-effective	2024-12-17T08:35:35-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e68dfd23a1a95270f98bbddb761193eea8938ba/0_27_5717_3429/master/5717.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6f5998789771def1c56597b3d23492d3

Donald Trump calls Canadian PM Justin Trudeau ‘governor’ for second time as he weighs in on deputy PM’s departure – live	President-elect criticizes Chrystia Freeland in social media post after doubling down on tariff pledges on Monday Good morning, US politics blog readers. Since winning re-election last month, Donald Trump has, for reasons that are not clear, taken to calling Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau -governor-. He’s done it in two instances that we can think of, the most recent coming last night, in a post on Truth Social where the president-elect weighed in on the departure from Trudeau’s government of deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland, who had disagreed with Trudeau over how to handle Trump’s threatened economic policies. Without giving examples, the president-elect said -her behavior was totally toxic-, and accused her of standing in the way of a trade deal between the two countries. The -governor- moniker is a strange one to bestow on Trudeau, considering it is both inaccurate, and because the prime minister has made efforts to reach out to Trump, including by dining with him at Mar-a-Lago. Hanging over the two men’s relationship is Trump’s threat to impose steep tariffs on Canada, which Trudeau is trying to convince him not to follow through with.

Training up UK workers may not bring down net migration, Starmer warned	Skilled overseas workers contribute 20 times more than UK-born adults, while some shortages may be due to pay and conditions, say advisers Keir Starmer’s plan to bring down UK net migration by improving domestic training and skills is not guaranteed to work, the government’s independent advisers have concluded.

Minister says ‘no plans’ to ban smacking in England, despite comment from Sara Sharif’s father – UK politics live	Education secretary Bridget Phillipson tells LBC ‘we’re not intending to legislate around this’ Good morning. The children’s wellbeing and schools bill is being published today and, as Sally Weale reports, it will set out plans to tighten checks on children being educated at home in England. Publication coincides with the sentencing of the killers of 10-year-old Sara Sharif – her father and step-mother – following a trial that revealed details of one of the most shocking cases of child cruelty heard by a British court in years. Sara was taken out of school, and educated at home in the months before her death, even though teachers had started to notice evidence that she was being assaulted at home, and so the legislation – although planned well before the trial – does address one of safeguarding loopholes the Sharif case has highlighted. Too many children have been failed by the state in recent years, it is clear that action is required. So no more lessons learned, no more words. Today we set out our plans to make sure that those agencies are working together and that we have much greater visibility of where children are and what they’re experiencing in their lives. What haunts me the most about Sara’s death is that her father used the words ‘I legally punished my child’, believing this to be a defence to murder. It is unthinkable that any parent or carer could hide behind our legal system to justify such cruelty – and yet, children living in England today have less protection from assault than adults. We’re not intending to legislate around this. I do want to look at the experience in Wales and Scotland where they have legislated to understand what the effect has been. Because what I want to understand is the impact and the effect of the legislation in Wales. They will be setting out the first round of a review into the implications and effect of the legislation that they had introduced. I would like to see that, would like to understand it, and to decide then whether it’s necessary to take further measures here in England.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/17/uk-politics-latest-news-labour-conservatives-keir-starmer	2024-12-17T01:17:48-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ad969a48a4a02233db8159d54137570e7d02ebb/0_153_1795_1077/master/1795.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=00dbcd1ffe5e827f510d180e357705bb

Tuesday briefing: How the UK left 64 asylum seekers stranded on an island in the Indian Ocean	In today’s newsletter: As a judge finds the government unlawfully detained Tamils on Diego Garcia, we look at the geopolitcs that led to them being trapped in ‘hell on earth’ for three years Good morning. In October 2021, a boat carrying dozens of Tamils trying to find their way to Canada sprung a leak. They were rescued by the British navy and brought to Diego Garcia, a tropical island in the middle of the Indian Ocean that was under the control of the British government, and which hosted a US military base. But their saviours became their captors – and they found themselves in rat-infested camps, largely deprived of their liberty and caught in legal limbo with no obvious way out. The authorities on Diego Garcia maintained that the asylum seekers were free to leave whenever they wanted, and that any restrictions on their movements there were lawful and necessary. Yesterday, a judge said that case had -not come close- to being made. She ruled that the asylum seekers had been unlawfully detained in conditions that one of them described as -hell on earth-. The ruling amounts to a crushing defeat for the British government, and a wholesale vindication for an almost forgotten group of people whose fate has been subjugated to geopolitical forces far beyond their control. Espionage | The alleged Chinese spy with links to Prince Andrew and who made connections at the heart of the UK establishment has been named as Yang Tengbo, a businessman also known as Chris Yang.

The White Lotus: first trailer for third season suggests more satire and intrigue	Next season of critically acclaimed drama will be set in Thailand with Jason Isaacs and returning Natasha Rothwell Once again, there’s trouble on the horizon for the White Lotus resorts. The first teaser trailer for the acclaimed HBO show’s third season suggests as much intrigue, secrets and incendiary social critique as the first two – this time, on the beaches of Thailand. The 90-second trailer substantiates creator Mike White’s suggestion that the Emmy-winning series, which satirized wealth privilege at a Hawaiian resort in season one before moving to bedroom farce in Sicily for season two, would tackle westerners’ interest in eastern spirituality in its third outing.	https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/dec/16/white-lotus-trailer-season-three	2024-12-16T08:57:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/570bfab2b62d26a7cf8e31d57d917b5dfb7b41ca/0_84_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4b6201f4b3ae80c320c59021f6e8b87d
Mitch McConnell warns Trump to avoid ‘isolationist’ foreign policy in second term	Republicans’ outgoing US Senate leader takes issue with foreign policy thinking in party’s Maga movement Mitch McConnell, the Republicans’ outgoing leader in the US Senate, has called on Donald Trump to avoid an -isolationist- foreign policy during his looming second presidency – and urged him to back up a surge in American -hard power- by continuing to support Ukraine in its war against Russia. In a 5,000-word essay in Foreign Affairs magazine, McConnell, 82 – who retires as the GOP Senate leader at the end of this term in 2027 – takes issue with a strand of foreign policy thinking in the party’s pro-Trump Make America Great Again (Maga) movement, which casts China as the US’s biggest threat and advocates turning away from the war in Ukraine to tackle challenges in Asia.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/16/mitch-mcconnell-trump-foreign-policy	2024-12-16T08:53:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f05afafec16c1cf3ff17af9cc31f7c3af6d97c15/409_179_4354_2612/master/4354.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd9352d1c2e811b8ecfad0a6442e9031

Democrats make last-minute push to add Equal Rights Amendment to US constitution – live	If Joe Biden published the ERA, move could trigger a court fight that would cast a shadow over incoming Trump administration Good morning, US politics blog readers. Dozens of Democratic lawmakers have proposed a novel idea for Joe Biden to secure his presidential legacy in his final weeks in office: decide that the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which protects against sex discrimination, has met the standard for ratification, and have the Archivist of the United States publish the amendment into the constitution. The proposal was approved by the US House and Senate in the early 1970s but a conservative backlash prevented it from being ratified by the necessary two-thirds of states by a 1982 deadline congress had set. In the years since, several states have voted to approve the amendment, and in a letter to Biden sent over the weekend, more than 120 House Democrats argued that the ERA has met the requirements, and should be added to the constitution as the 28th amendment, and the first since 1992. The subtext here is Donald Trump’s impending arrival in the White House, and the likelihood that Biden publishing the ERA would trigger a court fight that casts a shadow over the newly arrived president, particularly since he is viewed as politically vulnerable among women. We’ll tell you more about the ERA push today. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the anti-vaccine activist Trump has named to lead the health and human services department, is heading to Capitol Hill to meet with Republican senators throughout the day. Biden will at 12.15pm hold an event at the labor department to promote his administration’s efforts to help American workers, then convene a Hanukkah reception at 7.45pm. Syrian diplomats and community leaders plan to today hoist the flag of -Free Syria- at its Washington DC embassy, which has been closed since 2014.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/dec/16/biden-trump-latest-equal-rights-amendment-push-democrats	2024-12-16T06:06:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77526c124f296d0f4c344c1ad91ea9217ebeab02/0_0_5122_3074/master/5122.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=76d54db8aeb17afee5129d192ecd46d5

Assad uncle used Guernsey adviser to secretly manage vast wealth	Rifaat al-Assad, the ‘Butcher of Hama’, identified as client of consultant who received ban and fine this year An uncle of the recently ousted Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad used an adviser in Guernsey to secretly manage his wealth, which included a vast European property empire worth hundreds of millions of euros that prosecutors claim was acquired with funds looted from the wartorn state. Rifaat al-Assad, known as the -Butcher of Hama- for overseeing the violent suppression of a rebellion in the 1980s, has been accused of war crimes by Swiss prosecutors. In 2020, he was convicted by a French court of embezzling Syrian state funds and pouring the money into luxury properties, with the French state seizing assets worth €90m. The Witanhurst estate in Highgate, north London – the second largest private residence in the capital after Buckingham Palace. Rifaat sold it for £32m to developers in 2007 after leaving it in disrepair. A £50m mansion in South Street, Mayfair. Owned through a shell company in the British Virgin Islands, it was frozen by British proceeds of crime prosecutors in 2017. A seven-bedroom, seven-bathroom estate in Leatherhead, Surrey, with a gym, tennis court and indoor swimming pool. It was sold for £4m in 2016 before prosecutors could impose an asset freeze. A seven-storey mansion on Avenue Foch, which leads to the Arc de Triomphe in the most expensive arrondissement of Paris.

Germany: parliament to declare no confidence in chancellor Olaf Scholz – live	Chancellor triggered path to elections, due to take place on 23 February, by firing finance minister Christian Lindner last month Scholz, who is deeply unpopular, will begin the session at 1pm CET with a short speech presenting his reasons for calling the confidence motion. He will be the fifth chancellor to use the measure as laid out in Article 68 of Germany’s Basic Law since the second world war – Angela Merkel was a rare exception in never using it despite her 16 years in power through many a crisis. About 90 minutes of debate will follow. If all goes according to Scholz’s plan, a majority of MPs will vote against Scholz and he can go to president Frank-Walter Steinmeier at Bellevue Palace in central Berlin, recommending that the head of state dissolve the current Bundestag and clear the way for a general election. Steinmeier will have 21 days to take his decision, during which he will consult with the leaders of the various parliamentary groups. If he agrees to dissolve the Bundestag, an election would have to be held within 60 days, thus clearing the way to the 23 February poll.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/16/germany-parliament-no-confidence-olaf-scholz-chancellor-latest-updates	2024-12-16T03:39:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e59f61d0314cfda06f84c032768ceb4d26b2cd4/0_215_4724_2833/master/4724.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7cbaad78d484daa4b19a8371ceee4652
First Thing: Israel strikes Syria as Netanyahu approves settlement expansion	The Israeli PM approved plan to double Israeli population in Golan Heights. Plus, South Korea’s constitutional court begins reviewing presidential impeachment Good morning. Israel bombed dozens of sites in Syria overnight, despite the Syrian rebel leader, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani aka Ahmed al-Sharaa, saying his Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group was not interested in conflict with Israel. What is Israel bombing in Syria? Israeli air raids have hit bases, heavy weapons, sites associated with the former Assad regime’s missile and chemical weapons programme, and destroyed Syria’s small naval force in port of Latakia. The scale of the Israeli bombing campaign has surprised many western capitals. How did Netanyahu justify further settlements? He justified expanding Israeli settlements in the occupied Golan Heights -in light of the war and the new front facing Syria- and a desire to double the Israeli population in the area. -We will continue to hold on to it, cause it to blossom and settle in it,- he said.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/16/first-thing-israel-strikes-syria-netanyahu-approves-settlement-expansion	2024-12-16T03:32:35-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb75ef23be46e886d273963569a782d1337701d6/0_208_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b48ba56c69122d3ba54ea5eca65b9d76

Monday briefing: What do we know about Prince Andrew and the alleged Chinese spy?	In today’s newsletter: Many questions remain unanswered about the person known only as H6, but the complex relationship between China and the UK is sure to be put under the spotlight Good morning. Espionage is an obviously mysterious business, but there can be fewer greater puzzles in the annals of national security than the one that has arisen in the last few days. If you were the mighty Chinese state, and making a list of British public figures who might hold useful intelligence or influence, what would make you put Prince Andrew on it? I can’t answer that one. But many other questions besides have arisen since it emerged that a businessman and alleged Chinese spy with links to Andrew has been barred from entering the UK on national security grounds – and last night, MPs raised fears that the case shows that the UK has been too eager to strengthen UK-China relations. Today’s newsletter explains what we know. Here are the headlines. Ireland | Israel has announced it will close its embassy in Ireland, citing Dublin’s decision last week to support a petition at the international court of justice accusing Israel of genocide. Irish taoiseach Simon Harris called the move -deeply regrettable-. Economy | Fifty economists and policy experts have issued a warning to Rachel Reeves that encouraging the city to expand could threaten financial stability and jeopardise growth. The chancellor has claimed that regulations imposed after the global financial crisis have -gone too far-. Extreme weather | At least several hundred people are feared to have been killed after the worst cyclone in almost a century ripped through the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte on Saturday. Officials said the final toll would be hard to ascertain but could be in the thousands. Immigration and asylum | Syrian asylum seekers left in limbo after the UK home secretary said the government was pausing their claims have called the decision -cruel- and urged officials to resume processing their cases. About 6,500 cases are now in the system.

Labor’s old hand treasurer Tim Pallas departs, leaving a dilemma for Jacinta Allan	Resignation of the ‘humble staffer who maybe got a little bit ahead of himself’ hands Victorian premier need for cabinet reshuffle When Labor premiers faced a problem, they often turned to Tim Pallas for a solution.

‘Celebrating the unknown’: Syrian Alawites fear for future under rebel rule	Minority Islamic sect associated with overthrown Assad regime waits to see how threats of revenge will play out To prepare khubeiza, the leaves of the kale-like plant must be roughly chopped and sauteed with onions, garlic and a dash of salt. Folklore says that the recipe originated among the Alawite communities who lived in Syria’s mountainous coastline where the fibrous, wild-growing plant can be found in abundance. So poor were the Alawites during Ottoman times, the story goes, that the only food they could find to eat was khubeiza, which sprouts like a stubborn weed every spring. When Hafez al-Assad, a member of the minority Islamic Alawite sect, seized the reins of power in 1971, he promised to lift the neglected community out of its poverty and end its hunger.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/15/celebrating-the-unknown-syrian-alawites-fear-for-future-under-rebel-rule	2024-12-15T05:52:14-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba91f0597f2f49153498aa299fda8c5aee4963c0/0_327_4902_2941/master/4902.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2d5c7ae847959dc10e9860e3030f5615

Prince Andrew may have been a victim of Chairman Mao’s ‘magic weapon’ | Isabel Hilton	The United Front Work Department aims to befriend, bribe and seduce ‘useful idiots’. Was Andrew caught up in its net? The late Chairman Mao, China’s former supreme leader, once called the United Front Work Department (UFWD) one of the three -magic weapons- of the Chinese Communist party (CCP). That the other two were the People’s Liberation Army and the party’s propaganda arm signals how central the UFWD has been to the CCP’s efforts for nearly a century. The operation involving Andrew must count as one of its more unusual achievements. The UFWD’s job began as neutralising potentially hostile actors at home. As China has expanded into the world, it has increasingly taken on the international challenge of befriending, bribing or otherwise seducing figures of influence who can be won over to China’s cause. Such elite figures can become both useful sources of information and agents of influence who can be invited to smooth away any hostility or suspicions that might otherwise get in the way of the CCP’s ambition.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/14/prince-andrew-chairman-mao-united-work-front-department	2024-12-14T11:04:48-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d61d687319f7a344e7b2ee9949ae4bcec7a9c2c/338_541_2222_1333/master/2222.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3acfe2612f0a168ce5f17dee46098835

Trump-linked officials consider targeting banking regulators and polio vaccine, reports say – US politics live	President-elect’s team reportedly exploring ways to downsize or combine key bodies; RFK Jr adviser challenges approvals of polio and other vaccines Good morning, US politics blog readers. We have fewer than 40 days to go until Donald Trump is inaugurated president of the United States, and more signs are emerging of how he might follow through on his plans to transform the country. The New York Times reports that Aaron Siri, a lawyer who has filed petitions challenging the approvals of vaccines against polio and several other diseases, has been by health and human services secretary nominee Robert F Kennedy Jr’s side as he has interviewed candidates for jobs in the department. It’s yet more evidence that, if he is confirmed, Kennedy could insert his discredited anti-vaccine views into the government. The Wall Street Journal reports that Trump’s transition team is exploring ways to downside or combine major banking regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a key stabilizer of the sector that was created in the wake of the Great Depression. While the country has come a long way since that era-defining financial crisis, bank collapses still happen, and expect tons of pushback if the second Trump administration follows through on the plan. Joe Biden is starting his day early, with a virtual meeting of G7 countries at 9.30am ET. House Republicans announced their committee chairs for the next Congress. Notable, Biden nemeses Jim Jordan and James Comer will remain as chairs of the judiciary and oversight committees, respectively. Xi Jinping is not expected to attend Trump’s inauguration, CBS News reports, after the president-elect invited the Chinese president.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/dec/13/trump-transition-rfk-regulators-updates	2024-12-13T06:46:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00c2a7569da39434c72ee68d8ba2c6645280270e/0_109_6000_3599/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ed922f23375f4ca4b5e6cca6aa0c4638

‘The water war’: how drought threatens survival of Sicily’s towns	Amid Italian island’s worst drought, towns such as Troina are fighting for survival as supplies run dry and tensions rise An ancient Sicilian proverb goes like this: -When water to two fountains flows, one will stay dry – that’s how it goes.- The residents of the small town of Troina in the heart of Sicily, struck by a long and unprecedented drought, perhaps understand its meaning better than anyone else. When authorities decreed that the little water left in their dam should be shared with the villages of another province, they took action, and, on 30 November, occupied the distribution centre of the reservoir, blocking access. -It’s a war between the poor; we are aware of it,- says Salvatore Giamblanco, 66, owner of a bed and breakfast in Troina. -But we had no other choice. The dam is drying up. We have difficulty finding water for ourselves. I had to cancel numerous reservations due to the lack of water. If we also have to share what little we have with other towns, we will all be left dry.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/13/the-water-war-how-drought-threatens-survival-of-sicilys-towns	2024-12-13T02:00:43-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95923b36770d9692822b3b5b0777f362ba4a1a0d/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=23c65d5e918e34934ca4c9a6a83fe320
Middle East crisis live: rebel leader urges Syrians to take to the streets to celebrate ‘revolution’	Leader of Islamist rebels that ousted Assad says people should ‘express their joy’ after Friday prayers Hello, welcome to our live coverage of events in Syria and around the Middle East. It’s a little after noon in Damascus. Here are the major developments: The US secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, is wrapping up a visit to Turkey as part of a broader effort to rally support across the Middle East for a peaceful political transition in Syria. The US administration is worried that a power vacuum in Syria could worsen tensions in the region, already heightened by multiple conflicts, and create conditions for the Islamic State group to regain territory and influence. Blinken said Friday that there’s broad agreement on what both Turkey and the US would like to see in Syria following concerns about the two NATO allies’ competing interests in Syria, as Turkey targets a US-backed Kurdish group seen as key to containing the extremists. Blinken also said he saw -encouraging signs- of progress toward a ceasefire in Gaza and urged Turkey to use its influence to encourage Hamas to accept. -We discussed Gaza, and we discussed I think the opportunity... to get a ceasefire in place. And what we’ve seen in the last couple of weeks are more encouraging signs that that is possible,- Blinken told reporters. G7 leaders are set to gather virtually on Friday afternoon to discuss Syria. The leaders have said they are prepared to support a transition to an -inclusive and non-sectarian- government, and emphasised -the importance of holding the Assad regime accountable for its crimes.- Russia has also reportedly established direct contact with the political committee of Syria’s Islamist rebel group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, according to the Interfax news agency, which quoted Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Mikhail Bogdanov. In comments to reporters, Bogdanov reportedly said Moscow aims to maintain its military bases in Syria. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, has ordered the military to -prepare to remain- throughout the winter in the UN-patrolled buffer zone between Israeli and Syrian forces on the strategic Golan Heights.

North Carolina GOP lawmakers override veto to strip power from Democratic officials	Republicans tuck new law into relief bill for Hurricane Helene as they attempt to shift state government control On the brink of losing their supermajority in the state legislature, North Carolina Republicans overrode a gubernatorial veto on Wednesday to enact a new law that gives them control over elections in the state and strips the incoming Democratic governor and attorney general of some of their powers. Currently, North Carolina’s governor appoints the five members of the state board of elections, allowing him to select a three-person majority from his party. The new law transfers that appointment power to the state auditor.

Biden issues mass clemencies and says more may come before end of presidency – US politics live	President has commuted the sentences of nearly 1,500 people and issued pardons to 39 others in largest single-day act of clemency in US history Good morning, US politics blog readers. Joe Biden has commuted the sentences of nearly 1,500 people and issued pardons to 39 others, a sweeping exercise of his presidential powers in his final weeks in the White House. The clemencies – the largest single-day act in US history – are targeted at people who have been serving their sentences in home confinement under the pandemic-era Cares Act, while the pardons are for people convicted of non-violent crimes who -have turned their lives around-, the White House said. It is typical for presidents to commute sentences and issue pardons as they complete their terms, but even though Biden is casting this as a historic act of mercy, his decision last week to pardon his son, Hunter Biden, casts a bit of a shadow over it. The younger Biden was facing sentencing over tax evasion and gun charges, but the president opted to pardon him, saying he had been unjustly prosecuted, and could be further harassed once Donald Trump takes office. When it comes to clemencies, Biden says he’s not finished, and may issue more in the weeks left in his term. We will let you know if we get any hint at who those might affect. Trump appointed Kari Lake, a Republican former candidate for governor and senator in Arizona, as director of Voice of America. VOA is a US-government supported global news agency, and Lake is best known nationally not just for her twin failed bids for office, but refusing to acknowledge her defeat in the governor’s race two years ago. Xi Jinping, China’s president, has been invited to Trump’s inauguration next month, CBS News reports. No Chinese leader has ever attended a US presidential inauguration, but many incoming Trump administration officials view China as a rival and national security threat.

Middle East crisis live: Syria’s rebel leader vows retribution against Assad officials; Blinken heads to the region	Abu Mohammed al-Jolani says those behind the country’s notorious prison system will not evade justice Hello, welcome to our live coverage of events in Syria and around the Middle East. It’s a little after 10am in Damascus and here are the major developments. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is headed for Jordan and Turkey on Thursday, where he is expected to rally regional countries to help advance efforts to reach an elusive Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal, and ensure a smooth transition in Syria, after the ousting of longtime authoritarian ruler Bashar al-Assad. His national security adviser Jake Sullivan is also scheduled to visit Israel, Qatar and Egypt in the coming days, US officials said. Syria’s rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani has signalled he is seeking retribution, saying there will be no pardons for prison torturers. The rebel commander has vowed to dissolve Assad regime security forces, close its prisons and hunt down anyone involved in the torture or killing of detainees. He also said he would ask countries to hand over Assad regime officials who have fled the country. At the Masnaa border crossing to Lebanon on Wednesday night, thousands of Syrians were trying to leave the country despite assurances from Jolani’s group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) that civil rights and sectarian differences will be respected. Rebel fighters appeared to be searching for members of the regime army and security services trying to get to Lebanon with their families. Syrian refugees residing in countries such as Turkey, have also been lining up at the border to return home. Mohammed al-Bashir, who has been appointed by the rebels as Syria’s interim leader pledged that the rights or all people and sects in Syria would be guaranteed. The comments come as a mausoleum in Qardaha near Latakia that housed the remains of ousted president, Bashar al-Assad’s father, Hafez, who seized control of Syria in 1970, was burned by armed Islamist rebels. Israel, which has been fighting both the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah for over a year, has deployed ground troops into and beyond a demilitarised buffer zone in the disputed Golan Heights, its first foray into Syrian-controlled territory for 50 years. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has claimed the US and Israel acted as the command centre that engineered the downfall of Syria’s former president, Bashar al-Assad, and the ousting of Iran from the country. The UN general assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly adopted a resolution calling for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, a symbolic gesture rejected by the United States and Israel. The resolution was adopted by a vote of 158-9, with 13 abstentions and urges -an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire,- and -the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages-. The UN would consider taking the Syrian rebel group that toppled the regime of Bashar al-Assad off its designated terrorist list if it passes the key test of forming a truly inclusive transitional government, according to a senior official at the world body. The tomb of ousted Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s father Hafez was torched in his home town of Qardaha, accoding to AFP footage taken on Wednesday. AFP said it showed rebel fighters in fatigues and young men watching it burn. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor told AFP the rebels had set fire to the mausoleum, located in the Latakia heartland of Assad’s Alawite community.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/12/middle-east-crisis-syria-rebels-assad-officials-blinken-live-updates	2024-12-11T23:09:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/708ff74b3d606492299dc792ac19c288052ee3b1/0_217_3456_2074/master/3456.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d043797e881defee6aeb42c054caf0cf

What were the missed chances to prevent Sara Sharif’s death?	Trial revealed 15 occasions when authorities were made aware that the schoolgirl was potentially in danger The murder of Sara Sharif has raised serious questions about missed chances to prevent her death, with the case revealing 15 occasions in which it was flagged to authorities that the schoolgirl was potentially in danger before she was killed in 2023. For more than a decade, Urfan Sharif, 43, had repeatedly attracted the attention of police, social services and schools. He was never charged in relation to previous abuse allegations made against him, and was given custody of Sara in 2019 despite the years-long concerns about the risk he posed.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/11/sara-sharif-death-what-were-the-missed-chances	2024-12-11T05:22:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56d4354262cfeef31045c2238bfc7b33ecde6f64/0_738_4252_2549/master/4252.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=092cdc781fe177eea76bd7b1889258ca

Iran’s supreme leader says US, Israel and Turkey behind fall of Assad | First Thing	Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s remarks came after leading rebel group named an interim prime minister, who urged calm. Plus, Luigi Mangione to plead not guilty and fight extradition Good morning. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has blamed the US, Israel and Turkey for the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria, after a lightning offensive by rebels toppled the regime. How is HTS being received? It remains on the UN’s list of designated terrorist groups – but the organization said it would consider removing HTS from the list if it forms an inclusive transitional government. What charges does he face? In Pennsylvania, he faces the charges of carrying a gun without a license, forgery, falsely identifying himself to the authorities and possessing -instruments of crime-.

With partisan gridlock and special interests more powerful than ever, it’s difficult to know how to move forward Rage, frustration and bitterness – all were on display in social media comments following the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Trump is dedicated to isolationism – but is Syria’s future too important to ignore?	Concerns that US’s hands-off approach could leave the country open to a return to civil war or a resurgence of Iran For a Biden administration in its final days, managing the downfall of Bashar al-Assad was not in the cards. For a Trump administration dedicated to isolationism and America First, Syria’s future may be too important to ignore. Before last week, the front lines of the country’s nearly 13-year-old civil war had been largely frozen. Conflicts in Ukraine and Israel were dominating attention and US diplomatic efforts around the world.

Four new prisons to be built but space could still run out, minister warns – UK politics live	Demand rising faster than any supply ‘could possibly catch up with’, justice secretary says Good morning. Labour inherited many problems with public services when it took office, but few were worse than the prison overcrowding crisis. This was so dire that it prompted Rishi Sunak into holding an early election. With the Ministry of Justice just days away from ordering a fresh early release system (which would have been unpopular with voters), this was one of the main reasons for Sunak holding the election in July, not last autumn. Today, as part of the government’s response, Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, is announcing plans to create 14,000 prison places by 2031. PA Media sums up the plans here. The government has said it will build four new prisons within the next seven years in a bid to grip the overcrowding crisis. The Ministry of Justice promised to find a total of 14,000 cell spaces in jails by 2031. Demand is still rising faster than any supply could possibly catch up with. We’re very honest and transparent in the strategy itself that building alone is not enough because the demand is rising more quickly. The demand for prison places is actually 4,500 extra every single year. Even with the emergency measures that I’ve been forced to take, that’s 3,000 every year, we can’t get there just by building alone. That’s why I set up the sentencing review just a few weeks ago, because we need a longer term solution. We will run out, because even all of that new supply, with the increase in prison population that we will see as a result of that new supply, doesn’t help you with the rise in demand, because demand is still rising faster than any supply could possibly catch up with. I would say to trade unions and everybody else workers alike, that this is the start of that process, and of course, I would hope that they recognise that the government’s fiscal inheritance has been extremely difficult, and we do have to make sure that the books overall balance as well, and that pay is on a sustainable footing. This is the start of that process, and I wouldn’t want to get ahead of where we think the pay review bodies might ultimately make their recommendations.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/11/pmqs-live-uk-politics-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-labour-tories-prisons	2024-12-11T01:14:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/997382d299c58c12a28abdf98d3f4ed246eb762a/0_78_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9f4efc1f416ca28b0845cbe4c0548200

Wednesday briefing: Everything you wanted to know about the spending review (but were afraid to ask)	In today’s newsletter: All governments do them. But what exactly are they and how can you tell if they worked or not? Good morning. There are certain phrases in news stories about government, aren’t there, where your eyes glaze over like you’ve just wound down the window and asked someone for directions. Autumn statement; early day motion; fiscal rules; white paper; ping pong, weirdly. They’re definitely all very important, but it would be cruel to stop the average punter halfway through a news story and ask them for a crisp definition. Today’s case in point: the spending review. I mean, we all know what a spending review is, obviously – it’s when they review the spending. But it’s also one of the defining moments in the life of any government – and the one now being undertaken by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has been billed as the crucial first step in Labour’s plan to hit the -milestone- targets Keir Starmer set out last week, and on which he has said the government should be judged. UK news | Vodafone -unjustly enriched- itself at the expense of scores of vulnerable small business owners by slashing commissions to franchisees running high street stores, according to allegations filed on Tuesday in the high court. Vodafone denied any misconduct ahead of a £120m legal claim. Syria | Syria’s leading rebel group has named a new prime minister, Mohammad al-Bashir, to head the country’s transitional government. Meanwhile, Israel said it had carried out more than 480 strikes over the previous 48 hours against weapons stockpiles to keep them out of the hands of extremists. Courts in crisis | The head of the government’s sentencing review has said that specialist courts focused on breaking cycles of addiction could be rolled out across England and Wales. In an interview with the Guardian, David Gauke praised -very encouraging- pilots of intensive supervision courts. Iran | Women in Iran could face the death sentence or up to 15 years in prison if they defy new compulsory morality laws due to come into effect this week. Amnesty International said the laws could lead to the execution of women who send videos of themselves unveiled to media outside Iran or engage in peaceful activism. US news | The suspect in the shooting death of the UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson, will plead not guilty and fight extradition from Pennsylvania to New York, his lawyer said yesterday. Outside a court hearing, Luigi Mangione shouted: -This is completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people-. While some of these efforts have made notable savings for the public purse and improved civil service capability … they have often taken the form of discrete, temporary initiatives, and had less success embedding efficiency as a continuous process and culture across government. None, moreover, have led to a fundamental step-change in government’s approach to public spending.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/11/wednesday-briefing-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-the-spending-review-but-were-afraid-to-ask	2024-12-10T22:55:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acbf3cf5124d6ee5426f218535b250356225c7b2/1541_1138_1410_846/master/1410.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c6c015a5ea8f4d2a1aed2e65d0b2289
Middle East crisis live: rebel-backed Syrian interim prime minister urges ‘stability and calm’	Mohammed al-Bashir chairs cabinet meeting of new transitional government and will lead interim authority until 1 March Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the Middle East crisis. Syria’s new interim leader said it was time for -stability and calm- in the country as he announced he was taking charge of the country as caretaker prime minister with the backing of the former rebels who toppled President Bashar al-Assad three days ago. Israel says it has carried out more than 480 airstrikes targeting weapons stockpiles and strategic infrastructure in Syria over the past 48 hours. The IDF said the air force conducted the crewed aircraft missile strikes on Syrian military targets including weapons production sites in the cities of Damascus, Homs, Tartus, Latakia and Palmyra. It said 130 strikes were -during ground operations- and aimed at weapons depots, military structures, launchers and firing positions. The world -has nothing to fear- from the new Syrian regime, the leader of rebel group Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS) has told Sky News in what the network says are his first comments to a western media outlet since his organization toppled Bashar al-Assad on Sunday. Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, attempted to reassure foreign nations in his remarks and promised Syria -will be rebuilt-. Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow is -providing sanctuary- for deposed Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, having transported him to Moscow on Sunday -in the most secure way possible-. -He is secured, and it shows that Russia acts as required in such an extraordinary situation,- he told NBC News. The insurgent group that overthrew Bashar al-Assad’s government in Syria claims to have wrested control of the eastern city of Deir el-Zour after intense battles with the Kurdish-led, US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), AP reported. A member of the Islamic group Hayat al-Tahrir Sham (HTS) said in a recorded video that the group would sweep neighbourhoods to secure the city. The nearby city of Boukamal had also fallen to HTS, the person said, adding that Raqqa and Hasakah were subsequent targets. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 218 people were killed in three days of fighting between Turkish-backed forces and the SDF in Manbij, north-east of Damascus. Early on Wednesday, SDF commander Mazloum Abdi said the SDF and the Turkey-backed rebels had reached a ceasefire agreement in Manbij through US mediation. Outgoing US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has called for an -inclusive- political process in Syria, saying the US would eventually recognise a new government if it renounces terrorism, destroys chemical weapons stocks and protects the rights of minorities and women. -The Syrian people will decide the future of Syria. All nations should pledge to support an inclusive and transparent process and refrain from external interference,- Blinken said in a statement. The UN would consider taking the Syrian rebel group that toppled the regime of Bashar al-Assad off its designated terrorist list if it passes the key test of forming a truly inclusive transitional government, according to a senior official at the world body. Geir Pedersen, UN special envoy for Syria, held out the prospect of removing Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) from the organisation’s list of proscribed terrorist groups.

Nigel Farage, man of the people, welcomes his latest billionaire to Reform	Like our Nige, Nick Candy doesn’t appear to have any solutions to anything … but he does have very deep pockets Several Range Rovers with blacked out windows pulled up outside the TV studios in Westminster. Out stepped Theresa May. Awkward. If she’d known her arrival was going to coincide with a Reform party photo call, she’d have probably asked the driver to go round the block again. Just in case people jumped to conclusions. Not that there was much chance of anyone imagining that the Maybot was about to leave the Tory party and defect to Reform. But better safe than sorry. These are happy days for Nigel Farage. OK, so Donald Trump might have gone a little cold on him. The Donald’s apparatchiks have been letting it be known that the president-elect regards Nige as an eccentric fanboy, basking in the reflected glory. But back in the UK things are hunky dory.

Daniel Penny’s acquittal reveals ‘double standard’ about white vigilante crime	In longstanding pattern in the US, white killers are celebrated and Black victims denigrated, experts say On Monday, Daniel Penny, a 26-year-old white man, was acquitted of all charges related to the 1 May 2023 killing of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old unhoused Black man with severe mental illness, on a New York City subway train. Penny was charged with second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide after he choked Neely for nearly six minutes, causing his death. The Marine veteran claimed self-defense after an unarmed Neely made threats to passengers and complained of being hungry and thirsty, according to witness testimony. In a police interview following Neely’s death, Penny referred to Neely as -just a crackhead- who was -acting like a lunatic-. Experts say Penny’s acquittal fits into a longstanding pattern of how white vigilante crime is treated in the US, with white killers celebrated and Black victims denigrated.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/10/daniel-penny-acquittal-white-vigilante-crime	2024-12-10T08:52:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfef4ee7132bc9e11499a87cc961fbf9378b5d06/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ff49d2c99fb0cbd79babe1127f88a3b6

UK politics live: Stop using money on non-priority areas, Reeves tells ministers, as she launches spending review	Chancellor due to speak at hospital event this morning as cabinet ministers have been asked to seek 5% efficiency savings in their departments Good morning. Today is the launch of the spending review. And the prime minister has been writing about the process. Every secretary of state inherits dozens of projects and priorities from his or her predecessor, and a huge quantity of government activity is therefore being carried out even if it is no longer necessary or relevant. In one of my very first cabinets, I told them all to go through their budget lines and cut at least 5%. ‘It’s time to slaughter the sacred cows,- I said. Secretaries of state across government will need to allocate their budgets to ensure that government spending is focused on the prime minister’s Plan for Change, and that every pound of taxpayers’ money is spent well. The chancellor will work with departments to prioritise spending that supports the milestones to deliver the plan … In letters sent by the chief secretary to the Treasury, departments will be advised that where spending is not contributing to a priority, it should be stopped. Although some of these decisions will be difficult, the chancellor is clear that the public must have trust in the government that it is rooting out waste and that their taxes are being spent on their priorities.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/10/uk-politics-live-rachel-reeves-spending-review-keir-starmer-cyprus	2024-12-10T01:20:40-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70e097d272bf4431f4956eb3304cd01f4ccc7b76/0_553_7560_4535/master/7560.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4e5e6c22b0797325de99741e42407205

Tuesday briefing: What happened when the doors of Syria’s most notorious prison were finally opened	In today’s newsletter: The Guardian’s William Christou was the first western journalist to gain access to Sednaya prison. He reflects on what he saw Good morning. Of all the horrific symbols of the deposed Assad regime, few carry the notoriety of Sednaya, the most feared node in the Syrian government’s repressive prison system. About 30,000 people were killed there between 2011 and 2020, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimated, more than in any other single location; for years, groups of 50 at a time were hanged in secret, once or twice a week. Many were still locked up there a couple of days ago, including women and children, in conditions so disorienting and dehumanising that some were unable to say their names. But early on Sunday, as the rebels swept into Damascus, the doors were opened, and they were freed.

The 87-year-old sporting great was hospitalised last Wednesday and spent time in intensive care with broken ribs and a broken wrist, Seven News reported. Dawn is an Australian living treasure – an icon of our sport – and we wish her a speedy, healthy and [full] recovery. If we’re asking people to identify with different flags … we are dividing our country unnecessarily … I think the fact is that we should stand up for who we are, for our values as a country which is what we should do in Australia. We should value and respect our heritage, and we should also speak a lot more about our migrant story, the incredible story of people who came here, particularly in the post-second world war period, with nothing, and have worked hard as trainees, as farmers, and they’ve educated their children.

Human rights for Syrians but perhaps not for Saudis in Labour’s Middle East	While David Lammy lauded the fall of Bashar al-Assad, Keir Starmer was having a love-in with Mohammed bin Salman Not that the foreign secretary was trying to take any of the credit for the collapse of the Assad regime, but without the UK standing firm then the dictator would have been around a lot longer. Just saying. Only maybe things weren’t entirely that simple. Because David Lammy had given an interview to Laura Kuenssberg back in September in which he said he had been talking enthusiastically to the Italians about their deal to send refugees back to Syria. So not quite the same as talking direct to Assad. But nearly so. By such threads are reputations made. Then to the known unknowns. The government would be cautious in its dealings with the rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. Who would have guessed? They would judge the new regime by its actions. But for now he was standing by the ordinary Syrians. They had a right to decide their own future democratically. And in Keir Starmer they had a man who would speak out against human rights abuses wherever he found them. Taking the Lead by John Crace is published by Little, Brown (£18.99).

There has not been a deportation charter flight to Pakistan since February 2020, with three subsequent deportation charter flights to Pakistan in 2020 and 2021 cancelled by the Home Office.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/dec/09/husband-and-wife-to-be-forced-apart-by-home-office-deportation-flight	2024-12-09T11:39:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7413cdf54992a2a73966d089ffc89dbe12b070a9/0_81_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1949ad8fceb84cdc2d0ffef69abfcb2a

Project 2025: the Trump picks with ties to ultra-rightwing policy manifesto	The president-elect has tried to distance himself from Project 2025, but several key choices have direct links to it On the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly disavowed Project 2025, saying he had -nothing to do- with the blueprint for a conservative presidency and didn’t know the people behind it. But as he starts to assemble his cabinet and White House staff, it seems likely he’ll get to know the people involved very well soon. Trump’s attempts to disavow the project before winning re-election seemed improbable, given that it was written by various members of his first administration and aligned on policy goals with his own proposed second term agenda.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/22/project-2025-trump-picks	2024-12-09T11:17:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bb72440e21561f467387af26b886e1c01647815/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=820eb260f0e19b12aa522bb4efb655ee

Will emergence of HTS in Syria raise level of global terrorism threats?	Intelligence chiefs have to decisively analyse the risk posed by group once affiliated to islamists al-Qaida When Sir Richard Moore, the head of MI6, warned in a speech given 10 days ago that he had -never seen the world in a more dangerous state- Syria was mentioned just once. The context was that jihadist terrorism was on the retreat in the country, but after the lightning success of the rebel offensive, questions will inevitably be asked again. Intelligence chiefs are now having to quickly reassess the triumphant Syrian rebels, and in particular, the leading group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), now designated as a terror organisation by the US and the UK. Once a Syrian offshoot of al-Qaida, HTS cut its affiliation in 2016 and under the leadership of Abu Mohammed al-Jolani the group has sought to project a moderate image as it has led the counter offensive from Idlib to Damascus, telling CNN in an interview with CNN he would respect Syrian minorities and -no one has the right to erase another group-. Early reports from Aleppo suggest the Christian minority in Aleppo was unaffected after the HTS capture of the city a week ago.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/09/will-emergence-of-hts-in-syria-raise-level-of-global-terrorism-threats	2024-12-09T10:52:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30c4c686f456765735a33c4226a6310be315fd74/0_0_2169_1301/master/2169.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=74c4b39ac3f6857221bb189647b887ff

Cheney was responding to comments made by Trump during an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday in which he said members of the House committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack -should go to jail- – but said he would not direct the attorney general or FBI he appoints during his second presidency to pursue the matter.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/09/liz-cheney-trump-prison-threat	2024-12-09T06:19:01-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec8268a71a4f74953d93babe79a114a1cf713f5c/0_344_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3d2fc9aba4c4c81b224ebd9c3a975c8f
Liz Cheney hits back at Trump after saying January 6 committee members should be jailed – live updates	Former Republican lawmaker says ‘Trump attempted to overturn the 2020 presidential election and seize power’ after he threatens to jail her and other committee members Good morning, US politics blog readers. In his first sit-down interview since winning the presidential election, Donald Trump made clear to NBC News on Sunday that he planned to upend an array of governing norms as soon as he gets into the White House. The president-elect said he would pardon most January 6 insurrectionists, and that the former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney and other lawmakers who served on the bipartisan House committee that investigated the attack on the Capitol -should go to jail-. That prompted a furious riposte from Cheney, who was ousted from Congress’s lower chamber two years ago over her break from Trump. -Here is the truth: Donald Trump attempted to overturn the 2020 presidential election and seize power,- Cheney said in a statement, where she also called for the justice department special counsel, Jack Smith, to release evidence he gathered into Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election.

Domestic issues pile pressure on Iran’s president amid foreign policy setbacks	Tensions over executions and plans for petrol price rise and hijab law add to reversals in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria The fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, the latest in a string of foreign policy reversals for Iran including the weakening of its allies in Lebanon and Gaza, has coincided with growing domestic frustration over rising executions, planned increases in the price of petrol and a proposed law that imposes heavy fines and loss of access to public services to any woman not wearing the hijab. The confluence of events is putting unprecedented pressure on Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, to demonstrate what reforms he has introduced since being elected in June. He is viewed domestically as a consensual figure and faces a conservative parliament, but his supporters are impatient for changes that will lift the economy.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/09/domestic-issues-pile-pressure-on-iran-president-masoud-pezeshkian-amid-foreign-policy-setbacks	2024-12-09T05:56:39-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13d67e6a1399149df366dca5b88b9b979392035f/0_0_2550_1530/master/2550.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=29ba286f96fe859312f829ace07843e1

Critics say his scheduling of 28 January primaries in solid Republican districts held by former congressman Matt Gaetz, who resigned during his ill-fated nomination for attorney general, and Mike Waltz, Trump’s pick for national security adviser, is a hasty political move designed purely to bolster speaker Mike Johnson’s fragile House majority as soon as possible.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/09/ron-desantis-republican-house-primaries	2024-12-09T04:00:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1e5867cd61739fd4f899453c80711a852d6c3d8/0_39_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=687a719a65247eae52be21b0a194d0be

Badenoch has not said much about how this might happen (although she has spoken about wanting the state to do less, implying not so much a rewiring of the state as a complete removal of some of the wiring instead). And Starmer has not given a detailed vision of what rewiring might involve either, but this morning Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister, will give a speech providing the answer, or at least one answer. As Eleni Courea reports in her overnight story, McFadden will say the government will ask officials managing public service delivery to operate as if they are running a tech startup. ‘Crack’ teams of problem solvers will be deployed to improve public services and support delivery of the Plan for Change. Made up of a mix of people working in partnership to drive change - with data and digital skills, policy officials, and frontline workers, they will be given the freedom to experiment and adapt - adopting the ‘test and learn’ mindset of Silicon Valley. Instead of writing more complicated policy papers and long strategy documents, the government will set the teams a challenge and empower them to experiment, innovate and try new things. Test it. Fix the problems. Change the design. Test it again. Tweak it again. And so on, and so on, for as long as you provide the service. Suddenly, the most important question isn’t, ‘How do we get this right the first time?’. It’s ‘How do we make this better by next Friday? That’s the test and learn mindset, and I’m keen to see where we can deploy it in government. Where we can make the state a little bit more like a start-up.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/09/uk-politics-live-pat-mcfadden-labour-civil-service-reform-rachel-reeves-eu-relationship	2024-12-09T01:07:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a55ea176fe656f47cb50ac18d01a3ada0f5f223/0_35_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=02cbf5435ee5704f6cea93791965ba6d

Syria live: civil defence teams investigating ‘hidden underground cells’ at notorious Assad prison	Syria’s White Helmets send rescue teams to Sednaya prison; ousted president Bashar al-Assad has fled to Moscow, Russian media report As the brutal regime of Bashar al-Assad fell, the doors of the country’s notorious prisons have opened, including those of Sednaya, a facility described as a -human slaughterhouse-. Across the country prisoners, bewildered and exultant, have poured out of their cells. Syrian anti-government rebels declared they had ousted President Bashar al-Assad after seizing control of Damascus on Sunday, in an astonishing end to his family’s decades of autocratic rule after more than 13 years of civil war. The ousted Syrian president is now in Russia, according to a Kremlin source, where he has been granted asylum on -humanitarian grounds-. The United Nations security council will convene on Monday afternoon for an emergency closed door meeting on Syria in the aftermath of the ousted president fleeing the country. Thousands of Syrians have rallied across cities in Europe in the wake of the news, waving flags and barely able to contain their joy at Assad’s downfall. Similar celebrations have also been seen in Syrian embassies, including in Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur. As armed rebels swept cities across Syria, flinging open detention facilities where rights groups estimated that at least 100,000 people were considered missing or forcibly disappeared since 2011 at the hands of the state. This included the Sednaya military prison, a facility notorious as the site of particularly brutal and humiliating methods of torture. UN secretary-general António Guterres on Sunday praised the end of Syria’s -dictatorial regime- and called on the country to focus on rebuilding. Joe Biden said the sudden collapse of the Syrian government was a -fundamental act of justice- after decades of repression, but that it’s -a moment of risk and uncertainty- for the Middle East. The US Central Command said its forces conducted dozens of airstrikes on Islamic State targets in central Syria on Sunday. The US president also said it believes missing American journalist Austin Tice, who disappeared 12 years ago near the Syrian capital, is alive and -we think we can get him back-. Rebel commander Abu Mohammed al-Jolani said in a statement read on Syria’s state TV that there is no room for turning back. -The future is ours,- his statement said. Al-Jolani, commander of Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS), reportedly said that all state institutions would remain under the supervision of al-Assad’s prime minister until they were handed over officially. The Israeli military has issued a warning to five towns in southern Syria, calling on residents to stay at home -until further notice- due to ongoing combat in the area. Arab states will seek to avert the threat of a reignited Syrian civil war by starting an open dialogue with all the forces on the ground to ensure any transition is inclusive of all Syrians regardless of ethnicity, Qatar’s foreign ministry has said.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/09/syria-bashar-al-assad-asylum-russia-live-updates-blog	2024-12-08T21:43:25-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8efc08d5dcc85da9ef7026d8e252b963d3e1f99c/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=204c3d4c1aad8c7909d148d37ccf5248

The Guardian splashed with -Rebels seize Damascus as Assad flees to Moscow-, with a picture underneath of celebrations in Damascus.

Peter Dutton accused of ‘disgusting’ political point-scoring after synagogue firebombing – then attacks Jewish Labor MP	Josh Burns says he has been standing up for his Melbourne community ‘every day’ as Chris Bowen calls for national unity Peter Dutton has launched an extraordinary attack on the Labor MP Josh Burns, claiming that the Jewish politician has failed to speak up about antisemitism in the community, despite numerous public statements and speeches, including a joint press conference with a senior Coalition member hours after the Melbourne synagogue attack. The opposition leader’s comments came just hours after the federal minister Chris Bowen accused the Coalition of -disgusting- attempts to politicise the attack on the Ripponlea synagogue, saying it should be a moment for national unity rather than political point-scoring.

Politicians’ ‘inflammatory language’ part of failure to tackle extremism, report finds	Report calls for ‘radical rethink’ of how ministers approach extremism, amid risk of declining trust in democracy and institutions Politicians have been criticised for using -inflammatory language- and peddling conspiracy theories in a report that finds government policies are failing to prevent extremism spreading and taking route in the UK. The report from Dame Sara Khan, a former counter-extremism commissioner, urges a -radical rethink- of how ministers tackle extremism amid a -chronic risk of democratic decline- due to conspiracy theories, worsening social cohesion and other threats. Twenty-nine percent of people in the UK believe in the -great reset- conspiracy theory that claims there are plans to impose a totalitarian world government. Forty-five percent of young men in the UK have a positive view of the misogynistic influencer Andrew Tate. One in 10 people shared the views of or sympathised with those who engaged in violent disorder and rioting during the summer.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/09/politicians-inflammatory-language-part-of-failure-to-tackle-extremism-report-finds	2024-12-08T16:01:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c9fb41a828d2ab96a9a25b6c5dccc400693a176/289_125_2162_1297/master/2162.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f885c9d856b54b00879a706cdf8d3198

Syria’s rebels had strengths, but it was his regime’s weakness that undid Assad | Jason Burke	Corruption and incompetence in the army and successful outreach by the rebels left the troops with little to fight for When the rebels finally reached Bashar al-Assad’s sprawling palace in Damascus, the gates were open. There was no traffic on the floodlit highways leading into the vast estate, and apparently no defenders among the carefully tended trees. In the empty guardhouses, coats were still hung on the back of doors, so swiftly had the occupants fled. Asked by the Guardian early on Sunday morning what had happened to the tens of thousands of men of the armed forces, pro-government militias, intelligence services, police and others who had all been dedicated to the preservation of Assad’s rule, one veteran Damascus-based analyst gave a terse answer: -They have vanished.

Hezbollah’s war with Israel left the Assad regime fatally exposed	With the fall of Damascus, Iran can longer deny that its political and military ‘axis of resistance’ has collapsed It was not a coincidence that the Syrian group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) began its push for the city of Aleppo on the same day that Israel and Hezbollah agreed a ceasefire to end the fighting in Lebanon. The domino effect set in motion by Hamas on 7 October 2023 is still rippling through the Middle East, this weekend resulting in the spectacular downfall of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. A country that suffered under a Ba’athist regime for 60 years, as well as 14 years of civil war, is celebrating hard-won freedoms as thousands of disappeared people pour out of Assad’s infamous prisons. What comes next in Syria, which still has to grapple with deep internal and sectarian problems, is uncertain. In Iran though, the picture is clearer.

Syrian rebels say they have captured capital as Bashar al-Assad reported to have fled Damascus – live updates	Anti-regime forces declare Damascus ‘free’ of Assad as government forces withdraw presence Welcome back to our live coverage of the rebel offensive that seems to have been successful in toppling the Syrian government, led by longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad. Here are the latest developments: Rebel forces, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, in Damascus have declared the Syrian capital -free- of Assad as government forces withdraw their presence. In the capital’s central square, people climbed on top of tanks and cheered as they trampled on a toppled statue of Assad’s father, Hafez. The Syrian rebel coalition said it is continuing work to complete the transfer of power in Syria to a transitional governing body with full executive powers. Syrian prime minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said the government is ready to -extend its hand- to the opposition and hand over its functions to a transitional government. -I am in my house and I have not left, and this is because of my belonging to this country,- Jalili said. Syria’s army command notified officers on Sunday that Assad’s regime had ended, Reuters is reporting. But the Syrian army later said it was continuing operations against -terrorist groups- in the key cities of Hama and Homs and in Deraa countryside. Assad, who has ruled the country for nearly 25 years, has reportedly left Damascus by plane for an unknown destination. US president-elect Donald Trump said on Sunday that Assad had -fled his country- after losing the backing of Russia. -Assad is gone,- he said on his Truth Social platform. -His protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer.- Outgoing US President Joe Biden and his team were monitoring the -extraordinary events in Syria- and were in touch with regional partners, the White House said. As armed rebels swept cities across the country, they flung open detention facilities where rights groups estimated that at least 100,000 people were considered missing or forcibly disappeared since 2011 at the hands of the state. This included the Sednaya military prison, a facility notorious as the site of particularly brutal and humiliating methods of torture. Iraq has reportedly evacuated its embassy in Syria and moved staff to Lebanon, hours after rebels overthrew Assad and took control of the capital. Reasons behind the evacuation were not made public.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/08/syria-bashar-al-assad-damascus-rebels-latest-updates-live	2024-12-08T01:22:16-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d433e02565e9b5ded780243dc1428a8b16198400/0_213_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=70e4da8655e611220edf191384887c79

On wokeness, patriotism and change, Kamala Harris’s defeat has lessons for Starmer | Deborah Mattinson and Claire Ainsley	Two former senior advisers to Labour analyse the clear messages from US voters’ preference for Trump • ‘Don’t dodge your responsibilities,’ Starmer warns English councils that block new homes Given how events unfolded, it was never going to be easy for Kamala Harris. Many Democrats are ­convinced her ­campaign saved the party from an even worse result. To be fair, it achieved some real highs: she won the debate. But she never won the argument, at least not with the ­voters who mattered most. The US election triggered a scary deja vu moment for those of us who had watched the 2019 UK ­general ­election from behind our sofas, hands over our eyes. The Democrats lost votes with almost everyone, almost everywhere, but, like Labour in the -red wall-, most ­dramatically with traditional heartland ­voters: working-class, low-paid, non-­graduates. And, like Labour back in 2019, that lost connection with core voters had not happened overnight.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/dec/07/wokeness-patriotism-change-kamala-harris-defeat-labour	2024-12-07T12:00:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b833160f08bd79d3bfacf5ab69c523ff581966b/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6a07ce69f63b96111065952d70ef2ce1

Younger people at greater risk of heat-related deaths this century – study	New research estimates a 32% increase in deaths of people under 35 if greenhouse gases not radically cut Extreme heat fueled by the climate crisis is often viewed as primarily a problem for vulnerable segments of the population, such as elderly people.

While older people are susceptible to heatwaves, they currently make up the bulk of cold-related deaths. As the world heats up, it will be younger people that will suffer disproportionately as the mortality burden shifts, with the new study estimating a 32% increase in deaths of people under 35 years old this century from heat if greenhouse gases emissions aren’t radically cut.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/06/young-adults-heat-related-deaths-climate-crisis	2024-12-06T11:00:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21ae0d10b6a47341f4dad01f77cbd31d2267a63f/0_71_5116_3069/master/5116.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b937bee7f65469fbded1626db3db7f9f

Your smoke detector may be at risk if solar power is turned off during sunny days to protect the grid, experts say	High voltage required to use Aemo’s emergency backstop is a bit like stopping a car by driving into a tree, Vince Garrone says This week’s call by the Australian Energy Market Operator for -emergency backstop- mechanisms to switch off rooftop solar systems brings safety risks, because the high voltages needed exceed the limits that many appliances have safely been tested for. That’s according to Vince Garrone, former power quality manager at Energex, Queensland’s biggest electricity distributor who called the situation ironic. Authorities, in using -brute force- to trip inverters, were creating the very high voltage conditions the device protection was designed to prevent.

Trump defends Pete Hegseth as he announces more administration picks – live	President-elect says embattled defense secretary nominee ‘is doing very well’ and announces new role of ‘White House AI and crypto czar’ Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump announced a slew of new nominations for top administration officials last night, including ambassador to China, head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and a new role of -White House AI and crypto czar-. He also made clear he was sticking by his embattled nominee for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth. Writing on Truth Social this morning, Trump said Hegseth -is doing very well-, even though it remains unclear if key senators will support his nomination to lead the Pentagon. The former Fox News host has spent the past few days on Capitol Hill, trying to win over Republican lawmakers in spite of reports of his excessive drinking, financial mismanagement of two charities, and a sexual assault allegation. Back to the nominations Trump announced last night, former Georgia senator David Perdue will serve as ambassador to China, while tech entrepreneur and Elon Musk associate David Sacks has been appointed to the new crypto czar role – the latest sign that the Trump administration will be much friendlier to the digital asset industry than Joe Biden’s ever was. The US job market remains robust, according to just-released government data that showed the economy added 227,000 jobs in November, and the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%. Joe Biden will deliver remarks from the White House at the 6pm ET performance of -The Eyes of the World: From D-Day to VE Day-, which honors World War II veterans.

But just days ago, as anticipation grew over the start later this month of the second season of Squid Game – the first season of which is Netflix’s most-watched show – real-life dystopia intervened when the South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, announced he was imposing martial law to root out -anti-state forces- and overcome political opponents who were obstructing his policy agenda.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/06/k-pop-and-autocrats-jolt-to-democracy-lays-bare-south-korea-two-sides	2024-12-06T05:21:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/842f3ea3f397d391e9a3b97d1c1052af2b32c280/0_81_3805_2283/master/3805.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=93aa1697f954d6ed81a89b2fc314009f

Meet the Rees-Moggs: a bluffer’s guide to the family’s weirdness	Just in case you can’t bear to watch the former Tory MP’s new reality show, we equip you for it coming up in conversation Jacob Rees-Mogg’s new reality show may sound as appealing as flushing your entire head down a toilet. Yet Meet the Rees-Moggs (on Discovery+) is such a bewildering piece of television that it may well come up in conversation over the next few weeks. If that’s the case, here’s a handy bluffer’s guide to just how weird the former Tory MP and his family are. Jacob Rees-Mogg’s Somerset home is covered with portraits of Jacob Rees-Mogg. It is so heavily plastered with pictures of him that you will soon lose count. There’s a painting of him as an adolescent. There’s a painting of him mimicking Aaron Shikler’s John F Kennedy portrait. There’s a painting of him standing in front of another painting, which is quite Inception-y of him. The best one, though, is a painting of him that one of his six children is forced to stare at during trumpet practice. Jacob Rees-Mogg is a Greggs nut. Apparently, he says, he buys a ham and cheese baguette and a chocolate eclair for his lunch every day. He says this, however, during the election campaign and then never mentions it again after he loses his seat, so maybe it is simply a wrongheaded attempt to pander to the electorate. Jacob Rees-Mogg is a picky eater. Perhaps the Greggs infatuation is down to his bizarre eating habits. He doesn’t like yellow food, for example, and a member of his household staff points out: -He isn’t a fan of vegetables or onions or anything like that.- Jacob Rees-Mogg describes the same member of staff, a man named Shaun, as someone who -does everything that needs to be done in a busy household-. This includes -making our cider and looking after the Bentley-. His duties also appear to include scrubbing the words -posh twat- off election campaign posters and, in one instance, doing the -wanker- sign at a portrait of Robert Peel. Jacob Rees-Mogg sleeps completely still. As if he was in a tomb, he says. Chilling. Jacob Rees-Mogg quotes his election concession speech all the time. When he lost his seat this year, he quoted Chitty Chitty Bang Bang by saying: -From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success.- He also uses this exact phrase when his dog eats one of his daughter’s sausages off the floor. Jacob Rees-Mogg is sent into apoplexy by the notion of commuting badgers. During his post-election doldrums, and inspired by his daughter’s desire to emulate Carrie Johnson, he briefly entertains the idea of digging a duck pond in his garden. When the planning permission report points out that the pond might disrupt the path of commuting badgers, he throws a little tantrum and gives up. Jacob Rees-Mogg does not pack his own suitcases. Jacob Rees-Mogg has a private chapel. It contains some of his most prized possessions: a fragment of the true cross, a fragment of the crown of thorns and a piece of Thomas More’s hair shirt. It is illegal to buy and sell this sort of item, he says, but not necessarily illegal to buy and sell the containers that they happen to come in. What an unexpected wheeler dealer. Jacob Rees-Mogg is capable of emotion. But only briefly and only if you look hard enough. He doesn’t flinch when he loses his seat, nor does he flinch when the promise of becoming Conservative party chairman is snatched from him at the last minute. But when he Facetimes his daughter shortly after she has been sent to boarding school – something he struggled to adapt to as a child and she clearly isn’t thrilled about either – he very briefly clams up in a very repressed, English, privately educated way. Maybe, buried deep beneath the multiple self-parodic layers he’s constructed around himself, he does actually have a heart. Jacob Rees-Mogg makes his children dress in black tie for dinner on Saturday nights.	https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/dec/06/meet-the-rees-moggs-a-bluffers-guide-to-the-familys-weirdness	2024-12-06T05:00:56-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9655fe9bf50ad84df5b376eecdbe67822a255927/0_13_4240_2545/master/4240.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7cf5ab9cdc0ef0044b98c5c0c2b19376

The House has voted against publishing the ethics committee’s report into allegations of sexual misconduct and potential illegal activities by the former Florida Republican representative Matt Gaetz. On what grounds was it blocked? Gaetz resigned from the House on 13 November, when Trump picked him for attorney general – and the Mississippi Republican Michael Guest, the committee chair, said the panel’s investigative authority ended then.

Russia and Ukraine warily wait for Trump transition … and subsequent peace talks	President-elect’s strategy on ending war is yet to emerge but interviews with Ukrainian officials and Russians suggest a compromise may be hard to find Nobody knows when the talks will happen, or in what city. It is unclear who might be sitting at the table, or what format the discussion will take. But at some point in the coming months, the incoming US administration will likely attempt to negotiate an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Donald Trump takes office in January and with his self-image as a great dealmaker boasted on the campaign trail that he could end the war in 24 hours. Last week Trump appointed the retired army general Keith Kellogg as his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, tasked primarily with ending the war. Or as Trump put it in his online announcement, to -secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH-.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/06/russia-and-ukraine-warily-wait-for-trump-transition-and-subsequent-peace-talks	2024-12-06T04:31:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42e8a0719d3d0f1502efae800b42add62b275bf8/0_11_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c5e8ffe0fb288dfb9ca8631b00b68715

Starmer vows to take on ‘blockers’ as Labour council says government housebuilding targets ‘impossible’ – UK politics live	The PM has said he wants 1.5 million homes to be built in England before the next election Good morning. Yesterday Keir Starmer committed the government to six -measurable milestones- – a mixture of some new targets and some existing ones, wrapped up in a package intended to show people that the government is focusing on things that will make a tangible difference to their lives. They are in a Plan for Change which is an implicit admission that the previous headline performance indicators that Starmer said he wanted to be judged by – his five pre-election missions, and his six -first steps for change- – were a bit woolly. One of the new milestones is: Building 1.5 million homes in England and fast-tracking planning decisions on at least 150 major economic infrastructure projects - more than the last 14 years combined. I feel that we are going to be on a collision course with Labour. And it’s not just Labour councils. It’s Liberal Democrats, it’s Conservatives, they’ve all said the same thing. Absolutely, absolutely, over these planning targets. They are absolutely impossible and unrealistic. I know, with trust in politics so low, the public are sceptical of promises made by politicians. And who can blame them, after years of inaction by successive Tory governments. But that can’t be an excuse for low expectations and easy ambitions, a culture that isn’t brave enough to even try for fear of failure. I know some councils have come out this week to challenge our plans for housing reform. I always knew there would be resistance to our planning reform. Let me say this — I won’t shy away from this argument. In fact, I welcome it. Where there are blockers putting the brakes on, it’s a sign you are delivering real change. And change is what the British people voted for this summer — a government that is willing to take on the obstacles and break down the barriers that prevent us from reaching our full potential.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/06/keir-starmer-labour-housebuilding-uk-politics-latest-news	2024-12-06T01:13:40-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b769606c766b22d9f90e8da165eb5801c36e5535/0_0_7179_4307/master/7179.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=914a57f4ae8552501a9e374169a50647

Middle East crisis live: thousands of people flee Homs in central Syria as rebel forces push on	Rebels have captured key cities of Aleppo and Hama, dealing blows to president Bashar al-Assad 14 years after protests erupted across Syria Thousands of people fled the central Syrian city of Homs overnight and into Friday morning, a war monitor and residents said, as rebel forces sought to push their lightning offensive against government forces further south. They have already captured the key cities of Aleppo in the north and Hama in the centre, dealing successive devastating blows to president Bashar al-Assad, nearly 14 years after protests against him erupted across Syria. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of sources in Syria, said 826 people, mostly combatants but also including 111 civilians, have been killed in the country since the violence erupted last week. It marks the most intense fighting since 2020 in the civil war sparked by the repression of pro-democracy protests in 2011. Iran says it conducted a successful space launch, the latest for its program the west alleges improves Tehran’s ballistic missile programme. Iran conducted the launch using its Simorgh programme, a satellite-carrying rocket that had seen a series of failed launches. The launch took place at Iran’s Imam Khomeini Spaceport in rural Semnan province. There was no immediate independent confirmation Friday the launch was successful. Iraqi foreign minister, Fuad Hussein, will meet his Syrian and Iranian counterparts on Friday to discuss the situation in Syria, the Iraqi state news agency said on Thursday. A Hamas official said on Thursday that international mediators have resumed negotiating with the militant group and Israel over a ceasefire in Gaza, and that he was hopeful a deal to end the 14-month war was within reach. Ceasefire negotiations were halted last month when Qatar suspended talks with mediators from Egypt and the US because of frustration over a lack of progress between Israel and Hamas. Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said that he plans to hold talks on Friday with Turkish and Iranian officials on the situation in Syria. On Thursday, Lavrov said Moscow was -very much concerned- with a recent escalation of violence in Syria.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/06/middle-east-crisis-thousands-people-flee-homs-central-syria-rebel-forces-israel-gaza-latest-updates	2024-12-05T23:41:45-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86a3cb871a504d070fc2604e46debbfaf928e9cc/0_298_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a01ab8deeda9eb1b49730b7d1b16936f

Pete Hegseth’s nomination hangs on key senator as more details of drinking emerge – US politics live	Senator Joni Ernst expected to be key to fate of Trump’s Pentagon pick; media reports say Hegseth faced HR investigation over Fox Christmas party antics Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, will be back once again on Capitol Hill today to try to convince Republican senators that he’s the right man to lead the Pentagon. Reports of excessive drinking, financial mismanagement and poor treatment of women, as well as a sexual assault allegation, have dogged his nomination over the past days, with several conservative lawmakers expressing doubts over approving him for the job. But the most important voice in determining his fate has not piped up yet: Iowa’s Republican senator Joni Ernst. The army veteran and sexual assault survivor met with Hegseth yesterday but said little publicly about their talk. Her views on him will be pivotal in determining whether the former Fox News host’s nomination advances, or goes the way of Matt Gaetz. Meanwhile, the New York Times has uncovered more details of incidents Hegseth was involved in while employed by the conservative network. These include another story of him drinking to excess, as well as an incident at a Christmas party eight years ago that led to an investigation from Fox News’s human resources department. We’ll see what Republican senators have to say about that throughout today. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be together in public again at 6pm ET to light the national Christmas tree outside the White House. The pair have not been seen together much since Harris lost last month’s presidential election to Trump. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are heading to the Capitol today to promote the Department of Government Efficiency, their unorthodox, Trump-sanctioned idea to cut spending and downsize Washington’s federal organs. The House committee investigating the attempted assassination of Trump will hear testimony from acting Secret Service director Ronald Rowe Jr, and will also mark up its final report.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/dec/05/trump-hegseth-defense-drinking-us-politics-latest-updates	2024-12-05T06:01:43-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b780f6d71d2b25177f08a1e727674413bdeb0c12/1160_481_3360_2016/master/3360.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dec94b935632b4c6c5acaa8a1f14ada4

Twenty Minnesota ballots went missing in key race that hinges on 14 votes	Race for state house seat, which will determine whether Republicans win control of chamber, separated by 14 votes Twenty ballots went missing in a Minnesota precinct this November, the type of error that would typically result in an internal investigation but not receive much public attention.
