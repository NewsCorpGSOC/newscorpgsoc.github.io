Meta scrapped factcheckers because systems were ‘too complex’	Comments by co-chair of oversight board Helle Thorning-Schmidt come as X CEO welcomes move by rival The co-chair of Meta’s oversight board has said the company’s systems have become -too complex- after it decided to scrap factcheckers, as the chief executive of Elon Musk’s X welcomed the decision. Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the co-chair of the social media company’s oversight board and the former prime minister of Denmark, has said she and the departed president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, had agreed -Meta systems have been too complex-, adding that there had been -over-enforcement-.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/08/meta-scrapped-factcheckers-because-systems-were-too-complex	2025-01-08T02:43:38-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e2d39d119805965f27ae8f473c86ecd56e04356/14_40_5932_3562/master/5932.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a5fccb27cf17a2e4d54f2f09678a0beb
Met to hold inquiry over handling of Mohamed Al Fayed allegations	Internal inquiry into two complaints will seek to establish if there were ‘any missed opportunities or failures’ Two complaints from victims about the Met police’s handling of allegations against Mohamed Al Fayed in 2008 will be investigated by the force’s directorate of professional standards to establish whether there were -any missed opportunities or failures-, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said.

Do they mean us? Mexicans bemused as Emilia Pérez sweeps film awards	Film largely praised by international critics but Mexicans ridiculed idea that it represents their country A musical about a Mexican cartel boss who fakes their death, transitions and is reborn as a heroine searching for the forcibly disappeared is sweeping international film awards, but prompted amusement and outrage in Mexico. Emilia Pérez, directed by Jacques Audiard, has been largely praised by international critics, though some noted it risked trivialising extremely sensitive issues. It scooped the jury prize at Cannes before winning four Golden Globes on Sunday, including those for best musical or comedy and best non-English language film.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/08/emilia-perez-film-mexico-misrepresentation	2025-01-08T02:00:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27248af91fd7226b9360c99c9fb1790b10ebbdc0/0_0_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a406e62f7e285d30b32c7121930b09fb
Berries, creek water and two muesli bars: how missing hiker survived in Kosciuszko national park	After almost two weeks missing in the rugged Australian Alps, Hadi Nazari has been found alive It’s some of Australia’s harshest, most unforgiving terrain. In Kosciuszko national park, the bush can be so thick in places you can’t see far beyond what’s in front of your face. The ranges are steep and remote. Extreme UV radiation belts down throughout the day and winds whip at you in the afternoon.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/08/how-missing-hiker-survived-in-kosciuszko-national-park	2025-01-08T01:58:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78b3ff572ebd26422b99b0adc39f4a697ab7cb62/399_274_2139_1284/master/2139.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d87ae4f23898b6e833ec1da52888dc48
Top Tory claims Elon Musk ‘may have saved humanity’ as Starmer attacks Badenoch over child safety – UK politics live	Prime minister says if Tories vote for amendment on children’s wellbeing bill, it will show ‘they are more interested in retweets than children’s safety’ as shadow business secretary praises Musk Good morning. Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch will be in the Commons today for the first PMQs of 2025 and the Tory calls for national inquiry into grooming gangs will continue to be near the top of the news agenda. That is because Badenoch is pushing for a vote on the children’s wellbeing and schools bill that would block the legislation and call on the government to set up an inquiry instead. The inquiry element is a procedural red herring because the Conservatives would have voted against the bill anyway. But, if the Speaker does allow a vote on the Tory reasoned amendment, Badenoch will be able to launch a social media campaign accusing Labour of voting against a grooming gang inquiry. The Conservatives are opposed to the bill primarily because it will restrict some of the freedoms enjoyed by academies. But the legislation also contains safeguarding measures that have widespread support, and Starmer has given an interview to the Daily Mirror saying that, if the Tories vote for their amendment, it will show they are more interested in retweets than children’s safety. He told the paper: I would implore any right-thinking Tory MP to vote for the bill because [the Conservative reasoned amendment] would kill the bill, this would kill the legislation. It would kill the provisions for a unique identifying number that will stop children falling through the cracks … No MP should be voting down children’s safeguarding measures. It’s shocking they are even thinking about this as a tactic. It’s the elevation of the desire for retweets over any real interest in the safeguarding of children. The @elonmusk purchase of X may have saved humanity. With X becoming a true freedom of speech platform, the common ground of public opinion is no longer determined by a left-leaning elite.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/08/conservatives-elon-musk-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-child-safety-pmqs-uk-politics-latest-updates	2025-01-08T01:41:29-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e40c507446dd3da2bfcb442b9e4d40b96ddd0146/0_246_7536_4522/master/7536.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6408a15555e5a791a04e82278b6fb357

UK weather live: Met Office weather warning for snow in southern England comes into force	Warnings issued on Tuesday for snow and ice in the Midlands, north Wales, north-west of England, north and west of Scotland and Northern Ireland remain in place Good morning and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the UK’s freezing weather. A fresh weather warning is set to come into force as it is revealed that 300 properties have flooded across England since New Year’s Eve, reports the PA news agency. Dozens of people have been rescued by firefighters across Leicestershire since Monday, Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service said. Homeowners on Belton Road in Loughborough were stranded on the first floor of their semi-detached houses on Tuesday after rising water from the nearby Grand Union canal flooded the street. Patients have been urged to attend A&amp;E alone as NHS hospitals grapple with high demand amid rising flu cases. Several NHS trusts declared critical incidents due to -exceptionally high demands- in emergency departments. Hundreds of schools were closed across the UK on Tuesday, with road and rail links blocked. Manchester, Bristol and Liverpool John Lennon airports were forced to suspend flights because of the conditions. The RAC said Monday was the busiest day for breakdowns this winter. Rod Dennis, RAC spokesperson said: -Anyone unfortunate enough to break down should expect a longer wait than normal this week. It’s therefore more important than ever that drivers ensure they have an emergency breakdown kit in the boot.-	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2025/jan/08/uk-weather-met-office-yellow-weather-warning-snow-ice-flooding-latest-updates	2025-01-08T00:42:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d86551da2daf247dc7c91bb974fa32388146301/0_163_5071_3043/master/5071.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f8a8578b4fe7853f2480e764a5efd9b0
Wednesday briefing: What Elon Musk’s focus on grooming gangs reveals about alt-right online discourse	In today’s newsletter: The owner of X, who previously said ‘civil war is inevitable’ in Britain, has stoked online unrest with incendiary comments about the UK Good morning. What is a news story in the UK? Whatever Elon Musk says it is. That is the conclusion you might draw, anyway, from the influence of the billionaire Trump adviser’s posts on X claiming that -a quarter-million little girls were – still are – being systematically raped by migrant gangs in Britain-, and demanding a new public inquiry into historic child sexual exploitation in Oldham, Rotherham, Rochdale and elsewhere. There is no reliable basis for the quarter-million figure. In any case, Prof Alexis Jay, the chair of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse in England and Wales that looked extensively at grooming gang scandals and published a series of recommendations in 2022, said yesterday that -we’ve had enough of inquiries, consultations and discussions-, and urged the government to instead implement more of her proposals. But the political energy is still around the idea of a new inquiry as some sort of panacea, and the Conservatives will try to force a vote on one in parliament today. Social media | Meta will get rid of factcheckers, -dramatically reduce the amount of censorship- and recommend more political content on Facebook and Instagram, founder Mark Zuckerberg has said. The suite of changes was met with dismay by critics, who described them as -a full bending of the knee to Trump-. British army | Afghans who were killed by members of the SAS in Afghanistan were described dismissively as having been -flat packed-, according to a former member of the elite force’s sister unit. The soldier, known only as N1799, was giving evidence to an inquiry into the deaths of 80 civilians in Helmand province. California | A fast-moving wildfire erupted in Los Angeles on Tuesday, quickly consuming nearly 3,000 acres and destroying homes in an affluent community along the Pacific Ocean. Amid a significant windstorm across much of southern California, a second unrelated blaze also forced evacuations in a different part of Los Angeles. France | Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of France’s far-right National Front party, who sent shock waves through the country when he made it to the second round of the presidential election in 2002, has died at 96. Drugs | Ketamine could be reclassified as a class A drug by the Home Office after illegal use reached record levels last year. Ministers are seeking -expert advice- on reclassification – it is currently a class B substance – after an estimated 299,000 people reported use of the drug in 2024.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/08/wednesday-briefing-what-elon-musks-focus-on-grooming-gangs-reveals-about-alt-right-online-discourse	2025-01-07T22:52:36-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e5573231a4bfc5fd11849cc4f48a2b5e07932c9/0_94_5665_3400/master/5665.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ac294ec52d863e7a55d44ee0a98d699f

Coffee drinkers reap health boost – but only if they do it in the morning	Pre-lunch brewers enjoy lower risk of death, analysis finds, but benefit vanishes among all-day drinkers People who get their coffee hit in the morning reap benefits that are not seen in those who have shots later in the day, according to the first major study into the health benefits of the drink at different times. Analysis of the coffee consumption of more than 40,000 adults found that morning coffee drinkers were 16% less likely to die of any cause and 31% less likely to die from cardiovascular disease during a 10-year follow-up period than those who went without.	https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jan/08/coffee-drinkers-reap-health-boost-but-only-if-they-do-it-in-the-morning	2025-01-07T22:00:01-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ea2cea497324197ad1d71114586c62d0c9e8e1f/0_235_5922_3555/master/5922.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fbb1078baacb4503f1f819a79022d143

The UN wants to influence a pluralist Syria – but will the country listen?	Syrians are suspicious after allegations of complicity with the brutal Assad regime during 14 years of civil war The UN special envoy for Syria will urge the security council to back a transition to a pluralist democratic Syria, but faces resistance within the country. The interim government fears the lifting of sanctions will be tied to excessive demands imposed by the west, with suspicion of the UN deeply embedded after what are seen as its failures during 14 years of civil war. Ahmed al-Sharaa, the country’s de facto leader, has told Gulf and western states that his group, Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), long ago transformed itself from a Salafi jihadi group in Idlib province to a technocratic force willing to accommodate all Syrians.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/08/un-influence-pluralist-syria-assad	2025-01-07T21:00:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33d03b5f120d0cf651c51a8c4cb35f1826c67e0c/25_0_1666_1000/master/1666.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3fc60db547bcf53cf9efe8e4dd0a353e

Fast-moving wildfire billowed by ‘life threatening’ windstorm sweeps southern California – live updates	Large swath of the region is under what officials have described as ‘extreme risk’ from destructive storm By midafternoon, shoppers at a luxury outdoor mall in Century City, about 12 miles east of the Pacific Palisades, were still strolling around as usual. But outside the mall, billows of smoke were visible to the west, and the views in the distance were starting to look hazy. I’m currently driving east across Los Angeles, and am close to Beverly Hills at the moment.

The suit is the latest salvo in an ongoing eight-year battle in which advocates have pressured the FDA to ban the chemicals’ use in food packaging, but the agency has sided with industry that opposes the calls. Since 2016, the FDA has either illegally ignored petitions or rejected demands to revoke a 40-year-old authorization for the chemicals that is based on long-outdated science.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/07/fda-phthalates-plastic-lawsuit	2025-01-07T08:52:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54490647f3d0a86e55798bd00b0875101c6e6564/0_0_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a0a13a1a8828501554a5f0c41b48ee81

Trump moves to block report on election interference and classified documents cases – US politics live	President-elect’s lawyers ask attorney general to stop release of outgoing special counsel Jack Smith’s report Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump may be less than two weeks away from returning to the White House, but his lawyers are keeping busy with motions to frustrate the final developments in his lingering criminal cases. Yesterday, they asked New York judge Juan Merchan to delay the president-elect’s sentencing on the 34 felony business fraud charges he was convicted of last year, but their motion was denied and the hearing is expected to take place on Friday. The case, brought by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, was the only one of Trump’s four criminal indictments to go to trial before his election victory in November. His prosecution in Georgia for allegedly meddling in the state’s election result four years ago has stalled, likely permanently, while special counsel Jack Smith dropped the charges he brought against Trump for allegedly hiding classified documents, and plotting to overturn the 2020 election. However, justice department regulations mandate that Smith release a report at the end of his investigations, which could bring to light damaging evidence about Trump’s actions. Late yesterday, the president-elect’s attorneys asked outgoing attorney general Merrick Garland to prevent the report’s completion. We’ll let you know if Garland makes his response known today. Donald Trump Jr is scheduled to arrive in Greenland today, the massive island that his father has talked about the United States buying from Denmark. We’ll see how that visit goes. Jimmy Carter will lie in state at the US Capitol today, with Kamala Harris laying a wreath on his casket and eulogizing him at 4.30pm ET.

Congress certifies Trump’s election win amid high security measures | First Thing	Joe Biden urged Americans not to forget the Capitol attack. Plus, Trudeau to resign as Canadian prime minister Good morning. Congress certified Donald Trump’s presidential election victory yesterday in an event heavy with symbolism, four years to the day since he incited a violent mob in attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat. What were November’s final results? Trump won the electoral college by 312 to 226, and the popular vote by a margin of about 2.5m. What did Harris say yesterday? -I do believe very strongly that America’s democracy is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it,- she told reporters. -Otherwise, it is very fragile, and it will not be able to withstand moments of crisis. And today, America’s democracy stood.- The president, Joe Biden, wrote an op-ed urging Americans not to forget the Capitol attack. What do we know about the quake’s ferocity? The US Geological Survey said the earthquake was centred in the Tibet region at a depth of about 10km (6 miles). It measured the tremor at a magnitude of 7.1, while China recorded it as 6.8.

Child abuse inquiry chair attacks ‘politicisation’ of issue and says new investigation would delay reforms – UK politics live	Prof Alexis Jay says ‘many people, sometimes in a very uninformed way, have waded into the argument’ over whether a further inquiry was needed Good morning. Keir Starmer is basking in praise from liberal, progressive Britain today for the way he hit back at calls for a new inquiry into child sexual abuse scandals, and the way they are being driven by inflammatory and false claims by Elon Musk and other rightwingers on X. But Tory Britain has yet to be persuaded, and the rightwing papers are promoting the Conservative party’s (very dubious) claim that Starmer was smearing anyone opposed to child rape as far-right. This morning Prof Alexis Jay stepped into this argument. As the main chair of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA), the eight-year, all-encompassing inquiry into child sexual abuse in Britain, she has as much authority on this subject as anyone. Today she clearly came out against calls from Musk, Reform UK, the Tories and others for a new national inquiry focusing specifically on rape or grooming gangs. No, I don’t agree with that, in the sense of requiring further and more detailed national inquiries into child sexual exploitation. We have learned quite a lot from those reviews that have already been undertaken. I think that the time has passed for more inquiries. We’ve had enough of inquiries, consultations and discussions, and especially for those victims and survivors who’ve had the courage to come forward … They clearly want action, and we have set out what action is required, and people should just get on with it, locally and nationally. I would not attribute that to everyone, but I’ve certainly been very unhappy about the politicisation of child sexual exploitation and child sexual abuse in the way that many people, sometimes in a very uninformed way, have waded into the argument.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/07/child-abuse-grooming-gangs-elon-musk-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live-updates	2025-01-07T01:14:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/981d9fd4f58f51b0473b6ae2ce0d6ada5159dc1e/0_301_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=85d64bd110195bb1473385fe74ccc762

Tuesday briefing: How Britain has coped with an Arctic blast	In today’s newsletter: Widespread flooding, snow and power outages have left thousands of households and travellers facing the aftermath of a cold snap – with more disruption to come Good morning. British winters have grown markedly milder over the past century: analysis has shown that the average UK winter has gotten 1C warmer and 15% wetter in the last century. Last February was the warmest in recorded history. There have been fewer and fewer snow days and the Met Office found that ground frost periods are three weeks shorter compared to the 1970s. Canada | Justin Trudeau has said he will step down as Canada’s prime minister. His resignation throws open the doors to a fierce political battle to be the country’s next leader, with polls showing the Liberals losing badly to the official opposition Conservatives. Child sexual exploitation | Keir Starmer has condemned Elon Musk’s increasingly erratic attacks on the government, suggesting that his -lies and misinformation- on grooming gangs were amplifying the -poison- of the far right. Ministers meanwhile promised to implement a key demand of a 2022 child sex abuse inquiry so that professionals who do not report claims of abuse will be sanctioned. US politics | The US Congress certified Donald Trump’s presidential election victory on Monday, in an event heavy with symbolism four years to the day since he incited a violent mob to disrupt a similar ceremony. Kamala Harris presided over a joint Senate and House of Representatives session to validate the result. Foster care | The UK is facing a fostering crisis where retiring carers are not being replaced by younger people, while the number of children entering care homes is rising, a charity has warned. The decline in foster carers is due to the impact of the pandemic, the costof living crisis, biological children staying at home for longer, spare rooms being used as home offices and changing family situations, Barnardo’s children’s charity said. Tibet | A magnitude 6.8 earthquake has struck near one of Tibet’s holiest cities, the China Earthquake Networks Centre has said, killing 53 people, injuring 62 and damaging buildings around Shigatse, according to state media.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/07/tuesday-briefing-how-britain-has-coped-with-an-arctic-blast	2025-01-06T22:34:35-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99894d56e5d340c61cd130ff0b7d0d2f538e2dea/0_366_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d3bb5fa4c5ed304567b96230e54ab9b7

Congress to certify Trump’s election win four years after insurrection – US politics live	Senate and House to convene in joint session to certify results four years after Trump’s supporters stormed Capitol Good morning, US politics blog readers. It is January 6, the legally designated day when the Senate and House of Representatives convene in a joint session to certify the results of the presidential election – in this case, Donald Trump’s victory two months ago. Today’s meeting comes four years after the then-president’s supporters stormed the Capitol after he addressed them outside the White House, a historic attack that Trump’s successor, Joe Biden, tried and ultimately failed to have him prosecuted over. There’s no sign that a repeat of those events will take place this year. Washington DC is socked in by a snowstorm that’s snarled roads across parts of the east coast and midwest, the Capitol is under heavy guard, and, unlike the Republicans who in 2021 tried to used procedural moves to block Biden from taking office, no congressional Democrats have signaled plans to object to Trump’s re-election during the session. The session is set to begin at 1pm ET, with Kamala Harris presiding in her role as president of the Senate. Once Trump’s victory is certified, it will clear the way for his inauguration two weeks from today, on 20 January. Trump on Sunday said he will support efforts by Republicans in Congress to pass one massive piece of legislation that will enact many of his campaign promises, including better fortifying the country’s borders and removing taxes on tips. There had been some debate among the GOP over whether to split those priorities up into separate bills, but with that decided (for now), expect Republicans to spend the next several months getting that legislation through Congress. Biden wrote on opinion piece for the Washington Post, in which he encouraged Americans not to forget the insurrection that took place four years ago today.

Trump and Republicans plot radical policy agenda in one ‘big, beautiful bill’	House speaker says party seeks single piece of legislation covering tax cuts, immigration and military spending Donald Trump is working with top Republicans in Congress to devise a single -big, beautiful bill- that will contain all of his major policy ambitions – including a clampdown on immigration, tax cuts, and increased military spending in an attempt to supercharge his radical agenda as he embarks on a second presidency. The plan to pile all of Trump’s main policy goals into one mega-bill, against the wishes of some top congressional Republicans, raises the prospect of months of potentially bruising political in-fighting needed to secure its passage.

Convicted January 6 rioters anticipate Trump pardons four years after US Capitol attack | First Thing	‘We’re excited that we have our country back,’ one convicted man said. Plus, Adrien Brody wins Golden Globe for The Brutalist Good morning. Once back in power, Donald Trump has promised he will pardon people prosecuted over the assault on the Capitol four years ago today. Carried out by a mob of Trump’s supporters after he had addressed them outside the White House, the 6 January 2021 attack brought political violence into the halls of Congress and has been linked to nine deaths among police and rioters. How many have been charged? The justice department has charged more than 1,500 people, nearly 600 of whom have faced felony charges of assaulting or impeding law enforcement. How popular would the move be? For all the enthusiasm among Trump’s supporters, a December poll from Monmouth University found that 61% of respondents would disapprove of Trump pardoning people convicted of attacking the Capitol. What do we know about the attack? Jabber’s truck displayed an IS flag. A rifle he used in the shootout was bought privately from someone who did not know what he had planned. Officials said Jabbar – who wore body armor and a helmet – had fashioned a homemade device meant to suppress the noise of gunshots fired by the rifle. What do authorities believe about the motive? Indications suggest Jabbar fell into extremism after marital and financial woes.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/06/first-thing-convicted-january-6-rioters-anticipate-trump-pardon-us-capitol-attack	2025-01-06T02:46:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21466ef563ff78864d7783feecef3d3b336ce875/0_185_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ee0ba5980be86089357d585b859fe2ec

Firms that donated to Republican party avoided tariffs in Trump first term – study	President-elect has threatened to levy tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China, which can burden businesses With Donald Trump threatening to impose steep tariffs upon his return to office this month, US firms are bracing for impact. But an analysis of Trump’s last presidency identified one way to boost their chances of avoiding the levies: donating to the Republican party. While the initial stage of the president-elect’s tariff agenda is designed to hit America’s largest trading partners – Canada, Mexico and China – it is US firms that pick up the bill, paying duties imposed on the goods they buy from these markets.

Middle East crisis live: Israel and Hamas wrangle over potential ceasefire and hostage deal	Disagreements over deal continue as Palestinian officials say more than 100 people died over the weekend due to Israeli bombardments Israel and Hamas are wrangling over the details of a potential deal to halt Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip and return hostages home, as Palestinian officials said intensified Israeli bombardments had killed more than 100 people over the weekend. A Hamas official said the group had approved a list of 34 Israeli hostages to be returned as part of a deal that could eventually lead to a ceasefire, Reuters reported. But Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office swiftly issued a statement on Sunday saying Hamas had not provided such a list. Israeli military airstrikes continued throughout the Gaza Strip on Sunday, with an airstrike killing five people in a house in the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza and another killing four in Jabalia in the territory’s north, Gaza health officials said. Later in the day, an airstrike hit a police station in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, killing five people, medics said. It was not immediately clear if all the people who were killed were police officers. At nightfall, medics said an Israeli airstrike had killed three people in Bureij camp in central Gaza, bringing Sunday’s death toll to 17. Two Palestinians, including a 17-year-old boy, were killed by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank on Sunday, according to the Palestinian Fatah party and the Palestinian health ministry. Palestinian media said Israeli forces opened fire on the home of a 37-year-old man in a town south of Jenin. The health ministry said the 17-year-old was killed in an Israeli raid in Askar camp in Nablus. The Israeli military said its forces killed an armed militant in the West Bank, confiscated weapons and dismantled an explosives manufacturing laboratory. Separately, it said it was looking into reports that a 17-year-old was killed. Social order in Gaza is likely to collapse further if Israel goes ahead with its threat this month to end all cooperation with the UN refugee agency for Palestinians (Unrwa), Louise Wateridge, its senior emergency officer, has warned. Gunmen opened fire on vehicles, including a passenger bus, on Monday near a village in the occupied West Bank, killing three people and injuring at least seven others, the Israeli military and emergency services said. -Paramedics have confirmed the deaths of three victims, including two women and a man,- emergency service provider Magen David Adom said, while the military reported that troops were -pursuing the terrorists- who carried out the attack near the village of Al-Funduq. Antony Blinken will meet his European counterparts Thursday in Rome on Syria, as the west looks to engage the new Islamist-led leadership.

Republicans try to exploit New Orleans attack to push through Trump agenda	Trump loyalists make baseless link between attack and US border and say cabinet nominees must be urgently ratified Republicans in the US Senate are attempting to exploit the New Year’s Day attack that killed 14 victims in New Orleans, while injuring dozens more, to push through Donald Trump’s most controversial cabinet nominations and rocket-charge the incoming president’s anti-immigration agenda – despite the fact that the attacker was a US citizen born and raised in east Texas.

The cold weather health alert, issued by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), lasts until midday on Wednesday. It means it is expected temperatures inside places such as hospitals, care homes and clinics could drop below the recommended levels. The Met Office has warned that the freezing weather could cause delays to rail and air travel, power cuts and the cutting off of rural communities, with up to 30cm of snow forecast in some areas.

Manchester said its teams are working to clear them -as quickly as possible- but had been hampered by -heavy snow- around 7am. The National Grid said there were a number of power cuts and it was working to restore power across the Midlands, south-west England and South Wales on Saturday evening, including in Birmingham, Bristol and Cardiff. The Irish government’s emergency planning team is holding a meeting as Ireland braces for a -multi-hazard weather event-, which is due to hit the country later on Saturday. Snow, ice, heavy rain and sleet are to sweep over Ireland as a series of orange and yellow weather warnings come into effect. Met Éireann has warned that the cold snap will create difficult travelling conditions and poor visibility. Forecasters have said that depending on snow accumulations on Monday, schools could remain closed as the sub-zero temperatures stretch into next week. They have warned that it will probably lead to disruption to public transport, air, rail and bus services, difficult conditions underfoot and animal welfare issues.

Some football games have already been called off this weekend. They include Cheltenham’s clash with League Two leaders Walsall and Halifax’s National League home game against Fylde. It remains to be seen if Manchester United and Liverpool’s clash in the English Premier League, one of the most watched sporting events in the world, will be cancelled on Sunday. Horse racing at Sandown Park in Surrey was abandoned on Saturday, with the racecourse saying the weather meant there -would not be sufficient time for the ground to become raceable-.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2025/jan/05/uk-weather-warnings-remain-in-place-as-uk-hit-by-snow-and-freezing-rain-live-updates	2025-01-05T00:08:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b01d4f960eda3b57a14779fe2ca38089d08727e/0_653_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ed30fecb6fdea2358563c48888952e7a

Ukraine waits for Trump the dealmaker to broker end of Putin’s war | Shaun Walker in Kyiv	The US president-elect’s policy on the conflict may prove decisive, but appeasing both sides will be a challenge A new year in Ukraine began in much the same way as the old one finished: with deadly Russian drone attacks across the country. In Kyiv, one person was killed and at least six others were injured in the first few hours of 2025. It is Ukraine’s third new year since Russia’s invasion. If 2023 began with hopes high that Ukrainian battlefield gains would push Russia back and lead to an outright victory, by the start of 2024 the Ukrainian army and population were already settled in for the long haul and had few illusions about a quick victory.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/04/ukraine-dealmaker-trump-putin-war-russia-zelenskyy	2025-01-04T08:29:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55c732ceca99894ff00b099c7f3d6427a9aac999/0_26_4418_2651/master/4418.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=78a1b857311b088c22bdd6b74798b492

Barcelona to fine e-scooter users up to €500 for riding on pavements	Council to crack down on antisocial behaviour linked to rapid rise of e-scooter riders in city Anyone riding an electric scooter on the pavement or without a helmet in Barcelona faces a fine of up to €500 (£415) from 1 February as part of a crackdown on antisocial behaviour linked to the rapid rise of e-scooter use in the Mediterranean city. In an urban landscape that is mostly flat, with more than 250km (155 miles) of cycle lanes, 2,500 hours of sunshine and barely 55 rainy days a year, electric scooters are a perfect fit. According to the city council’s figures, the number of people using e-scooters since the pandemic has risen four times faster than those choosing to travel by bicycle.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/03/barcelona-fine-e-scooter-users-riding-pavements	2025-01-03T04:56:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e585172e2ceda685d6552d0c53e31f30a0691fc/0_165_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=81ef3cd48e23bbb71340bec2f0cb98e2

First Thing: Arrest of South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol fails amid security force standoff	Anti-corruption officials say they were blocked by 200 presidential personnel. Plus, FBI says New Orleans terror suspect acted alone Good morning. South Korea’s political crisis took a dramatic turn on Friday when investigators were forced to abandon an attempt to arrest the impeached president, Yoon Suk Yeol, after a tense standoff with his security forces. What are the details of Friday’s standoff? Local media reports said anti-corruption officials – who are leading a joint team of police and prosecutors – entered the compound to find themselves blocked by troops under the control of the presidential security service. What happened on 3 December? Yoon declared martial law in an attempt to root out what he described as -anti-state, pro-North Korean- forces – a reference to opposition MPs in the national assembly. He did not provide any evidence for those claims, however. He was forced to lift the order six hours later after lawmakers forced their way past troops into the parliament building to vote it down. What do we know about the New Orleans attack suspect? It’s understood Jabbar was born and raised in Texas, served in the US army 2007-2015, and in 2022 was $27,000 behind on house payments, he said in court documents. Jabbar’s brother told AP that in recent months he’d isolated himself. Why didn’t steel bollards stop the attack? Seven years ago, officials began installing barriers at intersections in the French Quarter of the city. But the steel bollards were in the process of being replaced over New Year’s Eve.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/03/first-thing-arrest-of-south-korean-president-yoon-suk-yeol-fails-amid-security-force-standoff	2025-01-03T02:32:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa19edbf0482114c05b6dac6818d0ae662ff4005/0_0_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=37343acafc9f657f0c3d835c4b097dc5

Streeting defends pace of plans for adult social care reform – UK politics live	Ministers to launch historic commission to reform ‘failing’ system amid warnings the NHS risks being overwhelmed Wes Streeting has set out overnight for the Guardian his view on the new Labour government’s proposal for adult social care reform. The health secretary wrote: By 2050, there will be 4 million more people aged 65+ in England than today. If we do nothing, real social care costs are expected to nearly double by 2038, compared with 2018 numbers. Many more people will be left without the care they need, the burdens will fall on the health service and our NHS will be overwhelmed. We can’t keep paying a heavier and heavier price for failure. Our NHS can’t afford to keep bearing a heavier burden. We can’t afford not to act. Labour took a lot of flak in the general election campaign for not spelling out in more detail our plans for a National Care Service. I was honest about the reason why – general election campaigns are where plans for social care go to die. If anyone is going to help us to break the cycle of bad politics, knock heads together, and forge the national consensus I think we need on social care, it is Louise Casey. And that work will begin in April. It will report initially next year. And within three years I hope we will have built the consensus we need to build a national care service fit to meet the challenges for older and disabled people in the 21st century.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/03/wes-streeting-adult-social-care-reform-elon-musk-uk-politics-live-updates	2025-01-03T01:12:38-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1de800d53bf6061d31c375d7b1b4a6347a48125/0_304_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=70f8f898159a73578eb8d97244c6d434

Why supporters of South Korea’s impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol are flying US flags	The prominence of the US flag at conservative rallies reflects a complex intersection of religion, politics and identity that defines South Korea’s far-right movement As investigators attempted to arrest president Yoon Suk Yeol on Friday morning, his supporters gathered outside the presidential residence waving two national flags: the South Korean Taegukgi alongside the American Stars and Stripes. To outsiders, the unexpected combination may seem baffling. But to Yoon’s supporters, America represents more than an ally: it’s a perceived ideal. The symbolism of the US flag is a declaration of a broader cultural and spiritual order they believe is under threat.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/03/why-yoon-suk-yeol-supporters-us-flags-south-korea-ntwnfb	2025-01-02T20:40:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce546d01b34aa9fa6ce9034fe5c53d6d2316c5c0/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c05cf41e7304cecbece60acc911dd0a2

The question New Orleans investigators hope to answer: will there be another attack?	The FBI says the attacker acted alone, but links to Islamic State mean further violence can’t be ruled out As investigators examine the terrorist attack in New Orleans on Wednesday, they will be hoping to answer three questions: who was responsible? How was the attack executed? And why? All will be vital to answering the most pressing question of all: will there be another attack in the immediate hours or days to come? Their first priority will have been to identify the attacker. The FBI has said it believes Shamsud-Din Jabbar, the 42-year-old who drove a pickup truck into a crowd celebrating the new year, acted alone. He hired a vehicle, procured an assault rifle, as well as body armour and ammunition.

Automatic voter registration may be an answer to UK’s troubling turnout gap	Experts say evidence from abroad shows AVR is effective – and it’s one of several proposals to try to boost voting A healthy democracy depends on people participating in it. In the UK, the proportion of people doing so is falling. Voter turnout in general elections stayed above 70% from 1945 through to 1997, hitting more than 80% in 1950 and 1951. But it collapsed to 59.4% when Tony Blair won his second term in 2001, and though it rose again between 2010 and 2019, it has not reached the 70% mark since 1997. In the 2024 election, turnout fell to 59.7%. The decline has been acute enough to trigger concern among Labour officials. Before July, the Guardian revealed they were drawing up plans to introduce automatic voter registration (AVR). In the election, when it came around, just 52% of adults living in the UK exercised their right to vote – the lowest proportion since universal suffrage was introduced. Crucially, this statistic counts all adults eligible to vote in the UK, not just those registered on the electoral roll.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/01/automatic-voter-registration-uk-turnout-gap-elections	2025-01-01T09:26:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53be2671a1f2793c6ebd77c914bd06516bd643fe/0_0_4122_2474/master/4122.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=00501a5a13da57650ec21cb5180ac23a

Jimmy Carter’s crowning achievements came after having the most powerful job in the world	The Georgian was a campaigner for human rights, democracy and public health – and a devoted husband It was the spring of 2014 and I was at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Washington to interview Jimmy Carter.

Cause of South Korea plane crash unclear as officials focus on bird strikes	Experts say bird strikes are relatively common and should not have been enough to cause landing gear failure No one knows for certain what caused Jeju Air flight 7C2216 to crash, killing all but two of its 181 passengers and crew. As darkness fell at Muan international airport in South Korea and officials fielded questions from distraught relatives of the dead, the most likely explanation was that the plane had been struck by one or more birds, triggering a sequence of events that prevented the pilot from deploying the landing gear. Aviation officials focused on bird strikes – and, to a lesser extent, the weather – as the most probable cause, even as some experts said the relatively common phenomenon would not have been enough to cause a catastrophic failure of the landing gear.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/29/cause-of-south-korea-plane-crash-unclear-bird-strikes-landing-gear	2024-12-29T08:37:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/995c199518186f55d2d7edfcfc7d2c207dc08f43/0_202_5336_3203/master/5336.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fb472537199ef5f4e3ca9da26bbdc933

South Korea plane crash: all except two are presumed dead on Jeju Air flight carrying 181 people, say authorities – live updates	South Korea facing worst domestic civil aviation disaster after Boeing 737-800 with 175 passengers and six crew skidded off runway and hit wall at Muan airport Dozens are feared dead after a plane skidded off the runway while attempting a landing without landing gear at Muan international airport in South Korea on Sunday morning The exact casualty figures have not yet been tallied, though authorities are provisionally reporting that 28 people are believed to have died, according to news agency Newsis. Fire officials have warned that given the severe damage to the aircraft, the number of casualties could rise. Jeju Air flight 2216 from Bangkok to Muan was carrying 181 people – 175 passengers and six crew – when it came down, skidded along the runway and hit fencing and a wall around the perimeter before catching fire.

The Boeing 737-800 may have suffered a bird strike that caused the landing gear to fail, according news agency Yonhap. The flight had reportedly attempted one landing before being forced to -go-around- when the landing gear failed to lower normally. South Korea’s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, has ordered -all available equipment and personnel to be mobilised- for the rescue operations at Muan international airport in the country’s south-west and is heading to the crash site, about 300km from the capital, Seoul.

Among the many odd things to come out of Donald Trump’s political movement – see ear bandages, doomed boat rallies and rubbish dancing – one that could be here to stay is more prosaic: the creation of a series of rightwing marketplaces and products seeking to capitalize on anti-establishment fervor. In recent years a number of platforms have sprung up to sell conservative-made items, from -anti-woke- dog food to pro-America lipstick, in a pushback against what they claim is -cancel culture- in the US – and what others might see as a fairly cynical attempt to cash in on rightwing Americans’ political beliefs.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/28/anti-woke-shopping-public-square	2024-12-28T04:00:38-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/813227a42e73850ffaae14cc699c1bdfa38a24cd/0_12_3257_1955/master/3257.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8420f666a1ee8ae97897183465488cc6

Russia-Ukraine war live: Moscow says Kyiv plot to kill high-ranking officer with music speaker bomb foiled	Claim from FSB comes two weeks after Ukrainian assassination of senior Russian general Igor Kirillov On 8 March 2023, International Women’s Day, Russian soldiers were handing out tulips and boughs of mimosa to women and girls in the city of Melitopol, southern Ukraine – a move designed to promote friendly relations between the occupiers and the inhabitants. But the night before, someone had been discreetly sticking posters to walls and lamp-posts. They bore the image of a young Ukrainian woman, dressed in a traditional embroidered shirt, smashing a bouquet over a Russian soldier’s head. -I don’t want flowers,- read the slogan. -I want my Ukraine.- Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service accused American and British spies of trying to provoke attacks against Russian military bases in Syria in a bid to force the evacuation of the bases, the state-run RIA news agency said on Saturday. The SVR gave no evidence for its allegation. North Korean troops deployed in Russia’s Kursk region are suffering heavy losses and being left unprotected by the Russian forces they are fighting alongside, according to Ukraine, while the US says Russian and North Korean generals see the soldiers as -expendable-. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Friday that said Russian troops were sending the North Koreans into battle with minimal protection and that the North Koreans were taking extreme measures to avoid being taken prisoner. -Their losses are significant, very significant,- the Ukrainian president said in his nightly video address. The Biden administration pledged to approve fresh military aid to Ukraine, including crucial air defence systems. John Kirby, the US national security communications adviser, said the promised US security assistance package was expected to be announced -in the next couple of days-, though it was unclear how much it will include.

Why speech could be a target for the anti-abortion movement in 2025	The anti-abortion movement is looking at ways to control information about how and where to obtain abortions The next front in the US abortion wars may be what people are allowed to say about it. More than two years after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in the case Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, US abortions are on the rise, thanks in large part to the spread of abortion pills and travel across state lines. This has infuriated anti-abortion advocates, who have proposed policies to help the incoming Trump administration curtail the mailing of abortion pills and targeted individuals and groups that help women get out-of-state abortions. In a sign of how the issue is pitting states against one another, Texas earlier this monthsued a New York-based doctor who allegedly provided a telehealth abortion to a Texan woman.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/27/speech-anti-abortion-movement	2024-12-27T05:00:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3faa1b222876c0d70ea72aacd0080fcdda7a70da/0_230_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=102a7eeda3b3c7791c3d521762a1450d

Middle East crisis live: 14 security personnel killed in Syria after clash over former prison officer	Security personnel and three armed men killed in Tartous province after forces sought to arrest officer linked to Sednaya prison, says Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza and developments in the Middle East more widely. Fourteen security personnel from Syria’s new authorities and three armed men were killed in clashes in Tartous province when forces attempted to arrest an officer linked to the notorious Sednaya prison, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Five journalists were killed when their vehicle was struck in the vicinity of Al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat in central Gaza, health authorities said. Palestinian media and local reporters said the vehicle was marked as a media van and was used by journalists to report from inside the hospital and Nuseirat camp. The journalists worked for the Al-Quds Al-Youm television channel. The Israeli army said its air force attacked the vehicle in a -targeted manner- and that members of the Islamic Jihad militant group were inside. In a separate incident, five people were killed and 20 wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a house in Gaza City’s Zeitoun neighbourhood early on Thursday, medics with the Gaza health authorities reported. They warned the death toll could rise as many people remained trapped under the rubble. A baby girl has frozen to death in Gaza, the third to die from the cold, in Gaza’s tent camps in recent days, doctors said. The father of three-week-old Sila, Mahmoud al-Faseeh, wrapped her in a blanket to try to keep her warm in their tent in the Muwasi area outside the town of Khan Younis, but it was not enough, he told the Associated Press. On Wednesday, Hamas and Israel traded blame over their failure to conclude a ceasefire agreement despite progress reported by both sides in past days. Israel’s air and ground offensive has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry. It says more than half the fatalities have been women and children, but does not say how many of the dead were fighters.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/26/middle-east-crisis-live-security-personnel-killed-syria-sednaya-prison-gaza-israel-latest-updates	2024-12-26T01:01:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72f05a5ccbd2dadff383da682b82c435e555053e/0_189_4300_2580/master/4300.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=69afe26c36e9247d0b915814451b6dd5
Russia-Ukraine war live: Ukrainian military says it shot down 20 of 31 drones launched by Russia overnight	11 ‘imitator drones’ did not reach their targets after active engagement from the Ukrainian military, it said Hello – Welcome to the Guardian’s blog covering the Russia-Ukraine war. Joe Biden has asked the US defence department to continue its surge of weapons deliveries to Ukraine, describing Russia’s Christmas Day attack against some of Ukraine’s cities and its energy infrastructure as -outrageous-. Christmas morning in Ukraine was overshadowed by a massive Russian aerial attack using cruise missiles to target energy infrastructure across the country, which Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned as -inhuman-. The attack left half a million people in Kharkiv region without heating, in temperatures just a few degrees Celsius above zero, while there were blackouts in the capital, Kyiv, and elsewhere. Ukraine’s air defences downed 59 of 78 Russian missiles and 54 of 102 drones launched overnight and on Wednesday morning, the Ukrainian military said. British prime minister Keir Starmer has also condemned the Russian attack launched on Ukraine’s energy grid, which killed one person. Nato member Romania said it had not detected any Russian missile passing through its airspace to target Ukraine, as claimed by Kyiv. Russia’s Federal Security Service claimed on Thursday that it had foiled several plots by Ukrainian intelligence services to kill high-ranking Russian military officers and their families in Moscow. It claimed four Russian citizens allegedly involved in the plots had been detained. Ukraine’s SBU intelligence service has claimed responsibility for the killing of Igor Kirillov, chief of Russia’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection troops, who died after a bomb attached to an electric scooter exploded outsided his apartment building on 17 December. A Russian cargo ship that sank on Tuesday in the Mediterranean Sea was the target of an -act of terrorism-, according to the vessel’s owner. The Ursa Major sank while it was sailing through international waters between Spain and Algeria, leaving two crew members missing. The Ukrainian navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk said Russia faced -systemic problems- in maintaining its fleet but gave no indication that Kyiv was involved in the incident. Falling debris from a Ukrainian drone that was shot down caused an explosion and a fatal fire in a shopping centre in the city of Vladikavkaz in Russia’s North Ossetia region, the local governor said on Wednesday. One woman was reported to have been killed inside the shopping centre. Russia’s foreign ministry said Australia had been in contact about the possible capture by the Russian army of an Australian citizen fighting with Ukrainian forces. Oscar Jenkins was reportedly captured by Russian soldiers while fighting alongside Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region. Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a call with the Japanese prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, where he thanked Japan’s government for a decision to transfer an additional $3bn secured from frozen Russian assets. The Ukrainian leader also thanked Japan for the total $12bn in humanitarian and financial aid provided to Ukraine, according to a readout of the Wednesday call.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-ukrainian-military-russian-drones-latest-updates	2024-12-26T00:24:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7490487111a41480d6398b47626dbc5b4dc34b1/0_260_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=13edd08dff8fb15194da323a8fd58461

Calls for Labour to honour pledge to toughen anti-hunt laws	Government urged to ban trail hunting as data suggests illegal foxhunting is still widespread in England and Wales Animal welfare campaigners are calling on ministers to keep to a pledge to toughen anti-hunt laws, as figures suggest illegal foxhunting remains widespread in England and Wales. Almost 20 years since the Hunting Act 2004 was brought in by Tony Blair’s government, the League Against Cruel Sports (Lacs) – the animal welfare charity that was the driving force behind the original ban – says its data evidences how stronger legislation is required to close loopholes and prohibit trail hunting, which campaigners say has been used as a smokescreen for illegal foxhunting. Trail hunting is where dogs follow an animal-based scent.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/26/calls-for-labour-to-honour-pledge-to-toughen-anti-hunt-laws-england-wales-foxhunting	2024-12-25T21:00:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d79ad735bc7ffcfc2d5c744ea633045490ddf1b/0_183_3795_2277/master/3795.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2ccbcf3f7724c19b6a6f2d9cc5ea28b2
