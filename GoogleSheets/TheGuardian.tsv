How the world’s richest man laid waste to the US government	Elon Musk has achieved astonishing power in Trump’s administration – and spent the weekend wielding it Since declaring his support for Donald Trump in July of last year and subsequently spending more than $250m on his re-election effort, Elon Musk has rapidly accumulated political influence and positioned himself at the heart of the new administration. Now as prominent as the president himself, he has begun to make use of that power, taking actions that could affect the health of millions of people, gaining access to highly sensitive personal data and attacking anyone who opposes him. Musk, the world’s richest man and an unelected official, has achieved an astonishing level of power over the federal government. Over the weekend, workers with Musk’s -department of government efficiency- (Doge) clashed with civil servants over demands for unfettered access to the computer systems of major US government agencies in a breakneck series of confrontations. When the dust settled, several top officials who opposed the takeover had been pushed out, and Musk’s allies had gained control.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-elon-musk-federal-government	2025-02-04T11:52:24-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/153a0c447760596072c83ad7ac0d282977bda122/0_136_4109_2467/master/4109.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=042e0ef1f9f5255f0aca6a429bbc820d

Deaths predicted amid the chaos of Elon Musk’s shutdown of USAid	The impact of the billionaire’s declaration has been swift and brutal, with food and crucial drugs abandoned in warehouses, vital programmes closed and workers laid off Critical supplies of life-saving medicines have been blocked and children left without food and battling malnutrition as multiple effects were reported across the globe after Elon Musk resolved to shut down the US government’s pre-eminent international aid agency. Chaotic scenes were seen in scores of countries as aid organisations warned of the risk of escalating disease and famine along with disastrous repercussions in areas such as family planning and girls’ education, after President Donald Trump’s decision to freeze funding to USAid. In 2023, the agency managed more than $40bn (£32bn).	https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/feb/04/deaths-predicted-amid-the-chaos-of-elon-musks-shutdown-of-usaid	2025-02-04T08:28:45-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/489fc48c0be66e74e58b1f78c4780987e225cdca/0_47_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f4c20157f7318ee32d09e71fe332f2c8

In this Trump era of shakedown diplomacy, everything has a price	Friends and allies of the US president will say his recent tariff threats delivered quick wins, but he may find there are no winners in a trade war As the world reels from the first three weeks of Donald Trump’s shakedown diplomacy, it is divided between those who marvel at this display of raw American economic hegemony, and those who fear that the US’s president, fatally misreading how the globe has changed since his first term, is storing up trouble that will diminish the US as an economic and moral force in four years’ time. At one level Trump’s antics are wearily familiar. After all, the last rites of the 70-year-old liberal world order were also read when Trump came to power in 2017, before that order was briefly disinterred under Joe Biden. The diplomatic pearls were collectively clutched when Trump 1.0 threatened to pull out of Nato, launched a trade war with China, introduced a travel ban on mainly Muslim countries, and withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation trade agreement championed by Barack Obama. In 2019 Trump dropped the threat of a 5% tariff in return for Mexico sending 6,000 militarised police to the southern border. Grievances, and bargains, have always animated Trump’s thinking.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/in-this-trump-era-of-shakedown-diplomacy-everything-has-a-price	2025-02-04T08:22:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a726668bb3d94b624fc479e88c91803807ce29b/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42f35e6ec17d14d7c76dce942479aa18

Netanyahu hoping to ‘redraw map’ of Middle East in Washington DC ceasefire talks with Trump – Israel-Gaza war live	Israeli PM in Washington for talks with US president as Hamas says it is ready to discuss details of second phase of ceasefire and hostage releases Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the latest news from the Middle East. Today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in Washington for talks with US President Donald Trump about the ceasefire in Gaza. Trump said on Monday he did not known whether the ceasefire deal in Gaza was going to last. -I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,- he told reporters. Hamas is ready to begin talks on the details of a second phase of the ceasefire, two officials from the group told the AFP on Monday. -We are waiting for the mediators to initiate the next round of negotiation,- said one. Israel continued its operations in the West Bank city of Jenin for a 14th consecutive day, with dozens of homes demolished and at least 25 people killed, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa The Palestinian ministry of health said the Israeli military had killed at least 70 people, including 10 children in the West Bank, since the beginning of 2025. More than 545,000 Palestinians are estimated to have crossed from southern Gaza to northern Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect, according to figures by the UN. The Trump administration has asked congressional leaders to approve transfers of roughly $1bn worth of bombs and other military hardware to Israel, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing US officials. The sales would include 4,700 1,000-pound bombs as well as armoured bulldozers built by Caterpillar. The head of Amnesty International, Agnes Callamard, said the ceasefire should not erase the events of the last 15 months and that Israel should held accountable for -genocide-. -If you have any sense of the future, you need a reckoning for the past,- she told Al Jazeera. The office of Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said the ongoing Israeli military operation in the occupied West Bank amounts to -ethnic cleansing- and urged the US to intervene. A spokesperson said the presidency -condemned the occupation authorities’ expansion of their comprehensive war on our Palestinian people in the West Bank to implement their plans aimed at displacing citizens and ethnic cleansing-. A car bomb killed at least 15 people in the northern Syrian city of Manbij. The attack was the second in three days and the deadliest since Bashar al-Assad was deposed in December. The office of the president vowed that those responsible would be help accountable.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/04/benjamin-netanyahu-donald-trump-israel-gaza-middle-east-ceasefire-latest-live-news	2025-02-04T02:54:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a18271bda488f2f0ee5861668d403ec200bb0fb1/0_72_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f7868134d28da8a88c0c4bbd518ef1ab

Reform UK overtakes Labour for first time in national opinion poll – UK politics live	Trend shows support for Nigel Farage’s Reform UK has grown significantly since general election Good morning. A good rule of thumb in political reporting is that any news story about voter intention polling is wrong. That is because news stories, by definition, are what’s what new and what’s different, and polls that show anything unusual (or at least anything significantly unusual) are probably outliers. In polling, what matters is the trend (because polls are a reliable guide to voting trends) but not so much the actual numbers (where polling is much more hit and miss). So it it is with some reservation that we start with YouGov polling, for the Times and Sky News, showing Reform UK in first place, and ahead of Labour for the first time in a national opinion poll. It has Reform UK on 25%, Labour on 24% and the Conservatives on 21%.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/04/latest-live-uk-politics-news-labour-reform-tory-conservatives-keir-starmer	2025-02-04T01:30:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ce7dbc5a63bc37033987f48a5f49ba3247aea66/0_164_4929_2957/master/4929.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1da340d05b6e227e3e21a5c1ff06947a

Trump to pause Canada tariffs for at least 30 days as China levies set to take effect Tuesday – live	Canadian PM Justin Trudeau says he had ‘good call’ with US president, as Mexico tariffs paused too Donald Trump’s administration has confirmed plans to merge the US international aid agency USAid into the state department in a major revamp that would shrink its workforce and align its spending with Trump’s priorities. The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, declared himself the acting administrator of the agency and employees have been locked out of its Washington DC headquarters, while others have been suspended. Trump announced he’s planning to appoint Michael Ellis and the deputy director of the CIA. Ellis is a close Trump ally and worked in the president’s previous administration and helped fight allegations of collusion with Russia in the 2016 election. The Trump administration is opening new investigations into allegations of antisemitism at five US universities including Columbia and the University of California, Berkeley, the Education Department announced Monday. The US Senate on Monday confirmed Chris Wright, a fracking executive, to be Donald Trump’s energy secretary. The vote was 59-38. Wright, 60, the CEO of Liberty Energy since 2011 has said he will step down from the company once confirmed. He wrote in a Liberty report last year that he believes human-caused climate change is real, but that its hazards are -distant and uncertain-. He has also said that top-down governmental policies to curb it are destined to fail. The US interior department has unveiled a suite of orders aimed at carrying out Donald Trump’s agenda to maximise domestic energy and minerals production and slash red tape, Reuters reports. In a statement, the agency said interior secretary Doug Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota, signed six orders on his first day in office. US President Donald Trump has invited Indian prime minister Narendra Modi to visit the White House next week, a White House official said, hours after a US military plane departed to return deported migrants to the country. Senator Susan Collins, a republican from Maine, said she’ll vote to confirm Tulsi Gabbard as the director of national intelligence. Collins is a key swing vote and her support brings Gabbard’s nomination close to being sealed. Trump is reportedly mulling an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education, in alignment with mandates from Elon Musk’s -department of government efficiency- to slash federal agencies. Musk’s Doge reportedly accessed administration systems for the federal Small Business Administration. It has also reportedly accessed secure information at USAid and the Treasury department. According to Wired, Musk has reportedly deployed six young men to lead Doge’s efforts to access federal government data. The Trump administration made plain its intent to merge USAid with the state department under Musk’s supervision. Employees were barred from the agency headquarters today, after the website was shuttered over the weekend. Several democrats cried foul, calling the act illegal and denouncing Musk. The Trump administration may today begin using an obscure 18th-century law to deport undocumented migrants without first going through the courts. Darren Beattie, a former White House official who wrote, -Competent white men must be in charge if you want things to work,- is reportedly set for a top role at the state department.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/feb/04/donald-trump-tariffs-live-blog-news-updates-canada-trudeau-mexico-china	2025-02-03T18:50:35-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c6c32f7de6d46668cfb725059f5a2f0e8ff0662/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=57c8c39923efef51a60d05e4860c4c9e

How Trump is targeting wind and solar energy – and delighting big oil	Critics say Trump is using every presidential power possible against clean power in sharp turn after Biden investments created jobs For several years, Republicans accused Joe Biden of waging a -war on energy- even as the Untied States drilled more oil and gas than at any time in its history. Now, a more tangible assault is gathering pace under Donald Trump – aimed squarely at wind, solar and other cleaner forms of power. In the first two weeks of his return as president, Trump has, like his first term, issued orders to open up more American land and waters for fossil fuel extraction and started the process to yank the US from the Paris climate agreement. -We will drill, baby drill,- said Trump, who has promised to cut energy and electricity prices in half within 18 months.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/03/trump-war-on-clean-energy-big-oil	2025-02-03T03:00:39-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4692017038050d670d846cb0365ac4ff2bcfa5b3/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=60028ce25095472afb904a7d603f0aa4

Simon & Schuster imprint will no longer ask authors to obtain blurbs for their books	Publisher says expecting authors, agents and editors to secure blurbs can create ‘an incestuous and unmeritocratic literary ecosystem that often rewards connections over talent’ When you buy a new book, you can usually expect to see praise from other authors emblazoned on its cover. A writer slightly more famous than the author of the book you’re buying might have called it -whip-smart-, -illuminating- or -a tour de force-, for example – presumably so that fans of the more famous writer will take a punt on the less famous one. But soon we may not see so many of these author blurbs – Sean Manning, publisher of Simon &amp; Schuster’s flagship imprint in the US, has written an essay for Publishers Weekly explaining that as of this year he will -no longer require authors to obtain blurbs for their books-.	https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/31/simon-schuster-us-imprint-authors-blurbs-books	2025-01-31T09:27:59-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d43f8ba0fcd502759c6eaae34477607818759d9/0_128_3854_2314/master/3854.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=10de228e4820ceb3fb90fd9869ae7511

Trump baselessly blames ‘diversity’ and Democrats for deadly DC plane crash | First Thing	Sixty-seven people die in deadliest US air tragedy since 2001. Plus, Israeli-Hamas deal leads to release of eight hostages and 110 prisoners Good morning. Donald Trump used the plane crash in Washington DC to attack his political enemies, claiming Democrats were responsible for declining standards in air traffic control and that the disaster -could have been- caused by diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies at the Federal Aviation Administration. What details have emerged about the passengers? As many as 14 figure skaters and coaches were onboard the plane, as well as other Americans and citizens of several other countries. How did Democrats respond to Trump’s rant? Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic House minority leader, said Trump used the collision to -peddle lies, conspiracy theories, and attack people of color and women without any basis whatsoever-. He continued: -Have you no respect for the families whose lives have been turned upside down?- What is the death toll of the war? At least 47,460 people have been killed in the Israeli offensive, according to Gaza health officials, but a study published in the Lancet says the true number is about 41% higher. How many hostages have been released? Fifteen since the ceasefire began on 19 January.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/31/first-thing-trump-baselessly-blames-diversity-and-democrats-for-deadly-dc-plane-crash	2025-01-31T03:55:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f99f1403eddda91ece62fd87cde432fa67e1810/0_336_5043_3026/master/5043.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3bdafec776f0445ac02c020c021c4216

Tory bid to celebrate Brexit anniversary marred by spat between Badenoch and Patel over party’s migration record – UK politics live	Kemi Badenoch issues rebuke to Priti Patel after former home secretary defends rise in migration since Brexit Good morning. It is five years to the day since the UK left the European Union. Despite complaints from some of the pro-Brexit papers, Keir Starmer and the government are not planning anything today to mark the occasion – which is not surprising because polling suggests only 11% of the population believe that it has been a success, and most people know think that, when voters followed the advice of Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Nigel Farage, they made a mistake. Still, in some parts of British politics Brexit has long ceased being a policy option, and become more of a cult, and some supporters of Brexit have been marking the anniversary with statements defending the policy. But, in the Conservative party, that has all gone a bit haywire. Five years ago today, the Conservatives honoured the democratic will of the British people and Got Brexit Done. Since then, our country has reaped the benefits—securing new trade deals with dynamic, fast-growing markets across the world and reclaiming sovereignty from Brussels. This has allowed us to reform or revoke 2,500 EU laws, ensuring Britain’s future is shaped by our own parliament.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/31/brexit-politics-tory-kemi-badenoch-priti-patel-keir-starmer-live-latest-news	2025-01-31T01:29:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f249e0eab725ff7f432527f7c52516c5a820164/33_459_2315_1389/master/2315.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e01c6fb84ff41eec33067680e6ee257f

Washington DC plane crash live: flight data and cockpit voice recorders recovered, officials say	National Transportation Safety Board announces recorders are now at a lab for evaluation; operation to recover bodies continues Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Wednesday’s night’s collision between a regional passenger jet and a military helicopter near Washington DC’s Reagan airport. The flight data and cockpit voice recorders have been recovered from the American Airlines flight, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has announced, and they are now at the NTSB’s labs for evaluation. With the 67 people aboard both the American Airlines flight and the army Black Hawk helicopter all presumed dead, the collision is being called -the deadliest aviation disaster- in the US since 2001. At least 28 bodies have been recovered from the Potomac River, with recovery operations ongoing. A day before Wednesday night’s midair collision near Reagan airport, a different jet there had to abort its landing and make a second approach after a helicopter appeared near its flight path, the Washington Post reported. The US army saw an increase in very serious aviation incidents during the last fiscal year, with 15 flight and two ground incidents that resulted in deaths of service members, destruction of aircraft, or more than $2.5m in damage to the airframe, the Associated Press reported, Donald Trump and members of his administration claimed, without evidence, that diversity efforts at the FAA under the Biden and Obama administration could be to blame for the crash, with Trump specifically claiming that the FAA had been accused of being -too white,- and suggesting efforts to hire Americans with disabilities were irresponsible. Trump signed an executive order that rolls back diversity initiatives to stop -woke policies- in federal aviation. The Trump administration’s choice to draw an unfounded connection between a deadly tragedy and diversity initiatives at a press conference sparked broad condemnation from Democratic politicians. They called the comments -disgusting,- -despicable,- and -racist,- with Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries saying that Trump was -blaming women and people of color for the deadly plane crash.- As many as 14 skaters and coaches, including two 16-year-olds and a married pair of world champions, were onboard the American Airlines plane. The Skating Club of Boston said Jinna Han and Spencer Lane, both aged 16, and the Russian-born ice skating coaches and former world champions Yevgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, who were husband and wife, were on the flight.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/31/washington-dc-plane-crash-live-flight-data-and-cockpit-voice-recorders-recovered-officials-say	2025-01-30T18:28:45-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3748ed9af0e94997caf2a79eb9847e0b925d0e68/0_43_4992_2995/master/4992.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2413bcf7502e0ebdedd284b648309532

The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Mirjana Spoljaric, told the UN general assembly that -respect for international humanitarian law is in crisis- and -threatening the very humanity that these laws seek to preserve-, citing the situations Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank.

Trump moves to gut government by offering to buy out 3m federal workers | First Thing	Memo says aim is to retain only those employees who are ‘reliable, loyal, trustworthy’. Plus, 85% of Greenlanders reject US advances Good morning. The Trump administration has offered buyouts to almost all of the roughly 3 million people who work for the US government if they leave their jobs by 6 February in exchange for seven months’ salary, as the White House attempts to gut the civil service. What are the details? The email had the same subject line – -Fork in the road- – as one sent by Elon Musk to employees at Twitter in 2022 when he bought the social media platform. It asked interested workers to reply with the word -Resign-. How did the employees’ union react? The American Federation of Government Employees denounced the offer. It said it was an effort to pressure workers who are not considered loyal to the new administration to leave their jobs – which could cause upheaval in federal programs. What do we know about the death toll so far? Local officials counting casualties into hospital tents said at least 38 were feared dead while other officials and doctors have given death tolls ranging from 15 to 50.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/first-thing-trump-moves-to-gut-government-by-offering-to-buy-out-3m-federal-workers	2025-01-29T04:21:59-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d257fbebf1ad95256ab043fdfe15c3aeea51df0/0_2_4001_2400/master/4001.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=425e446bdc554dc41dc5d5344619ea40

Wednesday briefing: The problems, perils and precedent of ‘cleaning out’ Gaza	In today’s newsletter: After Donald Trump’s remarks, renewed alarm about what will follow the first phase of the ceasefire Good morning. Donald Trump presented his proposal as one rooted in a concern for the safety of Palestinians: it was time to find many of the residents of Gaza somewhere else to live. -I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing at a different location where they can maybe live in peace for a change,- he said. -You’re talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing and say: ‘You know, it’s over.’- That was more than stream of consciousness: Trump doubled down on his comments on Monday. But the idea of -cleaning out- Gaza is not welcomed by the Palestinians who live there – or the countries that Trump has in mind as their new home. And if they were to be forced to leave after Gaza was devastated by the Israeli military, it would appear to be a clear case of ethnic cleansing. Kumbh Mela festival | Dozens of people are feared to have died in crowd crushes at India’s Kumbh Mela festival, local officials have said, as vast crowds went to bathe at one of the holiest sites of the Hindu gathering.

Technology | US tech stocks tentatively recovered on Tuesday after the emergence of the Chinese DeepSeek app wiped $1tn (£800bn) in value from the leading US tech index.

Trump’s press chief shows she’s more than capable of going full North Korea	Karoline Leavitt’s debut press briefing was standing room only – and she was slick, pugnacious, and loyal to her boss -Clear a path!- shouted the big shots of TV news as they tried to squeeze their way through reporters packed like sardines into the White House briefing room to get to their front row seats. Tempers frayed, foreheads perspired and necks strained similar to passengers itching to get off a plane. The first press briefing of a new administration is always a standing-room-only event. This time it was the second Donald Trump administration and the debut of Karoline Leavitt, who pointed out that she is the youngest person to serve as White House press secretary.

Louvre’s decision to move Mona Lisa is a misguided act of snobbery	Crowds give life to the Paris museum and the painting is a silent, compelling mystery at the heart of the hubbub What a wonderful headache for a museum to have. The Louvre in Paris gets so many visitors it is taking drastic measures to cope, which include moving its most famous treasure to a dedicated space where fans can visit without entering the main museum at all. It will no longer suck the oxygen from other art. Nearly 9 million visitors a year stream through the Louvre and it’s believed 80% of them are looking for Leonardo da Vinci’s portrait of Lisa Gherardini del Giocondo, better known as La Gioconde, better still as the Mona Lisa. I’m worried the Louvre is trying to solve a problem that is not really a problem. Ask Britain’s museums if high visitor numbers are a bad thing: they still haven’t recovered their pre-pandemic crowds. The decision, dramatically announced by Emmanuel Macron, to move the Mona Lisa to a special hygienically isolated gallery where les idiots who flock to take selfies in front of it won’t bother more cultured visitors who wish to study art in a hushed atmosphere, is a misguided act of snobbery. It may ruin the Louvre’s ecosystem as a place where high art becomes popular culture.	https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jan/28/louvres-decision-to-move-mona-lisa-is-a-misguided-act-of-snobbery	2025-01-28T11:57:34-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce1fdb682db5613f2299e7e4efa91b547ee881f7/0_118_5447_3268/master/5447.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a807182f6370aeb60ad606bd4207cc88

New documents shed light on police killing of Georgia ‘Cop City’ activist	Records obtained by Guardian give details about events leading to death of Manuel Paez Terán, shot dead in 2023 Previously unavailable records obtained by the Guardian shed light on the killing of environmental and social activist Manuel Paez Terán during a police operation aimed at clearing out less than two dozen people from an Atlanta-area forest as they protested against a training center planned to be built nearby known as -Cop City-. The incident was the first of its kind in US history, and Georgia authorities have released scant information about what happened during the police operation two-plus years ago. None of the Georgia state patrol officers involved were wearing body cams, so no video evidence of the shooting exists.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/28/georgia-cop-city-killing	2025-01-28T05:00:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dad14b04e97aa8e8c61c74beeb2ef0c06034d45/0_287_5474_3286/master/5474.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6b3522b5dd67cdac3f360359411f56c2
Cult London film venue Prince Charles cinema under threat of closure	Much loved for its screenings of hard-to-find films, the venue claims its landlord wants to alter lease, leaving it able to shut down the business The Prince Charles cinema in central London, long a site of pilgrimage for those interested in cult and hard-to-find films, has launched a petition saying its existence is under threat from its property developer landlords.

Middle East crisis live: Netanyahu planning to meet Trump next week as US president repeats aim to move Palestinians from Gaza	Israeli prime minister could visit White House as soon as next week, making him the first foreign leader to meet Trump since his inauguration Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the latest events in the Middle East. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is planning to meet US President Donald Trump in Washington as early as next week, according to reports, as hundreds of thousands of Palestinian people made their way back into northern Gaza on Monday. US secretary of state Marco Rubio held a call with Jordan’s King Abdullah on Monday, two days after a suggestion by Donald Trump that Jordan and Egypt should take more Palestinians from Gaza. -The Secretary and King Abdullah discussed implementation of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, the release of hostages, and creating a pathway for security and stability in the region,- the state department said in a statement. Trump’s weekend remarks were not mentioned. Lebanese officials say firing by Israeli troops has killed two people and injured 17 in the second day of deadly protests in southern Lebanon. Residents displaced by the 14-month war between Israel and Hezbollah on Monday again attempted to return to villages where Israeli troops remain. On Sunday, 24 people were killed and more than 130 injured when Israeli troops fired at protesters. Israel said on Monday that it had arrested two Israelis suspected of spying for Iran, including one accused of handing the country classified information obtained during his military service. Tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem were set to lose education, healthcare and other services provided by UN agency Unrwa as an Israeli ban on the organisation takes effect on Thursday. Eight of the 26 hostages yet to be released under the first phase of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas are dead, Israel has confirmed. A Hamas delegation has arrived in Cairo to discuss the implementation of the Gaza ceasefire deal, the group said in a statement. The EU’s foreign ministers have agreed to a -roadmap- to ease current sanctions on Syria, a move welcomed by the country’s government.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/28/israel-gaza-netanyahu-trump-hamas-palestinians-middle-east-latest-live-news	2025-01-27T23:33:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64dff35b74022795939d2f256cd5875dbb0fbc4e/0_62_3360_2016/master/3360.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9c64645370c6e3fa95d70b4b52f99896
Tuesday briefing: How an unknown Chinese startup wiped $593bn from the value of an AI giant	In today’s newsletter: the US had a huge head start on artificial intelligence – but now a low-cost rival from Hangzhou has turned the industry on its head Good morning. Since the emergence of ChatGPT, OpenAI’s groundbreaking artificial intelligence tool, American companies have appeared to have a huge head start in the development of the most significant technology of its generation. But now a small Chinese rival has emerged that appears to match what OpenAI and the other US giants can do at a much lower cost, and without the same hunger for computing power that has made the chip manufacturer Nvidia the most valuable company in the world. The result was a stunning collapse in the value of Big Tech stocks yesterday – and a $593bn fall in the value of Nvidia, the biggest in the US stock market’s history. Gaza ceasefire | Tens of thousands of Palestinians flooded back into northern Gaza on Monday after Israel opened military checkpoints that had divided the strip for more than a year, ending a forced exile from homes and loved ones that many feared could become permanent. UK security | Hindu nationalism, misogyny and the -manosphere- have been identified as breeding grounds for extremism in a leaked government report commissioned after last summer’s riots. The -rapid analytical sprint- also dismissed claims of -two-tier policing- as a -rightwing extremist narrative-. Auschwitz | Elderly former inmates of Auschwitz gathered for perhaps the final time on the 80th anniversary of the concentration camp’s liberation. In remarks at the event, four survivors warned world leaders against the danger of rising antisemitism. Roman Abramovich | An offshore scheme appears to have helped companies owned by the billionaire Roman Abramovich avoid duties potentially amounting to tens of millions of dollars.

Dr Phil joins Chicago immigration raid as border czar says more arrests coming	TV personality embeds in one of several raids in US cities in what Tom Homan says are only ‘beginning stages’ The TV personality Dr Phil joined the US border czar, Tom Homan, in a choreographed immigration raid in Chicago, one of several conducted in US cities over the weekend in what Homan claimed was only -the beginning stages- of Donald Trump’s promised threat to deport millions of people from the country. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said it had made 956 arrests on Sunday, bringing the total since Trump took office to 2,681 arrests – short of the 1,200 to 1,500 daily arrests that Trump has reportedly demanded. The Washington Post reported that Trump’s White House has issued a directive to Ice field offices that they should make 75 arrests daily and that agency managers would be held responsible for missed targets, raising fears of indiscriminate arrest tactics.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/27/trump-immigration-dr-phil-chicago-raids	2025-01-27T07:52:44-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86e237eb6464b666504b8345aed26c92529a7ed0/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1a7c3101aefb0b86af6f91a0c44af530

How Australia’s ‘unfair’ dental system – and the way $1.3bn is spent – is driving inequality and leaving millions of people behind	Half of all government spending on dental care goes to private insurance rebates – meaning those without often skip treatment until things get worse Patients bear the brunt of dentist fees. But of the $1.3bn the federal government spends on the nation’s teeth, more than half goes to subsidising the uptake of private health insurance.

Secret police tricked Carlos the Jackal into fleeing Prague, archives reveal	New book casts doubt on accepted picture of Communist bloc support for violent radicals during cold war In June 1986, a pair of operatives from communist Czechoslovakia’s StB intelligence service made contact with a mysterious couple staying at a Prague hotel. The man’s passport identified him as a Syrian diplomat called Walid Wattar; his pregnant wife also had a Syrian diplomatic passport.

What would happen if the US military went after cartels on Mexican soil?	Experts say any incursion could come with serious repercussions, include violence against US tourists Evan Hafer, a popular veteran and founder of Black Rifle Coffee, was on Joe Rogan’s podcast after the November election. As with any Maga acolyte, the US-Mexico border figured prominently in his mind. -If we declare war on the cartel, these dudes are not going to understand what the fuck is going on.

After asking the mother of a sick boy routine questions about his family history, the woman looked outraged.

More than half Gen Z think authoritarian leader better for UK than democracy, poll suggests – UK politics live	Polling finds 52% of Gen Z thought UK would be better place if ‘strong leader did not have to bother with parliament and elections’ Good morning. It is Holocaust memorial day, and the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, and the Westminster politics news is relatively light this morning because broadcasters have been focusing on these events. No 10 did not even have a minister doing a morning interview round. Jakub Krupa, who recently took over writing the Guadian Europe live blog, is covering all the relevant events here. The big Westminster news yesterday was the fact that Keir Starmer and Donald Trump have had their first conversation since the inauguration. They spoke for 45 minutes, after Trump gave a peculiar -very good person- (for a liberal) endorsement of Starmer to reporters on Air Force One. (It was slightly patronising – -he’s done a very good job thus far- – but, from the No 10 point of view, a lot more welcome than what gets said when the president is in ‘bad Trump’ mode.) Eleni Courea has the story here.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/27/gen-z-authoritarian-leader-uk-kemi-badenoch-covid-inquiry-conservatives-labour-uk-politics-latest-updates	2025-01-27T01:45:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ae7a645bbe3f8f44d90d9e0286f6a95e4a0098a/599_160_3164_1898/master/3164.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a742d5039d7efa77a7083784fe100cf2
Israel insists it is going ahead with Unrwa ban – what it may mean for Palestinians	UN agency ordered to vacate HQ by Thursday – just as aid is being increased to Gaza after ceasefire Israel has insisted it will not back down over its plan to close down the Gaza operations of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa), the UN relief agency for Palestinians, even though critics say the move will jeopardise urgent humanitarian aid efforts. Israel has ordered the UN agency to vacate its headquarters in East Jerusalem by Thursday, after the Israeli Knesset passed a law on 28 October banning its operations in Israel and the Palestinian territories. It has not yet said how it will implement a related law ending all Israeli government cooperation with Unwra, which could come into force on the same day and strangle its operations in the West Bank and Gaza.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/27/israel-insists-it-is-going-ahead-with-unrwa-ban-what-it-may-mean-for-palestinians	2025-01-27T01:34:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adff4b9663f772eb7daf31c395a32157b48f48d6/0_252_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7c97c99e527485eb0dc1d4dfac83f3b0

But in a growingly polarised and aggressive world, the ceremony will also for many be a call for action and renewal of our collective memory.

Monday briefing: What if the climate crisis makes disaster insurance unaffordable?	In today’s newsletter: The Los Angeles wildfires highlighted the immense challenges faced by the insurance industry amid the escalating risks of the climate crisis. Are there any potential solutions for homeowners? Good morning. If the Los Angeles wildfires are bracing evidence of the general threat posed by the climate crisis, they have also brought home a specific problem: how can you make the insurance system work when the risks are so high? That is not a question limited to California, or to the United States: the insurance industry has rated the climate crisis as the biggest threat to its future four years in a row, a very concrete riposte to those politicians who continue to question the reality of global heating. It is impossible to know whether a specific weather event like storm Éowyn in the UK has been caused by climate change – but we know that they, and the damage they leave in their wake, are only going to get more frequent. Israel-Gaza war | Donald Trump’s proposal that large numbers of Palestinians should leave Gaza to -just clean out- the whole strip has been rejected by US allies in the region. Trump’s intervention came as a deal was reached to allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza and release a civilian hostage who Israel said should have been freed already. Heathrow | Rachel Reeves has given her heaviest hint yet that she will back a third runway at Heathrow airport, arguing that she is willing to make difficult decisions while pursuing economic growth. Campaigners have warned that the move would be a severe setback for the UK’s climate commitments. Southport attack | Prevent’s assessment of the danger posed by Axel Rudakubana followed policy at the time, an official review will find – but it will criticise the scheme for rejecting extra help to tackle his interest in violence. The review of the way three referrals were handled before Rudakubana committed an atrocity in Southport is due to be published this week. AI | Ministers have shut down or dropped at least half a dozen artificial intelligence prototypes intended for the welfare system, the Guardian has learned, in a sign of the headwinds facing Keir Starmer’s effort to increase government efficiency. Belarus | Alexander Lukashenko is set to win a seventh five-year term as Belarusian president with 87.6% of the vote in Sunday’s election, according to an exit poll. The US and the EU said in the run-up to the election that it could not be free or fair because independent media are banned and all leading opposition figures have been jailed or forced to flee abroad.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/27/monday-briefing-will-the-climate-crisis-kill-off-disaster-insurance	2025-01-26T22:51:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03add73c9b2af5547f821b444886c401681ebea9/0_431_7914_4749/master/7914.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=15f15fd168fde2e4ce4975bea0ff8a4a

Workers who were considered to be on the frontline during the pandemic have seen no change to their working hours or shift patterns in recent years, according to research by Timewise, a social enterprise that helps businesses with flexible working policies.

Middle East live: Palestinians start to return to homes in north Gaza after Israeli hostage deal reached	Israel said it would stop blocking Palestinians from travelling north after agreement reached with Hamas on release of Israeli civilian Arbel Yehoud Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Middle East. Displaced Palestinians are expected to begin returning to their homes in northern Gaza on Monday, two days later than scheduled, after an agreement was reached between Israel and Hamas to release a civilian Israeli hostage. Israeli forces opened fire on people trying to return to their homes, killing at least 22 people, including a Lebanese soldier and six women, and injuring 124 amid a dispute with Lebanon over a ceasefire agreement. Israel said it would not allow civilians to return to southern Lebanon, and accused the Lebanese army of violating key commitments under the ceasefire deal. Videos showed tense face-offs between Israeli soldiers and tanks and Lebanese crowds waving banners and chanting slogans. The White House said late on Sunday that Israel and Lebanon had agreed to extend the deadline for Israeli troops to depart southern Lebanon until 18 February. Israeli prime minister Netanyahu said on Friday that the Lebanese state had not yet -fully enforced- a deal to secure the south, meant to ensure that Hezbollah withdrew beyond the Litani River. -To ‘clean’ Gaza immediately after the war would in fact be a continuation of the war, through the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people,- said Hassan Jabareen, the director of Palestinian rights group Adalah. Omer Shatz, a lecturer in international law at Sciences Po Paris and international criminal court (ICC) counsel, said Trump’s comments were a -call for ethnic cleansing- that echoed calls from extremist Israeli politicians and public figures dating to the start of the war. The US president had said Palestinians could move to countries including Jordan, which already hosts more than 2.7 million Palestinian refugees, and Egypt. -I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing at a different location where they can maybe live in peace for a change,- Trump told reporters on Air Force One. -You’re talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing and say: ‘You know, it’s over.’-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/27/middle-east-live-israel-palestinians-gaza-return-hostage-deal	2025-01-26T21:23:57-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9717d811a094a62121d4330ae7a7ffcf25495566/0_0_8064_4838/master/8064.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=216157cdf94d97c5b4ef80914283038b

Intimacy coordinators say Blake Lively’s legal dispute shows need for their role	Actor has accused Justin Baldoni, co-star and director of It Ends With Us, of sexual harassment in civil action The film footage at the centre of Blake Lively’s high-profile legal row proves that intimacy coordination should be considered as necessary on set as organising stunts, leading consultants have said. Lively filed a civil complaint against co-star and director Justin Baldoni just before Christmas, accusing him of sexual harassment during the filming of It Ends with Us – a romantic drama released last year. Baldoni denies the claims.	https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/27/intimacy-coordinators-say-blake-livelys-legal-dispute-shows-need-for-their-role	2025-01-26T21:00:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b944f0045481f1f82f18a3aee98753e126d9ff3d/0_0_1712_1027/master/1712.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=78d6f8ca1039e0fb08ce36a86eefc395

Australia news live: Minns condemns vandalism of NSW police monument; Victorians brace for searing heat	Police launch investigation over defacement of wall of remembrance in the Domain. Follow today’s news live Peter Dutton says Holocaust education an important mission In his statement for International Holocaust Day, Peter Dutton, the opposition leader, drew parallels between current anti-semitism and the Holocaust. The weight of history will be especially felt by survivors and their families this International Holocaust Remembrance Day with 2025 marking the 80th Anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau. In the magnitude of anti-Semitism which is plaguing Western democracies today – including Australia – many citizens who have read about the history and horrors of the Holocaust have, for the first time, grasped how that catastrophe eventuated. They have seen, with their own eyes, a type of hate that, if left unchecked, unleashes greater evils. Educating Australians about atrocities of the Holocaust and the October 7 attacks is an important mission that deserves support. By gaining awareness of the persecution and atrocities committed against Jews, Australians will have a better understanding of why there is no place for antisemitism in our community. It was a pitiless and unrelenting act of cruelty that was long in the planning, cold in its calculation, and carried out on a scale that falls across the decades like a terrible shadow. The devastation felt when witnessing the horror, destruction and brutality inflicted by Hamas on October 7 is reminiscent of the dark and painful stories of the past. For the Australian Jewish community, those are the stories of their families. We embraced the Jewish community then, and we embrace you now. Tragically, we are not yet free of antisemitism. It stands in vile opposition to all we are as a nation and all that we have built - together - over generations. We will not tolerate it in any form. It has no place in our nation, and we will combat it with the full force of our laws and with total commitment from every level of government.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/jan/27/australia-news-live-chris-minns-police-victoria-melbourne-heatwave-antisemitism-holocaust-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-election-campaign	2025-01-26T12:36:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4df95bbd39d6732418f9ce4664dad230b74cdf77/612_45_2959_1775/master/2959.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=de858cb9e0b9306e309c79e90c8d7e4a

The framing of the shrew: California students photograph mammal never caught on film	Three young scientists set traps to capture and film species of special concern in move that can help conserve the shrew In a 7,000ft-high marshy spot in the cold, rugged eastern Sierra mountains, two groups of mammals scurried around at night. One was going about their normal nocturnal routine of hunting worms. The other was hoping for a glimpse of an elusive creature: the Mount Lyell shrew, the only known California mammal never photographed alive. The three young student scientists faced a tight timeline. They baited 150 pitfall traps – small cups dug into the earth to catch wandering creatures – with cat food and mealworms and monitored them across a 600ft area, checking each trap every two hours for any signs of their goal. They slept no more than two hours at a time. Shrews have such a fast metabolism that they die in traps quickly, one of the reasons this species had never been photographed or studied live.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/26/mount-lyell-shrew-california-photograph	2025-01-26T09:43:13-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/290d1f56a6b048b829ce818933cd13f74e098059/0_731_2914_1749/master/2914.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5890e19466a34d400bc20d7cb73033f1

Nearly two-thirds of Britons say very rich have too much influence on politics	Opinium survey of 2,000 adults found concern about the impact of growing wealth inequality in the UK Growing wealth inequality is increasing the risk of societal ­collapse, according to a new Fairness Foundation report that shows nearly two-thirds of Britons are concerned about the political influence of very rich people. People losing faith with democracy, economic shocks and environmental breakdowns are some of the potential triggers for a decline or collapse in social cohesion, the thinktank said. One warning sign of democracy being undermined is a lack of public trust in institutions, so it commissioned a survey of 2,000 adults by Opinium, which found 63% believe the very rich have too much influence on UK politics, ­compared to 40% for businesses and ­religious organisations, and 38% for ­international organisations, such as the EU and UN.	https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2025/jan/25/nearly-two-thirds-of-britons-say-very-rich-have-too-much-influence-on-politics	2025-01-25T08:23:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b190b7c4d605519a4c9b9425f9cd47b9c9ae251/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25b46cf185d4a9de713cdd02e94c9dcf

Eric Adams meets Trump – is a pardon more pressing than running New York?

Adams, a Democrat who faces a federal indictment for allegedly accepting bribes and illegal campaign contributions from foreign sources, met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida shortly before the president-elect took office; went to Trump’s inauguration, rather than attend scheduled events in the city for Martin Luther King Day; and did an interview with Carlson, a former Fox News host who frequently criticizes Democrats and has promoted conspiracy theories about immigration.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/25/eric-adams-trump-new-york	2025-01-25T05:00:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8e666df9079afef4e96218ee0c0da0ce5498f50/611_437_2990_1794/master/2990.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=afd150cd5e9c209ccc59e60810f62f1e

‘Stick-it-to-the-man sentiment’: Oscar-nominated films compete to bait Donald Trump	Almost all the shortlisted movies this year can be seen as a critique of the incoming president. Accident or design? When reacting to Oscar nominations, actors traditionally err on the side of hyperbole.

Britain’s response to Russian ‘spy ship’ is game of political messaging – for now	Deteriorating security environment and incidents in Baltic have forced military reassessment in northern Europe Submarines normally operate in secret, lurking in the deep. So when the British defence secretary, John Healey, authorised a Royal Navy Astute-class attack sub to surface close to the Russian -spy ship- Yantar south of Cornwall in November, it was unusual enough. What was even more notable, however, was that the minister went on to tell the House of Commons on Wednesday what he had done. It was, Healey said, conducted -strictly as a deterrent measure-, as was his decision to accuse the Kremlin of spying on the location of undersea communication and utility cables that connect Britain to the world.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/24/britain-russian-spy-ship-response-political-messaging	2025-01-23T22:00:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02c418d56f91cb671ee7e605f90e7e3d9bc12ed9/438_375_2231_1339/master/2231.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d3856ffd78c4f1e03be381ee626aad1f

Inquest exposes poor leadership, insufficient testing at aged care home that saw 19 Covid deaths in 2020	Deadly wave of Covid that hit Sydney’s Newmarch House made more severe by organisational failings, coroner says Some of the 19 deaths during a 2020 Covid-19 outbreak at a NSW aged-care home could have been avoided had proper testing for the virus been implemented, a coronial inquest has found. Poor leadership, insufficient communication and staff shortages were highlighted in coroner Derek Lee’s review of the deaths from a wave of the virus that swept through Sydney’s Newmarch House. If universal testing of staff had been performed once the outbreak had begun, and timelier reporting of results had allowed for cases of Covid-19 to be identified more readily, it would likely have reduced the extent and severity of the outbreak; Frontline management at Newmarch House did not clearly understand the chain of command and did not get effective support from Anglicare senior executives. -Consequently, Anglicare did not demonstrate adequate leadership and governance during the course of the outbreak-, Lee said; There was a lack of clarity at Newmarch House as to who, if anyone, bore ultimate responsibility for clinical decision-making; Anglicare did not give residents’ families enough specific information about their loved one, and in some cases it was inaccurate or understated the seriousness of what was occurring; During the initial stages of the outbreak there was a -significant deficiency- in the number of staff available which -meant that infection control and the care provided to residents was gravely jeopardised-.

Firefighters battle to keep upper hand on new wildfire north of Los Angeles	Hughes fire near Castaic Lake broke out on Wednesday and led to evacuation orders or warnings for more than 50,000 Firefighters fought to maintain the upper hand on a huge and rapidly moving wildfire that swept through rugged mountains north of Los Angeles and resulted in more than 50,000 people being put under evacuation orders or warnings.

Trump’s executive order on gender uses language pointing to ‘fetal personhood’	Words ‘at conception’ in order gesture to push by anti-abortion movement to give embryos and fetuses legal rights One of Donald Trump’s new executive orders, which claims there are only two genders, quietly incorporates tenets of fetal personhood – the legal doctrine, pushed by the anti-abortion movement, that life begins at conception and that embryos and fetuses therefore deserve full legal rights and protections. -‘Female’ means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell,- reads the order, which was issued just hours after Trump took office on Monday. -‘Male’ means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell.-	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/23/trump-executive-order-fetal-personhood	2025-01-23T04:29:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dd207fabe84944c3e272cc20271d55128f32dc2/0_0_3577_2146/master/3577.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2a4aa2996f1a96b5cfcb5c06d63e7649
First Thing: Trump labels January 6 attacks on police ‘very minor incidents’	President defends offering clemency to the 1,500 people involved in the insurrection. Plus, an oral history of the making of Twin Peaks Good morning. Donald Trump has described attacks by insurrectionists on police officers at the US Capitol on January 6 2021 as -very minor incidents- after he offered sweeping clemency to those who took part. Why so many pardons? Media reports suggest Trump was too impatient to go through cases individually, with Axios quoting an adviser as saying: -Trump just said: ‘Fuck it: Release ’em all’.- What other action are Republicans taking related to January 6? House Republicans will continue investigating the insurrection to try to undermine the previous inquiry that found Trump responsible for the deadly attack. Which aspects of the ACA will be affected? Trump cannot repeal the act by executive order but his directives are restricting eligibility requirements, cutting federal subsidies and affecting enrolment deadlines.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/23/first-thing-trump-labels-january-6-attacks-on-police-very-minor-incidents	2025-01-23T04:17:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6c80b2c175b684ee04ab249ef7430323c11cde6/0_166_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9866ff5584cd26fbafe8614a09a4e607

UK will not accept EU offer to join pan-European customs union ‘at present time’, minister says – UK politics live	Housing minister shoots down idea floated by Maroš Šefčovič designed to help reset UK-EU discussions Good morning. The government is obsessed with finding any levers it can that might promote growth. At Davos yesterday Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, was asked if growth was even more important than promoting net zero, and she replied: -Well if [growth is] the number one mission it’s obviously the most important thing.- Today the government is announcing potentially significant plans that could limit the scope of judicial review applications to hold back growth. Pippa Crerar, Kiran Stacey and Sandra Laville have the details here. Economists argue that an obvious move to promote growth would be to have close trade links with the EU. But the government has ruled out rejoining the single market or the custom union (let alone rejoining the EU proper – which is still largely a taboo proposal in most parts of UK politics). And today a minister has ruled out an EU proposal for the UK to join, not the customs union, but a customs union with the EU. Šefčovič referred to the idea of the UK joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM). These are common rules that allow parts, ingredients and materials for manufacturing supply chains to be sourced from across dozens of countries in Europe and North Africa to be used in tariff-free trade. We’re not seeking to participate in that particular arrangement. I think in general the government’s been very clear … we do want a closer relationship with our European partners, both in trading terms, but also, importantly … in terms of security and defense cooperation, where we need to work far more closely. So absolutely, yes, we do want a closer relationship.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/23/keir-starmer-eu-sadiq-khan-latest-live-politics-news	2025-01-23T01:28:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9bddca2b2830e514cc80df9cdacbccd2233cb74/0_98_5552_3331/master/5552.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9267462122b06c19f2bbf9085fa48f19
Trump suggests it was a mistake for Biden not to pardon himself – US politics live	US president says his predecessor gave ‘everybody pardons’ but says it is a ‘sad thing’ he didn’t give himself one Donald Trump has described attacks on police officers at the US Capitol on January 6 2021 as -very minor incidents- as he sought to defend his decision to pardon the insurrectionists. The US president hinted that those who put him through -four years of hell- via criminal prosecutions should themselves be investigated, adding ominously that his predecessor, Joe Biden, made a mistake by not pardoning himself. Most of the people were absolutely innocent. OK. But forgetting all about that, these people have served, horribly, a long time. It would be very, very cumbersome to go and look – you know how many people we’re talking about? 1,500 people.- This guy went around giving everybody pardons. And you know, the funny thing, maybe the sad thing, is he didn’t give himself a pardon. And if you look at it, it all had to do with him.- Joe Biden has very bad advisers. Somebody advised Joe Biden to give pardons to everybody but him.- Donald Trump has described attacks on police officers at the US Capitol on January 6 2021 as -very minor incidents- as he sought to defend his decision to pardon the insurrectionists. Those pardoned include more than 250 people who were convicted of assault charges, some having attacked police with makeshift weapons such as flagpoles, a hockey stick and a crutch. Trump also used the prime-time Fox News interview to discuss his barrage of executive orders, dismiss security concerns over Chinese-owned app TikTok (-Is it that important for China to be spying on young people, on young kids watching crazy videos?-) and discuss the possibility of cutting off federal funds to so-called -sanctuary cities- that shield undocumented immigrants from federal detention requests. On Thursday, Trump will speak remotely at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, delivering his first major speech to global business and political leaders. He is due to give a speech and engage in a dialogue at 11am US Eastern Time (4pm GMT), according to the meeting schedule. It is not clear what he will discuss. The new US presidential envoy for special missions has pushed back against Nato chief, Mark Rutte’s talk at the World Economic Forum about Ukraine joining Nato, pointing out many members of the alliance aren’t paying their -fair share- already. Richard Grenell, appointed by Trump in December, said it is -pretty shocking- that so many foreign ministers in Europe, and so many US politicians, did not try to stop the Russia-Ukraine war, and criticised Biden’s handling of the situation.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/23/donald-trump-pardons-january-6-us-president-joe-biden-jd-vance-republicans-live-news	2025-01-23T00:42:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5fcf45c541301d81dc486432ff09d991a9e5b5f/196_30_1282_769/master/1282.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=db34cd3853a8542998b1b626bcb60c4f

Thursday briefing: With a new wave of violence, the West Bank is on edge	In today’s newsletter: As Israeli security forces launch an operation in the city of Jenin and violence by settlers escalates, Emma Graham-Harrison explains what happens next Good morning. A few days after a ceasefire brought at least temporary relief to Gaza, violence erupted in the occupied West Bank. On Tuesday, the Israeli military launched what was described as an extensive raid in the city of Jenin, a day after Israeli settlers attacked Palestinians, setting vehicles and property ablaze in a violent rampage that left at least one person dead. Two Israeli were arrested even though dozens of armed settlers were involved in the rioting. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, condemned the attacks, but it is evident that extremist settlers feel emboldened by government policies and ministers who back their agenda.
