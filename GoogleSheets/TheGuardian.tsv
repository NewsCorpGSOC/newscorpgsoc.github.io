Sweep of swing states rubs salt in Democrats’ wounds as Trump prepares to meet Biden	Trump to visit Oval Office on Wednesday as Biden says he will ‘ensure a peaceful and orderly transition’ Donald Trump was declared the winner in Arizona early on Sunday, completing the Republicans’ clean sweep of the so-called swing states and rubbing salt in Democrats’ wounds as it was announced that the president-elect is scheduled to meet with Joe Biden at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the presidential handover. In a national campaign that was projected as being extremely close but he ended up winning handily, the result in Arizona gives Trump 312 electoral college votes, compared with Kamala Harris’s 226. The state joins the other Sun belt swing states – Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina – and the three Rust belt states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in voting Republican. All were expected to be extremely competitive but all went for Trump, though by fairly close margins.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/10/trump-arizona-swing-states-sweep	2024-11-10T11:55:01-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/827418b53de6099f2f9152ff1aa05bb97d836ad6/0_79_3376_2026/master/3376.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=766efa098b78b0f93c810d4b47a1449d

Scientists have warned the proposal to extend the life of the North West Shelf gas processing plant on the Burrup Peninsula in the country’s remote north-west is linked to the development of at least three major gas fields and could ultimately result in billions of tonnes of climate pollution being released into the atmosphere.

UK ‘planning lots of scenarios’ for Donald Trump’s approach to Ukraine	Chief secretary to the Treasury says security and defence spending is a priority but it requires ‘trade-offs’ The UK is examining all possible options when it comes to the US president-elect Donald Trump’s approach to Ukraine, the chief secretary to the Treasury has said, as the UK’s chief of defence staff said approximately 1,500 Russian troops were being killed and injured every day. Whitehall officials are -considering and planning lots of different scenarios,- Darren Jones told Sky News on Sunday. During the election campaign, Trump said he would find a solution to end the war -within a day-, but did not explain how he would do so. His vice-president nominee JD Vance has been vociferously opposed to providing more funds to support Ukraine.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/10/uk-planning-lots-of-scenarios-for-donald-trump-approach-to-ukraine	2024-11-10T05:13:13-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b65ed5b3bda8e98589af06674d8087ddb86a79e5/0_69_3129_1877/master/3129.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=263d9ba418e3acf5e71ae0a8ea35343c
‘The movement is not over’: leaders of Uncommitted look ahead at organizing during Trump term	While disappointed, leaders say Democratic party stuck with ‘status quo’ instead of listening to voter concerns Following Donald Trump’s decisive victory in this week’s presidential election, leaders of the anti-war group Uncommitted National Movement expressed their disappointment over the results, highlighting the Democratic party’s failure to listen to its base and prioritize progressive policies. Since the movement formed last winter, its leaders have urged the Democratic party to heed their demands of a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and to adopt an arms embargo on Israel, or risk losing their votes. While a full picture of how Arab and Muslim Americans voted in the presidential election is still being captured, this election showed a shift among communities that had long formed the Democratic base. A majority of Muslim Americans voted for the Green party candidate Jill Stein at 53%, according to a nationwide exit poll of more than 1,500 Muslim Americans by the civil rights group Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), followed by 21% for Trump and 20% for vice-president Kamala Harris.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/10/uncommitted-movement-leaders-organizing-trump	2024-11-10T05:00:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a5f190d5604844ff813f71ab274df078a03dabc/0_221_3300_1979/master/3300.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=be45b407db043d107dbe1a22b40f7967

Kamala Harris is just the latest victim of global trend to oust incumbents	Voters across the world have backed any alternative to the people in charge What do the British Conservatives, the New Zealand Labour party, the LDP of Japan and the ANC of South Africa have in common? Defeat. All four led governments that have been pummelled at the polls recently as part of the greatest wave of anti-incumbent voting ever seen. Governments of left and right, radicals and moderates, liberals and nationalists: all are falling. This week the US Democratic party joined the electoral casualty list, bested by the man they ousted four years ago, the past and now future president, Donald Trump. Critics and cheerleaders alike see Trump as an extraordinary figure with a unique appeal. But his triumph is the rule, not the exception. Defeated vice-president Kamala Harris ran ahead of the global trend, even more so in the crucial swing states. But she was swept away nonetheless.	https://www.theguardian.com/global/2024/nov/10/kamala-harris-is-just-the-latest-victim-of-global-trend-to-oust-incumbents	2024-11-10T04:00:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d81477f4180749705d72e83c356ba9dab4d19800/0_182_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f8004b5be09d574517ee5e696d0170bb

Donald Trump wins Arizona as US House moves closer to Republican control – US politics live	President-elect completes clean sweep of seven battleground states; Republican representative defeats former Navajo Nation president for House seat Donald Trump won the presidential election in Arizona, the Associated Press (AP) declared on Saturday, completing a clean sweep of all seven battleground states and locking in a decisive electoral college victory over the Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris. Trump, who had secured the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White House by early Wednesday, now has what is expected to be a final total of 312 votes to Harris’ 226. Protests against Trump erupted in the US on Saturday as people on both coasts took to the streets in frustration about his re-election. Thousands of people in major cities including New York City and Seattle demonstrated against the former president and now president-elect amid his threats against reproductive rights and pledges to carry out mass deportations at the start of his upcoming presidency. Biden and Trump will meet on Wednesday in the Oval Office, the White House announced on Saturday. -At President Biden’s invitation, President Biden and president-elect Trump will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday,- the press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said in a statement. Republicans on Saturday appeared close to clinching control of the US House of Representatives, a critical element for Trump to advance his agenda when the president-elect returns to the White House in January. The AP reported that three US House races in Arizona were too early to call on Saturday, most notably the first and sixth congressional districts. The president-elect has charged Howard Lutnick, a longtime friend, and one of the few high-profile figures in corporate America to vocally endorse his campaign, with recruiting officials who will deliver, rather than dilute, his agenda. The CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, and co-chair of Trump’s transition team, has made no secret of his plan to stack the new White House with loyalists – and keep out anyone who threatens to derail his pledges. A senior adviser to Trump said that the incoming US administration’s priority for Ukraine will be achieving peace rather than helping it regain territory captured by Russia in the almost three years of the war. In an interview with the BBC, broadcast on Saturday, Bryan Lanza, who has been a political adviser to Trump since his 2016 presidential campaign, said: -When Zelenskyy says we will only stop this fighting, there will only be peace, once Crimea is returned, we’ve got news for President Zelenskyy: Crimea is gone.- An employee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) has been fired from her job and is being investigated because she told a disaster relief team she was directing in Florida after Hurricane Milton to avoid homes displaying election campaign signs supporting Trump, conduct that the agency head on Saturday called -reprehensible-.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/10/donald-trump-arizona-swing-states-house-representatives-republicans-us-politics-latest-updates	2024-11-10T00:57:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4de7ba42cceec10b200fb94a63959087d9bcb02/0_213_7008_4205/master/7008.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=71a8f52781f3e0ccaa6e18ce05fa6dd3

He talks about a lot of stuff that people in the Rust Belt care about.- Stewart was a guest at Donald Trump’s election watch event in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday night and celebrated his victory over Democratic vice-president Kamala Harris. The result said much about gender, race and the new media landscape. It also represented a populist backlash against America’s perceived elites.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/09/trump-election-win-backlash	2024-11-09T06:00:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51934ddabdcd7948b51152fd98f1de4a9d641a22/0_198_5929_3558/master/5929.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=56c9be4d2b5dad8b5adf266aeeedd6cf

Middle East live: at least nine Palestinians killed after reported Israeli attack in ‘humanitarian zone’	Al Jazeera reports that women and children are among the dead after the Israeli attack on the al-Mawasi area near Khan Younis Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the conflicts in the Middle East. At least 14 people were killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza late on Friday and early on Saturday, the Palestinian news agency Wafa has reported. There is a -strong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas- of the northern Gaza Strip, a committee of global food security experts warned on Friday, as Israel claims to be pursuing a military offensive against Palestinian militant group Hamas in the area. -Immediate action, within days not weeks, is required from all actors who are directly taking part in the conflict, or have influence on its conduct, to avert and alleviate this catastrophic situation,- the independent Famine Review Committee (FRC) said in a rare alert. The FRC said it could be -assumed that starvation, malnutrition, and excess mortality due to malnutrition and disease, are rapidly increasing- in north Gaza. -Famine thresholds may have already been crossed or else will be in the near future,- the global hunger monitor said. Nearly 70% of the people killed in the war in Gaza are women and children, according to a UN analysis of verified deaths that highlights the heavy civilian toll of the conflict. In a new report, the most detailed analysis of its kind yet, the UN human rights office said it had verified 8,119 of those killed during the first six months of the war in Gaza. Of the fatalities, 3,588 were children and 2,036 were women. The youngest victim was a one-day-old boy and the oldest was a 97-year-old woman. The UN’s peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon said on Friday that the Israeli military’s -deliberate and direct destruction- of its property was a -flagrant violation- of international law. Since Israel launched a ground campaign across the border against Hezbollah fighters at the end of September, Unifil has accused the Israel Defense Forces on several occasions of deliberately attacking its bases, including by shooting at peacekeepers and destroying watchtowers, which Israel denies. In its latest accusation, Unifil said the IDF used excavators and a bulldozer to destroy part of a fence and concrete structure at a UN peacekeeping position in southern Lebanon on Thursday. Peacekeepers had also observed Israeli troops this week removing a barrel that marks blue line, it said. Benjamin Netanyahu has appointed a hardline supporter of the war in Gaza and longtime backer of settlements in the West Bank as his ambassador to the US as Israel prepares for the incoming administration of Donald Trump. Yechiel Leiter, an American-born rightwing publicist and former government aide who immigrated to Israel four decades ago, was announced as Israel’s next ambassador to Washington on Friday. Amsterdam police have made more than 60 arrests after what authorities called -hateful antisemitic violence- against Israeli football fans. A plane carrying football supporters brought home from the Dutch capital by the Israeli government landed on Friday at Israel’s Ben Gurion airport after the clashes on Thursday, which took place after a Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv. Amsterdam’s police chief, Peter Holla, said there had been -incidents on both sides-, starting on Wednesday night when Maccabi fans tore down a Palestinian flag from the facade of a building in the city centre and shouted -fuck you Palestine-. A social media video verified by Reuters showed Maccabi fans setting off flares and chanting -Olé, olé, let the IDF win, we will fuck the Arabs-, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/09/middle-east-live-israel-gaza-war-hamas-lebanon-hezbollah	2024-11-09T00:13:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4dc1f8e202985448dea2e3b89f50fc8ba61f535/0_279_5500_3301/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=131f8b15988bf193615ed0eeaf9885ae

Fiscal policy was a squabble too far for German coalition’s odd throuple	At times it felt like the three parties thought they were governing three completely different countries Germany’s coalition government, which collapsed in dramatic fashion on Wednesday night after almost three years in power, was always an odd throuple. A pact between three parties with three quite different histories and different priorities, it was made up of two outfits that have traditionally located themselves on the left of the political spectrum – the Social Democratic party (SPD) and the Greens – and one, the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), that had until then been a loyal junior partner to the conservatives.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/08/germany-coalition-odd-throuple-fiscal-policy-squabble	2024-11-08T03:09:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/717ebf0e93c6d2669687113d0aa17b2e07e54d2e/0_71_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7f48931e54c542de0ccb1bd993f3988c

UK must seize ‘opportunities’ of Trump presidency, says David Lammy – politics live	UK foreign secretary says US election result ‘not wholly bad’ and Britain should not underestimate opportunities of the next four years Good morning. As the Labour government tries to work out what having Donald Trump back in the White House will mean for Britain, and what it must do in response, David Lammy is absolutely at the centre of that debate. Partly that is because he is foreign secretary, and partly it’s because (in a crowded field) he is probably the British MP who has been most outspoken and critical about Trump in the past. Lammy has now given a long interview to the BBC’s Newscast podcast to discuss these issues. And, as Jamie Grierson reports, he dismissed suggestions that his past diatribes about Trump would damage the relationship now by describing his comments as -old news-. The first thing is to say that, on the whole, foreign policy is less partisan than domestic policy. And that is the case in the American system as much as it is in our system. The second thing to say is, yes, there will be differences and there will be areas where we disagree actually, I suspect. In a world where there’s war in Europe, where there’s a tremendous loss of life in the Middle East, where the US and the UK genuinely have a special relationship, where we got someone who’s about to become again the US president who has experience of doing the job last time around, we will forge common interests. We will agree and align on much and, where we disagree, we’ll have those conversations as well, most often in private.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/08/labour-david-lammy-donald-trump-keir-starmer-conservatives	2024-11-08T01:24:46-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bda3538d102be22e8416aef84b457769cb2ea30f/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=498a77c8b42cf360f921223d75bcbea0

Labor’s plan to re-impose ankle bracelet and curfew regime ‘very likely’ to face legal challenge, advocates say	Measure alongside bill to facilitate removal of non-citizens criticised as heavy-handed proposals ‘that interfere with fundamental rights’ Legal challenges against the Albanese government’s plans to re-impose ankle bracelets and curfews on non-citizens released from indefinite immigration detention are -very likely- as the home affairs minister tries to contain the fallout from a scathing high court ruling.

Israel sends rescue planes to Amsterdam after attacks on football fans – Middle East crisis live	Security minister says fans ‘encountered antisemitism and were attacked with unimaginable cruelty just because of their Jewishness’ Hezbollah said it targeted a naval base near the Israeli city of Haifa with missiles, the second such attack in less than 24 hours. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), the group said it targeted the Stella Maris naval base, north west of Haifa, with a missile barrage, -in response to the attacks and massacres committed by the Israeli enemy-. The US state department’s spokesperson, Matthew Miller, has said the US would continue to pursue a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon until the end of President Biden’s term. Miller said: -We will continue to pursue an end to the war in Gaza, an end to the war in Lebanon, a surge of humanitarian assistance [to Gaza], and that is our duty to pursue those policies right up until noon on 20 January when the president-elect takes office.- People in Gaza have been pushed -beyond breaking point- with families, widows and children enduring -almost unparalleled suffering-, according to the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council. Jan Egeland visited Gaza this week and found -scene after scene of absolute despair-, with families torn apart and unable to bury relatives who had died. Israel’s ousted defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has reportedly said the army has achieved all its objectives in Gaza and that Netanyahu rejected a hostages-for-peace deal against the advice of his own security establishment. Gallant was speaking to hostages’ families on Thursday, two days after being sacked by Netanyahu, and reports of his remarks quickly surfaced in Israeli media. Donald Trump will as president give Netanyahu a -blank check- in the Middle East, possibly opening the way for all-out war between Israel and Iran, the former CIA director and US defense secretary Leon Panetta predicted. -With regards to the Middle East, I think he’s basically going to give Netanyahu a blank check,- Panetta said of Trump, who won the presidential election this week and will take office again in January.

First Thing: Harris concedes to Trump but urges supporters to ‘never give up’	Harris calls on her supporters to stay engaged in the fight for US democracy.

Kamala Harris formally conceded the election to Donald Trump on Wednesday, calling on her supporters to -never give up- and to fight for American democracy as he prepared to choose his top team. How many people voted for Trump compared with 2020? The vote count is ongoing – but Trump is expected to hit the 74m votes he won in 2020, while Harris looks set to fail to reach the 81m votes Biden gained in 2020. When will we know?

Trump’s return to White House means abortion rights face new chapter of peril	A nationwide abortion ban could become a reality, and access to other forms of reproductive healthcare are at risk Abortion, the issue thought to be the magic bullet that would mortally wound Donald Trump’s chances at a second presidency, instead failed to stop him on Tuesday. Now, two years after a conservative supermajority on the US supreme court ended federal protections for the procedure, the future of American abortion access is facing a new chapter of extraordinary peril. While seven states passed ballot measures to amend their state constitutions and protect abortion rights, Trump’s return to the White House means those hard-fought efforts may amount to nothing. Despite the gridlock in US Congress, a nationwide abortion ban could soon become a reality: anti-abortion advocates hope that Trump will resurrect a 19th-century anti-vice law to effectively implement a nationwide ban. Access to other forms of reproductive healthcare, such as contraception and in vitro fertilization, are also at risk.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/07/abortion-donald-trump-return-to-white-house	2024-11-07T02:00:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95f1b8bbaadf0f5ccb7d84d23276e0577d3600e9/0_396_8256_4952/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25919f5f5e6ad4598abb68a2a2f6f7ae

Pat McFadden pushes back against Trump alarmism and says ‘fiery’ campaign claims might not happen – UK politics live	Prime minister’s chief fixer says UK relationship with US is strong and will continue with Trump in the White House Good morning. The election of Donald Trump as the next US president will create profound challenges for Labour, and for many governments around the world, and 24 hours on we are starting to get a better sense of how Labour will respond. Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister and Starmer’s lead political -fixer- in government has just finished a media round where he has been talking about almost nothing else. And the strategy that is emerging? Be nice, and hope for the best. Keir Starmer has been working hard to establish a good relationship with Trump since he became PM and we saw more of this last night, when he had his first call with the president-elect. No 10 normally issues a readout when the PM has a call with a foreign leader, and normally these are among the most dry, boring and uninformative press releases to come out of Whitehall. But this is what Downing Street released last night. The prime minister spoke to President-elect Donald Trump this evening to congratulate him on his historic victory. The prime minister offered his hearty congratulations and said he looked forward to working closely with President-elect Trump across all areas of the special relationship. I think in the end the relationship between the two countries is just much deeper than stuff like that … One thing I know as a cabinet member in the British government is the friendship between the United States and the United Kingdom is really important, it’s benefit beneficial for both countries, and it’s in our national interest to maintain that. I think you’ve got to understand that in an election, a lot of fiery things are said, and President-elect Trump says a lot of fiery things, and the important thing is what he actually does. We obviously have interests as a trading nation. We want to protect and look after our interests, and we always want to have a dialogue with the US administration about those.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/07/keir-starmer-labour-donald-trump-uk-politics-latest-live-news	2024-11-07T01:30:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/959469d8e1bb153cb0bbf1c4d7692abe793f4785/360_100_1981_1189/master/1981.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a7b8897fb0e20f273b2540413f636592

Thursday briefing: What lies ahead for the US in a second Trump administration	In today’s newsletter: After winning Tuesday’s election, America’s first convicted president will assemble his transition team – here’s what we know so far about his plans • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. Kamala Harris conceded the US election to Donald Trump overnight. In a speech at Howard University, the vice-president urged supporters not to lose hope, saying -this is a time to organise, to mobilise and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together-. Harris, hoarse from the frenzied campaign that began a little over 100 days ago, contrasted sharply with Trump following his defeat in the 2020 election, which he never formally conceded. Environment | It is -virtually certain- that 2024 will be the hottest year on record, the European Union’s space programme has found. The prognosis comes the week before diplomats meet at the Cop29 climate summit and a day after a majority of voters in the US, the biggest historical emitter of planet-heating gas, chose to make Donald Trump president. Middle East | Many Israelis were reeling after Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to dismiss his popular defence minister, Yoav Gallant, in the midst of a multifront war. The prime minister said he had fired Gallant over what he described a -crisis of trust-. Gallant, a member of Netanyahu’s Likud party and a senior general, has been replaced by the foreign minister, Israel Katz, a Likud lawmaker and loyalist who has little military background. Politics | The Reform UK MP Lee Anderson has apologised after parliament’s watchdog on bullying and harassment told him to do so for telling a security guard who asked for his ID to -fuck off, everyone opens the door to me-. Economy | Rachel Reeves has committed not to increase taxes at Labour’s next budget and said the government would need to -live within the means- of her spending plans if public services came under mounting pressure. Health | Doing just five extra minutes of exercise a day could help lower blood pressure, a study suggests. High blood pressure affects 1.28 billion adults worldwide and is one of the biggest causes of premature death. It can lead to strokes, heart attacks, heart failure, kidney damage and many other health problems, and is often described as a silent killer due to its lack of symptoms.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/07/first-edition-second-trump-administration	2024-11-06T23:11:54-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0ee5cef678f964c3ccdd2d8222c07dbfa1f4dc0/0_47_4633_2779/master/4633.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3ab85795a074d90e89a04f0806e6fcf8
US diplomats brace as Trump plans foreign policy shake-up in wider purge of government	Analysts say it is hard to separate the president-elect’s bluster from his actual plans but it’s clear his priority is to bin many of Joe Biden’s policies The US foreign policy establishment is set for one of the biggest shake-ups in years as Donald Trump has vowed to both revamp US policy abroad and to root out the so-called -deep state- by firing thousands of government workers – including those among the ranks of America’s diplomatic corps. Trump’s electoral victory is also likely to push the Biden administration to speed up efforts to support Ukraine before Trump can cut off military aid, hamper the already-modest efforts to restrain Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu in Gaza and Lebanon and lead to a fresh effort to slash and burn through major parts of US bureaucracy including the state department.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/us-election-donald-trump-foreign-policy-plans-government-purge	2024-11-06T23:00:54-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5dd725b43a6c08954bdabeefd28b33b67da0155/0_83_1886_1132/master/1886.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=94ca88548980e2a7d03861cafb23b72c

Trump sends shock waves around world as he is elected US president | First Thing	Republican nominee told crowd ‘nothing will stop me’ after taking North Carolina, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Plus, Americans explain what decided their vote Good morning. Donald Trump has been elected the 47th president of the United States in a stunning comeback that has sent shock waves around the world, after he secured his path to victory through the country’s battleground states. What does this mean for Trump’s legal woes? It looks like a get-out-jail card as the Trump ally and South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham told special counsel Jack Smith that -it is time to look forward to a new chapter in your legal career- and to -bring these cases to an end-. What about the House of Representatives? That race, where the Republicans were defending a majority, is yet to be called – only 376 of 435 seats had been announced at time of writing.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/first-thing-trump-sends-shock-waves-around-world-as-he-is-elected-us-president	2024-11-06T03:22:40-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efa0137121c9fd231e4920ff34cbeb56227c57a9/0_206_2878_1727/master/2878.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=832b88138a60281c496c2b165bdf485f

The Biden administration had put off imposing any meaningful pressure on the Israeli prime minister until after the election, despite its growing frustration with him on multiple issues: the obstruction of aid into Gaza, his campaign against the UN, his obstruction of a hostage-for-peace deal, and his government’s support for violent West Bank settlers.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/trump-netanyahu-victory-israel-middle-east	2024-11-06T02:55:26-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/655c8c6530d7cad378953338782dfa646261a12b/0_76_2763_1658/master/2763.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=67feada3c83e3485febd6a300291dabc

But many of the public congratulations could do little to disguise the private foreboding of what the next four years will augur for European security, populism and the world economy.

US election 2024 live: Donald Trump on brink of victory as world leaders congratulate likely new president	Former president poised to return to White House after sweeping key early battleground states Donald Trump is poised to win the US presidency after an unexpected sweep through key battleground states. The former president was set for a return to the White House after a contentious election in which democracy itself had been at stake and which is likely to take the United States into uncharted political waters. -This was a movement like nobody’s ever seen before, and frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time. There’s never been anything like this in this country, and maybe beyond. -And now it’s going to reach a new level of importance, because we’re going to help our country. We’ll help our country … we have a country that needs help, and it needs help very badly. We’re going to fix our borders. We’re going to fix everything about our country. And we made history for a reason tonight, and the reason is going to be just that we overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible, and it is now clear that we’ve achieved the most incredible political thing. The swing states still to be called are Wisconsin (10 electoral college votes), Nevada (6), Michigan (15) and Arizona (11). The other states still to be called are Alaska and Maine. Alaska is considered a red state, and its three electoral college votes could deliver Trump the presidency. Missouri, Colorado, New York and Maryland all passed measures to protect abortion rights, while in Florida, an effort to roll back a six-week ban fell short. Republicans have retaken the majority in the Senate, the Associated Press reported, after picking up seats in Ohio and West Virginia, and fending off challenges to their candidates in Texas and Nebraska. Republicans will control Congress’s upper chamber for the first time in four years. Donald Trump will be in a position to confirm his supreme court justices, federal judges and appointees to cabinet posts. The House is still in play, but Republicans hold a strong lead, with 190 representatives to the Democrats’ 168. There were decisive victories for Democrats elsewhere in the election. The US will have two Black women serving as senators for the first time in American history, with the election of Lisa Blunt Rochester from Delaware and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland. Sarah McBride, a Delaware state senator, also made history as the first out transgender person elected to the US House of Representatives. McBride, 34, won Delaware’s at-large House seat in Tuesday’s general election against the Republican candidate John Whalen III, a former Delaware state police officer and businessman. The House seat, Delaware’s only one, has been Democratic since 2010. Trump won in Iowa despite the state’s foremost pollster Ann Selzer on Saturday finding Harris leading by a small amount that was nonetheless within the survey’s margin of error. The finding was viewed as a potential sign of strength for Harris in nearby Wisconsin and Michigan, two swing states that are demographically similar to Iowa. The Trump campaign decried Selzer’s poll as an outlier, which turned out to be the case.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/06/us-presidential-election-2024-donald-trump-kamala-harris-latest-news-updates	2024-11-06T02:30:56-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ff74e8b71b77f4c5200e7ae54c34ee7024d2d6c/0_151_3666_2200/master/3666.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5b7d50bc0e5763c0b4a53e01190c3ce2

As in every election, there were a handful of administrative and technological errors that caused delay for a small numbers of voters. Elections in the United States are administered at the local level, which means that county election offices, often operating on shoestring budgets, are in charge of overseeing the vote.

As Americans appeared poised to return Donald Trump to power, it was her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond, who appeared onstage instead. He tried to strike a note of optimism – there were still votes to be counted. But the scene had echoes of Hillary Clinton’s loss in 2016, when her campaign chairman, not the candidate, came out to address supporters awaiting the result of a presidential election that many hoped would finally shatter the -hardest, highest- glass ceiling.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/kamala-harris-presidential-election-day	2024-11-05T23:18:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ef4c175974eb8f0e9eba7e3fe92b44072e3e8b1/0_233_6987_4194/master/6987.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2463fb46c4db2bdf8143ad7b566b4c64
North Korea’s involvement in Ukraine draws China into a delicate balancing act	The entry of North Korean troops risks a dangerous escalation in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It also puts Beijing in a tight spot In October 1950, barely a year after the Chinese civil war ended, Mao Zedong sent the first Chinese soldiers to fight in the Korean war. Between 180,000 and 400,000 of Chairman Mao’s troops would die in that conflict, including his own son. But it was important to defend North Korea in that battle, Mao reportedly said, because -without the lips, the teeth are cold-. That Chinese idiom has been used to described China and North Korea’s close relationship for more than seven decades. China sees North Korea as a strategic security buffer in the region, while North Korea relies on its superpower neighbour for economic, political and military support. But that relationship is now under strain thanks to another war which is drawing Communist-rooted countries into a common battle.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/06/north-korea-troops-russia-ukraine-war-china-relationship	2024-11-05T23:02:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4b3137b70ce363df72e83c4458acca152f9b522/11_269_1623_974/master/1623.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=83ffd37d20d080ddab46f76c4db95cc4
Wednesday briefing: Trump wins in Georgia and North Carolina put Harris on the brink	In today’s newsletter: A bleak night for Kamala Harris is still developing, with the first swing states called for her opponent and others trending his way, while her party lost control of the Senate • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. The votes are still being counted, and it is not yet possible to call the winner of the race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. But the pattern of votes cast so far suggests that Trump is a very strong favourite to win. He has been called as the winner of key states North Carolina and Georgia. The remaining battlegrounds are not yet decided, but he currently appears on course to win all five of them, and could win the popular vote. While there is still a theoretical path for Harris, it looks very remote. Trump is expected to address his supporters soon. Harris did not appear at her HQ at Howard University, and her campaign told supporters that she would speak on Wednesday morning.

Shomari Figures elected as first congressman in Alabama’s redrawn majority-Black district	Mobile-born Figures, who worked in Obama’s White House, becomes first Black man to hold position since 1832 Tuesday night was a celebratory one for voters in Alabama’s newly redrawn second congressional district two. Shomari Figures, who was born in Mobile, was elected to the US House of Representatives, becoming the first Black person to hold the position since 1832. To some district two residents, Figures’ election is proof that their work to get the district redrawn and to educate voters was worth it. For them, Figures, who worked in Barack Obama’s White House, represents an opportunity for change and progress in the majority-Black district. Voting advocates in and around district two for months had been working to inform voters about the district change. In March, during super Tuesday, some feared their efforts were in vain as voter turnout was low.

Clashes over budget could push Germany’s ailing coalition to collapse	With contradictory proposals unlikely to mesh, leaders to decide whether there is scope for alliance to continue When, in 2021, Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats went into a -traffic light- coalition with the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats, the new government was riding high on an enthusiastic spirit of cooperation. There were promises to modernise, reinvigorate and green-proof Europe’s largest economy. Germany, the coalition partners said, had sleep-walked into a complacent state during 16 years of rule under Angela Merkel. The new trio in power would jolt the country out of its hubris, and deliver it into a new era of vigour and creative transformation.

Kidney disease is one of the well-established health problems linked to PFAS exposure, and the new research suggests changes in gut bacteria and associated metabolites caused by the chemicals seems to be responsible for up to 50% of a decrease in kidney function seen over a four-year period.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/05/pfas-gut-health-kidney-disease	2024-11-05T03:00:49-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cab683877e6c17d34779225395222603feb88a51/0_277_3450_2070/master/3450.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c4f3ad49e1a2588128212ba8a0b20d57
US elections 2024: control of House hangs by thin margin as country votes	While Republicans are looking to expand control of the lower chamber, Democrats need only five seats to win All 435 members of the US House of Representatives face re-election on Tuesday, with Republicans looking to expand their narrow majority after two chaotic years in power. Control of the lower chamber appears to be a true toss-up, as Democrats only need to win five more seats than they did in 2022 to regain their majority. The country may have to wait days to learn who won the House, given that it took more than a week to make that call in 2022, but early results in battlegrounds like North Carolina’s first district and Virginia’s seventh district will give the first clues as to how Americans voted.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/05/house-representatives-elections	2024-11-05T03:00:49-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26d27d6e5c7531bc0bcbd8ac1e25c350acacd1f1/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bbfe1f8b395d1b041b375ff0aa7e6254
Alarm grows over Trump and Musk’s blizzard of baseless voter-fraud claims	Falsehoods swirling on X and other platforms undermine trust and create potential for violence, critics warn Donald Trump and top allies such as the multi-billionaire Elon Musk have created a blizzard of false voting misinformation portraying Democrats as bent on stealing the election, undermining trust in the voting process and leading to potential violence, voting experts and ex-federal prosecutors say.

Tuesday briefing: Hour by hour, what to expect as the results roll in	In today’s newsletter: A guide to what we’ll know, and when – with a serious warning attached: it might drag on for days • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. This time tomorrow, we may know who’s going to be the next president of the United States. Or we may know that we don’t yet know. Or we may know who’s projected to win, but be bracing ourselves for weeks of enervating legal action and protest. It’s going to be that sort of night, I’m afraid. There’s been a bit of a sense in the last few days that momentum has been shifting towards Kamala Harris, but most respected polling dorks are treating that narrative with the same caution they viewed the one before that, which suggested a rush towards Donald Trump. The smart way to approach it is to remember that there is literally no need to make a prediction because we will have actual numbers very soon, and then get into a flotation tank and stick on some Sigur Rós.

Accrual of status credits could be key to Qantas dominance among MPs and public servants, expert says	Since 2010 government travellers have been banned from accepting frequent flyer points for work-related travel. But ban did not extend to status credits The accrual of personal airline status credits by public servants, politicians and their staff travelling for work may influence which carrier they fly with despite rules that insist on the cheapest fare, an expert in aviation loyalty programs says.

The device, reported to have been secreted in shipments of massage pillows and erotic gadgets, started a fire on the ground in Leipzig that was feared to be capable of downing a plane – similar to a package that ignited at a DHL warehouse in Birmingham on 22 July.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/04/incendiary-device-plot-targeting-uk-may-have-been-dry-run-for-us-canada-russia-dhl	2024-11-04T13:03:21-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62040822351297ef59e7c440dc7e594581649c36/0_84_3985_2392/master/3985.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eb6b118359ff8fe3ca3d13b025fdfa9a

Musk-linked Pac accused of targeting Jewish and Arab Americans in swing states	Future Coalition Pac accused of sending the two groups very different messages about Harris’s position on Gaza A political action committees (Pac) linked to Elon Musk are accused of targeting Jewish and Arab American voters in swing states with dramatically different messages about Kamala Harris’s position on Gaza, a strategy by Trump allies aimed at peeling off Democratic support for the vice-president. Texts, mailers, social media ads and billboards targeting heavily Arab American areas in metro Detroit paint Harris as a staunch ally of Israel who will continue supplying arms to the country. Meanwhile, residents in metro Detroit or areas of Pennsylvania with higher Jewish populations have been receiving messaging that underscores her alleged support for the Palestinian cause.

Trump and Harris scramble to win votes in key states in final day of campaigning	Ex-president hurtles through four rallies across three states as vice-president puts focus on Pennsylvania Donald Trump began hurtling through four Maga rallies across three battleground states – and delivered a dark and dystopian speech about the -migrant invasion- of murderers and drug dealers – while Kamala Harris put all her last chips on Pennsylvania in a frantic final day of campaigning from both candidates. With the polls showing the contest essentially deadlocked between two vastly different political visions, both the ex-president and the vice-president were scrambling on Monday to drive home their message.

Badenoch plucks Patel, Jenrick and Stride from the Tories’ tiny gene pool of talent | John Crace	James Cleverly has the right idea – head down and sit tight until KemiKaze crashes and burns of her own accord Just do the maths. There are 120 other Tory MPs from which Kemi Badenoch can select her ministerial team. Or put it another way, there’s about a one in five chance of any MP making it into the shadow cabinet and a near 100% chance of becoming a ministerial bag carrier. These are days of plenty for ambitious young Tory MPs with one eye on their own careers. It just requires a different mindset. There again, not every Tory MP will necessarily want a place in Kemi’s team. James Cleverly very publicly snubbed his new boss at the weekend, saying he’d rather a return to the backbenches than carry on as shadow home secretary. He was fed up with having to defend someone else’s brainless policies. A year in Westminster: John Crace, Marina Hyde and Pippa Crerar.

Starmer to give speech about ‘severity’ of illegal migration threat as Badenoch works on shadow cabinet – UK politics live	Starmer to urge world to ‘wake up’ to severity of illegal migration threat at Glasgow’s Interpol meeting Good morning. Interpol, the International Criminal Police Organisation, which has 196 member countries, has a general assembly and, for the first time in 50 years, it is meeting in Britain. Keir Starmer will address the meeting in Glasgow and he is going to deliver a -wake up- call on illegal migration, saying that the world needs to face up to the scale of the problem and that tackling the problem needs to be internationalised. Britain cannot do it on its own, he implies. According to extracts from the speech released in advance, Starmer will say: The world needs to wake up to the severity of this challenge. I was elected to deliver security for the British people. And strong borders are a part of that. But security doesn’t stop at our borders. There’s nothing progressive about turning a blind eye as men, women and children die in the channel. Keir Starmer’s announcement on tackling gangs will mean absolutely nothing without a deterrent to stop migrants wishing to make the dangerous journey across the channel. It is a shame that Starmer has not recognised the extent of the crisis in the channel sooner, as he and the Labour party voted against numerous measures to stop the gangs while they were in opposition.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/04/keir-starmer-labour-migration-interpol-kemi-badenoch-conservative-shadow-cabinet-uk-politics-latest-news	2024-11-04T01:13:02-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b39c300e275e1478862528408dce89810d5fd1b6/142_0_1905_1144/master/1905.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=94fcab69b1324dec300ceda47020da1a

US election 2024 live: Harris and Trump converge on rust belt as final day of campaigning begins	Democratic and Republican candidates set to blitz rallies in Pennsylvania and Michigan as polls shows race too close to call The Guardian US has been averaging national and state polls to see how the two candidates are faring. Nationally, Kamala Harris has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over Donald Trump, virtually identical to last week. The election will be decided in the seven battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In these states, the polls are too close to call. Kamala Harris pledged to -do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza- in her final rally in Michigan on Sunday, as she attempted to appeal to the state’s large Arab American and Muslim American population two days out from the election. Michigan is home to about 240,000 registered Muslim voters, a majority of whom voted for Joe Biden in 2020, helping him to a narrow victory over Donald Trump. But Arab Americans and Muslim Americans in the state have expressed dissatisfaction over the vice-president’s stance on Israel’s war on Gaza. Harris was making her fourth stop of the day in Michigan, having earlier spoken at a church in Detroit and stopped by a barber shop in Pontiac. Trump is holding his final rally of the campaign in Michigan on Monday night. Donald Trump said he should never have left the White House after his defeat in 2020 and joked darkly he would be fine with reporters getting shot. -We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,- Trump said at a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania. -I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – - he said before abruptly cutting himself off. In other comments, as he denigrated the media, he said: -To get to me, somebody would have to shoot through fake news, and I don’t mind that much, because, I don’t mind. I don’t mind.- Donald Trump again suggested he would give a role on health policy to Robert F Kennedy Jr at a rally in Macon, Georgia. -I told a great guy, RFK Jr., Bobby — I said, ‘Bobby, you work on women’s health, you work on health, you work on what we eat. You work on pesticides. You work on everything,- he said. Kennedy, a well known vaccine sceptic, on Saturday said that the former president would push to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected. Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. The Trump campaign claimed that recent polling by the New York Times and the Des Moines Register is designed to suppress Trump voter turnout by presenting a bleak picture of his re-election prospects. The memo claims that the Times’s polls have biased samples and overrepresent Democratic voters compared with actual voter registration and turnout trends. Trump also disputed a shock Iowa poll that found Kamala Harris leading the former president in the typically red state 47% to 44%. -No President has done more for farmers, and the Great State of Iowa, than Donald J. Trump,- Trump said in a post on the Truth Social network on Sunday morning. -In fact, it’s not even close! All polls, except for one heavily skewed toward the Democrats by a Trump hater who called it totally wrong the last time, have me up, by a lot-.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/04/donald-trump-kamala-harris-us-election-polls-latest-live-news	2024-11-03T23:29:02-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e815e5c6798cc728228e554bba2d75f8ece224e0/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42051860c9e31b2e09bd47bde23ce127

Monday briefing: Can Kemi Badenoch face the past and plot a path for the future?	In today’s newsletter: The new Conservative party leader was announced on Saturday – and must build a credible opposition from a small pool of colleagues in the House of Commons • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. Kemi Badenoch was elected as Conservative leader over the weekend, and now has a window of about two minutes of mainstream attention before the US election devours the entire news agenda. That is not time to plot the next five years in any detail. But it doesn’t take long to observe just how stiff the challenge she faces will be. The contest was billed as a postmortem of the election defeat – but as it played out, we don’t even know in any detail why Badenoch thinks the Tories lost. She said yesterday that the threat of Reform UK was a symptom of her party not being -consistent enough about values- – without being specific about what that would mean in practice. Meanwhile she starts with a reputation as an abrasive media performer who is firmly on the right of her party, and will soon have to decide whether to oppose public spending increases just four months after a landslide defeat. US election | In the final stretch of the presidential race, Donald Trump has said he should never have left the White House after his defeat in 2020 and joked darkly he would be fine with reporters getting shot. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris promised to work to end the war in Gaza as she attempted to appeal to Arab American and Muslim American voters in Michigan. Europe | The pro-western incumbent Maia Sandu has won a second term in office in the Moldovan presidential election, preliminary results have shown, marking a significant boost for the country’s EU aspirations and a clear rebuke to Moscow. Labour | Rachel Reeves has admitted she was wrong to say before the election that no major tax rises would be needed, but promised there was -no need to increase taxes further- after last week’s budget raised £40bn. Spain | Hundreds of people have heckled Spain’s King Felipe and prime minister Pedro Sánchez – throwing mud and shouting -murderers- – as they visited an area in Valencia devastated by last week’s floods. The scenes laid bare the degree of anger among residents who feel abandoned by the authorities. Work | One thousand workers in the UK will get extra time off with no loss of pay in the first official pilot by the four-day week campaign under the Labour government. Amid growing momentum for a shorter working week, the campaign will present its findings in the summer.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/04/monday-briefing-can-kemi-badenoch-face-the-past-and-plot-a-path-for-the-future	2024-11-03T22:51:02-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d94a2121763591fb4386287db03f091f3849602c/0_474_3011_1806/master/3011.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=062143bdc9343b5b7787892bd111595f

Frantic campaigning by Trump amid Iowa poll shock – US election live updates	Republican nominee to hold events in three swing states as the presidential race enters its final hours Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the 2024 US presidential election as we move into the final hours before polls open on Tuesday. It’s set to be a busy day for Donald Trump with appearances in three swing states and it comes amid a surprise setback in Iowa with a poll showing him trailing Kamala Harris in what was previously expected to be a safe state for the Republicans. A Georgia judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person. The lawsuit only targeted Fulton county, a Democratic stronghold. Trump falsely blamed Fulton county workers for his loss of the 2020 election in Georgia. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women’s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration, according to reports on Saturday. Kennedy said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/03/donald-trump-kamala-harris-iowa-poll-us-presidential-election-live	2024-11-03T03:07:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ab42d78dbcf93ae9c981ab6d198002b3590fb47/0_150_3731_2240/master/3731.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d21684c9009ea941002e5349519282ca
Trump aides confident in his chances – but admit results are wildly unknown	Some polls offer promising outlook for Trump in swing states and reveal most believe US is on the wrong track Donald Trump’s aides are bullish about their prospects with their internal polls showing them ahead of his rival Kamala Harris during the final weekend of the campaign before the election, even as they also concede they actually have no idea how America’s election will ultimately break. The confidence is mainly coming from two places: some polls that show the former US president ahead in every battleground state and Republicans holding onto early vote leads in places like Nevada, which they extrapolate to read that the Sun Belt states may be increasingly out of reach for Harris.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/03/trump-aides-election-results-polls	2024-11-03T03:00:43-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16bcdd6f6ac0be12aeef98e1f1e1f265a417ed78/0_278_4415_2650/master/4415.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5fd5bc61dcf89d1c6512fb897bac1879

Civilians and civilian structures, including residential buildings, as well as humanitarian workers and their vehicles, must always be protected in accordance with international humanitarian law.

Did Bidenomics work? How the US economy fared over the last four years	The now-outgoing president inherited a US economy battered by Covid and a looming inflation crisis Joe Biden promised a -recovery for everybody- as he prepared to take over an economy ravaged by the pandemic four years ago. Few predicted what would follow. One of two candidates – Kamala Harris, his vice-president, and Donald Trump, his predecessor – will succeed Biden in January. As millions prepare to elect the next US president, here is how the world’s largest economy fared under Biden.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/joe-biden-economy-analysis	2024-11-02T03:00:12-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17b4a3467b5fa0f4a4de3f27f7a6992c4931b889/37_383_4909_2946/master/4909.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=615fd2101e8a80efbe0f5de9cb43fff0
Dead-heat poll results are astonishing – and improbable, these experts say	It’s possible the tied race reflects not the sentiments of the voters, but rather risk-averse decision-making by pollsters The US presidential election campaign enters its final weekend with polls showing Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in seemingly permanent deadlock and few clues as to which of them will prevail on Tuesday. At the end of another unruly week that began with Trump’s racially charged rally in New York’s Madison Square Guardian and was punctuated by celebrity endorsements, misogynistic comments and insults about -garbage- being levelled left and right, the Guardian’s 10-day polling average tracker showed little change from seven days earlier, with voter loyalty to their chosen candidate appearing relatively impervious to campaign events, however seismic.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/what-polls-mean-so-far-trump-harris-election-voters	2024-11-02T03:00:11-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cc893820e1afed77a6fc82c841558e781c51a70/0_110_3550_2129/master/3550.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=472dc782f0b0788cebdd4897672ad4d4
Middle East crisis live: Iran threatens Israel and US with ‘crushing response’ over Israeli attack	Ayatollah Ali Khamenei spoke as Iranian officials are increasingly threatening to launch yet another strike against Israel In other developments: Israeli airstrikes on Friday killed at least 52 people and injured scores more, the Lebanese health ministry said, while rockets fired from Lebanon fell on Israel on Saturday. Israeli police said 19 people were injured before dawn on Saturday in the central town of Tira. Three projectiles crossed into Israel from Lebanon, Israel’s military said, and some were intercepted. The situation in the northern Gaza Strip is -apocalyptic- as Israel pursues a military offensive against Hamas militants in the area, top United Nations officials have warned. -The entire Palestinian population in north Gaza is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine and violence,- they said in a statement on Friday signed by the heads of UN agencies, including the UN children’s agency Unicef and the World Food Programme, and other aid groups. The US asked Lebanon to declare a unilateral ceasefire to revive stalled talks to end hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, according to a report later denied by the Lebanese prime minister. Two unnamed sources, a Lebanese political source and a senior diplomat, made the claim to Reuters, saying the US envoy, Amos Hochstein, had communicated the proposal to Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, this week.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/02/middle-east-latest-iran-israel-gaza-lebanon-hamas-hezbollah	2024-11-02T02:18:26-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5b72c16f68c81752fdcf60cdceee2a1646edc82/0_51_2168_1301/master/2168.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72fb4d9cde705ec8e4cd418a9a37ab50

Tory leadership election live: Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick await final results	New Conservative party leader will be announced shortly – but James Cleverly says he won’t serve in either’s shadow cabinet Good morning. Conservative party members have chosen a new leader and the winner will be announced shortly after 11am, at an event in London. This has only happened four times before since William Hague changed the rules a quarter of century ago to ensure members, not MPs, take the final decision about who should be leader. The process has not always worked very well – there’s been a failure rate of at least 50%, conventional wisdom would – which is one reason why he thinks his rule change has been a mistake. The two obvious failures were Iain Duncan Smith, who was elected leader in 2001 but replaced after two years after MPs concluded he was not up to the job, and Liz Truss, who only lasted two months. The members’ decision to elect David Cameron in 2005 is generally seen as a good one, because he led his party back into power and won a second, surprise election victory. Members also voted for Boris Johnson in 2019; like Cameron, he also turned out to be an election-winner, but his record as PM was so dire, and caused such lasting reputational damage to the party, that it is arguable that this was a bad choice too.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/02/tory-leadership-election-results-live-kemi-badenoch-robert-jenrick-new-conservative-leader	2024-11-02T01:24:40-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8967386033edf4e3745117f8a59a94a3e99c0b2/469_0_4416_2650/master/4416.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=704a09bef8e31e203a9d80409af7bcf7

Andy Warhol prints stolen and damaged in ‘amateurish’ Dutch gallery heist	Thieves steal two prints and leave two behind after ripping them from their frames as they were too big for their car Thieves blew open the door of an art gallery in the southern Netherlands and stole two works from a famous series of screen prints by Andy Warhol, leaving two others badly damaged in the street as they fled the scene of the botched heist. The gallery’s owner, Mark Peet Visser, said the thieves had attempted to steal all four works from a 1985 series by the US pop artist called Reigning Queens, which features portraits of the then-queens of the UK, the Netherlands, Denmark and Swaziland, which is now called Eswatini.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/01/andy-warhol-prints-stolen-damaged-dutch-gallery-heist	2024-11-01T07:37:37-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cce6d04e5fde03b22faa720af089e78456de3168/0_285_9000_5400/master/9000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d7d52ac5b48218ddc76d1fcacdb29585

Harris v Trump: election campaigns pit the traditionalist against the troll	Harris runs a conventional campaign; Trump sets up viral stunts – a reflection of the voters each are trying to reach Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are making their last-ditch pitches to voters, both criss-crossing the swing states furiously enough to rack up millions of airline points if they were flying commercial – but in other respects running two very different styles of campaign. On Monday last week, Harris was in three battleground states hoping to win over moderate Republicans with a series of traditional campaign events. On the same day, Trump dressed up as a McDonald’s worker to serve French fries in suburban Philadelphia, trolling Harris’s own experience working at McDonald’s franchise in the early 1980s.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/election-harris-trump-campaign	2024-11-01T07:25:23-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09d30f7f6d06c3d76635d99649421e999c1b836e/79_94_2864_1718/master/2864.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bf0da46b926398f27987525d645be7f5

The warnings – from Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans – come as Americans prepare to vote on Tuesday in the most consequential presidential contest in generations.

Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaign in key swing states as electoral race heats up – US politics live	Harris and Trump campaign in key swing states of Arizona and Nevada as only five days remain until election Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the US election. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are locked in a nail-bitingly close US presidential election race. Harris maintains a single point advantage over her Republican rival. As of 30 October, the latest polls put Harris at 47%, and Trump at 46%. Read more from the Guardian’s poll tracker: Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris campaigned in the western part of the US, namely the key swing states of Arizona and Nevada. In her speech, Harris told Nevada: -Make no mistake: we will win.- Adding, -It is time for a new generation of leadership in America … And I am ready to offer that leadership.- During her appearances, Harris repeatedly criticised Trump’s -very offensive- remarks about being the -protector- of women -whether they like it or not-. Harris’s speech was followed by a performance by Jennifer Lopez in Las Vegas, as she seeks to connect with Latino voters in the final days of the race. Trump, meanwhile, appeared with far-right media personality Tucker Carlson in Phoenix, Arizona. Former president Donald Trump launched another attack on former Rep Liz Cheney late Thursday, calling the Republican former Wyoming congresswoman a -war hawk- and suggesting she might not be as willing to send troops to fight if she had guns pointed at her. Cheney has vocally opposed Trump since the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol and has become a surrogate for his Democratic opponent, vice-president Kamala Harris. After calling Cheney -a very dumb individual-, he said: -She’s a radical war hawk. Let’s put her with the rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. OK, let’s see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face.- More than 65 million people have cast their ballots in the race, as of 31 October at 11pm EST.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/01/kamala-harris-donald-trump-swing-states-campaign-us-politics-latest-updates	2024-11-01T03:31:52-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae3e8cac07fab615e8641c3c08199a8e07059f02/0_405_6001_3601/master/6001.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ef092a46dba1b69e5583cc494b7ccddc

Allies see a perfect role for him in advising a new Trump administration crackdown on offshore wind energy.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/trump-presidency-rfk-jr-offshore-wind-climate-crisis	2024-11-01T03:00:44-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58edbebf0bfd0eb1b9df8004912109e4020cbc05/0_229_4343_2605/master/4343.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8cc9cef69e6fe58e22d8d92406e40488
Treasury minister says markets have ‘PTSD’ from Liz Truss’s budget – UK politics live	Darren Jones says ‘markets always respond to budgets’ and says Office for Budget Responsibility reviewed plans as extra borrowing sees markets jitter The UK is in a -very different world- compared with the turmoil which followed Liz Truss’s economic plans, a minister has said as the government seeks to quell post-budget market jitters. The scale of extra borrowing in Rachel Reeves’s budget – around £32bn a year on average – saw yields on government bonds increase as the market responded to the chancellor’s plans. The value of the pound has also fallen against the dollar after Labour’s first budget in more than 14 years. Completely different in contrast to now: We’ve got verified reports from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility that say we meet our fiscal rules earlier than had been planned originally, 2027-2028, that those tough fiscal rules means there is a fiscal consolidation and that strong approach to public spending. We’re in a very, very different world.- Yes, but the question in the manifesto, the promise in the manifesto, was not to increase the rate of tax that employees pay in their payslip. It says that we make a promise to working people, that’s people who go to work and get a payslip, that we will not increase income tax or national insurance.- Rachel Reeves has been warned an extra £9bn of tax rises may be required to avoid a fresh austerity drive in key public services as her record tax-raising budget sent tremors through the financial markets. Threatening to undermine the chancellor’s claim that her budget would restore economic stability to Britain, government borrowing costs rose sharply in the City on Thursday as traders turned on Reeves’s tax and spending measures. Reform UK is facing a schism over its approach to Tommy Robinson’s supporters, after two high-profile party figures said it was wrong to disavow those who went to a weekend rally backing the far-right leader. The Independent Schools Council (ISC) has said it will launch legal action against the government’s decision to impose VAT on independent school fees. The council, which represents more than 1,400 private schools in the UK and abroad, reached its decision after a board meeting held on Thursday. More than half of people expect the number of those living in poverty to have risen by the end of the government’s current term, according to a study. Four in 10 Labour voters expect this to be the case by 2029, the research from King’s College London (KCL) and the Fairness Foundation suggested.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/01/markets-labour-budget-treasury-rachel-reeves-uk-politics-latest-updates	2024-11-01T02:53:10-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/272177df38b9a1de9623cf961299797f6d9b4a4b/0_115_3463_2078/master/3463.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ebddb682014dc0085bdc3a5030ca003

Middle East crisis live: Netanyahu says ability to counter ‘threats’ from Lebanon key to any ceasefire deal	Israeli prime minister reportedly told US envoys that return of displaced people was paramount; Israel resumes strikes on southern Beirut Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. Hochstein and McGurk, met the Israeli prime minister on Thursday to talk about a ceasefire proposal for Lebanon. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said negotiators made -good progress- toward a deal. -We’re hopeful that we will see things transition in Lebanon in a not too distant future,- US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said. Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, who had expressed optimism of a speedy settlement -in hours or days- earlier on Thursday, said that Israel’s -ongoing escalation- in his country -does not inspire optimism-. Netanyahu’s office said the prime minister -made it clear that the main point is not this or that agreement on paper but Israel’s ability and determination to enforce the agreement and thwart any threat to its security from Lebanon, in a manner that will return our residents securely to their homes-. Thursday marked a day when the most civilians in both Israel and Lebanon were killed since October 2023. The Lebanese health ministry said that Israeli attacks had killed 45 people in the previous 24 hours, amid bombing in the north-east Bekaa valley and infantry battles in the south. In one Bekaa village, eight people were killed from the same family. In northern Israel, seven people were killed by rocket fire from Lebanon, including four Thai agricultural workers. The Israeli army’s evacuation call for several areas of south Lebanon on Thursday included a Palestinian refugee camp. Among the areas listed was Rashidieh camp, which houses thousands of Palestinian refugees. Israel issued its second evacuation order for the city of Baalbek and two surrounding villages in the Bekaa valley on Thursday afternoon, carrying out a series of airstrikes on the village of Durous a few hours later. The evacuation orders had prompted a mass exodus of residents from the city, which is home to a Unesco world heritage site. Israeli attacks killed at least one child in Lebanon each day and injured 10 others, the UN children’s agency (Unicef) said. Citing the Lebanese health ministry, Unicef said 166 children have been killed since October 2023, while at least 1,168 have been injured. It awrned that the war in Lebanon is -inflicting severe physical wounds and deep emotional scars- on many of the country’s children. Six Lebanese health workers were killed and four wounded in Israeli strikes across south Lebanon on Thursday, the health ministry said in a statement.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/01/middle-east-crisis-live-netanyahu-says-ability-to-counter-threats-from-lebanon-key-to-any-ceasefire-deal	2024-11-01T00:36:24-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee9c08f7f43b6188701e927508fcb050358f3749/0_520_8640_5184/master/8640.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=72a87105ef31c98932824e23bb56afac

In an election awash in cash, how does a campaign spend a billion dollars?

At a reported $450,000 per day for what is believed to be the first political ad to appear on the futuristic new attraction, it was also one of the most expensive. But even at those rates, it barely made a dent in the staggering election war chest of almost $1bn that Harris has built since replacing Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket this summer.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/election-campaign-spending-breakdown	2024-11-01T00:00:41-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b70c3f2b6428edb01f409688b9e177a396e52810/1_133_3611_2167/master/3611.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=14271f5d717d3ea0f6b535492d2c7a7c

Kamala Harris said time was running out at a get-out-the-vote event yesterday in Madison, Wisconsin, where she was joined by a lineup of folk and pop musicians including Remi Wolf, Gracie Abrams and Mumford &amp; Sons. -We have six days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime,- the vice-president and Democratic nominee told the crowd. Harris responds to protesters. In two different sections of the crowd, protesters drew attention to Israel’s war in Gaza, shouting -free Palestine- and unfurling banners. Harris said: -We all want the war in Gaza to end and get the hostages out as soon as possible, and I will do everything in my power to make it heard and known.- Harris’s slow-mo breakup with president. The delicate dance by Harris’s campaign, simultaneously showing deference to Joe Biden while separating herself from his presidency and thwarting his ambition to campaign for her, has reached a critical juncture.

Sweden abolishes tax on plastic bags despite warnings usage could rise	Levy that reduced usage by more than three-quarters in four years fell victim to rightwing culture wars, say critics A tax that has reduced plastic bag consumption in Sweden by more than three-quarters in four years is being abolished on Friday, despite warnings that the move could lead to usage rising back towards previous levels. Since the introduction of the 3 kroner (£0.21) tax in May 2020, plastic bag usage in the country has slumped. In 2019, before the levy was introduced, people in Sweden used an average of 74 plastic bags (15-50 micrometres thick) per person each year each. In 2023 that number had dropped to 17.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/31/sweden-abolishes-tax-on-plastic-bags-warnings-usage-could-rise	2024-10-31T05:01:47-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6786171c5a57acf224123d93cd9deb3c84f56e1/0_0_6402_3844/master/6402.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40d81f739c088fff55fd75a573218fa4

Business leaders keep quiet on Trump – what are they saying in private?	Experts say top chief executives are treading a fine line to avoid any backlash in the event of a Trump victory After the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, America’s business leaders came out strongly in their criticism of Donald Trump. Now – as the Harris campaign brands Trump a -fascist- and Trump threatens retribution against -the enemy within- – there appears to be a conspiracy of silence. In fact, as the nation heads to the polls in an election that is too close to call, some of America’s most powerful chief executive appear to be cozying up to Trump again.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/31/business-leaders-trump-election	2024-10-31T04:00:16-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f0d030cefd009ab55262db0d05566641ed21dbe/0_34_4465_2679/master/4465.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d373609087801ac4845e7c815fd42930
US election live updates: Trump and Harris head west with six days to go	Data shows almost 60 million Americans have already voted in the election Good morning. It is less than a week before polls close at the 2024 U.S. election and more than 57.5 million Americans have already checked their ballots, according to the Election Lab at the University of Florida. Presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are still hot on the campaign trail in a fiercely contested race that is too close to call. Harris spoke in Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania state capital, one of few counties that voted for Joe Biden in 2020. Polls show a tied race in Pennsylvania. Arnold Schwarzenegger has announced that he is backing Harris in next week’s election. Schwarzenegger, 77, said that while he doesn’t -really do endorsements-, he felt compelled to formally endorse Harris and her pick for vice-president, Tim Walz. Trump refused to apologise for the comments made about Puerto Rico at his Madison Square Garden rally. -He’s a comedian, what can I tell you? I know nothing about him. I don’t know why he’s there.- A Pennsylvania judge on Wednesday sided with Trump’s campaign and agreed to extend an in-person voting option in suburban Philadelphia, where long lines on the final day led to complaints voters were being disfranchised by an unprepared election office. A majority of voters in swing states do not believe Trump will accept defeat if he loses next week’s presidential election and fear that his supporters will turn to violence in an attempt to install him in power, a new poll suggests.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/31/donald-trump-kamala-harris-us-election-latest-updates-live	2024-10-31T03:40:01-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b7b2ee4205458f88898432c673e29191a78d591/0_193_5725_3436/master/5725.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0e39cd51be229b718a71cccedfbd9925

Rachel Reeves accepts budget tax rises may impact wage increases – UK politics live	Chancellor has been appearing on TV and radio defending her budget Good morning. The day after budget day is normally when the most thorough and considered budget analysis starts to emerge, and rarely has there been more to chew over than there was in Rachel Reeves’s first budget as chancellor – a mamoth, £40bn-tax-raising fiscal reset with huge consequences for Britain for the rest of the decade. Reeves and her Tory shadow, Jeremy Hunt, are doing full media rounds this morning, and the leading budget thinktanks are publishing full studies of what was announced yesterday. In an interview with BBC Breakfast, Reeves accepted that people would get lower pay rises as a result of her decision to increase employers’ national insurance. She said: I said that [the national insurance increase] will have consequences. It will mean that businesses will have to absorb some of this through profits and it is likely to mean that wage increases might be slightly less than they otherwise would have been.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/31/rachel-reeves-autumn-budget-labour-tax-rises-uk-politics-latest	2024-10-31T01:09:23-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f56e0bb82e68b5fabd08840adb8c294c8cf1d2d8/0_94_2786_1671/master/2786.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4b0f0af4e19441432bbd07e2031f574b

It was Labour’s first budget in 14 years; it was the first budget ever to be delivered by a female chancellor; and, as a share of GDP, it takes taxes to their highest level since comparable records began. As heavily trailed as Rachel Reeves’s appearance at the dispatch box yesterday was, it was still a monumental political moment, and one that is likely to set the course of the country for many years to come. After weeks of paving the way for a rough budget by blaming her Conservative predecessors for the economic legacy she inherited, Reeves largely struck a more optimistic tone in her delivery. And, by some measures, she has successfully charted a course that will increase growth and balance the books without increasing the burden on those endlessly-discussed -working people- as heavily as had been expected. UK news | Keir Starmer has warned Tory leadership contenders Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch against undermining the police investigation into the Southport attack. Jenrick said information about the attack was -concealed-, while Badenoch said that the government and police -have questions to answer-. Spain | At least 95 people were dead after torrential rains in southern and eastern Spain on Tuesday brought flash floods that raged through towns and cut off roads and railway lines. UK news | The Blur drummer, Dave Rowntree, has attacked the UK law on assisted dying as -psychopathic- as he spoke out for the first time about the choice of his terminally ill ex-wife to take her own life at Dignitas in Switzerland. India | The Canadian government has publicly alleged that India’s home affairs minister, Amit Shah – closest political ally of the prime minister, Narendra Modi – was behind a recent series of plots to murder and intimidate Sikh separatists on Canadian soil. US election | Donald Trump dressed as a sanitation worker and appeared in the cab of a garbage truck in Wisconsin as he sought to capitalise on a gaffe by Joe Biden. Biden appeared to call Trump supporters -garbage- but later said he was referring to a comedian’s -hateful rhetoric- about Puerto Rico at a Trump rally.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/31/thursday-briefing-what-you-need-to-know-about-rachel-reevess-plans-for-the-economy	2024-10-30T23:56:00-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7dc2b90db4d21e3bb106fde6daddaccab0ac06f/0_389_5196_3118/master/5196.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6eff42d73e2c54b8167b8c0a4b661e2a

Australia news live: Greens offer unlimited mental health sessions on Medicare; report finds schools too close to main roads	Under proposal, Greens would remove cap of 10 subsidised mental health sessions a year after it was halved from 20 in late 2022. Follow the day’s news live Up to 55% of schools and childcare centres are unsafely close to main roads in some Australian suburbs, exposing children to deadly car pollution, according to a new report. A Climate Council report, released today, finds that about one in six schools and childcare centres across our capital cities are located within 100 metres of a busy road. That equates to more than 2,300 childcare centres and 827 schools. Let’s give more people in our cities better travel options, so it’s easier for more people to use shared and active means of getting around our cities - like walking, riding a bike, or taking public transport - more often. This will rapidly clean up our neighbourhoods, reduce air and climate pollution at the same time, and create healthier and safer spaces for our kids to thrive in. If you’re putting off mental healthcare because you can’t afford it, you’re not alone ... 1 in 3 big corporations pay no tax. The Greens will make big corporations pay their fair share of tax so you can see a psychologist for free and get unlimited mental health appointments through Medicare.-	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/oct/31/greens-unlimited-mental-health-sessions-medicare-report-schools-roads-politics-labor-coalition-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-qld-vic-nsw-climate-economy	2024-10-30T13:47:34-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/621e72b130476bd8f4efe2dfb1873383c66b72dc/0_227_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b52e48feeb18abbc8e9f48860380ea02

Is Reeves still the green chancellor after her budget? Yes … and no	The fuel duty freeze led to ire, but there were boosts for renewable energy investment and heat decarbonisation So how did Rachel Reeves’ ambition to be the -green chancellor- survive contact with battle in the budget? Reactions are, honestly, mixed. The decision to freeze fuel duty and keep the 5p cut made by the Conservatives in 2022 is attracting some fury, not least because the tax relief is estimated to have raised UK greenhouse gas emissions by 7% since 2010. Reeves has been accused of doing -completely the wrong thing- for climate by making this decision at the same time as raising the bus fare cap from £2 to £3, and rail fares by 4.6%.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/reeves-green-chancellor-budget-climate-environment	2024-10-30T09:37:49-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a744631dd62c1bbb54b5eb06e0817de6209d14e/283_20_3217_1930/master/3217.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=90811cf275b38bea3d7b5ac08f9f0b27

First Thing: Kamala Harris calls for a ‘new generation of leadership’	VP delivers speech from site of Trump’s speech before deadly January 6 attack. Plus, a lost Maya city is found Good morning. With the White House illuminated behind her, Kamala Harris asked the vanishing slice of undecided Americans to elect a -new generation of leadership-, likening Donald Trump to a -petty tyrant- who had stood in the very same spot nearly four years ago and, in a last-gasp effort to cling to power, helped incite the mob that stormed the US Capitol. What was the focus of Harris’s speech? The Democratic nominee’s big speech mentioned Trump by name 24 times and Joe Biden only once. It confirmed that, even when Trump is not commander-in-chief, he still commands the American psyche. Sorry, who did you mean to condemn? Responding to the Trump rally opener calling Puerto Rico an -island of garbage-, Joe Biden got into hot water himself: -The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters’ … his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.- The president later clarified that he was condemning the demonization of Latinos, not calling Trump supporters garbage. The Trump rally on Sunday in New York opened with a series of racist remarks about Puerto Rico, Latinos, Jews and Palestinians. Why did South Carolina pause executions for 13 years? Faced with growing backlash, pharmaceutical companies stopped selling lethal injection drugs to the state, but last year South Carolina passed a shield law to conceal the identity of suppliers.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/30/first-thing-kamala-harris-calls-for-a-new-generation-of-leadership	2024-10-30T05:09:33-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d46b711c4de14f7487eba2a87904d14fbce3152/0_40_3278_1966/master/3278.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fb5b5df244c3f1baf8ba2763e0ce5396

Trump’s threats – singling out ex-speaker Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff and others as -the enemy from within- and -more dangerous than China [and] Russia- – jibe with his earlier incendiary talk of using a return to the White House to seek -revenge- against political foes led by Joe Biden.

Trump’s mass deportation plan would be ‘economic disaster’ for US	Loss of migrant workers would trigger productivity losses and a new round of inflationary pricing pressure If elected, Donald Trump plans to carry out -the largest deportation operation in American history-. After pushback on Joe Biden’s border policies, Kamala Harris has embraced border restrictions and the need to maintain limits on asylum seekers. But neither candidate captures the realities of US immigration. US consumers are accustomed to cheap goods and services, and the economic rationale for large-scale immigration has been largely avoided. In a country that relies on a mobile, low-cost workforce, the loss of migrant workers would trigger productivity losses and a new round of inflationary pricing pressure.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/30/trump-deportation-plan-economic-disaster	2024-10-30T04:00:07-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/317d97f04b9bac3d630dd0deaacb0b74634a0161/0_213_7197_4318/master/7197.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6fe23bc5f38e32788d74c3aaa9cd3d7a

Autumn budget live: major tax rises expected as Rachel Reeves prepares to set out first Labour budget in 15 years	The chancellor will deliver the budget at around 12.30pm GMT, just after PMQs Good morning. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, will today seek to reset the trajectory of public spending and taxation for the rest of this parliament – perhaps for a decade, based on Labour’s pre-election rhetoric – with what is set to be the biggest tax-raising budget in history, at least in cash terms. Larry Elliott and Pippa Crerar preview it here, in our overnight story. In recent years budgets have become two-week news events, with many of the main measures being covertly, or overtly, announced in advanced by the Treasury, instead of being unbundled as a surprise in the hour-long Commons statements. This year that has been happening even more than usual, to the extent that government insiders are saying that there will be no surprises in speech this afternoon. That means that she won’t use her last two minutes to unveil an out-of-the-blue tax cut or spending bonanza destined to grab the news headlines; it doesn’t mean that there won’t be plenty of interesting news in the budget, and things we did not know. With most of the big announcements, we have a broad indication of what’s coming, but not the detail. My belief in Britain burns brighter than ever. And the prize on offer to today is immense. More pounds in people’s pockets. An NHS that is there when you need it. An economy that is growing, creating wealth and opportunity for all. Because that is the only way to improve living standards. [Reeves] will make clear that this budget rejects austerity, instead prioritising economic stability, investment and reform. The budget will ensure funding to cut hospital waiting lists, unlock affordable homes and new investment to rebuild schools. Meanwhile, working people won’t face higher taxes in their payslips in line with the manifesto commitment not to increase taxes on income tax, VAT or employee national insurance. The chancellor will reflect on the tough decisions she has had to make to restore economic stability, on spending and welfare by cracking down on fraud, tax avoidance and waste, and making sure every penny of taxpayer money is spent wisely.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/30/autumn-budget-2024-tax-rachel-reeves-labour	2024-10-30T01:34:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a90fa952722012b5f887c3b1e68bc9754de9e40/134_180_771_463/master/771.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cc91b48d8c820da24daa903fca3c6473

Middle East crisis live: Israeli airstrikes and tank advances reported in Lebanon	Israel hits towns of Sarafand and Haret Saida, says Lebanese health ministry; ‘large number’ of tanks cross Israeli border, local media reports Israeli tanks entered the outskirts of the Lebanese village of Khiam in their deepest incursion yet into southern Lebanon in their ground operation, Lebanese media reported, while the health ministry said at least 14 people were killed in Israeli strikes on the south. The official National News Agency on Tuesday reported the entry of a -large number- of Israeli tanks into the eastern outskirts of the town of Khiam, about 6km from the border with Israel. At least 93 Palestinians were killed or missing and dozens injured in an Israeli strike on a crowded block of flats in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya, the Gaza health ministry said on Tuesday. The US state department called the incident -horrifying-. Medics said at least 20 children were among the dead. -A number of victims are still under the rubble and on the roads, and ambulance and civil defence crews cannot reach them,- the health ministry said. Israel is not addressing the -catastrophic humanitarian crisis- in Gaza, the US envoy to the United Nations told the UN security council. Linda Thomas-Greenfield’s remarks on Tuesday came as a Washington-imposed deadline looms for Israel to improve the situation on the ground in Gaza or face potential restrictions on US military aid. Four Israeli soldiers were killed in combat in northern Gaza, with one officer severely injured, the Israeli military said. Separately, the military said another soldier died from wounds sustained in battle in southern Lebanon, bringing the total number of Israeli soldiers killed since October last year to 777. The UN said that if Israel put in place new laws cutting ties with the UN Palestinian relief agency Unrwa, the Israeli government would have to meet their needs under international law. Secretary general António Guterres said Unrwa would be prevented from doing work mandated by the UN general assembly if Israel implemented the laws, and called on it -to act consistently with its obligations-. He wrote in a letter to Benjamin Netanyahu about the -devastating impact- on Palestinians in the occupied territories if the legislation was implemented, the UN chief’s spokesperson said. The World Health Organization head, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the Israeli parliament’s decision was -intolerable- and would have -devastating consequences-. Norway said it would seek clarification from the international court of justice over Israel’s aid obligations after the Israeli vote on Unrwa. The Israeli UN ambassador said Israel would facilitate humanitarian aid in Gaza but asserted that -Unrwa has failed in its mandate and is no longer the right agency for this job-. Two senior advisers to the US president, Joe Biden, will arrive in Israel on Thursday to try to close a deal that would end the war in Lebanon, Axios reported on Tuesday, citing three unidentified sources. The US news website quoted Israeli and US officials as saying the deal to end Israel-Hezbollah fighting could be achieved within a few weeks. At least 43,061 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and 101,223 injured in Israeli airstrikes since last October, according to the latest figures from the territory’s health ministry on Tuesday. The UN’s World Food Programme called for immediate action to avert famine in northern Gaza. It said north Gaza -continues to deteriorate, the likelihood of a larger group being impacted by famine will surely increase-. In Gaza’s two northern governorates, where about 300,000 people remain trapped, famine was expected to arrive between now and May.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/30/middle-east-israel-gaza-lebanon-hamas-hezbollah	2024-10-30T00:31:36-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec41fe72f48e71a79f02e3bc3ce85c3093bf8c1e/0_50_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eead8b49bdbe6c95e5d492a59538b40a

Wednesday briefing: Five key messages that will define the budget	In today’s newsletter: Labour has told two stories about Rachel Reeves’ budget. Will it be an end to austerity – or an acceptance of -the harsh light of fiscal reality-? • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. There will be no triumphalism, no big giveaways and certainly no rabbits out of hats: this, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have been at pains to tell us, is going to be a very grownup budget. And even though Reeves will promise today that -the prize on offer is immense-, we might also therefore expect it to be a painful one. Since the entire thing appears to have been briefed out in advance over the last few weeks, nobody can say they haven’t been warned.

JD Vance hits out at critics over Trump ‘fascist’ claim	Running mate criticizes Kamala Harris on Michigan campaign trail but avoids mention of Trump rally jokes JD Vance hit back at those who say Donald Trump is a fascist, accusing Kamala Harris and her allies of disrespecting second world war veterans as he campaigned on Tuesday in one of the most hotly contested regions of battleground Michigan.

Mystery artist leaves neo-Nazi tiki torch ‘tribute’ to Trump near White House	Unknown artist who made bronze piece of feces to ‘honor’ January 6 rioters appears to be behind new statue The unknown artist or artists who fashioned a swirled bronze piece of feces on a replica of former US house speaker Nancy Pelosi’s desk – and placed it on the National Mall recently – appear to have struck again. This time, the artistic-political commentary is focused not on the January 6 2021 US Capitol attack carried out by Donald Trump supporters, when a participant did indeed defecate on Pelosi’s desk. Instead, the display satirically evokes the notorious white nationalist Unite the Right Tiki torch parade through Charlottesville’s University of Virginia campus in August 2017, with some marchers chanting -Jews will not replace us-.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/29/neo-nazi-tiki-torch-statue	2024-10-29T10:16:36-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b64749552f4d6baee13ce47442351d081268ebf/0_82_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ae05506c8ec1f41fe4aba5703a44fc3c

Nine days of horror as Israel steps up offensive on exhausted northern Gaza	With families too worn out to flee yet again, the death toll in recent strikes is nearing 300 Israel’s recent offensive in northern Gaza has claimed more than 700 lives in a little over three weeks, with nearly 300 deaths, mainly in the north, in the past nine days alone. While it has attempted to justify its renewed focus on the north by claiming it is targeting regrouped Hamas fighters, the intensity of the fighting has caused heavy losses on the 100,000 civilians still living there. Many of them are families, exhausted by Israel’s multiple forced displacement orders, who have chosen to stay in the north. The Israeli military has repeatedly struck shelters for displaced people across Gaza, saying it is carrying out precise strikes targeting Palestinian militants and has tried to avoid harming civilians. The strikes have often killed women and children. These are the reported deaths in the past nine days:	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/nine-days-of-horror-as-israel-steps-up-offensive-on-exhausted-northern-gaza	2024-10-29T08:52:28-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41d317aaa505eb64e3ba554e946db8049c8ede15/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=593d6a9963f00447c372e787642bf645

When Ukrainian troops freed the city in the autumn of 2022, Sivak was presented with a long list of medical specialists who could help his recovery and asked to tick the ones he needed.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/carved-on-bodies-and-souls-russias-use-of-male-sexual-torture-in-ukraine	2024-10-29T03:05:12-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f193204174bcaba83343845c965171dc391208d1/910_721_1937_1163/master/1937.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e7bdfebad41530fc3d3bf534a30b7a8f
Former British colonies owe ‘debt of gratitude’, says Robert Jenrick	Tory leadership candidate wades into reparations debate, arguing empire brought democratic institutions Britain’s former colonies should be thankful for the legacy of empire, not demanding reparations, according to the Conservative leadership candidate Robert Jenrick.

Private schools can mitigate VAT on fees ‘if they’re the good charities they say they are’, minister says – UK politics live	Wes Streeting says private schools have hiked fees above inflation for over a decade and can prevent pupils leaving if they really are charitable Health secretary Wes Streeting has claimed that the government is already -ramping up- a promised additional 40,000 weekly NHS appointments in England, though he said due to data lag he could not provide precise figures. Speaking on LBC radio, Streeting said it would be a hard winter ahead for the NHS, but that tomorrow’s budget was putting a level of funding in place to arrest a decline in the health service. I will come back on your programme to mark one year of a Labour government and tell you how many more appointments have been delivered in the first year of a Labour government compared to the previous year of Conservative government. And therefore I will be able to confidently tell you that we will have honoured our promise to deliver 40,000 more appointments a week well within the first year of a Labour government. That was the promise we made. It is a promise we will keep. I can’t pretend that there’s a magic wand that I can wave so that no one will be waiting on a trolley in the corridor this winter. And nor am I going to say that is any more acceptable under a Labour government than it was under a Conservative government. I would just say to independent schools, you have hiked your fees up with inflation-busting increases year after year after year since 2010 and now you’re pleading poverty. If you are worried about whether children in your schools will continue to access your schools, you’ll have to cut your cloth in the way that state schools have had to. They have hiked up their fees with inflation-busting increases for well over a decade, and they can, I’m sure, take steps to mitigate against children being forced to drop out if if they’re the good charities they say they are.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/29/autumn-budget-labour-conservatives-keir-starmer-rachel-reeves	2024-10-29T02:03:26-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66df3442af71d38a0a7aefd5f581b8f5cb4bba1e/0_317_7177_4306/master/7177.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=36abfe9baed8fbf05980a384d0b8ccb4
Kamala Harris to urge voters to ‘turn the page’ on era of Trump	Vice-president to strike hopeful tone in remarks delivered from site of Trump’s speech before deadly January 6 attack With the presidential race deadlocked a week before election day, Kamala Harris will call on voters to -turn the page- on the Trump era, in remarks delivered from a park near the White House where the former president spoke before a mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol in a last effort to overturn his 2020 loss. The Harris campaign has described the remarks as a major address that will underline the vice-president’s closing message, in a location she hopes will remind voters precisely why the electorate denied Trump a second term four years ago. She is expected to cast Trump as a divisive figure who will spend his term consumed by vengeance, leveraging the power of the presidency against his political enemies rather than in service of the American people.

If Trump wins the election, Nato can expect more turbulence ahead	Past threats former president – and present Russian ones – have spurred Europe to invest in self-defence, but as conflicts rise the alliance still looks vital Politeness and convention dictate that European leaders try to sound noncommittal when asked whether a Donald Trump presidency would hurt Nato. But despite the rhetoric about -Trump-proofing-, Nato cohesion will be at risk from a hostile or isolationist Republican president, who has previously threatened to leave the alliance if European defence spending did not increase. -The truth is that the US is Nato and Nato is the US; the dependence on America is essentially as big as ever,- said Jamie Shea, a former Nato official who teaches at the University of Exeter. -Take the new Nato command centre to coordinate assistance for Ukraine in Wiesbaden, Germany.

Tuesday briefing: Some Democrats are grimly convinced that Trump is going to win. What does the evidence show?	In today’s newsletter: The polls are neck and neck. So why are some Kamala Harris supporters convinced the Republicans have the election in the bag? • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. With a week to go until America votes, the polls consistently show Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in a statistical dead heat. The nerds who simulate the race hundreds of times to model the likelihood of each result are consistently finding extraordinarily even chances between the two. And nothing that happens – not assassination attempts, Kamalamentum, convention speeches, running mate selections, celebrity endorsements, multi-million-dollar political ads, the debate, erratic rally performances, or plausible accusations of fascist tendencies – seems to change anything for more than a minute. The election, in summary, looks too close to call. Budget | The government is expected to announce an increase of about 4% to NHS funding, an increase that could translate to about £7bn for the health budget in England. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said that the money would deliver more surgical hubs and radiotherapy machines in a drive to add 40,000 appointments each week. Middle East | Israel’s parliament has voted to ban the UN relief and works agency (Unrwa) from the country within 90 days. Alongside a decision to declare Unrwa a terror group, the move is expected to lead to the closure of Unrwa’s East Jerusalem headquarters and would effectively block the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza via Rafah. Crime | The far-right activist Tommy Robinson has been jailed for 18 months for contempt of court for repeating false allegations against a Syrian refugee, in breach of an injunction. Robinson had repeated his false claim that Jamal Hijazi, who had been filmed being attacked at a school in West Yorkshire, -violently attacks young English girls- despite losing a libel case. Justice | Prisoners serving controversial indeterminate sentences were given minimum terms of less than six months but have remained in jail for at least 16 years, newly released data shows. Wildlife | Hedgehogs are now listed as -near threatened- on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s red list, after a decline in numbers of at least 30% over the past decade across much of their range.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/tuesday-briefing-some-democrats-are-grimly-convinced-that-trump-is-going-to-win-what-does-the-evidence-show	2024-10-28T23:51:49-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/768255fc6bbd8f3c926798ee13d11e155138a043/0_341_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2ea226dfe4ba9953f183a4126a05120f

Much of the rhetoric at the evening rally in Ann Arbor, a city synonymous with the University of Michigan and its nearly 53,000-strong student body, was aimed squarely at the first-time voters who have traditionally been a treasure trove of votes for Democrats. Speaking at a city park just south of the university campus, Harris offered comfort to a generation where many view their challenges as existential.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/29/us-election-kamala-harris-michigan-ann-arbor-rally-updates	2024-10-28T20:34:34-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb9021839416f08b1347338c1e9f5af720129c25/0_147_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=034d806ae8c89045b55966991d7ede48

Therapy-speak and 80s hairstyles: will Harris’s Brené Brown sit-down swing white female voters?	The Democrat’s cozy chat with the vulnerability expert was largely apolitical – which could play well with a key demographic In the quest to win over white female voters – 53% of whom showed up for Donald Trump in 2020 – Kamala Harris made her case on a podcast hosted by one of their beloved avatars, the vulnerability researcher Brené Brown. The episode, released on Monday, was a mostly fluffy discussion about leadership, trauma and the notion of voting as agency in an uncontrollable news cycle. Brown, a University of Houston professor and bestselling author who has spent two decades studying social sciences, became an overnight celebrity after giving a 2010 Ted Talk called -the power of vulnerability-. One could argue the talk, which birthed Brown’s Oprah-approved speaking empire, also spawned our culture’s current obsession with therapy-speak.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/28/kamala-harris-brene-brown-interview	2024-10-28T12:48:16-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c6b881abca741c6a410b4c046d0bf6f175d1a06/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=10a3e4e0f41f9b871fb6b2e8dc87396c

Many Republicans take a tough line on China despite their own business ties to Beijing	With Senate control up for grabs in swing states, both parties are trying to stress China’s threat to US economy In testimony to Congress last year, David McCormick, now the Republican candidate for US Senate in Pennsylvania, said that as CEO of Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world, he -held deep reservations- about -the moral and patriotic hazards of doing business in China-. As CNN reported, between 2017 and 2021, such qualms did not stop McCormick overseeing an increase in Bridgewater’s Chinese holdings from $1.6m to $1.77bn. Nor, according to Bloomberg, did Bridgewater flinch from significant investments in companies that supply the Chinese military.

Starmer to set out ‘harsh’ reality of fiscal situation in speech – UK politics live	Prime minister will say government will ignore ‘populist chorus of easy answers’ as it is set to raise taxes and rewrite fiscal rules in this week’s budget Cabinet minister Pat McFadden has said there are -real reasons- to have optimism as the country approaches the first Labour budget for 14 years later this week. He stated that the government had -inherited a plan to decline, to reduce, investment- from Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government, and that the measures Labour were taking in the budget were -tough decisions- but the start of a turnaround. I think people should look for three things in the budget. Will it stabilize the country’s public finances and do so in a way that keeps our promises? It will Will it also start to turn around the public services and the NHS in particular. We will start that road with a combination of both investment and reform. This is not 1997, when the economy was decent but public services were on their knees. And it’s not 2010, where public services were strong, but the public finances were weak. These are unprecedented circumstances. And that’s before we even get to the long-term challenges ignored for 14 years: an economy riddled with weakness on productivity and investment, a state that needs urgent modernisation to face down the challenge of a volatile world. The Conservatives have raised the tax burden to a 70-year high. We will ensure taxes on working people are kept as low as possible. Labour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of income Tax, or VAT.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/28/keir-starmer-budget-harsh-light-fiscal-reality-uk-politics-live	2024-10-28T02:01:33-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71ec316594f542bce47db67efad8890907accb41/1138_0_1932_1159/master/1932.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a0b2f2f17585e73ff7cd41fe493bfc16

Middle East crisis live: Iranian military chief warns Israel of ‘bitter consequences’ over weekend’s airstrikes	Comments from commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps come as country mulls response to attacks Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing coverage of the Middle East crisis amid Israel’s ongoing wars on Lebanon and Gaza. The top commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has warned Israel it would face -bitter consequences- after its attack on Iranian military sites early on Saturday, according to local media reports. Israel’s parliament – the Knesset – is expected to vote on Monday on a pair of bills that, if passed, will make it impossible for the UN relief and works agency for Palestinians (Unrwa) to operate in Gaza and the West Bank. One of the bills seeks to ban Unrwa from operating within Israel’s sovereign territory, stating that the agency -shall not establish any representation, provide any services or conduct any activities within the territory of Israel-. This would lead to closure of the Unrwa headquarters in East Jerusalem and end visas for Unrwa staff. The measures look to have a cross-party majority of about 100 of the 120 members, despite widespread opposition from other countries, including most of Israel’s allies. At least three people were killed and two others injured by Israeli attacks on the Raml neighbourhood in the Lebanese city of Tyre, according to the country’s national news agency.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/28/israel-iran-gaza-lebanon-unrwa-middle-east-crisis-news	2024-10-28T00:47:30-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65650d9fef0c612592bb8d519482cd75fba18d3b/0_211_3185_1912/master/3185.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9aac3362c72b72728b3830a25183bcbc
