Louisiana holds people in prisons past their release date, DoJ lawsuit alleges	State accused of ‘systemic overdetention’ that violates inmates’ rights and costs taxpayers millions of dollars a year Louisiana’s prison system routinely holds people weeks and months after they have completed their sentences, the US justice department alleged in a lawsuit filed on Friday.

Middle East crisis: Israeli strikes kill 17 Palestinians in Gaza – live updates	The strikes came a day after Pope Francis condemned the bombing of children in Gaza as ‘cruelty’ Hello, and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza and developments in the Middle East more widely. Israeli military airstrikes across the Gaza Strip have killed at least 17 Palestinian people, 8 of them at a school sheltering displaced families in Gaza City, medics said. Several people have been injured by Israeli attacks on northern Gaza’s Kamal Adwan hospital, according to Al Jazeera, with Israeli forces reportedly firing directly on the facility’s ICU and maternity ward, as well as at the nearby al-Awda hospital. Hussam Abu Safiya, the director of Kamal Adwan hospital, said the army ordered staff to evacuate the hospital and move patients and injured people toward another hospital in the area. Abu Safiya said the mission was -next to impossible- because staff did not have ambulances to move the patients. -Tonight’s reports of bombardment near Kamal Adwan hospital and order to evacuate the hospital are deeply worrisome. The hospital has been in the midst of fighting for too long and the lives of patients are at risk,- WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote in a post on X late last night. The US military said it mistakenly shot down one of its own fighter aircraft over the Red Sea on Sunday morning, forcing both pilots to eject. Both were rescued, one with minor injuries, after the -apparent case of friendly fire,- which is being investigated, US Central Command said in a statement. The fighter was an F/A-18 Hornet flying off the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman. One of the carrier’s escort ships, the missile cruiser Gettysburg, -mistakenly fired on and hit- the plane, the statement said. The US military carried out airstrikes against a missile storage facility and a command-and-control facility operated by Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen’s capital, Sana’a, on Saturday. The US military’s Central Command said the strikes aimed to -disrupt and degrade- Houthi operations, including attacks against US navy warships and merchant vessels in the southern Red Sea, Bab al-Mandeb and Gulf of Aden. The strike followed a similar attack last week by US aircraft against a command and control facility operated by the Houthis, who control much of Yemen. The US attack on Sana’a came the same day that a Houthi missile struck Israel’s commercial hub Tel Aviv, injuring 16 people in the second such airstrike in days. Turkey has vowed to -do whatever it takes- to ensure its security if the new Syrian administration cannot address Ankara’s concerns about US-allied Kurdish groups it views as terrorist groups, the country’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, said on Saturday. Turkey regards the YPG, the militant group spearheading the US-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants who have fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for 40 years and are deemed terrorists by Ankara, Washington, and the EU. The UN has warned that people living in makeshift shelters might not survive the winter. Nearly 2 million Palestinians have been displaced by Israel’s war on the territory and are struggling to protect themselves from the wind, cold and rain.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/22/middle-east-crisis-israel-airstrikes-gaza-yemen-houthis-latest-updates	2024-12-22T00:38:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/401da4b5622ed52d1a6a4da89df86462c16c3d95/0_0_6195_3719/master/6195.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4c336cad3cfc8424d626bfb1d1d75062

Middle East crisis live: 14 injured after Israel fails to intercept missile from Yemen	Missile fell in the Tel Aviv-Jaffa area leaving 14 people with minor injuries; attack comes days after Israel launched deadly strikes on Yemen Israeli airstrikes killed at least 25 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on Friday, Reuters reports, citing medics. The toll included at least eight in an apartment in the Nuseirat refugee camp and at least 10, including seven children, in the town of Jabalia. Hello, and welcome to our live coverage of developments in the Middle East. The Israeli military said its forces had shot a protester during a demonstration against the army’s activities in a village in southern Syria on Friday, injuring him in the leg. Since Islamist-led rebels toppled Syrian president Bashar al-Assad on 8 December Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes on Syrian military facilities in what it says is a bid to prevent them from falling into hostile hands. In a move widely condemned internationally, Israel also sent troops into a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone in the Golan Heights and beyond, calling it a defensive and temporary measure. Gaza’s civil defence rescue agency reported that an Israeli air strike killed 10 members of a family on Friday in the northern part of the territory, including seven children. Violence in the Gaza Strip continues to rock the coastal territory more than 14 months into the Israel-Hamas war, even as international mediators work to negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas Palestinian militants. The Israeli military told the AFP news agency it had struck -several terrorists who were operating in a military structure belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation and posed a threat to IDF troops operating in the area-. Syria wants to contribute to -regional peace-, the country’s new authorities said late on Friday, after a meeting between leader Ahmed al-Sharaa and a US diplomatic delegation. -The Syrian side indicated that the Syrian people stand at an equal distance from all countries and parties in the region and that Syria rejects any polarisation,- the statement said. It said the new authorities wanted to -affirm Syria’s role in promoting regional peace and building privileged strategic partnerships with countries in the region-. The meeting between al-Sharaa - known previously by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani - and the US delegation led by Barbara Leaf, head of the Middle East at the State Department, was -positive-, a Syrian official previously told AFP. Al-Sharaa, the leader of the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group that seized power in Damascus, was previously the target of US sanctions. But after their first formal contact in Damascus on Friday, Washington announced it had dropped a bounty for his arrest. The Iranian government is attempting to salvage some influence with Syria’s new leaders, as Tehran reels from its sudden loss of authority in Damascus after the collapse of the regime of Bashar al-Assad. The Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, is already facing multiple domestic and international crises, including power cuts due to a lack of oil supplies, continued tensions over its nuclear programme and a row about a new law that will toughen punishments for women who do not wear the hijab.

A wreath laid at Heydar Aliyev’s grave in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, bore three names: Iain McNicol, Labour’s former general secretary, Darren Mott, the former chief executive of the Conservatives, and Tahir Gözel, a prominent local businessman who had paid for the peers’ visit.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/dec/20/uk-peers-lords-free-trips-azerbaijan	2024-12-20T06:00:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ace3b92abe853725fbc8cfa609fcccd15061dc5d/494_0_3041_1824/master/3041.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0d1c0393282664a2d33abbd8863ed7c9
Exclusive: Major Trump donors who complained of immigrant ‘invasion’ used Mexican workers illegally, sources allege	Experts believe the alleged ‘shuttle support’ program used by Uline – a company owned by billionaires Liz and Dick Uihlein – is likely illegal and exploitative of workers A company owned by two of Donald Trump’s top mega-donors has routinely brought dozens of its workers from Mexico to staff its warehouses in Wisconsin and other locations even though they do not appear to have permission to work in the US, according to a Guardian investigation. Uline – a giant Wisconsin-based office and shipping supply company controlled by billionaires Liz and Dick Uihlein – shuttles in its own workers from Mexico, who are using tourist visas and visas meant for employees who are entering the US temporarily to receive professional training, known as B1 visas. But instead of being part of a dedicated training program, the Mexican employees stay for one to six months and – sources with direct knowledge of the matter allege – perform normal work in Uline’s US warehouses.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/20/uline-mexican-workers-trump	2024-12-20T06:00:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dafa69a273e5a33ac004ec41791cd7c04157a85e/0_282_5255_3154/master/5255.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e7f1ff41bca89eef28c311842a0b7abc

Several explosions were reported in Kyiv on Friday around 7am local time.

High profile, high risk: could Mandelson help tame Donald Trump?	Labour veteran Peter Mandelson is the first political appointment as ambassador to Washington in 50 years For some months, Lord Mandelson had been going round London suggesting he had no desire to be appointed to the role of Washington ambassador, saying he would rather not become a hotel manager so late in his career. His feigned lack of interest in shepherding a succession of middle-rank ministers through the 96-year-old recently restored Lutyens building is typical of the smoke and mirrors that has surrounded his potential appointment.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/dec/20/high-profile-high-risk-could-mandelson-help-tame-donald-trump	2024-12-20T05:39:40-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bef8639a1f49f346d8590ea2903eb04c6b07758/0_33_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=17854c802176e3b2cc0626d7ddfbbfc9

More links surface between bankruptcy case under FBI investigation and church reorganization	Some in church case worry whether connections mean they are getting a ‘fair shake’ Links have continued surfacing between a bankruptcy case in Houston that forced a judge there to resign – while thrusting him under FBI investigation – and a contentious, costly financial reorganization being pursued by the clergy abuse-plagued Roman Catholic archdiocese of New Orleans. Perhaps the most notable so far: a portion of a transcript from a March 2023 hearing that until now had largely gone unnoticed shows how – before corruption allegations prompted his resignation – David Jones exalted the wisdom of one of the most tendentious rulings made by fellow bankruptcy judge Meredith Grabill with respect to the New Orleans archdiocese’s chapter 11 reorganization.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/20/houston-church-bankruptcy-new-orleans-archdiocese	2024-12-20T05:00:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28dfcf5fdbdf6034836e8db21666ee4294471918/0_134_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4f632ee18066bbe98f2e987ac916f454

First Thing: US Amazon workers go on their ‘largest’ strike amid holiday rush	Employees at seven facilities including in New York, Atlanta and San Francisco take action. Plus, Elon Musk sinks congressional spending bill Good morning – and happy holidays! This is the last First Thing of 2024. We will be back on 2 January. On Thursday morning, workers at seven Amazon facilities across the country went on strike early during the holiday shopping rush, aiming to pressure the retailer into union contract talks. What are the details of the dispute? The union had given Amazon a 15 December deadline to begin negotiations and warehouse workers had recently voted to authorize a strike. Teamsters says Amazon -fails to pay its workers enough to make ends meet- and has -pushed workers to the limit-, despite -obscene profits-. The company reported above-expected revenue growth in the third quarter, with revenue of $158.9bn, 11% higher than the same period in 2023. How disruptive will the strike be? Amazon said it did not expect any effect on its operations during one of the busiest times of the year. Analysts said the company was unlikely to come to the table to bargain as that could open the door to more union actions. Why? Unions represent only about 1% of the Amazon workforce, with the company – one of America’s largest by market cap – accused of anti-union practices. Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, whose personal wealth Forbes estimates to be $239bn. What is the debt ceiling? Congress is in charge of setting the debt limit, which currently stands at $31.4tn. This limits the amount of money the government can borrow to pay for services such as social security, Medicare and the military. The debt ceiling has been raised 78 times since 1960, under both Democrat and Republican presidents. What happens now? Without action from Congress, a government shutdown looms, starting tomorrow at 12.01am.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/20/first-thing-us-amazon-workers-go-on-their-largest-strike-amid-holiday-rush	2024-12-20T04:31:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b32656c4cf4a2de97a1e0fb29731aaadfbd4cd3c/0_82_5078_3047/master/5078.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dc72e02770854a1ee54a629b0ca3259f

Diplomats welcome Peter Mandelson’s expected appointment as next ambassador to US – UK politics live	Keir Starmer on the verge of appointing Labour grandee to key post at start of Trump presidency Good morning. -I’m reliably informed that I will not be brought back,- Peter Mandelson told a podcast in June, when asked whether he might get a job in a Keir Starmer administration after the election which was then only about a week away. -That has been made absolutely clear. They don’t want any big beasts coming back to mark anyone’s homework.- Let’s hope that in his new job the intelligence he gathers about what is going on in Donald Trump’s administration turns out to a little bit more accurate. One source said that Starmer’s decision to make a political appointment reflected how seriously he takes the UK’s relationship with the US, adding that Mandelson is a -significant figure in his own right-. He’s a big political hitter, well connected in our government, and I think that’s what we need with the Trump administration. He’s very interested in international affairs and foreign policy. And by the way, he is well connected in America.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/20/peter-mandelson-ambassador-us-keir-starmer-labour-uk-politics-latest	2024-12-20T01:30:55-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a589edff6526d4ca0f86c74d7f1e08ed2301e3c/609_121_3123_1875/master/3123.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=236454edb1b3624ba61eb044cafc9ae6
Middle East crisis live: mediators push on with Gaza ceasefire talks amid fresh strikes	Talks in Egypt and Qatar are focused on forging a deal to pause the 14-month-old war and release Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners A senior delegation of US diplomats has arrived in Syria to speak directly to the new Islamist-led rulers, hoping to encourage a moderate, inclusive path and to seek information on missing Americans. It is the first formal US diplomatic mission to Damascus since the early days of the brutal civil war that broke out in 2011 and culminated in a surprise lightning offensive that toppled longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad this month. Israel has launched widespread airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, killing at least nine people in the port city of Hodeidah, and threatened more attacks against the group, which has launched hundreds of missiles at Israel over the past year. There had been reports beforehand that Israel was planning to hit Yemen with force after a recent increase in Houthi attacks, including two in the past week. All references to Syria’s former ruling Ba’ath party will be removed from the country’s education system, the country’s new education minister said. Speaking to Reuters, Nazir Mohammad al-Qadri added that the country’s new leaders will not otherwise change school curricula or restrict the right of girls to learn, saying, -Education is a red line for the Syrian people, more important than food and water … The right to education is not limited to one specific gender. There may be more girls in our schools than boys.- The UK government has said any new Syrian government needs to build a -secure and peaceful- Syria weeks after its president Bashar al-Assad fled the country. Foreign Office minister Anneliese Dodds said British officials had met with the Syrian rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in Damascus and the UK was giving Syria £61m in aid. Thousands of people demonstrated on Thursday in north-east Syria in support of a US-backed, Kurdish-led force that for weeks has been pushing back against Turkey-backed fighters, an AFP correspondent said. The show of support for the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) comes after Islamist-led rebels toppled Syria’s longtime strongman Bashar al-Assad earlier this month. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has accused Israel of -ethnic cleansing- in the Gaza Strip in a report documenting the 14-month conflict published on Thursday. The report documents 41 attacks on MSF staff including airstrikes on health facilities and direct fire on humanitarian convoys, AFP reported. The NGO said it was forced to evacuate hospitals and health centres on 17 occasions. Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia had not been defeated in Syria and that Moscow had made proposals to the new rulers in Damascus over Russia’s military bases there. Putin said he had not yet met with Bashar al-Assad but planned to meet him and said he would ask about the fate of missing US reporter Austin Tice.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/20/middle-east-crisis-live-gaza-ceasefire-talks-fresh-strikes	2024-12-20T00:47:47-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb521c925ffa13fd040c5ff84142eab865e2b43e/0_108_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fe897980a17f3b323383b78b3df9f5da
Russia-Ukraine war live: airstrike on Kyiv following warnings of ballistic missile attack	One killed in attack that reportedly used Kinzhal and Iskander missiles against the Ukrainian capital One person was reported killed on Friday in a Russian missile strike on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, where AFP staff saw smoke rise over parts of the city after a series of explosions. -According to preliminary reports, one person was killed,- the head of the city’s military administration, Sergiy Popko, said on Telegram. Attacks overnight also hit the southeastern city of Kryvyi Rih, badly damaging a two-storey building and injuring six people, according to officials. A man and a teenage girl had been pulled from the rubble and had been hospitalised, the region’s governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded to Putin’s comments about testing a new hypersonic missile above Kyiv -to see what happens-. Zelenskyy said: -Do you think that’s a sane person? Simply scumbags.- Russia has been accused of carrying out a mass cyber-attack on Ukraine’s state registries. Ukrainian deputy prime minister Olha Stefanishyna said on Facebook late on Thursday: -As a result of this targeted attack, the work of the unified and state registries, which are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine, was temporarily suspended.- Stefanishyna said it was clear the attack was -carried out by the Russians to disrupt the work of the country’s critically important infrastructure-. Russia did not immediately comment on the claim. Vladimir Putin has said he was ready to meet Donald Trump and discuss peace proposals as he used a marathon phone-in event to claim that the war in Ukraine had made Russia -much stronger-. The Russian president said during the annual event that Moscow was -ready for negotiations and compromises- to end the fighting, but later he pointed to a maximalist position that would involve keeping Crimea and other occupied territories, Ukraine not joining Nato, and the lifting of sanctions by the west. He also denied that the fall of his key ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria had hurt Moscow’s standing. Zelenskyy said Putin was a fantasiser and accused him of wanting to destroy Ukraine’s army. -He (Putin) is an old fantasiser. He lives in a different world. He lives in his own aquarium I am afraid.- Zelenskyy said he needed both Europe and the United States on board to secure a durable peace, as he huddled with EU leaders at their final summit before Donald Trump’s inauguration. -I believe that the European guarantees won’t be sufficient for Ukraine,- he said after talks with his EU counterparts.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/20/russia-ukraine-war-live-kyiv-airstrike-ballistic-missile-vladimir-putin	2024-12-19T23:58:53-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26cdc5d1cf6022ce18fd68a5299ce33ce6228d99/0_81_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=36db90a9b6d3e53fb6ae6d8b49434eea
Friday briefing: Will the Gisèle Pelicot case finally change how we view violence against women?	In today’s newsletter: For years, Dominique Pelicot drugged his wife and recruited men to rape her. It could be a turning point in social and legal attitudes to sexual assault Good morning. Dominique Pelicot, described as one of France’s worst sex offenders, has been sentenced alongside 50 other men who he recruited to rape his wife, Gisèle Pelicot. Dominique, who was given the maximum sentence possible of 20 years in prison, had been drugging and raping his wife for a decade before he was caught. The scale of the horror and depravity of this case has shocked the world, and reignited conversations around consent and sexual violence. Middle East | Israel has launched widespread airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, killing at least nine people in the port city of Hodeidah, and threatened more attacks against the group, which has launched hundreds of missiles at Israel over the past year. Water | Water bills in England and Wales will rise by 36% over the next five years, as suppliers were accused of forcing struggling households to pay for years of underinvestment to fix leaky pipes and cut pollution. Diplomacy | Peter Mandelson is set to become Britain’s next ambassador to the US, the first time a politician has been appointed to the role for almost half a century. Climate crisis | Potential new North Sea oil and gas fields with early stage licences from the UK would emit as much carbon dioxide as British households produce in three decades. The finding has led to calls to the government to reject demands from fossil fuel producers for the final permits needed to allow their operations to go ahead. Russia | Vladimir Putin said the war in Ukraine had made Russia -much stronger- and denied that the fall of his key ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria had hurt Moscow’s standing, as he held a marathon year-end press conference and television call-in seeking to project confidence at home and abroad.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/20/friday-briefing-will-the-gisele-pelicot-case-finally-change-how-we-view-violence-against-women	2024-12-19T23:00:57-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bda6b67f6264337447c4b2ee5adf7272b1ff8e9c/0_0_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=774eab8955cc87a58f3f16ab9f3f7b72

Inside Aleppo, the city Assad left to rot as a lesson in the price of rising up	A decade on from the Guardian’s last visit, it is clear war has ripped the city apart – but there are signs of positive change Bashar al-Assad’s face has been ripped away from posters at the abandoned checkpoint that separates Sheikh Maqsoud, a neighbourhood in the north of Aleppo, from the rest of the city. No cars dare use the wide boulevard any more because the road is still watched by Kurdish snipers allied to the regime. The units retreated into the warren of bombed and burnt-out buildings when Islamist rebel groups launched an unprecedented attack on the city at the end of November, triggering a chain reaction that led to the swift collapse of the Assad dynasty. Civilians hurry past, some with small children in pushchairs, others rolling cooking gas canisters down the road, all trying not to attract undue attention. A man had been shot and killed here the night before, picked off from the upper floor of a windowless apartment block. Aleppo fell to an umbrella of Sunni Arab factions led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) three weeks ago, but the Kurdish units stationed in sheikh Maqsoud had for years refused to lay down their weapons, afraid of what would happen if they surrendered. Now, they appear to be waiting for something to shift in Syria’s new and fragile status quo.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/20/inside-aleppo-the-city-assad-left-to-rot	2024-12-19T21:00:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ffbcc92d2c2691d35730f61ae438918a1cfe9c6/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3a908b1498eca99ebdd6a2fb6af71cd8

Expert panels usually assess woody, smoky, buttery or caramel aromas, which can help to ensure they don’t vary substantially between batches of the same product.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/19/ai-learns-to-distinguish-between-aromas-of-us-and-scottish-whiskies	2024-12-19T08:00:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7be80e77d110f25563e90ea59deb8b54963db96b/0_122_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6aff38e15142ee842a7c50d1f026387a

Chaos in Congress after Trump rejects spending deal as government shutdown nears – live updates	President-elect torpedoes bipartisan plan with less than 48 hours remaining until government shuts down for holidays Good morning, US politics blog readers. Just yesterday, it seemed like Congress was on the verge of enacting legislation to keep the government running for the next three months and prevent a shutdown that would begin after midnight on Friday. But on X, Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy and other conservatives whose influence grew after Donald Trump won re-election were busy condemning the deal. It was an effort that culminated yesterday afternoon, when the president-elect and JD Vance blew up the negotiations entirely by declaring that the bill should be scrapped and replaced with a new one that also increases country’s debt ceiling – a surprise demand that hadn’t been raised previously. The incoming administration’s opposition blew up the funding compromise, and now it is up to the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, to pick up the pieces, with less than 48 hours remaining until the government shuts down. Needless to say, few in Congress wanted this to happen with the Christmas holiday right around the corner. We’ll find out today if the GOP has it in them to turn the situation around. Here’s what else we are watching today: Democrats appear content to let Republicans own the government funding fiasco, with the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, tweeting that the GOP has -been ordered to shut down the government-. The Wall Street Journal has published a lengthy look into how the White House managed Joe Biden’s public ageing during his presidency and before – which was a major factor in his decision to end his re-election bid earlier this year.

Why do Black women consistently vote Democrat?	No other demographic has maintained the level of voter loyalty for a party as Black women have – experts tell us why For decades, Black women have been the most ardent supporters of the Democratic party. Most recently, in the 2024 election, they voted for Kamala Harris at 92%. Since 1972, Black people’s overall support for Democrats has stayed at about 90% during a presidential election, with Black women voting even more Democratic than Black men. No other demographic has maintained that level of voter loyalty for a political party. Donald Trump’s victory over the vice-president, and success with certain voting blocs such as Latino men and white women, has drawn attention to just how differently situated Black women are when compared with other voters.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/19/why-black-women-vote-democrat	2024-12-19T04:00:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfe617387eebedffd9d3637e69ed449d06eb692e/0_0_7700_4623/master/7700.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c025c68b39e64f57ad981ed2aba179f

Starmer to take questions from liaison committee as No 10 firms up links with incoming Trump administration – UK politics live	Prime minister to be questioned on economy, public services and global affairs as No 10 says he spoke to Trump on the phone on Wednesday Good morning. It is the last day the House of Commons is sitting before the Christmas recess, and the main event will be in a committee room in Portcullis House where Keir Starmer will have his first question session with the liaison committee, the prefects’ club comprising the chairs of all the other Commons select committees. For 90 minutes he will take questions on the economy, public services and global affairs from MPs who know their subjects pretty well. Most of them are Labour MPs, but they include people who have only become select committee chairs because, despite serving on the front bench before the election, they were not appointed ministers, and so it is wrong to assume they are all Starmer loyalists. In theory, 90 minutes of intelligent questioning with the PM should produce a decent amount of news. In the past liaison committee hearings have often failed to get much beyond a rehash of familiar No 10 lines to take, but we live in hope. Relations with the US are almost certain to come up, and Starmer may be asked about an overnight story that suggests Starmer is firming up links with the incoming Donald Trump administration. Yesterday Starmer and Trump spoke on the phone. In its readout, No 10 says: The prime minister began by congratulating President-elect Trump on his recent team appointments and President-elect Trump warmly recounted his meeting with His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in Paris earlier this month. Both agreed on their joint ambition to strengthen the close and historic relationship between the UK and the US. They looked forward to working together on shared priorities, including international security and delivering economic growth and prosperity. Morgan McSweeney travelled to Florida to meet Susie Wiles, the political strategist who masterminded Mr Trump’s re-election campaign and will be his chief of staff in office. Mr McSweeney also had policy discussions in Washington with Mike Waltz, the congressman who has been named as Mr Trump’s next national security adviser. The mood music was very warm. President Trump is nothing but warm about the UK. As the year closes, Team Starmer is confident the UK is in a good position for a strong bilateral relationship with the new presidency.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/19/keir-starmer-questions-liaison-committee-donald-trump-administration-uk-politics-latest-updates	2024-12-19T01:28:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ad911fc8ee3b99d81641bf37755d7a7c5d02c78/41_69_5516_3310/master/5516.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f31ecd6bc8ed6b195b5f106f9e5b83ee
Middle East crisis live: Israel’s ‘long hand’ will reach Houthi leaders, says defence minister	Israel Katz warns leaders of movement after airstrikes hit several areas of Yemen overnight, including power stations near capital Sana’a Hello and welcome to the Middle East crisis live blog. My name is Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news and developments from the region. We start with the news that Israel’s -long hand- will reach the leaders of Yemen’s Houthi movement, its defence minister, Israel Katz, vowed on Thursday, after unleashing airstrikes on several areas of the country overnight. The visiting UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told Agence France-Presse that there is a need for a significant aid boost across Syria after the ousting of Bashar al-Assad. -Across the country, the needs are huge. Seven in 10 people are needing support right now,- Fletcher said, adding, -I want to scale up massively international support, but that now depends on donors. The Syria fund has been historically, shamefully underfunded and now there is this opportunity.- Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said his country and Lebanon would work together on Syria after the overthrow of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad earlier this month. -A new era has now begun in Syria. We agree that we must act together as two important neighbours of Syria,- Erdoğan told a news conference, alongside Lebanese caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati. The Israeli military has ordered another evacuation in central Gaza, even as Israel and Hamas appear to inch closer to a ceasefire agreement. -This is an advance warning ahead of an offensive,- Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee posted on X. The order included four residential block areas in the urban refugee camp of Bureij, where Adraee claimed that Palestinian militants fired rockets toward Israel. UN special envoy Geir Pedersen has called for -free and fair elections- in Syria and urged humanitarian assistance, AFP reports. Addressing reporters at the end of a visit to Damascus, Pedersen said -there is a lot of hope that we can now see the beginning of a new Syria-, which he expressed hope would also include a -political solution- in the Kurdish-held northeast. The US, joined by Arab mediators, is seeking to conclude a long-negotiated ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. A Palestinian official told Reuters earlier today that mediators had narrowed gaps on most of the agreement’s clauses. He said Israel, however, had introduced conditions which Hamas rejected but would not elaborate. At least 45,097 Palestinian people have been killed and 107,244 injured in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said. Of those, 38 Palestinians were killed and 203 injured in the latest 24-hour reporting period, the ministry said.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/19/middle-east-crisis-israel-houthis-yemen-airstrikes-latest-updates	2024-12-19T00:22:49-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da0e4c70c8755fbf3906c8897659c193466985bf/0_251_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9a56fef70d82d1f55b61349eed46c4b9

Russia-Ukraine war live: Zelenskyy says he discussed French troop idea with Macron	Ukrainian leader says presence of forces ‘could contribute to stabilising the path to peace’ Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had held a new discussion with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, on the latter’s proposal to deploy troops in Ukraine as a means to help achieve a stable peace. At least 100 North Koreans deployed to support Russia’s war effort in Ukraine have been killed since entering combat in December, South Korean lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun told reporters on Thursday. Pyongyang has sent thousands of troops to reinforce the Russian military, including to the Kursk border region, where Ukrainian forces seized territory earlier this year. -In December, they [North Korean troops] engaged in actual combat, during which at least 100 fatalities occurred,- Lee said, speaking after a briefing by South Korea’s spy agency. -The National Intelligence Service also reported that the number of injured is expected to reach nearly 1,000.- Despite those losses, the agency also said it had detected signs North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was preparing to train a new special operations force to ship westward. Ukraine struck Russian territory with at least 13 missiles and 84 drones, triggering a fire at the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in the southern Rostov region that burned for hours, Russian officials said on Thursday. Russian air defences shot down 84 drones over Russian regions, including 36 over Rostov region, according to the defence ministry. A Russian missile attack damaged residential buildings and infrastructure in Ukraine’s Sumy and Dnipropetrovsk regions, the Ukrainian military said this morning. There were no immediate reports of causalities. Russia used two Iskander-M ballistic missiles and a Kh-59/69 guided missile in its attack, the air force said. The attack damaged infrastructure, two apartment buildings, a hospital, and a school in Dnipropetrovsk region, its governor Serhiy Lysak said. A missile attack on the northeastern Sumy region damaged nine private residences, regional authorities said. Britain has unveiled £225m (US$286m) in new military aid to Ukraine for next year including drones, boats and air defence systems. The World Bank has approved $2.05bn in funding for Ukraine that includes the first grant from a $20bn US loan fund for Kyiv that is backed by income from frozen Russian sovereign assets.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskyy-french-troop-plan-macron-russia	2024-12-19T00:14:30-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7211c41d680577b246c25aafc79bf2efb53ed05/0_74_3485_2091/master/3485.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ac85b24e2cb0b829c0669f3e9d9f5769

US Senate passes defense bill that raises troop pay and strips trans care for kids of military	Bill authorizes pay raises, strips coverage of trans medical treatments for children and aims to counter China’s power The Senate passed a defense bill on Wednesday that authorizes significant pay raises for junior enlisted service members, aims to counter China’s growing power and boosts overall military spending to $895bn while also stripping coverage of transgender medical treatments for children of military members. The annual defense authorization bill usually gains strong bipartisan support and has not failed to pass Congress in nearly six decades, but the Pentagon policy measure in recent years has become a battleground for cultural issues. Republicans this year sought to tack on to the legislation priorities for social conservatives, contributing to a months-long negotiation over the bill and a falloff in support from Democrats.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/18/senate-defense-spending-bill	2024-12-18T13:03:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4308570ed0be265de416dcfd0d2ce3050c697a7a/604_475_2345_1407/master/2345.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d7cbaf017ab12cba2ad36161c46233f7

Trump warns Liz Cheney ‘could be in a lot of trouble’ after Republicans call for FBI investigation – US politics live	President-elect reacts to House subcommittee report calling for former congresswoman to be investigated over January 6 inquiry Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump stayed up late (or woke up early?) to threaten Liz Cheney, the Republican former congresswoman who lost her seat two years ago after breaking with the president-elect. In a post written shortly after three in the morning, Trump said that Cheney -could be in a lot of trouble- over the findings of a Republican controlled House subcommittee that investigated the now-concluded bipartisan panel that held public hearings into the insurrection two years ago. The Republican subcommittee’s report accuses Cheney of witness tampering, saying, -numerous federal laws were likely broken by- the former congresswoman, and -these violations should be investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.- Those aren’t just empty words, considering Trump has nominated loyalist Kash Patel to lead the FBI, and, based on what Republican senators have said publicly so far, he may get confirmed. Here’s what else is happening today: Congress, and particularly House Republicans, are scrambling to pass a short-term government funding bill to ward off a shutdown that will otherwise begin Friday. As usual, many lawmakers do not like the compromises struck in the draft legislation released by Republican House speaker Mike Johnson, and will no doubt pipe up about it throughout today. The New York Times, which has had a fraught relationship with Joe Biden, has published a comprehensive look at what the president has been up to since Trump won re-election. You will learn that he appears older than ever, and even less willing than usual to entertain reporters. Biden has nothing public on his scheduled today, but is in Delaware to mark the anniversary of the car crash that killed his first wife and daughter.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/dec/18/trump-cheney-january-6-politics-latest-updates	2024-12-18T06:09:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4fe341f0ec9a4ffcdac66675dde9858aef672ab/0_193_5796_3478/master/5796.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=136f53c6db4b0a4119975c87c547e150

US violating law to fund Israel despite alleged human rights abuses, lawsuit says | First Thing	Suit claims state department is deliberately bypassing the Leahy law. Plus, New York grand jury charges Luigi Mangione with first-degree murder Good morning. The US state department is facing a new lawsuit – brought by Palestinians and Palestinian Americans – accusing it of deliberately circumventing a decades-old human rights law by continuing to fund Israeli military units accused of widespread atrocities in the occupied Palestinian territories. What is the Leahy law? Enacted in 1997, it was designed to prohibit US assistance to any security forces that the US identifies as being ineligible due to a gross violation of human rights. But, as one former state official told the Guardian earlier this year: -The rules were different for Israel.- What are the aims of the lawsuit? With the death toll in Gaza since last October reportedly approaching 45,000, humanitarian aid to the territory severely restricted, millions of people displaced and infrastructure decimated, the legal challenge demands judicial intervention to force the US to comply with the law. What happens now? The Kremlin has not yet indicated how it will retaliate. But RIA reported that the former president Dmitry Medvedev, now a senior Russian security official, said Ukraine’s military and political leadership faced revenge. What’s the latest on the frontlines? Russian forces took control of the villages of Trudove and Stari Terny in eastern Ukraine, RIA claimed. Meanwhile, North Korean forces have suffered -several hundred- casualties, according to a senior US military official.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/18/first-thing-us-violating-law-by-funding-israel-despite-alleged-human-rights-abuses-lawsuit-says	2024-12-18T04:51:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c44242eeadb3c26992463de49a18ae5d5e40c011/0_25_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1d11c7d61896aabc2e27020f1f7354e9

Two days into the Gaza war triggered by Hamas’s surprise attack in Israel, it had yet to be hit by Israeli jets. The camp, just north of the city of the same name, was established in 1948. Though technically still a refugee camp, in the ensuing decades it had become largely indistinguishable from the rest of northern Gaza’s urban sprawl – densely populated, vibrant and busy. As well as the large open market at its centre, there were restaurants and schools, two football teams, bakeries and clinics.	https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/dec/18/jabaliya-refugee-camp-gaza-destruction-idf	2024-12-18T03:00:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11876610dd4238e3daf9485f325f781454fc5575/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c9227fb313995069e712b3ffd49086e9

Reeves says compensating Waspi women not ‘best use of taxpayers’ money’ as backlash grows – UK politics live	Chancellor and PM have both defended not to pay compensation to Waspi women Good morning. Keir Starmer is facing his last PMQs of the year and, if he takes a glance at the papers this morning, he will find that he is being attacked by the Tory papers for not implementing a Jeremy Corbyn manifesto promise. Here are two of the headlines about yesterday’s announcement that the government will not compensate the so-called Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) women – women who lost out because they were not properly notified about the planned rise in their state pension age. The Daily Telegraph has not splashed on the story, but it does have it on the front, under the headline -Labour betrays Waspi women with U-turn on pension payouts-. It is true that, when Corbyn was leader, Labour did promise compensation for the Waspi women. But when the parliamentary and health service ombudsman (PHSO) recommended compensation worth up to £10bn in a report earlier this year, Keir Starmer very deliberately did not commit to implementing this, and his manifesto did not promise Waspi compensation.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/18/pmqs-starmer-badenoch-labour-tories-waspi-women	2024-12-18T01:24:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83775e089b50d6b7e285f2b3afddbdeebd2b9a46/0_286_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f17c6aa392ff0b526c87c23be13d8258

Middle East crisis live: hopes for Israel-Gaza ceasefire deal rise as officials express cautious optimism	Israeli negotiating team has travelled to Qatar with Hamas, US and Arab officials all suggesting a deal may be within reach On Tuesday an Israeli negotiating team travelled to Qatar while a report from Reuters – denied by his office and Egypt – said that the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was planning to travel to Cairo for talks. Instead, Netanyahu’s office said he had toured a buffer zone inside Syria that was recently seized by Israeli forces after the fall of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, which he said would remain under Israeli control for the foreseeable future. A ceasefire between Turkey and the U.S.-backed Kurdish Syrian forces (SDF) around the northern Syrian city of Manbij has been extended until the end of this week, state department spokesperson Matthew Miller has said. Washington brokered an initial ceasefire last week after fighting that broke out earlier this month as rebel groups advanced on Damascus and overthrew the rule of Bashar al-Assad. Geir Pedersen, the UN’s special envoy for Syria, however, has warned that the conflict -has not ended-, highlighting the clashes between the Turkish-backed and Kurdish groups. Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Israeli forces will stay in a buffer zone on the Syrian border, seized after the ouster of Syria’s President Bashar Assad, until another arrangement is in place -that ensures Israel’s security.- Netanyahu made the comments from the summit of Mount Hermon about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border with the Israel-held Golan Heights. Israeli lawmakers narrowly approved the country’s 2025 state budget in an initial vote. The 59-57 vote in the Knesset – the Israeli parliament – to pass the wartime austerity budget in its first of three readings. A UN refugee agency official said that about one million Syrian refugees are expected to return to the country in the first six months of 2025, with thousands of people already having returned to the country mostly from Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, said his country’s forces will maintain -security control- over the devastated Gaza Strip, even after the war is over, with Israeli soldiers able to act with -full freedom of action- over the territory. At least 45,059 Palestinian people have been killed and 107,041 injured in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement. Of those, 31 Palestinians were killed and 79 injured in the latest 24-hour reporting period, the ministry said. At least 10 people were confirmed killed in an Israeli airstrike on a house in Gaza City that destroyed the building, while further north in the town of Beit Lahiya at least 15 people were reportedly killed while they were sheltering in a house. Ahmed al-Sharaa, the leader of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group that toppled Assad, said all rebel factions would -be disbanded and the fighters trained to join the ranks of the defence ministry- during a meeting with members of the minority Druze community. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the bloc would send an ambassador back to Damascus. -We are ready to reopen our delegation, which is the European embassy, and we want this to be fully operational again,- she said. Kallas added that the EU would aim to help authorities restore basic services like electricity, water and infrastructure.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/18/israel-gaza-ceasefire-talks-middle-east-netanyahu-hamas-syria-lebanon	2024-12-17T23:44:28-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b0a7032305ea058206289fafd5cb8df94e85d05/0_25_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=01621d4376bf39c66a3c97bd0b6d9fa9

Wednesday briefing: The world waits after Ukraine assassinates top Putin general in Moscow	In today’s newsletter: Kyiv assassinated Igor Kirillov inside enemy territory, in its most audacious operation since the war began – how will Russia respond? Good morning. In the early hours of yesterday morning, Russian general Igor Kirillov and his deputy were killed when a bomb concealed in an e-scooter detonated as they left an apartment. Ukraine’s SBU security service swiftly claimed responsibility for the attack, which stands as one of the most audacious assassinations of a senior Russian military figure since the war began almost three years ago. Russian authorities arrested a 29-year-old citizen of Uzbekistan early today, the news agency Tass reported, citing the FSB, the country’s domestic spy agency.

US voters believe Trump will get more done than Biden – but also trust his government less	Survey finds voters think Trump will be an effective president, but don’t believe his administration will share accurate information Donald Trump won a second White House term in November’s election thanks to voters’ attaching higher priority to having an effective president than one who was trustworthy, fresh polling has suggested. A post-election survey conducted by Scheon Cooperman Research, in conjunction with George Washington University’s graduate school of political management, has concluded that voters believe Trump’s second presidency will be more effective in getting things done – even though they trust his administration less to share accurate information. And Trump not only failed to deliver on some of his more prominent campaign promises during his first term from 2017 to 2021, including a southern US border wall for which Mexico would pay – he also botched the federal response to the deadly Covid-19 pandemic.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/17/trump-biden-effective	2024-12-17T08:35:35-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e68dfd23a1a95270f98bbddb761193eea8938ba/0_27_5717_3429/master/5717.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6f5998789771def1c56597b3d23492d3

Two men had been leaving a residential building when the blast happened. It was 6.12am. One was Lt Gen Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian army’s chemical weapons division. Kirillov was a key player in Moscow’s ruthless war against Ukraine. The other was Kirillov’s assistant. Video shows their last moments as they walked into the street.

‘Ankara is getting what it wants’: how Erdogan’s balancing act in Syria paid off	Turkey tried to stall the HTS rebels’ offensive but has now become Syria’s ‘gateway to the outside world’ Less than a week after the deposed Syrian president Bashar al-Assad fled to Moscow , Turkish officials raised their flag over the embassy in Damascus. While many of the shutters on the palatial villa remained closed, the red and white crescent flew over the embassy rooftop for the first time in 12 years. It was a moment preceded days before by the arrival in the Syrian capital of Turkey’s spy chief, Ibrahim Kalin. In this immediate aftermath of the end of the Assad regime, Kalin rode in a black sedan driven by the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), Ahmed al-Sharaa, who sported civilian dress as he chauffeured Kalin through the crowded streets. The spy chief prayed beneath the hallowed archways of the Umayyad mosque, before emerging to stunned crowds gathered to see the first foreign dignitary to visit the new Syrian leadership.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/17/ankara-is-getting-what-it-wants-how-erdogans-balancing-act-in-syria-paid-off	2024-12-17T06:43:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87f3632f4e3a71944f1708433d1913065ffbdfbf/0_166_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5549b724e3814c61cd6f34648ba47801

Donald Trump calls Canadian PM Justin Trudeau ‘governor’ for second time as he weighs in on deputy PM’s departure – live	President-elect criticizes Chrystia Freeland in social media post after doubling down on tariff pledges on Monday Good morning, US politics blog readers. Since winning re-election last month, Donald Trump has, for reasons that are not clear, taken to calling Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau -governor-. He’s done it in two instances that we can think of, the most recent coming last night, in a post on Truth Social where the president-elect weighed in on the departure from Trudeau’s government of deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland, who had disagreed with Trudeau over how to handle Trump’s threatened economic policies. Without giving examples, the president-elect said -her behavior was totally toxic-, and accused her of standing in the way of a trade deal between the two countries. The -governor- moniker is a strange one to bestow on Trudeau, considering it is both inaccurate, and because the prime minister has made efforts to reach out to Trump, including by dining with him at Mar-a-Lago. Hanging over the two men’s relationship is Trump’s threat to impose steep tariffs on Canada, which Trudeau is trying to convince him not to follow through with. But at a press conference at Mar-a-Lago yesterday, Trump made clear he’s not changing course. -We lose a lot of money to Canada, tremendous amount,- the president-elect said, later adding: -Tariffs will make our country rich.- Kamala Harris will give a speech billed as encouraging young people to be active in their communities in the Washington DC suburbs at 11.35am ET.

US electors to certify Trump’s win in process targeted by fake electors in 2020	It’s unlikely history will repeat itself as electoral college meets in state capitols to formally vote for next president Electors will meet in all 50 states on Tuesday to ratify the second election of Donald Trump to the presidency, a process typically no more than a ceremonial step to the White House for the winner of an election. Usually, it lacks drama. But four years ago on 20 December 2020, Republican activists met in seven states won by Joe Biden – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania – to sign false certificates of ascertainment proclaiming victory for Donald Trump and Mike Pence, to be sent to the National Archives and to Congress.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/17/electoral-college-certifies-votes-trump	2024-12-17T04:00:24-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7764d1b5fb2215f77d2c617a2975df6b60d5b30a/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dd1b012f142c01049d42ddef0ec035c7

First Thing: Russian general killed in Moscow blast as Ukraine claims responsibility	Igor Kirillov was head of the Russian army’s chemical weapons division. Plus, Mitch McConnell warns Trump against isolationism Good morning. The head of the Russian army’s chemical weapons division, Lt Gen Igor Kirillov, was killed on Tuesday when an explosive device attached to a scooter went off outside an apartment building in Moscow. Britain and the US have accused Russia of using the toxic agent chloropicrin against Ukrainian troops. Chloropicrin is an oily liquid with a pungent odour known as a choking agent that was used widely during the first world war. Its use is outlawed by the chemical weapons convention. The killing comes as Russia has gained momentum in the war. Russia has made gains in eastern Ukraine as the Kremlin seeks to secure as much territory as possible before Donald Trump returns to the White House. Follow our live coverage here. Syria’s new leadership hopes to signal to the world that the country can return from diplomatic isolation. The UN envoy to Syria visited Damascus on Monday, meeting Sharaa and the interim prime minister. The envoy urged a -credible and inclusive- transition. Assad’s fall leaves western countries with a dilemma.

Middle East crisis live: Israel says it will maintain ‘security control’ of Gaza after war	IDF will have ‘complete freedom of action’ in Gaza after war has ended, Israel’s defence minister Israel Katz said We are restarting our coverage of the ongoing crisis in the Middle East, with Israel’s war on Gaza continuing and the Syrian rebel groups scrambling to form a transitional government in the wake of the fall of the Assad regime. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, has said his country’s forces will maintain -security control- over the devastated Gaza Strip, even after the war is over, with Israeli soldiers able to act with -full freedom of action- over the territory. After we defeat Hamas’ military and governmental power in Gaza, Israel will have security control over Gaza with full freedom of action, just as it did in Judea and Samaria (an Israeli term for the occupied West Bank). We will not allow any terrorist organization against Israeli communities and Israeli citizens from Gaza. We will not allow a return to the reality of before October 7th. The head of the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism, a UN investigative body, has written to Syria’s new authorities to express a willingness to engage with them and to travel to Syria to secure evidence that could implicate top officials of the former government. -There is now the possibility of accessing evidence of the highest level of (the) regime,- he said. The comments come after the head of a US-based Syrian advocacy organization on Monday said that a mass grave outside of Damascus contained the bodies of at least 100,000 people killed by the former government of ousted President Bashar al-Assad. German diplomats will hold their first talks with representatives of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in Damascus today, focusing on a transitional process for Syria and the protection of minorities, the German foreign ministry said. Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni said her country was ready to engage with Syria’s new leadership after the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad, but urged caution. US President-elect Donald Trump characterised the ousting of Assad as an -unfriendly takeover- by Turkey, which has historically backed the opposition. -I think Turkey is very smart... Turkey did an unfriendly takeover, without a lot of lives being lost. I can say that Assad was a butcher, what he did to children,- Trump told reporters at his residence in Florida. Ahmed al-Sharaa, the leader of the HTS group that toppled Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, said all rebel factions would -be disbanded and the fighters trained to join the ranks of the defence ministry- during a meeting with members of the Druze community.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/17/israel-gaza-war-syria-lebanon-hamas-hezbollah-assad-middle-east-latest	2024-12-17T02:41:43-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/707849c91b6190d86112b7b43d717403dc42217e/0_144_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bbc7b6372a59a4331535b32f07daeaad

Minister says ‘no plans’ to ban smacking in England, despite comment from Sara Sharif’s father – UK politics live	Education secretary Bridget Phillipson tells LBC ‘we’re not intending to legislate around this’ Good morning. The children’s wellbeing and schools bill is being published today and, as Sally Weale reports, it will set out plans to tighten checks on children being educated at home in England. Publication coincides with the sentencing of the killers of 10-year-old Sara Sharif – her father and step-mother – following a trial that revealed details of one of the most shocking cases of child cruelty heard by a British court in years. Sara was taken out of school, and educated at home in the months before her death, even though teachers had started to notice evidence that she was being assaulted at home, and so the legislation – although planned well before the trial – does address one of safeguarding loopholes the Sharif case has highlighted. Too many children have been failed by the state in recent years, it is clear that action is required. So no more lessons learned, no more words. Today we set out our plans to make sure that those agencies are working together and that we have much greater visibility of where children are and what they’re experiencing in their lives. What haunts me the most about Sara’s death is that her father used the words ‘I legally punished my child’, believing this to be a defence to murder. It is unthinkable that any parent or carer could hide behind our legal system to justify such cruelty – and yet, children living in England today have less protection from assault than adults. We’re not intending to legislate around this. I do want to look at the experience in Wales and Scotland where they have legislated to understand what the effect has been. Because what I want to understand is the impact and the effect of the legislation in Wales. They will be setting out the first round of a review into the implications and effect of the legislation that they had introduced. I would like to see that, would like to understand it, and to decide then whether it’s necessary to take further measures here in England.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/17/uk-politics-latest-news-labour-conservatives-keir-starmer	2024-12-17T01:17:48-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ad969a48a4a02233db8159d54137570e7d02ebb/0_153_1795_1077/master/1795.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=00dbcd1ffe5e827f510d180e357705bb

Tuesday briefing: How the UK left 64 asylum seekers stranded on an island in the Indian Ocean	In today’s newsletter: As a judge finds the government unlawfully detained Tamils on Diego Garcia, we look at the geopolitcs that led to them being trapped in ‘hell on earth’ for three years Good morning. In October 2021, a boat carrying dozens of Tamils trying to find their way to Canada sprung a leak. They were rescued by the British navy and brought to Diego Garcia, a tropical island in the middle of the Indian Ocean that was under the control of the British government, and which hosted a US military base. But their saviours became their captors – and they found themselves in rat-infested camps, largely deprived of their liberty and caught in legal limbo with no obvious way out. The authorities on Diego Garcia maintained that the asylum seekers were free to leave whenever they wanted, and that any restrictions on their movements there were lawful and necessary. Yesterday, a judge said that case had -not come close- to being made. She ruled that the asylum seekers had been unlawfully detained in conditions that one of them described as -hell on earth-. The ruling amounts to a crushing defeat for the British government, and a wholesale vindication for an almost forgotten group of people whose fate has been subjugated to geopolitical forces far beyond their control.

Turkey condemns Israel plan to double Golan Heights population	Ankara says plan would ‘seriously undermine’ efforts to bring stability to Syria after Bashar al-Assad’s fall Turkey has denounced Israel’s plan to double the population living in the occupied Golan Heights at the south-western edge of Syria as an attempt to -expand its borders-, as international concern grows over Israel’s actions in Syria since the fall of the Assad regime. Israel captured about two-thirds of the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967 six-day war.

Democrats make last-minute push to add Equal Rights Amendment to US constitution – live	If Joe Biden published the ERA, move could trigger a court fight that would cast a shadow over incoming Trump administration Good morning, US politics blog readers. Dozens of Democratic lawmakers have proposed a novel idea for Joe Biden to secure his presidential legacy in his final weeks in office: decide that the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which protects against sex discrimination, has met the standard for ratification, and have the Archivist of the United States publish the amendment into the constitution. The proposal was approved by the US House and Senate in the early 1970s but a conservative backlash prevented it from being ratified by the necessary two-thirds of states by a 1982 deadline congress had set. In the years since, several states have voted to approve the amendment, and in a letter to Biden sent over the weekend, more than 120 House Democrats argued that the ERA has met the requirements, and should be added to the constitution as the 28th amendment, and the first since 1992. The subtext here is Donald Trump’s impending arrival in the White House, and the likelihood that Biden publishing the ERA would trigger a court fight that casts a shadow over the newly arrived president, particularly since he is viewed as politically vulnerable among women. We’ll tell you more about the ERA push today. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the anti-vaccine activist Trump has named to lead the health and human services department, is heading to Capitol Hill to meet with Republican senators throughout the day. Biden will at 12.15pm hold an event at the labor department to promote his administration’s efforts to help American workers, then convene a Hanukkah reception at 7.45pm. Syrian diplomats and community leaders plan to today hoist the flag of -Free Syria- at its Washington DC embassy, which has been closed since 2014.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/dec/16/biden-trump-latest-equal-rights-amendment-push-democrats	2024-12-16T06:06:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77526c124f296d0f4c344c1ad91ea9217ebeab02/0_0_5122_3074/master/5122.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=76d54db8aeb17afee5129d192ecd46d5

Assad uncle used Guernsey adviser to secretly manage vast wealth	Rifaat al-Assad, the ‘Butcher of Hama’, identified as client of consultant who received ban and fine this year An uncle of the recently ousted Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad used an adviser in Guernsey to secretly manage his wealth, which included a vast European property empire worth hundreds of millions of euros that prosecutors claim was acquired with funds looted from the wartorn state. Rifaat al-Assad, known as the -Butcher of Hama- for overseeing the violent suppression of a rebellion in the 1980s, has been accused of war crimes by Swiss prosecutors. In 2020, he was convicted by a French court of embezzling Syrian state funds and pouring the money into luxury properties, with the French state seizing assets worth €90m. The Witanhurst estate in Highgate, north London – the second largest private residence in the capital after Buckingham Palace. Rifaat sold it for £32m to developers in 2007 after leaving it in disrepair. A £50m mansion in South Street, Mayfair. Owned through a shell company in the British Virgin Islands, it was frozen by British proceeds of crime prosecutors in 2017. A seven-bedroom, seven-bathroom estate in Leatherhead, Surrey, with a gym, tennis court and indoor swimming pool. It was sold for £4m in 2016 before prosecutors could impose an asset freeze. A seven-storey mansion on Avenue Foch, which leads to the Arc de Triomphe in the most expensive arrondissement of Paris. Art and furnishings from the property were auctioned but the property itself remains frozen. Thirty-two apartments in Paris’s Avenue du Président Kennedy, which runs along the bank of the Seine next to the Eiffel Tower. La Máquina, a €60m estate occupying almost a third of the entire Marbella resort town of Benahavís. La Máquina’s footprint is so expansive that the Assads were reported to have considered transforming it into an enclave exclusively for wealthy Syrians.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/16/assad-uncle-used-guernsey-adviser-to-secretly-manage-vast-wealth	2024-12-16T06:00:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d82da064c47585b6d46a70621835c0b6fd8be51d/1776_23_1582_949/master/1582.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f2a007df0fd34a08e3297ee117b1df71

Germany: parliament to declare no confidence in chancellor Olaf Scholz – live	Chancellor triggered path to elections, due to take place on 23 February, by firing finance minister Christian Lindner last month Scholz, who is deeply unpopular, will begin the session at 1pm CET with a short speech presenting his reasons for calling the confidence motion. He will be the fifth chancellor to use the measure as laid out in Article 68 of Germany’s Basic Law since the second world war – Angela Merkel was a rare exception in never using it despite her 16 years in power through many a crisis. About 90 minutes of debate will follow. If all goes according to Scholz’s plan, a majority of MPs will vote against Scholz and he can go to president Frank-Walter Steinmeier at Bellevue Palace in central Berlin, recommending that the head of state dissolve the current Bundestag and clear the way for a general election. Steinmeier will have 21 days to take his decision, during which he will consult with the leaders of the various parliamentary groups. If he agrees to dissolve the Bundestag, an election would have to be held within 60 days, thus clearing the way to the 23 February poll.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/16/germany-parliament-no-confidence-olaf-scholz-chancellor-latest-updates	2024-12-16T03:39:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e59f61d0314cfda06f84c032768ceb4d26b2cd4/0_215_4724_2833/master/4724.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7cbaad78d484daa4b19a8371ceee4652

He justified expanding Israeli settlements in the occupied Golan Heights -in light of the war and the new front facing Syria- and a desire to double the Israeli population in the area. -We will continue to hold on to it, cause it to blossom and settle in it,- he said.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/16/first-thing-israel-strikes-syria-netanyahu-approves-settlement-expansion	2024-12-16T03:32:35-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb75ef23be46e886d273963569a782d1337701d6/0_208_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b48ba56c69122d3ba54ea5eca65b9d76
US seeks stronger UN powers to intercept Red Sea shipments to Yemen’s Houthis	Pentagon also considering redesignating Iranian-backed Houthis as terrorist group The US is seeking global support to give the UN clearer powers to interdict ships in the Red Sea heading for Houthi-controlled Yemen ports, as part of a concerted bid to weaken the Iranian-backed group, according to the US special envoy.

Monday briefing: What do we know about Prince Andrew and the alleged Chinese spy?	In today’s newsletter: Many questions remain unanswered about the person known only as H6, but the complex relationship between China and the UK is sure to be put under the spotlight Good morning. Espionage is an obviously mysterious business, but there can be fewer greater puzzles in the annals of national security than the one that has arisen in the last few days. If you were the mighty Chinese state, and making a list of British public figures who might hold useful intelligence or influence, what would make you put Prince Andrew on it? I can’t answer that one. But many other questions besides have arisen since it emerged that a businessman and alleged Chinese spy with links to Andrew has been barred from entering the UK on national security grounds – and last night, MPs raised fears that the case shows that the UK has been too eager to strengthen UK-China relations. Today’s newsletter explains what we know. Here are the headlines. Ireland | Israel has announced it will close its embassy in Ireland, citing Dublin’s decision last week to support a petition at the international court of justice accusing Israel of genocide. Irish taoiseach Simon Harris called the move -deeply regrettable-. Economy | Fifty economists and policy experts have issued a warning to Rachel Reeves that encouraging the city to expand could threaten financial stability and jeopardise growth. The chancellor has claimed that regulations imposed after the global financial crisis have -gone too far-. Extreme weather | At least several hundred people are feared to have been killed after the worst cyclone in almost a century ripped through the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte on Saturday. Officials said the final toll would be hard to ascertain but could be in the thousands. Immigration and asylum | Syrian asylum seekers left in limbo after the UK home secretary said the government was pausing their claims have called the decision -cruel- and urged officials to resume processing their cases. About 6,500 cases are now in the system.

‘Celebrating the unknown’: Syrian Alawites fear for future under rebel rule	Minority Islamic sect associated with overthrown Assad regime waits to see how threats of revenge will play out To prepare khubeiza, the leaves of the kale-like plant must be roughly chopped and sauteed with onions, garlic and a dash of salt. Folklore says that the recipe originated among the Alawite communities who lived in Syria’s mountainous coastline where the fibrous, wild-growing plant can be found in abundance. So poor were the Alawites during Ottoman times, the story goes, that the only food they could find to eat was khubeiza, which sprouts like a stubborn weed every spring. When Hafez al-Assad, a member of the minority Islamic Alawite sect, seized the reins of power in 1971, he promised to lift the neglected community out of its poverty and end its hunger.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/15/celebrating-the-unknown-syrian-alawites-fear-for-future-under-rebel-rule	2024-12-15T05:52:14-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba91f0597f2f49153498aa299fda8c5aee4963c0/0_327_4902_2941/master/4902.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2d5c7ae847959dc10e9860e3030f5615

Prince Andrew may have been a victim of Chairman Mao’s ‘magic weapon’ | Isabel Hilton	The United Front Work Department aims to befriend, bribe and seduce ‘useful idiots’. Was Andrew caught up in its net? The late Chairman Mao, China’s former supreme leader, once called the United Front Work Department (UFWD) one of the three -magic weapons- of the Chinese Communist party (CCP). That the other two were the People’s Liberation Army and the party’s propaganda arm signals how central the UFWD has been to the CCP’s efforts for nearly a century. The operation involving Andrew must count as one of its more unusual achievements. The UFWD’s job began as neutralising potentially hostile actors at home. As China has expanded into the world, it has increasingly taken on the international challenge of befriending, bribing or otherwise seducing figures of influence who can be won over to China’s cause. Such elite figures can become both useful sources of information and agents of influence who can be invited to smooth away any hostility or suspicions that might otherwise get in the way of the CCP’s ambition.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/14/prince-andrew-chairman-mao-united-work-front-department	2024-12-14T11:04:48-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d61d687319f7a344e7b2ee9949ae4bcec7a9c2c/338_541_2222_1333/master/2222.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3acfe2612f0a168ce5f17dee46098835

Trump-linked officials consider targeting banking regulators and polio vaccine, reports say – US politics live	President-elect’s team reportedly exploring ways to downsize or combine key bodies; RFK Jr adviser challenges approvals of polio and other vaccines Good morning, US politics blog readers. We have fewer than 40 days to go until Donald Trump is inaugurated president of the United States, and more signs are emerging of how he might follow through on his plans to transform the country. The New York Times reports that Aaron Siri, a lawyer who has filed petitions challenging the approvals of vaccines against polio and several other diseases, has been by health and human services secretary nominee Robert F Kennedy Jr’s side as he has interviewed candidates for jobs in the department. It’s yet more evidence that, if he is confirmed, Kennedy could insert his discredited anti-vaccine views into the government. The Wall Street Journal reports that Trump’s transition team is exploring ways to downside or combine major banking regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a key stabilizer of the sector that was created in the wake of the Great Depression. While the country has come a long way since that era-defining financial crisis, bank collapses still happen, and expect tons of pushback if the second Trump administration follows through on the plan. Joe Biden is starting his day early, with a virtual meeting of G7 countries at 9.30am ET. House Republicans announced their committee chairs for the next Congress.

Trump’s FBI pick Kash Patel locks down Senate support as Wray prepares to quit	Seen as a controversial nominee, Patel is acquiring senate judiciary committee support for confirmation Donald Trump’s nominee for FBI director, Kash Patel, has broadly locked down support from Republicans on the Senate judiciary committee, paving the way for his confirmation to the role after the current director announced his intention to resign when the president-elect takes office in January. The idea of securing support from the judiciary committee, according to two people familiar with the matter, is that if the committee reports out his nomination perhaps unanimously, it would make it politically harder for any skeptical Republicans to oppose him later.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/13/fbi-kash-patel-senate-support	2024-12-13T02:00:44-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e8e3c70393d83a31bdd8546179d80bdafac12de/864_0_4486_2693/master/4486.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=24624c62dc637a8d46d0c2aaebb21a9b

‘The water war’: how drought threatens survival of Sicily’s towns	Amid Italian island’s worst drought, towns such as Troina are fighting for survival as supplies run dry and tensions rise An ancient Sicilian proverb goes like this: -When water to two fountains flows, one will stay dry – that’s how it goes.- The residents of the small town of Troina in the heart of Sicily, struck by a long and unprecedented drought, perhaps understand its meaning better than anyone else. When authorities decreed that the little water left in their dam should be shared with the villages of another province, they took action, and, on 30 November, occupied the distribution centre of the reservoir, blocking access. -It’s a war between the poor; we are aware of it,- says Salvatore Giamblanco, 66, owner of a bed and breakfast in Troina. -But we had no other choice. The dam is drying up. We have difficulty finding water for ourselves. I had to cancel numerous reservations due to the lack of water. If we also have to share what little we have with other towns, we will all be left dry.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/13/the-water-war-how-drought-threatens-survival-of-sicilys-towns	2024-12-13T02:00:43-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95923b36770d9692822b3b5b0777f362ba4a1a0d/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=23c65d5e918e34934ca4c9a6a83fe320
Middle East crisis live: rebel leader urges Syrians to take to the streets to celebrate ‘revolution’	Leader of Islamist rebels that ousted Assad says people should ‘express their joy’ after Friday prayers Hello, welcome to our live coverage of events in Syria and around the Middle East. It’s a little after noon in Damascus. Here are the major developments: The US secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, is wrapping up a visit to Turkey as part of a broader effort to rally support across the Middle East for a peaceful political transition in Syria. The US administration is worried that a power vacuum in Syria could worsen tensions in the region, already heightened by multiple conflicts, and create conditions for the Islamic State group to regain territory and influence. Blinken said Friday that there’s broad agreement on what both Turkey and the US would like to see in Syria following concerns about the two NATO allies’ competing interests in Syria, as Turkey targets a US-backed Kurdish group seen as key to containing the extremists. Blinken also said he saw -encouraging signs- of progress toward a ceasefire in Gaza and urged Turkey to use its influence to encourage Hamas to accept. -We discussed Gaza, and we discussed I think the opportunity... to get a ceasefire in place. And what we’ve seen in the last couple of weeks are more encouraging signs that that is possible,- Blinken told reporters. G7 leaders are set to gather virtually on Friday afternoon to discuss Syria. The leaders have said they are prepared to support a transition to an -inclusive and non-sectarian- government, and emphasised -the importance of holding the Assad regime accountable for its crimes.- Russia has also reportedly established direct contact with the political committee of Syria’s Islamist rebel group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, according to the Interfax news agency, which quoted Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Mikhail Bogdanov. In comments to reporters, Bogdanov reportedly said Moscow aims to maintain its military bases in Syria. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, has ordered the military to -prepare to remain- throughout the winter in the UN-patrolled buffer zone between Israeli and Syrian forces on the strategic Golan Heights. Israel seized the demilitarised zone on Sunday, hours after Syrian rebels ousted Bashar al-Assad. In the US, a former Syrian military official who oversaw a prison where alleged human rights abuses took place has been charged by a federal grand jury with several counts of torture and conspiracy to commit a crime. Samir Ousman al-Sheikh, who oversaw Syria’s infamous Adra Prison from 2005 to 2008 under recently ousted President Bashar Assad, was arrested in July on visa fraud charges.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/13/middle-east-crisis-live-syria-gaza-israel-lebanon-latest-updates	2024-12-13T01:34:56-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/872b7df3148c641a41f48cff9e45d287c772ca68/0_194_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b0fe2d5a0755b2831f7f313e1667a5cf

Biden issues mass clemencies and says more may come before end of presidency – US politics live	President has commuted the sentences of nearly 1,500 people and issued pardons to 39 others in largest single-day act of clemency in US history Good morning, US politics blog readers. Joe Biden has commuted the sentences of nearly 1,500 people and issued pardons to 39 others, a sweeping exercise of his presidential powers in his final weeks in the White House. The clemencies – the largest single-day act in US history – are targeted at people who have been serving their sentences in home confinement under the pandemic-era Cares Act, while the pardons are for people convicted of non-violent crimes who -have turned their lives around-, the White House said. It is typical for presidents to commute sentences and issue pardons as they complete their terms, but even though Biden is casting this as a historic act of mercy, his decision last week to pardon his son, Hunter Biden, casts a bit of a shadow over it. The younger Biden was facing sentencing over tax evasion and gun charges, but the president opted to pardon him, saying he had been unjustly prosecuted, and could be further harassed once Donald Trump takes office. When it comes to clemencies, Biden says he’s not finished, and may issue more in the weeks left in his term. We will let you know if we get any hint at who those might affect. Trump appointed Kari Lake, a Republican former candidate for governor and senator in Arizona, as director of Voice of America. VOA is a US-government supported global news agency, and Lake is best known nationally not just for her twin failed bids for office, but refusing to acknowledge her defeat in the governor’s race two years ago. Xi Jinping, China’s president, has been invited to Trump’s inauguration next month, CBS News reports. No Chinese leader has ever attended a US presidential inauguration, but many incoming Trump administration officials view China as a rival and national security threat. Time Magazine named Trump its -person of the year-. It’s his second time picking up the accolade, after first getting it in 2016.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/dec/12/biden-clemency-trump-us-politics-updates	2024-12-12T05:50:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0206d2e3f59ae7610127f3340ed524f405bb42a3/1687_944_6145_3687/master/6145.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=10f580360b4b4c6f59f86d80d20d5be5

Middle East crisis live: Syria’s rebel leader vows retribution against Assad officials; Blinken heads to the region	Abu Mohammed al-Jolani says those behind the country’s notorious prison system will not evade justice Hello, welcome to our live coverage of events in Syria and around the Middle East. It’s a little after 10am in Damascus and here are the major developments. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is headed for Jordan and Turkey on Thursday, where he is expected to rally regional countries to help advance efforts to reach an elusive Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal, and ensure a smooth transition in Syria, after the ousting of longtime authoritarian ruler Bashar al-Assad. His national security adviser Jake Sullivan is also scheduled to visit Israel, Qatar and Egypt in the coming days, US officials said. Syria’s rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani has signalled he is seeking retribution, saying there will be no pardons for prison torturers. The rebel commander has vowed to dissolve Assad regime security forces, close its prisons and hunt down anyone involved in the torture or killing of detainees. He also said he would ask countries to hand over Assad regime officials who have fled the country. At the Masnaa border crossing to Lebanon on Wednesday night, thousands of Syrians were trying to leave the country despite assurances from Jolani’s group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) that civil rights and sectarian differences will be respected. Rebel fighters appeared to be searching for members of the regime army and security services trying to get to Lebanon with their families. Syrian refugees residing in countries such as Turkey, have also been lining up at the border to return home. Mohammed al-Bashir, who has been appointed by the rebels as Syria’s interim leader pledged that the rights or all people and sects in Syria would be guaranteed. The comments come as a mausoleum in Qardaha near Latakia that housed the remains of ousted president, Bashar al-Assad’s father, Hafez, who seized control of Syria in 1970, was burned by armed Islamist rebels. Israel, which has been fighting both the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah for over a year, has deployed ground troops into and beyond a demilitarised buffer zone in the disputed Golan Heights, its first foray into Syrian-controlled territory for 50 years. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has claimed the US and Israel acted as the command centre that engineered the downfall of Syria’s former president, Bashar al-Assad, and the ousting of Iran from the country. The UN general assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly adopted a resolution calling for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, a symbolic gesture rejected by the United States and Israel. The resolution was adopted by a vote of 158-9, with 13 abstentions and urges -an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire,- and -the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages-. The UN would consider taking the Syrian rebel group that toppled the regime of Bashar al-Assad off its designated terrorist list if it passes the key test of forming a truly inclusive transitional government, according to a senior official at the world body.

Fear and uncertainty in Golan Heights as Israeli troops drive deeper into Syria	On the high rocky plateau, the fall of Bashar al-Assad has sown complicated and contradictory emotions On the outskirts of the Druze village of Majdal Shams, high in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, a gate in the fence leads to the supposedly demilitarised buffer zone on the Syrian side.

The move comes after the first Donald Trump administration killed the process to limit the chemicals’ uses, but the bans make it difficult for the second Trump administration to undo the rules.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/11/epa-bans-chemicals-linked-to-cancer	2024-12-11T04:00:46-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba1de541b4b575498af6438defc26b1f7ac73cf9/0_209_6270_3762/master/6270.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d4d4da19015397600dee18d68ae7c495
Trump is dedicated to isolationism – but is Syria’s future too important to ignore?	Concerns that US’s hands-off approach could leave the country open to a return to civil war or a resurgence of Iran For a Biden administration in its final days, managing the downfall of Bashar al-Assad was not in the cards. For a Trump administration dedicated to isolationism and America First, Syria’s future may be too important to ignore. Before last week, the front lines of the country’s nearly 13-year-old civil war had been largely frozen. Conflicts in Ukraine and Israel were dominating attention and US diplomatic efforts around the world. And the trend toward normalising relations with Assad only appeared set to extend his time in power.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/11/trump-america-first-syria	2024-12-11T03:34:42-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57bc2754e2f655410a5adf9d744a2831774c6c2b/0_17_5134_3081/master/5134.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a9b413070ad29b5c8ed1a2ef40570ed8
Ghanaians give ex-president Mahama a chance to eclipse his shaky legacy	Honeymoon period will be short as John Mahama tries to fix economy, seen as a huge factor in election Ghana’s electoral commission had been due to announce the official results of Saturday’s presidential election by Tuesday. But by Sunday morning Mahamudu Bawumia, the country’s vice-president and the flag-bearer of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP), and his campaign team had seen enough to give up. -The data from our own internal collation of the results indicates that … John Mahama has won the presidential election decisively,- he said at a press conference after calling his rival to concede. By Monday, the commission had confirmed the outcome: the former president Mahama, of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), had indeed won with 56% of the vote to Bawumia’s 41%.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/11/ghanaians-give-ex-president-mahama-a-chance-to-eclipse-his-shaky-legacy	2024-12-11T02:18:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2089459ac74dd6493140cd5d343e7d50aef375f5/0_291_6500_3902/master/6500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a8cc201ba4db7ef4fa114c23ca72afc8

Four new prisons to be built but space could still run out, minister warns – UK politics live	Demand rising faster than any supply ‘could possibly catch up with’, justice secretary says Good morning. Labour inherited many problems with public services when it took office, but few were worse than the prison overcrowding crisis. This was so dire that it prompted Rishi Sunak into holding an early election. With the Ministry of Justice just days away from ordering a fresh early release system (which would have been unpopular with voters), this was one of the main reasons for Sunak holding the election in July, not last autumn. Today, as part of the government’s response, Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, is announcing plans to create 14,000 prison places by 2031. PA Media sums up the plans here. The government has said it will build four new prisons within the next seven years in a bid to grip the overcrowding crisis. The Ministry of Justice promised to find a total of 14,000 cell spaces in jails by 2031. Demand is still rising faster than any supply could possibly catch up with. We’re very honest and transparent in the strategy itself that building alone is not enough because the demand is rising more quickly. The demand for prison places is actually 4,500 extra every single year. Even with the emergency measures that I’ve been forced to take, that’s 3,000 every year, we can’t get there just by building alone. That’s why I set up the sentencing review just a few weeks ago, because we need a longer term solution. We will run out, because even all of that new supply, with the increase in prison population that we will see as a result of that new supply, doesn’t help you with the rise in demand, because demand is still rising faster than any supply could possibly catch up with. I would say to trade unions and everybody else workers alike, that this is the start of that process, and of course, I would hope that they recognise that the government’s fiscal inheritance has been extremely difficult, and we do have to make sure that the books overall balance as well, and that pay is on a sustainable footing. This is the start of that process, and I wouldn’t want to get ahead of where we think the pay review bodies might ultimately make their recommendations.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/11/pmqs-live-uk-politics-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-labour-tories-prisons	2024-12-11T01:14:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/997382d299c58c12a28abdf98d3f4ed246eb762a/0_78_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9f4efc1f416ca28b0845cbe4c0548200

Wednesday briefing: Everything you wanted to know about the spending review (but were afraid to ask)	In today’s newsletter: All governments do them. But what exactly are they and how can you tell if they worked or not? Good morning. There are certain phrases in news stories about government, aren’t there, where your eyes glaze over like you’ve just wound down the window and asked someone for directions. Autumn statement; early day motion; fiscal rules; white paper; ping pong, weirdly. They’re definitely all very important, but it would be cruel to stop the average punter halfway through a news story and ask them for a crisp definition. Today’s case in point: the spending review. I mean, we all know what a spending review is, obviously – it’s when they review the spending. But it’s also one of the defining moments in the life of any government – and the one now being undertaken by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has been billed as the crucial first step in Labour’s plan to hit the -milestone- targets Keir Starmer set out last week, and on which he has said the government should be judged. UK news | Vodafone -unjustly enriched- itself at the expense of scores of vulnerable small business owners by slashing commissions to franchisees running high street stores, according to allegations filed on Tuesday in the high court. Vodafone denied any misconduct ahead of a £120m legal claim. Syria | Syria’s leading rebel group has named a new prime minister, Mohammad al-Bashir, to head the country’s transitional government. Meanwhile, Israel said it had carried out more than 480 strikes over the previous 48 hours against weapons stockpiles to keep them out of the hands of extremists. Courts in crisis | The head of the government’s sentencing review has said that specialist courts focused on breaking cycles of addiction could be rolled out across England and Wales. In an interview with the Guardian, David Gauke praised -very encouraging- pilots of intensive supervision courts. Iran | Women in Iran could face the death sentence or up to 15 years in prison if they defy new compulsory morality laws due to come into effect this week. Amnesty International said the laws could lead to the execution of women who send videos of themselves unveiled to media outside Iran or engage in peaceful activism. US news | The suspect in the shooting death of the UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson, will plead not guilty and fight extradition from Pennsylvania to New York, his lawyer said yesterday. Outside a court hearing, Luigi Mangione shouted: -This is completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people-. While some of these efforts have made notable savings for the public purse and improved civil service capability … they have often taken the form of discrete, temporary initiatives, and had less success embedding efficiency as a continuous process and culture across government. None, moreover, have led to a fundamental step-change in government’s approach to public spending.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/11/wednesday-briefing-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-the-spending-review-but-were-afraid-to-ask	2024-12-10T22:55:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acbf3cf5124d6ee5426f218535b250356225c7b2/1541_1138_1410_846/master/1410.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c6c015a5ea8f4d2a1aed2e65d0b2289
Middle East crisis live: rebel-backed Syrian interim prime minister urges ‘stability and calm’	Mohammed al-Bashir chairs cabinet meeting of new transitional government and will lead interim authority until 1 March Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the Middle East crisis. Syria’s new interim leader said it was time for -stability and calm- in the country as he announced he was taking charge of the country as caretaker prime minister with the backing of the former rebels who toppled President Bashar al-Assad three days ago. Israel says it has carried out more than 480 airstrikes targeting weapons stockpiles and strategic infrastructure in Syria over the past 48 hours. The IDF said the air force conducted the crewed aircraft missile strikes on Syrian military targets including weapons production sites in the cities of Damascus, Homs, Tartus, Latakia and Palmyra. It said 130 strikes were -during ground operations- and aimed at weapons depots, military structures, launchers and firing positions. The world -has nothing to fear- from the new Syrian regime, the leader of rebel group Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS) has told Sky News in what the network says are his first comments to a western media outlet since his organization toppled Bashar al-Assad on Sunday. Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, attempted to reassure foreign nations in his remarks and promised Syria -will be rebuilt-. Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow is -providing sanctuary- for deposed Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, having transported him to Moscow on Sunday -in the most secure way possible-. -He is secured, and it shows that Russia acts as required in such an extraordinary situation,- he told NBC News. The insurgent group that overthrew Bashar al-Assad’s government in Syria claims to have wrested control of the eastern city of Deir el-Zour after intense battles with the Kurdish-led, US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), AP reported. A member of the Islamic group Hayat al-Tahrir Sham (HTS) said in a recorded video that the group would sweep neighbourhoods to secure the city. The nearby city of Boukamal had also fallen to HTS, the person said, adding that Raqqa and Hasakah were subsequent targets. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 218 people were killed in three days of fighting between Turkish-backed forces and the SDF in Manbij, north-east of Damascus. Early on Wednesday, SDF commander Mazloum Abdi said the SDF and the Turkey-backed rebels had reached a ceasefire agreement in Manbij through US mediation. Outgoing US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has called for an -inclusive- political process in Syria, saying the US would eventually recognise a new government if it renounces terrorism, destroys chemical weapons stocks and protects the rights of minorities and women. -The Syrian people will decide the future of Syria. All nations should pledge to support an inclusive and transparent process and refrain from external interference,- Blinken said in a statement. The UN would consider taking the Syrian rebel group that toppled the regime of Bashar al-Assad off its designated terrorist list if it passes the key test of forming a truly inclusive transitional government, according to a senior official at the world body. Geir Pedersen, UN special envoy for Syria, held out the prospect of removing Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) from the organisation’s list of proscribed terrorist groups. But he said the group could not seek to govern Syria in the way that it had governed Idlib, the northern province where it was based and from where it led the military breakout that resulted in the sudden collapse of the Assad regime.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/11/middle-east-crisis-live-syria-interim-prime-minister-mohammed-al-bashir-israel-missile-strike	2024-12-10T22:22:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2aba93da7e562b3130a6d42999d2b0e873d2212f/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=93cd9536365899583a16f89118fa66a8

In the British case, that would help justify direct contact with Syria’s emerging leaders.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/10/leading-group-of-syrian-rebels-could-be-removed-from-uk-terror-list	2024-12-10T11:44:59-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce315ba2e9fe3624d7587b1927f58c5fd9cc728e/0_114_6000_3599/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c806ce7f583451cbf72e436b5e1e21bc

Nigel Farage, man of the people, welcomes his latest billionaire to Reform	Like our Nige, Nick Candy doesn’t appear to have any solutions to anything … but he does have very deep pockets Several Range Rovers with blacked out windows pulled up outside the TV studios in Westminster. Out stepped Theresa May. Awkward. If she’d known her arrival was going to coincide with a Reform party photo call, she’d have probably asked the driver to go round the block again. Just in case people jumped to conclusions. Not that there was much chance of anyone imagining that the Maybot was about to leave the Tory party and defect to Reform. But better safe than sorry. These are happy days for Nigel Farage. OK, so Donald Trump might have gone a little cold on him. The Donald’s apparatchiks have been letting it be known that the president-elect regards Nige as an eccentric fanboy, basking in the reflected glory. But back in the UK things are hunky dory.

Daniel Penny’s acquittal reveals ‘double standard’ about white vigilante crime	In longstanding pattern in the US, white killers are celebrated and Black victims denigrated, experts say On Monday, Daniel Penny, a 26-year-old white man, was acquitted of all charges related to the 1 May 2023 killing of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old unhoused Black man with severe mental illness, on a New York City subway train. Penny was charged with second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide after he choked Neely for nearly six minutes, causing his death. The Marine veteran claimed self-defense after an unarmed Neely made threats to passengers and complained of being hungry and thirsty, according to witness testimony. In a police interview following Neely’s death, Penny referred to Neely as -just a crackhead- who was -acting like a lunatic-.

UK politics live: Stop using money on non-priority areas, Reeves tells ministers, as she launches spending review	Chancellor due to speak at hospital event this morning as cabinet ministers have been asked to seek 5% efficiency savings in their departments Good morning. Today is the launch of the spending review. And the prime minister has been writing about the process. Every secretary of state inherits dozens of projects and priorities from his or her predecessor, and a huge quantity of government activity is therefore being carried out even if it is no longer necessary or relevant. In one of my very first cabinets, I told them all to go through their budget lines and cut at least 5%. ‘It’s time to slaughter the sacred cows,- I said. Secretaries of state across government will need to allocate their budgets to ensure that government spending is focused on the prime minister’s Plan for Change, and that every pound of taxpayers’ money is spent well. The chancellor will work with departments to prioritise spending that supports the milestones to deliver the plan … In letters sent by the chief secretary to the Treasury, departments will be advised that where spending is not contributing to a priority, it should be stopped. Although some of these decisions will be difficult, the chancellor is clear that the public must have trust in the government that it is rooting out waste and that their taxes are being spent on their priorities.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/10/uk-politics-live-rachel-reeves-spending-review-keir-starmer-cyprus	2024-12-10T01:20:40-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70e097d272bf4431f4956eb3304cd01f4ccc7b76/0_553_7560_4535/master/7560.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4e5e6c22b0797325de99741e42407205

Tuesday briefing: What happened when the doors of Syria’s most notorious prison were finally opened	In today’s newsletter: The Guardian’s William Christou was the first western journalist to gain access to Sednaya prison. He reflects on what he saw Good morning. Of all the horrific symbols of the deposed Assad regime, few carry the notoriety of Sednaya, the most feared node in the Syrian government’s repressive prison system. About 30,000 people were killed there between 2011 and 2020, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimated, more than in any other single location; for years, groups of 50 at a time were hanged in secret, once or twice a week. Many were still locked up there a couple of days ago, including women and children, in conditions so disorienting and dehumanising that some were unable to say their names. But early on Sunday, as the rebels swept into Damascus, the doors were opened, and they were freed.

OpenAI first presented Sora in February, but it was only accessible to select artists, film-makers and safety testers. At multiple points on Monday, though, OpenAI’s website did not allow for new sign-ups for Sora, citing heavy traffic. Sora is known as a text-to-video generator, a tool that can create AI video clips based on a user’s written prompts.

Dawn is an Australian living treasure – an icon of our sport – and we wish her a speedy, healthy and [full] recovery. If we’re asking people to identify with different flags … we are dividing our country unnecessarily … I think the fact is that we should stand up for who we are, for our values as a country which is what we should do in Australia. We should value and respect our heritage, and we should also speak a lot more about our migrant story, the incredible story of people who came here, particularly in the post-second world war period, with nothing, and have worked hard as trainees, as farmers, and they’ve educated their children.

Human rights for Syrians but perhaps not for Saudis in Labour’s Middle East	While David Lammy lauded the fall of Bashar al-Assad, Keir Starmer was having a love-in with Mohammed bin Salman Not that the foreign secretary was trying to take any of the credit for the collapse of the Assad regime, but without the UK standing firm then the dictator would have been around a lot longer. Just saying. Only maybe things weren’t entirely that simple. Because David Lammy had given an interview to Laura Kuenssberg back in September in which he said he had been talking enthusiastically to the Italians about their deal to send refugees back to Syria. So not quite the same as talking direct to Assad. But nearly so. By such threads are reputations made. Then to the known unknowns. The government would be cautious in its dealings with the rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. Who would have guessed? They would judge the new regime by its actions. But for now he was standing by the ordinary Syrians. They had a right to decide their own future democratically. And in Keir Starmer they had a man who would speak out against human rights abuses wherever he found them. Taking the Lead by John Crace is published by Little, Brown (£18.99).

But as he starts to assemble his cabinet and White House staff, it seems likely he’ll get to know the people involved very well soon.

Will emergence of HTS in Syria raise level of global terrorism threats?	Intelligence chiefs have to decisively analyse the risk posed by group once affiliated to islamists al-Qaida When Sir Richard Moore, the head of MI6, warned in a speech given 10 days ago that he had -never seen the world in a more dangerous state- Syria was mentioned just once. The context was that jihadist terrorism was on the retreat in the country, but after the lightning success of the rebel offensive, questions will inevitably be asked again. Intelligence chiefs are now having to quickly reassess the triumphant Syrian rebels, and in particular, the leading group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), now designated as a terror organisation by the US and the UK.

In his first sit-down interview since winning the presidential election, Donald Trump made clear to NBC News on Sunday that he planned to upend an array of governing norms as soon as he gets into the White House.

‘Grooming our children’: politicians demand Sportsbet pull promotional filters from Snapchat	Exclusive: Monique Ryan, Kate Chaney, Andrew Wilkie and Sarah Hanson-Young all call for gambling giant to remove the social media ads immediately Several federal politicians have urged Sportsbet to -immediately- pull its ads from the social media app Snapchat after Guardian Australia reported that they can be viewed by children. Sportsbet provides Snapchat users with filters that can alter their appearance and add effects to the content they share with friends.

Domestic issues pile pressure on Iran’s president amid foreign policy setbacks	Tensions over executions and plans for petrol price rise and hijab law add to reversals in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria The fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, the latest in a string of foreign policy reversals for Iran including the weakening of its allies in Lebanon and Gaza, has coincided with growing domestic frustration over rising executions, planned increases in the price of petrol and a proposed law that imposes heavy fines and loss of access to public services to any woman not wearing the hijab. The confluence of events is putting unprecedented pressure on Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, to demonstrate what reforms he has introduced since being elected in June. He is viewed domestically as a consensual figure and faces a conservative parliament, but his supporters are impatient for changes that will lift the economy.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/09/domestic-issues-pile-pressure-on-iran-president-masoud-pezeshkian-amid-foreign-policy-setbacks	2024-12-09T05:56:39-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13d67e6a1399149df366dca5b88b9b979392035f/0_0_2550_1530/master/2550.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=29ba286f96fe859312f829ace07843e1

Ron DeSantis called hypocritical over rush to fill Republican House seats	Florida governor swiftly scheduled primaries to fill posts from Trump picks while Democratic district waited months Florida governor Ron DeSantis has been accused of hypocrisy over his rush to fill Republican House seats vacated by Donald Trump’s cabinet picks, as he had previously kept voters in a Democrat-held district waiting for more than nine months. Critics say his scheduling of 28 January primaries in solid Republican districts held by former congressman Matt Gaetz, who resigned during his ill-fated nomination for attorney general, and Mike Waltz, Trump’s pick for national security adviser, is a hasty political move designed purely to bolster speaker Mike Johnson’s fragile House majority as soon as possible.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/09/ron-desantis-republican-house-primaries	2024-12-09T04:00:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1e5867cd61739fd4f899453c80711a852d6c3d8/0_39_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=687a719a65247eae52be21b0a194d0be

UK politics live: McFadden says Labour will ‘rewire state’ with new culture for civil servants	Cabinet Office minister will say he wants staff to adopt the ‘test and learn mindset of Silicon Valley’ Good morning. Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch have both spoken about their desire to completely -rewire- the way the British state operates. Badenoch has not said much about how this might happen (although she has spoken about wanting the state to do less, implying not so much a rewiring of the state as a complete removal of some of the wiring instead). And Starmer has not given a detailed vision of what rewiring might involve either, but this morning Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister, will give a speech providing the answer, or at least one answer. As Eleni Courea reports in her overnight story, McFadden will say the government will ask officials managing public service delivery to operate as if they are running a tech startup. ‘Crack’ teams of problem solvers will be deployed to improve public services and support delivery of the Plan for Change. Made up of a mix of people working in partnership to drive change - with data and digital skills, policy officials, and frontline workers, they will be given the freedom to experiment and adapt - adopting the ‘test and learn’ mindset of Silicon Valley. Instead of writing more complicated policy papers and long strategy documents, the government will set the teams a challenge and empower them to experiment, innovate and try new things. Test it. Fix the problems. Change the design. Test it again. Tweak it again. And so on, and so on, for as long as you provide the service. Suddenly, the most important question isn’t, ‘How do we get this right the first time?’. It’s ‘How do we make this better by next Friday? That’s the test and learn mindset, and I’m keen to see where we can deploy it in government. Where we can make the state a little bit more like a start-up.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/09/uk-politics-live-pat-mcfadden-labour-civil-service-reform-rachel-reeves-eu-relationship	2024-12-09T01:07:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a55ea176fe656f47cb50ac18d01a3ada0f5f223/0_35_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=02cbf5435ee5704f6cea93791965ba6d
