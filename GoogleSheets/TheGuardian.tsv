Who are the key New Labour figures in Keir Starmer’s government?	The PM is surrounded by Blairites, from Pat McFadden and Liz Kendall to Jacqui Smith and Jonathan Powell In the run-up to the general election, Keir Starmer was regularly compared to Tony Blair. When they were highlighted by the left, the parallels were often intended as insults. When they came from the Labour right, particularly after the landslide result, they were compliments. Starmer has mirrored Blair so far in his ruthlessness towards his own party, his efforts to build relationships with business and his pursuit of public service reform. But he is also more cautious, less seduced by glitz and more to the soft-left in his own views.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/15/who-are-the-key-new-labour-figures-in-keir-starmers-government	2024-10-15T11:12:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d68930ae43654386d246219f2ce593f320a1b4c/0_99_2416_1450/master/2416.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=07c7edfd954964b124d63e3a44cc756a

Middle East crisis live: UN peacekeepers ‘must never be targeted’; Netanyahu ‘won’t strike Iran nuclear facilities’	Security council says peacekeepers ‘must never be the target of an attack’; Israeli PM reportedly tells US he is willing to avoid strikes on oil or nuclear installations Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. The UN security council has expressed -strong concern- after several UN peacekeepers were wounded when they came under fire in southern Lebanon amid clashes between the Israeli military and Iran-backed Hezbollah militants. The council reiterated its support for the peacekeeping mission’s role in supporting regional security. Italy, Britain, France and Germany released a joint statement on Monday condemning Israel for repeatedly attacking UN peacekeepers. -These attacks must stop immediately,- they said, adding deliberate attacks were against international law. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez said there would be -no withdrawal- of the UN peacekeeping force from southern Lebanon after Israeli attacks and calls to leave. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Unifil’s work -is very important. It’s completely unacceptable attacking United Nations troops.- More than 20 people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Christian town in northern Lebanon on Monday, far from Hezbollah’s power centres in Beirut and the south and east of the country. The bombing struck Aitou, a Maronite village near the northern city of Tripoli, hit a small apartment building, killing 21 people according to the Lebanese Red Cross. The village’s mayor told Reuters that the building had been rented to families displaced by the war. It was also a particularly bloody 24 hours in the Gaza Strip. Four people were killed in an Israeli bombing of a hospital courtyard in central Gaza, another strike on a nearby school used as a shelter killed at least 20 people, and a drone strike killed five children playing on the street in al-Shati camp in Gaza City, according to local health authorities. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports of civilian casualties in the three incidents on Sunday and Monday. At least 42,289 Palestinians have been killed and 98,684 wounded in Israeli strikes since 7 October 2023, the Palestinian health ministry said on Monday. Netanyahu is examining a plan to seal off humanitarian aid to northern Gaza in an attempt to starve out Hamas, according to a report. The plan, proposed by a group of retired generals, would give Palestinians a week to leave the northern third of the Gaza Strip, including Gaza City, before declaring it a closed military zone. Those who remain would be considered combatants – meaning military regulations would allow troops to kill them – and denied food, water, medicine and fuel, according to a copy of the plan given to the Associated Press. The UN’s secretary-general, António Guterres, condemned the -large number of civilian casualties in the intensifying Israeli campaign in northern Gaza-, his spokesperson said on Monday. The UN chief -strongly urges all parties to the conflict to comply with international humanitarian law and emphasises that civilians must be respected and protected at all times,- spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said. Israeli forces shot dead two Palestinians in the northern West Bank city of Jenin on Monday, the Palestinian health ministry said. According to Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, one of the men was 17 years old. Four others were injured by Israeli fire during the raid, it said. Ireland’s foreign minister, Micheál Martin, accused Israel of trying to prevent the world from seeing what its troops are doing in Lebanon and Gaza, and of working to undermine the UN. Asked what Israel’s aim might be in demanding that UN peacekeepers leave their bases in Lebanon after a series of attacks, Martin said: -essentially to drive the eyes and ears out of south Lebanon and to give itself free rein-. Officials from the US’s main humanitarian agency attend daily meetings on an Israeli military base that also hosts a notorious prison for Palestinian detainees where torture reportedly runs rampant, the Guardian has learned.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/15/middle-east-crisis-live-un-peacekeepers-lebanon-israel-gaza-iran-netanyahu	2024-10-14T23:32:03-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd6c3e06cb86c75a8c2792d766bb6d82f7fe6ea7/0_140_4200_2521/master/4200.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d69d15e79bb8d9b976891fef34607998

With Israel expected to retaliate, it is not surprising US has announced it will deploy Thaad missile defence systems As Israel’s conflict with Hezbollah and Iran has escalated, it has begun to show a degree of vulnerability. A Hezbollah drone evaded Israel’s much vaunted air defences on Sunday and struck a military canteen when it was busy with soldiers eating dinner. Four were killed and 58 wounded, seven seriously, at a location 40 miles south of the Lebanese border. The drone that hit the canteen of the Golani base near Binyamina appears to have been part of a synchronised attack that allowed it to elude the country’s well organised air defences.

US election live: Trump and Harris expected in Pennsylvania with little over three weeks until vote	Both candidates campaigning hard as polls show them locked in a tight race for 5 November Good morning and welcome to the US elections blog with a little over three weeks to go until Americans head to the polls. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris were speaking last night and are back on the campaign trail today with both expected to hold events later in the swing state of Pennsylvania. Here’s a round-up of what happened overnight in the US. A man with a shotgun, loaded handgun, ammunition and several fake passports in his vehicle was arrested at a security checkpoint outside Donald Trump’s rally Saturday night in the Southern California desert, police said. He was released the same day on $5,000 bail. The suspect, a 49-year-old resident of Las Vegas, was driving an unregistered black SUV with a -homemade- license plate that was stopped by deputies assigned to the rally in Coachella, east of Los Angeles, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said at a news conference. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump spent Sunday trying to shore up political support among what they perceived to be must-have voting blocs. Polls show them locked in a tight 5 November presidential race. Trump pledged on Sunday to hire an extra 10,000 border patrol agents if he is reelected as president. The Republican presidential candidate said he would meet the goal by asking the US Congress to fund a 10% pay rise for border patrol agents and a $10,000 retention and signing bonus, at a rally in the border state of Arizona, an election battleground. Harris held a rally in Greenville, North Carolina, where she attacked her rival for spreading misinformation related to hurricanes Helene and Milton. -From him, we are just hearing from that same, old tired playbook,- she said. -He has no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people. He is only focused on himself.- Both Harris and Trump will be in Pennsylvania later today. Harris is speaking in the city of Erie and Trump is on the stump in Oaks, a small community about 20 miles from Philadelphia. Speaker Mike Johnson said that passing additional hurricane aid for states impacted by hurricanes Helene and Milton -can wait- until Congress is back in session after the election. Three major polls were released Sunday, showing Kamala Harris either ahead of Donald Trump or running a head-to-head race.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/14/us-election-live-donald-trump-kamala-harris	2024-10-14T02:58:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7ddec8eefb0310a5c77588eb663a44ad063ef35/0_0_4639_2783/master/4639.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1bb81766efdcbaa505d1192d30d9b08b

Middle East crisis live: 20 killed in strike on central Gaza school; Harris urges Israel to get more aid into northern areas	Israeli shelling killed people at a school serving as a shelter for displaced Palestinians in the central Nuseirat camp, say hospitals An Israeli airstrike on a hospital courtyard in the Gaza Strip early Monday killed at least four people and sent flames sweeping through a packed tent camp for people displaced by the war, leaving more than two dozen with severe burns, according to Palestinian medics. Civilians must be protected and must have access to food, water, and medicine. International humanitarian law must be respected.- A Hezbollah drone attack on an army base in central Israel killed four soldiers and severely wounded seven others on Sunday, the Israeli military said, in the deadliest strike by the militant group since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon nearly two weeks ago. Hezbollah called the attack near Binyamina city retaliation for Israeli strikes on Beirut on Thursday that killed 22 people. It later said it targeted Israel’s elite Golani brigade, launching dozens of missiles to occupy Israeli air defence systems during the assault by -squadrons- of drones. The US will send an antimissile system to Israel as well as a crew of US military personnel to operate the system. In a statement released on Sunday, Pentagon press secretary Maj Gen Pat Ryder said that the US will also send an -associated crew of US military personnel to Israel to help bolster Israel’s air defenses-. Sixteen people have been killed during Israel’s raid on Al Ma’asara in Lebanon’s Keserwan district. In a post on Sunday updating the death toll from yesterday’s attacks, the Lebanese health ministry said that in addition to the 16 people killed, 21 people were injured. United Nations secretary general António Guterres warned on Sunday that any attacks against peacekeepers -may constitute a war crime-, his spokesperson said, after Israeli tanks burst through the gates of a peacekeeping base in southern Lebanon. Reuters reports it was the latest accusation of Israeli violations and attacks against the UN peacekeeping mission, known as Unifil, in recent days. In a statement released late on Sunday, the Israeli military said a Merkava tank had been trying to evacuate injured soldiers and had backed into the Unifil post accidentally while under fire amid a smokescreen. In a videoed statement addressed to Guterres on Sunday, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, reiterated Israeli calls for Unifil troops to evacuate. -The time has come for you to withdraw Unifil from Hezbollah strongholds and from the combat zones,- he said. -The IDF has requested this repeatedly and has met with repeated refusal, which has the effect of providing Hezbollah terrorists with human shields.- French president Emmanuel Macron urged his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian to support a -general de-escalation- in the Middle East during a phone conversation on Sunday, the presidential office said. Reuters reports that in a separate discussion, Macron reiterated to Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati the -absolute necessity- of obtaining a ceasefire in Lebanon without further delay.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/14/middle-east-crisis-live-nuseirat-gaza-lebanon-israel-unifil-netanyahu	2024-10-13T23:41:58-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d2f40394ccde4db6b61754216c425ac5c1373b9/0_605_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=066d7e62007993ceef15dcb104a4b128

Australia news live: Labor commits $95m to prepare for deadly bird flu; republicans to welcome king’s visit with ‘farewell tour’ T-shirts	Australia is the only continent still free of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza. Follow today’s news live Environment ministers to meet and discuss preparedness for H5N1 strain Work by Wildlife Health Australia more than a year ago warned the consequences of the H5N1 strain of bird flu in native birds could be catastrophic. Environment organisations have been calling for additional funding for preparedness for the disease in wildlife for many months. This is incredible news. The Albanese government is finally investing a serious amount into preparation for what could be the worst environmental disaster in Australia’s history. This level of funding will allow departments to get on with the job of properly preparing to save wildlife and stop extinctions if the deadly bird flu hits our shores. I am particularly concerned about the potential impact on species already at risk of extinction and not well placed to cope with significant mortalities. This includes marine mammals such as the endangered Australian sea lion, and sea birds like the Christmas Island frigatebird which has only one breeding site.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/oct/14/labor-prepare-for-bird-flu-health-funding-republicans-king-charles-visit-politics-labor-liberals-greens-vic-nsw-qld-economy	2024-10-13T13:28:42-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/640d29ed967035dc797aff1d8e137f307797859f/0_0_4499_2700/master/4499.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d9817a93095a09615f466bb904b59a91

Trump to hold rally in Arizona as new polls show Harris in the lead – live	Several polls released on Sunday show Kamala Harris in the lead or in a tight race with Donald Trump Good morning, US politics blog readers. There’s another busy news day ahead of us and we’ll keep up with all the developments as they happen. Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona, later today. Kamala Harris’s husband, Doug Emhoff, will head to a Get Out the Jewish Vote campaign event in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. He will later deliver remarks at a Girl Dads for Harris-Walz phone bank in Delaware County. Kamala Harris on Saturday released a report on her health and medical history, which found that -she possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency- if voters elect her in November. A senior aide to Harris, 59, said the vice-president’s advisers viewed the publication of the health report and medical history as an opportunity to call attention to questions about Donald Trump’s physical fitness and mental acuity. Tightening poll figures have triggered nervousness and anxiety in Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign, with Donald Trump making gains in the states where it matters most as the election race enters its climactic final phase, according to The Guardian’s 10-day polling average tracker. Several former Trump administration officials have warned that the former president deliberately withheld disaster aid to states he deemed politically hostile to him as US president and will do so again unimpeded if he returns to the White House.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/13/donald-trump-kamala-harris-polls-politics-latest-updates	2024-10-13T07:31:47-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c88b663cca30eb1e2087af5d1decc1f06651930/0_399_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8cc3e28a4b3c78b40ab0962d8b09ce21

Coalition wants to scrutinise ‘national security risk’ of Chinese-made EVs – as it happened	This blog is now closed Coalition would consider mirroring US action on TikTok due to ‘foreign interference risk’, says Paterson Paterson has implied that the Coalition would consider taking similar action to the US on TikTok. TikTok will pose a national security risk and particularly a foreign interference risk in our democracy. The US has taken action. The worrying thing is you might end up with a safer version of TikTok in the United States and a more dangerous version in Australia because we have been unwilling to take that action. Of course, it happened on the Albanese government’s watch. They deserve some of credit for that, but it is a credit to Australia as a whole because the reason why the Chinese government has walked away from these sanctions is because they didn’t work. So much so that the Biden administration is taking very tough action to eliminate them from their market. If our closest ally and friends think it is a concern, we should address it as well. For example, you can impose minimum cybersecurity standards that would lift the bar that all Internet devices like that have to meet, not just cars but other devices connected to the Internet.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/oct/13/australia-news-live-politics-closing-the-gap-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-cost-of-living-voice-referendum	2024-10-12T23:38:46-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd429f2eff0e878b1815c13b2ba9db0b467b52e0/371_315_5629_3377/master/5629.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c9cf9d34c4083858f3d402c27e869b03

Sculpture by the Sea 2024: giant melanoma on Sydney beach to deliver ‘message that will be hard to ignore’	Sculpture often divides opinion but it’s rare for a work to carry the claim it may save lives Sculpture has a knack of provoking debate. The medium’s ability to divide viewers on the aesthetics of a work – and often its cost to the public purse – can make sculpture a polarising subject. But it’s rare for a work to claim it may save lives. Working in the field of advertising, Sydney creative Andrew Hankin is not above hyperbole. But his team’s entry into this year’s Sculpture by the Sea could very well save a life or lives, as visitors to Tamarama gaze down in horror/awe/morbid fascination at a gargantuan sculpture resembling a melanoma.

But his death 40 years ago, and the collapse of Europe’s communist parties in the late 1980s, eclipsed Berlinguer’s legacy, and Italy has since moved across the political spectrum, electing the far-right Giorgia Meloni as prime minister in 2022.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/12/enrico-berlinguer-communism-hero-italy-youth-far-right-film	2024-10-12T08:06:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51001b87dfb9426ff17bbd8c83e0bb2528e92ce5/0_398_5550_3330/master/5550.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0c93c2f95a98e6fe5422e1f2a1032539

Donald Trump to speak at Hispanic event as Kamala Harris releases medical report – live	The Republican and Democratic presidential candidates are campaigning with election day just over three weeks away Good morning and thanks for joining us this Saturday. With election day just over three weeks away, we’ll be covering the latest developments as they happen. Here’s a quick summary of the latest news from yesterday and where things stand today: At a rally in Aurora, Colorado, yesterday, former president Donald Trump announced -Operation Aurora-, a plan to invoke the 1798 Alien Enemies Act if he is re-elected. The law allows the president to detain and deport non‑citizens in times of a declared war or presidentially proclaimed -invasion-. Meanwhile, speaking in Scottsdale, Arizona, Kamala Harris said she would create -a bipartisan council of advisers- if elected president. She’s drawn remarkable support over the past two and a half months from establishment Republicans, most notably Liz and Dick Cheney. Also yesterday, Vogue magazine released its newest issue, featuring Harris on the cover. The photograph of the vice-president stood in stark contrast to Harris’s first appearance on the magazine’s cover three years ago – an image that was widely criticized as unserious and disrespectful. This morning, Harris released a report on her medical history – in contrast to her opponent who has repeatedly promised and then refused to do the same. The report concludes that Harris -possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency-. And Trump is scheduled to speak this afternoon at a Hispanic roundtable in Las Vegas. He’s expected to return to the anti-immigrant message that has defined his campaign. In a change of scenery, Tim Walz is taking a break from the campaign trail today to kick of Minnesota’s pheasant hunting season. He’s spending the day at the Governor’s Pheasant Opener – reiterating the Minnesota governor’s reputation as a hunter despite his firm stance on gun violence regulations.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/12/election-donald-trump-kamala-harris-politics-live-updates	2024-10-12T07:37:12-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51deb9deb203b28efc3270bed5d3f2c579c49309/0_98_2949_1769/master/2949.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=156a26cb23af415863dc8b6ae71bb642

Amid a dramatic news cycle that has seen the US hit by two destructive hurricanes and rising fears of all-out war in the Middle East, the Guardian’s 10-day polling average tracker showed the vice-president and Democratic nominee with a two-point nationwide lead, 48% to 46%, over her Republican opponent as of 10 October - tellingly, down from a 4% advantage she registered a fortnight ago.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/12/kamala-harris-donald-trump-polls	2024-10-12T04:00:23-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8b907a58edb102a6323adfb66a764e95afb8794/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e012d1a5208e5ff8f5a03959aa0b6f53
Florida begins long road to recovery after double hurricane strike	The twin blow from Milton and Helene has left the state reeling – and the act of rebuilding will be lengthy and costly More than just clouds were swirling when a tropical disturbance that would become Hurricane Milton formed in the south-western Gulf of Mexico, beginning its inexorable march towards a midweek strike on Florida’s west coast. As its winds picked up, so did familiar feelings of anxiety and dread across a state still reeling from the impact of another monster storm, Hurricane Helene, barely a week earlier. Ultimately, the densely populated cities of Tampa and St Petersburg were spared the apocalyptic scenario some had forecast.

Insurance is failing hurricane survivors: ‘People thought they were covered’	Flooding is separate from typical US home insurance and many homeowners are not adequately covered As millions of US residents begin working to file insurance claims on their homes in the aftermath of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, many could be denied, particularly if their homes were damaged by flooding. A quirk in the US home insurance market is that flood insurance is separate from typical home insurance, which usually covers wind damage from hurricanes but not flooding. Homeowners must purchase flood insurance separately if they want their homes protected against flooding.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/12/flood-insurance-hurricane-milton-helene	2024-10-12T03:00:24-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c04924d1c7ad968dfa97e8000a7cd4d1085f11ba/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f348cb93c7e42396866be3a7e84cf651

The European Commission paid the amount to the Tunis government in a controversial migration and development deal, despite concerns that the north African state was increasingly authoritarian and its police largely operated with impunity.	https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/oct/11/eu-funding-migrant-deal-tunisia-human-rights-violations-asylum-icc	2024-10-11T07:30:11-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c585a7d4b944a74d3efa1fed78547908701daca5/0_307_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=97d46d00ff594f9014c8bed08ea5c951
Victorian Liberals had been bracing for a leadership spill. Now voters have thrown John Pesutto a lifeline	Some in the party were concerned the Moira Deeming defamation trial had aired too much dirty laundry – but new polling suggests voters are focused elsewhere There may have been only one person on Spring Street revelling in the latest polling data: John Pesutto. Just days ago, the leader of the Victorian Liberal party was bracing for a potential leadership challenge. But the figures published in the Herald Sun on Thursday paint a hopeful picture for him and the Coalition, which has overtaken Labor and is in an election-winning position for the first time in seven years.

Tanya Plibersek defends Aboriginal heritage order blocking ‘irreversible damage’ of goldmine tailings dam	Financial impact on mining company does not outweigh ‘permanent loss’ to cultural sites, environment minister says Tanya Plibersek has defended her decision to issue an Aboriginal heritage protection order for the site of a proposed goldmine near Blayney, saying the financial impact on the mining company does not outweigh -irreversible damage and permanent loss- to Aboriginal cultural heritage sites. The environment minister made a partial declaration under section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act in August, blocking a proposal by mining company Regis Resources to build a tailings dam for its $900m McPhillamys gold project in the headwaters of the Belubula River. The declaration did not cover the rest of the proposed mining area.

Some Australian states are discovering what happens when they have too much rooftop solar	Alerts to possible power shortfalls have become a familiar occurrence. But experts say it won’t be long before the opposite is common When Victoria basks in mostly sunny spring weather this weekend, energy authorities will be monitoring how far electricity demand ebbs. If needed, they’ll turn off rooftop solar systems to ensure stability for the grid. Such minimum system load events, as they are called, have emerged as a new challenge as households across Australia take advantage of plunging prices for solar panels to shield themselves from rising power bills and cut carbon emissions.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/12/australian-states-too-much-rooftop-solar	2024-10-11T07:00:58-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2afa8c4f8248198a2c04aa63503e77a8b4e7c435/0_0_3733_2242/master/3733.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=07a8bb1499d28e2f56a18e3c15b90962

Obama takes down Trump’s lies and fake ‘strength’, urging men to vote for Harris – US elections live	Former president scoffs at idea Trump’s bullying shows strength in speech that also condemns hurricane lies and asks ‘When did that become OK?’ Good morning, US politics blog readers, there’s another busy news day in store and we’ll keep up with all the developments as they happen. Party politics has seeped further into hurricane news, and you can follow all that in our storm blog, here. Elsewhere, much is afoot on the campaign trail. Here’s what’s in store. Barack Obama said he had -a problem- with men who keep coming up with bogus excuses not to vote for Kamala Harris and leaning into Donald Trump’s macho aggression, in his first appearance on the campaign trail for the Democrats in Pittsburgh yesterday, in the must-win state of Pennsylvania. Expect more events with the former, two-term president. The former president told the crowd: -I’m sorry, gentlemen, I’ve noticed this, especially with some men who seem to think Trump’s behavior of bullying and putting people down is a sign of strength. And I am here to tell you: that is not what real strength is. It never has been. Real strength is about helping people who need it and standing up for those who can’t always stand up for themselves, that is what we should want for our daughters and for our sons, and that is what I want to see a president of the United States of America.- Obama also condemned Trump’s spreading of disinformation about the hurricane, railing against -the idea of intentionally trying to deceive people in their most desperate and vulnerable moments-. He highlighted that lies may discourage some of the people affected from seeking help. Visibly angry, Obama asked: -When did that become OK?- The Democratic governors of three vital battleground states, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, are going to hit the trail together. Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Wisconsin’s Tony Evers plan a midwestern bus tour from next week, called Driving Forward , Whitmer’s Fight Like Hell PAC said and Axios reported this morning. Bill Clinton, who maybe didn’t set the Democratic voting world alight with his lengthy address at the party’s convention in August but is nevertheless always a big name in US politics, is going to Georgia this weekend and then North Carolina, where Trump is marginally ahead in the polls and it’s all hands on deck for the Dems. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’s vice presidential pick, is going to do a TV interview blitz in, where else, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in the coming days, Axios reports. Donald Trump will speak in Aurora, Colorado, this afternoon, a state that’s confidently Democratic these days, but the former president plans to slam it to migrants and asylum seekers again, planning to make claims about Venezuelans and crime levels. This comes after Trump again used brutal language to undercut United States allies in the NATO alliance, saying -we will not protect you- from Russia if they don’t spend as much as they should on paper on their militaries. Trump was speaking in Detroit.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/11/trump-harris-us-elections-obama-latest-updates	2024-10-11T06:52:19-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2188705ff365877450174261cdfdf97e937c983/0_60_7929_4758/master/7929.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=211f67acc154276e6af9354cf07acda7

Hurricane Milton recovery resumes as Republicans stir up political storm	Sixteen people killed by storm but state spared ‘worst-case scenario’ as accusations fly between political candidates Authorities are urgently assessing the cost of Hurricane Milton after the deadly storm spawned tornadoes ahead of slamming into central Florida and then tearing across the state, leaving destroyed homes, streets blocked with downed power lines, fallen trees and debris. At least 16 people have been killed by the storm, according to the Tampa Bay Times and recovery efforts continue, meaning the numbers could rise.

The director general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio), Mike Burgess, told a social media summit in Adelaide on Friday that social media is -both a goldmine and a cesspit- that creates communities and divides them, and the internet was -the world’s most potent incubator of extremism-.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/11/australias-spy-chief-warns-ai-will-accelerate-online-radicalisation	2024-10-11T03:35:44-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbaaade67681c9ad51bdf401cfcccb299a6ec83c/0_223_6678_4007/master/6678.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cff198abe80693232c6e3acde1697b3c
DNA study confirms Christopher Columbus’s remains are entombed in Seville	Scientists have ‘definitively’ proved identity of remains – with navigator’s precise origins to be revealed Scientists in Spain claim to have solved the two lingering mysteries that cling to Christopher Columbus more than five centuries after the explorer died: are the much-travelled remains buried in a magnificent tomb in Seville Cathedral really his? And was the navigator who changed the course of world history really from Genoa – as history has long claimed – or was he actually Basque, Catalan, Galician, Greek, Jewish or Portuguese? The answer to the first question is yes. The answer to the second is … wait until Saturday.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/11/dna-study-christopher-columbus-remains-seville-cathedral	2024-10-11T03:31:01-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0f383ab7108750b443199e614aaa1968adf175a/567_299_4633_2780/master/4633.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9f11caba889c85d73933fb4860013bf5
First Thing: Death toll climbs as Florida grieves Hurricane Milton’s destruction	At least 10 people have died. Plus, a deadly day of Israeli strikes in Gaza and Lebanon Good morning. The death toll from Hurricane Milton climbed to at least 10 on Thursday as Florida continued to assess the damage from the category 3 storm that caused extensive property damage across the state and left more than 3.5m homes and businesses without power. How bad was the storm surge? Although the powerful storm surge authorities predicted before Milton’s arrival was not as bad as projected, in some areas, such as parts of Sarasota county, a storm surge of 2.4-3 metres (8-10ft) was recorded. What is the role of global heating? It is always complicated when discussing specific weather events. But the burning of fossil fuels has made storms as severe as this month’s Hurricane Helene about 2.5 times more likely than they were in the preindustrial age, scientists at the World Weather Attribution group said. What did Joe Biden say? The president attacked lies and misinformation when asked if he had spoken to Donald Trump, who falsely claimed disaster relief funds were redirected to migrants. -Former President Trump, get a life, man,- Biden said.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/11/first-thing-death-toll-climbs-as-florida-grieves-hurricane-miltons-destruction	2024-10-11T03:04:55-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e62aff4ab7f17bf7e312fc56e9e1d2a8c6df5ef3/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ee555a4bd451b93cfce7689e2a6b72d2

The Middle East and the US election: how they could affect each other	Benjamin Netanyahu has humiliated Biden’s America and seems to anticipate Trump’s return, but would that be so good for Israel? The year since the 7 October attack has demonstrated just how densely intertwined US presidential politics is with the trajectory of events in the Middle East. Each exerts a gravitational pull on the other, often in ways that are damaging for both. Foreign policy rarely matters much in US presidential elections, but this year could be an exception. In a contest likely to be decided by small margins in a handful of states, the fallout from the conflicts in Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon, with a potential war with Iran looming, could have a significant impact on Kamala Harris’s prospects.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/11/the-middle-east-and-the-us-election-how-they-could-affect-each-other	2024-10-11T03:00:51-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a77a1745cea9ffb98e489c3f2fc204b41203c63/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cef7d15bf0d65f842356b126590ef20e

Tories would have to support ECHR withdrawal ‘to serve in my shadow cabinet’, says Jenrick – UK politics live	Conservative leadership hopeful’s plan could lead to many senior Tories refusing to serve on the frontbench In his interview on the Today programme this morning Robert Jenrick, who has been running on a rightwing in the Tory leadership contest, denied telling MPs in private that, if elected leader, he would flip back to the centre. But he also refused to accept the premise of the question, and so it was not entirely clear what he meant. Justin Webb, the presenter, asked him about a report in the i suggesting that Jenrick’s rightwing stance is just tactical. The story says -senior Tories have cast major doubts over the chances of Kemi Badenoch or Robert Jenrick leading the Conservatives into the next election amid growing fears over party unity- and it includes this quote. Some moderates hope the candidates will tack back to the centre ground, should they succeed in convincing the Tory party membership to elect them. One member of the Shadow Cabinet said they had assurances Jenrick would rein in his right-wing polemic if elected party leader. -He has promised me he will turn to the centre,- they said. -I suspect he has told other people the same.- I don’t know where that quote comes from, and I wouldn’t believe everything that you read in the papers. I haven’t said that, no. But let me just address the broader point that it raises. Because there are those who say that the Conservative party, were I to lead it, is going to shift to the right. I actually don’t see these labels as at all relevant. What I want to see is the Conservative party occupy what I describe as the common ground of British politics. The reason that I believe we should leave the European convention on human rights is not an ideological one. I came to this view through the practical experience I had as a minister, in particular at the Home Office, where I saw that we as a country were not able to do the most basic duty of the state, which is to secure our borders. We weren’t able to remove dangerous criminals from the country. We weren’t able to remove terror suspects from the country, and we certainly weren’t able to set up a robust but important and credible deterrent, such as the Rwanda one, because of our continued membership with the ECHR. It would be one of the stable of Conservative policies, so yes, we would go into the next election with it in our manifesto. I believe it’s very important that we do this … I’ve already said to James, who is a friend, someone I respect enormously, that I would be delighted for him to serve in the shadow cabinet should he want to do so. I don’t think the point of difference is as big as perhaps you suggest it is. There is now a consensus within the Conservative party that the ECHR is not working in the interests of the British people, for all the reasons that I’ve just described. Most people now are saying that, at a bare minimum, we need to reform the ECHR.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/11/tory-leadership-echr-withdrawal-robert-jenrick-kemi-badenoch-keir-starmer-labour-devolution-uk-politics-latest-news	2024-10-11T01:53:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e26cb811a465ba6b292904171da96d4483f474f/0_19_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=add2bf880e34d793f5e44113bf341d01

Middle East crisis live: EU chief says Israel firing on peacekeepers ‘not acceptable’; UN says personnel in Lebanon ‘increasingly in jeopardy’	Operational activity of Unifil peacekeepers has virtually come to a halt, UN official tells security council Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. The safety and security of UN peacekeepers in Lebanon are -increasingly in jeopardy- and operational activities have virtually come to a halt since since 23 September, UN peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix told the security council on Thursday evening. At least 22 people were killed and more than 100 others injured after Israeli airstrikes hit residential areas of central Beirut on Thursday evening. The strikes hit the working-class district of Basta and the Nweiri neighbourhood, the deadliest attacks to target central Beirut since Israel intensified its bombardment campaign on the country two weeks ago. Hezbollah’s Al Manar TV reported that the strikes were an attempt to assassinate Wafiq Safa, a top security official with the group, which it said had failed. At least 28 people, including women and children, have been killed after an Israeli airstrike hit a school sheltering displaced people in central Gaza on Thursday morning. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said it had responded to 27 fatalities and 54 injuries after the strike on the school turned shelter in Deir al-Balah. The Israeli military said it targeted militants who were operating in the compound. The Israeli military continued to push on with an offensive that began six days ago, when it sent its troops into Jabaliya, the largest of Gaza’s eight historic refugee camps and the nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya. Palestinian health officials say at least 130 people have been killed so far in the operation, which Israel says is aimed at preventing Hamas from regrouping. The military has told residents to evacuate an area in which the UN estimates more than 400,000 people are trapped. Three hospitals in northern Gaza – Indonesian, Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan hospitals – have been ordered by Israeli forces to evacuate, putting patients’ lives at risk, medics say. The director of Kamal Adwan hospital n northern Gaza said eight patients, mostly children, were at risk inside the intensive care units should the Israeli army force them to evacuate. Israeli bombardment near Kamal Adwan hospital has already caused some damage to the facility, medics said. Officials said they know of many fatalities lying on the roads outside the hospital because of Israeli fire. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, said some Unrwa shelters and services were being forced to shut down for the first time since the war began and that with almost no basic supplies available, hunger was spreading again in northern Gaza, amid witness accounts of bodies lying uncollected in the streets because of the renewed fighting.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/11/middle-east-crisis-live-eu-israel-iran-lebanon-blog-news-updates-hezbollah-hamas-unifil	2024-10-10T22:22:11-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc484b3053a70af4eff38aefdf6b9b08f17b4d44/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=57a10a93ed7c7a696036eeca160cf422

Bella Ciao: a brief history of the resistance anthem sung to Viktor Orbán	A look at the origins and appeal off the song MEPs used to serenade the Hungarian PM in Strasbourg -This is not Eurovision,- said the speaker of the European parliament, Roberta Metsola, as she tried to silence leftwing MEPs greeting the visiting Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, with a rowdy rendition of the classic anti-fascist anthem Bella Ciao. The bang-your-fists-on-the-table motif at the heart of this earworm of a ditty – whose title means -Goodbye, beautiful- – may indeed sound like something cooed through dry fog by a spandex-clad blond at the European song contest. But the story it tells reaches far deeper into the continent’s history than the annual kitsch music extravaganza, telling an age-old tale of the left’s determined struggle against political oppression.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/11/bella-ciao-resistance-anthem-history-meps-strasbourg-viktor-orban	2024-10-10T21:00:43-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/472fb8b1bb129a3bb5f9dedfdf626ff70fd78763/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=10169e6bc755ea34ae32faec21cd87dd

The downward drift in rates is especially prevalent in fixed loans, with seven lenders cutting their rates by an average of 0.3 percentage points over the past week, according to Canstar. Four lenders cut variable rates by smaller margins.

Hurricane Milton slams into Florida as nearly 3 million without power | First Thing	Joe Biden describes it as the ‘storm of the century.’ Plus, US urges Israel to urgently address ‘catastrophic’ Gaza conditions Good morning. A weakening but still tremendously powerful Hurricane Milton slammed into Florida’s west coast on Wednesday night as a category 3 storm, leaving nearly 3 million homes without power, while bringing -catastrophic- winds likely to cause significant property damage. What do we know about the impact so far? Nearly 3 million homes and businesses in Florida were without power. St Petersburg has had 16 inches of rain since the storm began, half of which fell in just two hours. What is a storm surge? As a hurricane approaches a coast, the churning winds force ocean water up on to land; atmospheric pressure from the storm also helps squeeze the water ashore. Water is heavy, and it can move fast in a surge, sweeping people to their deaths, throwing boats and vehicles, and pulverising structures. This is a developing story.

Minister strongly rejects claim from business lobby ‘chaotic’ workers bill will cost jobs – UK politics live	Labour promised employment rights bill within first 100 days in office Good morning. During the election campaign Labour promised to produce an employment rights bill within its first 100 days in office. The anniversary is on Saturday, and, just in time for the deadline, the bill is being published today. It is hugely important to the trade unions, who provide the institutional backbone to the Labour party, and, as Jessica Elgot reports in her overnight story, millions of workers will gain new rights as a result. The government claims the scope of the reform is huge – 9 million people will gain new rights against unfair dismissal, more than 1 million low-paid workers on zero hours will have the right to job security on a new contract, an extra 30,000 parents will gain new rights to paternity leave, and 1.5 million will be newly entitled to unpaid parental leave. Ministers also believe the bill will help at least 1.7 million people into the labour market who are not working because of family commitments – and who would benefit from new policies on flexible working and parental leave.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/10/labour-workers-bill-jobs-keir-starmer-tory-party-leadership-jenrick-badenoch-uk-politics-live	2024-10-10T01:31:36-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a846a541773667065d3972cd4f8bc2d4bc6951f/0_217_5413_3248/master/5413.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=935d971692845d3c1411c6400ff4cb6f

The woman, who has not been named, was essentially trapped in her home near Poulsbo, Washington, and scared as the animals can be aggressive.

The same might not be true for the election after that.

The scramble to flee Florida ahead of Hurricane Milton | First Thing	Floridians are clogging interstates in an effort to escape the path of Hurricane Milton as it intensifies in strength. Plus: the Afghan women holding the Taliban accountable Good morning. Hurricane Milton is barrelling toward Florida’s west coast and is expected to make landfall as early as Wednesday night. An estimated 6 million people across 11 counties in Florida are now under mandatory evacuation orders, with time running out to make preparations. -If you choose to stay … you are going to die,- said Tampa mayor Jane Castor. How bad is Milton predicted to be? In barely a day, Milton went from a tropical storm to a category 5 hurricane, the strongest possible rating, with its winds hitting 180mph. Milton has the potential to become -one of the most destructive hurricanes on record for west-central Florida-, the National Hurricane Center said. What are the hardships facing those evacuating? For some, fleeing home to avoid a disaster is simply not possible. The Federal Reserve has estimated that nearly 40% of Americans would not be able to cover a $400 emergency expense in cash, while a 2021 study found that people who evacuated from the Texas Coastal Bend during Hurricane Harvey spent about $1,200 on average on evacuating – more if they had to stay in hotels. What have local officials done to ease evacuation efforts? Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, lifted tolls on major highways and ordered breakdown lanes open but traffic levels were still above 150% of normal, with accidents blocking some routes. -Unfortunately every storm we see traffic fatalities because people wait until the last minute to leave,- Florida’s transportation secretary, Jared Perdue, said. How has Trump responded to the allegations? Steven Cheung, Trump’s communications director, said: -None of these madeup stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man … clearly upset because President Trump is successfully suing him because of the unauthorized publishing of recordings he made previously.-	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/09/first-thing-the-scramble-to-flee-florida-ahead-of-hurricane-milton	2024-10-09T04:58:20-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4fa3edea503cb11b43a3b4ac01a01dd985dfbaa/0_167_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7f4ae7daea851566f3c1e146169c1873

The girl, who was 13 at the time, had accepted that she took a bladed fishing multi-tool into her school and stabbed the two adults and the pupil but denied attempting to kill them.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/09/ammanford-school-stabbing-trial-collapses-as-compromised-jury-discharged	2024-10-09T04:35:41-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68a408674314b42b9ae50cb8911583c5c1839360/0_6_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2baad2a1fbb28740ee80b44934868330

Cannabis is now legal in many US states – but can the smell get you in trouble?	Parts of the country are starting to treat cannabis like alcohol when it comes to policing intoxicated driving As states around the country continue to legalize recreational and/or medical cannabis use, more are beginning to treat cannabis like alcohol when it comes to policing intoxicated driving. A recent unanimous decision by the Illinois supreme court found that the smell of burnt cannabis alone does not give police license to conduct a warrantless vehicle search, making it the sixth state supreme court to make such a ruling. In contrast, Wisconsin’s supreme court, ruled the opposite just last year. They found that cannabis odor in a vehicle is probable cause to justify a search (unlike in Illinois, adult recreational cannabis is still illegal in Wisconsin).	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/09/dui-cannabis-vehicle-search	2024-10-09T04:00:13-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d39332f618216a65e65a27a554d660a937a3a2c5/0_141_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=33ea58a2222631e5969c24394e256174
US emergency crews struggle as climate crisis fuels ‘unprecedented’ competing disasters	Resources are stretched thin as the south-east grapples with hurricanes and the west swelters in high temperatures It’s been a brutal week in weather-related disasters across the US. Large parts of the south-east are still grappling with the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene, and another potentially catastrophic storm is barreling towards Florida. At the same time, much of the west has been sweltering amid scorching temperatures, which have elevated fire risks and fueled extreme fire behavior. Hurricanes and fires aren’t abnormal in early autumn. But the climate crisis has turned up the dial and created more opportunities for catastrophes to overlap, ultimately adding strain on relief resources, emergency response, and those who have been impacted by the dangerous and destructive events.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/09/hurricanes-wildfires-climate-crisis	2024-10-09T04:00:12-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4ff237eed8731ba24697d9358481704089cd6c2/0_144_7185_4310/master/7185.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5f4823250296d99e3c6c510b977c8cbe

Wisconsin Senate race tightens as rival attacks Baldwin over LGBTQ+ support	Eric Hovde campaign ramps up efforts to tie Democrat to funding for LGBTQ+ care for youth, as race becomes toss-up As the race between Wisconsin senator Tammy Baldwin and her Republican challenger Eric Hovde tightens, the Hovde campaign and outside groups supporting the candidate have ramped up efforts to tie Baldwin to funding for LGBTQ+ care for youth – echoing the anxieties and biases of the rightwing -parents rights- movement. According to the nonpartisan campaign analysis group Cook Political Report, the race between Hovde and Baldwin – in which Baldwin previously enjoyed an ample lead – is now a toss-up. Internal polling reportedly reflects that trend. The race in Wisconsin is one of a handful that could determine control of the Senate next year.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/09/wisconsin-senate-race-lgbtq-youth-care	2024-10-09T03:00:13-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/703f7a49e3eb449caf171f63652b9ecf608029dc/0_258_8014_4811/master/8014.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9e22bb53d537886926bd8429750e004f

Tory MPs to choose final two leadership candidates for members’ ballot – UK politics live	Robert Jenrick, the bookmakers’ favourite prior to the Tory conference, has implied he is victim of ‘horse trading’ Good morning. Keir Starmer is taking PMQs today, for the first time since the conference season recess and the internal No 10 reshuffle that saw his chief of staff, Sue Gray, in effect sacked. But there may be even more interest in what Bob Blackman, chair of the Conservative 1922 Committee, has to say at 3.30pm, when he announces the names of the two Tory leadership candidates who will go to the ballot of members. One of them is about 99.999% certain to be James Cleverly. The other will be either Kemi Badenoch or Robert Jenrick. They are both candidates for the Tory right, but Badenoch is a lifelong, conviction rightwinger, very popular with Tory members, while Jenrick is someone elected to parliament as a Cameroon moderniser who says he has been radicalised into favouring ECHR withdrawal by his experience in a Home Office unable to control irregular migration. There’s always horse trading, OK, in the final stages …. I’ve been around long enough to know that in the last few votes in these leadership contests there’s always people moving around votes and so on. In this leadership contest over the last few months I think I’ve been the only candidate who has set out specific, clear policies to tackle the big issues facing our country – the NHS, how do we grow the economy, how do we tackle immigration, secure our borders Because I think it’s so important that the Conservative party gets back onto the common ground of British politics, addressing the things that the public really care about.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/09/conservatives-leadership-james-cleverly-robert-jenrick-kemi-badenoch-pmqs-keir-starmer-uk-politics-latest-news	2024-10-09T01:35:57-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0a221525addc194abf14c611e53444f73b32f61/0_86_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0dcac5a1105b35be6c23d1334267dcd3

There are just three weeks to go until the biggest fiscal and political event for any government: the budget. Middle East | Israel has said it is expanding its ground operation in Lebanon with the deployment of a fourth division after another night of intense airstrikes. The reservist 146th division was sent to southern Lebanon overnight, meaning the number of troops on the ground is now likely to number 15,000. The Lebanese health ministry said late on Tuesday 36 people have been killed and 150 have been injured in Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours. Environment | Florida’s western coast was making emergency preparations on Tuesday for the impact of Hurricane Milton, with thousands of evacuees clogging highways, contending with fuel shortages, and the mayor of Tampa warning residents bluntly -you are going to die- if they stayed behind. Conservatives | James Cleverly has topped the latest MPs’ vote in the Conservative leadership contest, making him the new favourite, as Tom Tugendhat became the latest candidate to be eliminated.

Donald Trump claims to have been to Gaza despite no evidence of visit	Former president says territory where 41,000 people have been killed ‘could be better than Monaco’ if developed Donald Trump’s truthfulness as well as his knowledge of Middle East geography has come under fresh scrutiny after the former president claimed to have been to Gaza – although there is no evidence of him ever visiting the war-torn Palestinian territory. Trump raised eyebrows after the Republican nominee in November’s presidential election told Hugh Hewitt, a rightwing radio host, that he had been in the tiny coastal strip where more than 41,000 people have been killed and the majority of buildings badly damaged or destroyed in blistering Israeli military attacks responding to last year’s 7 October attack by Hamas.

Biden sets 10-year deadline for US cities to replace lead pipes	President to announce in Wisconsin EPA rule aimed at ensuring drinking water is safe for all Americans A decade after the Flint, Michigan, water crisis raised alarms about the continuing dangers of lead in tap water, Joe Biden is setting a 10-year deadline for cities across the nation to replace their lead pipes, finalizing an aggressive approach aimed at ensuring that drinking water is safe for all Americans. The president is expected to announce the final Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule Tuesday in the swing state of Wisconsin during the final month of a tight presidential campaign. The announcement highlights an issue – safe drinking water – that Kamala Harris has prioritized as vice-president and during her presidential campaign. The new rule supplants a looser standard set by former President Donald Trump’s administration that did not include a universal requirement to replace lead pipes.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/biden-lead-pipes-drinking-water	2024-10-08T05:09:55-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/854a9b6615b6b7ee62e224d29d961bf5b6f248a7/0_51_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=268e3010c66ef77dd06039c7c2968356
Hurricane Milton barrels toward Florida as Trump spreads falsehoods | First Thing	A top emergency official says lies spread by Donald Trump and his supporters about Hurricane Helene have hampered recovery efforts. Plus: how to combat food waste Good morning. Hurricane Milton is expected to sweep past Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula and hit the south-west coast of Florida by Wednesday evening local time, bringing sustained winds of nearly 155mph (250km/h) to an area already reeling from Hurricane Helene’s devastation 12 days ago. Almost all of Florida’s west coast was under a hurricane warning and more than a million people were told to evacuate. How has the Fema chief responded to Trump’s falsehoods? Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, have accused the Biden administration of -abandoning- people and, baselessly, of being short of disaster relief funds due to money spent on undocumented migrants. (Fema’s housing program, which offers shelter to migrants leaving detention, is separate from its disaster relief program.) Deanne Criswell, the Fema administrator, said these falsehoods were -creating an impedance to our ability to actually get people the help they need-. What else is the right saying about the hurricanes? The far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has been criticised for spreading false conspiracy theories that -they can control the weather-. Though she never specified who she meant by -they-, she has a history of promoting untrue conspiracy theories around the federal government, her political opponents and Jews. What will happen to disaster relief if Trump is elected? Experts say that under the controversial rightwing Project 2025 manifesto, which was authored by numerous former Trump officials, federal forecasting of severe storms and aid given to shattered towns and cities would be drastically scaled back. What else did Harris say? She vowed to raise taxes on billionaires and the biggest corporations in order to fund her economic proposals, which include plans to build millions of new housing units, tax breaks for new parents and $25,000 down-payment assistance for new homebuyers. Will Trump sit down with 60 Minutes? The CBS correspondent Scott Pelley told the audience that Trump cancelled an interview last week, with the Trump campaign providing -shifting explanations- for why the Republican nominee had declined to participate, including that he did not want to be factchecked. What do the polls say? Harris has a narrow lead over Trump in national polls, though the race is in effect neck and neck in the swing states that will decide the election.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/first-thing-hurricane-milton-barrels-toward-florida-trump-falsehoods	2024-10-08T05:06:19-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b940c70a5fd84623b628a5a2b1adb7bef90fe28/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=54d7ca3e6ba380cd88912e0456c369b5

US supreme court to hear arguments in major ‘ghost guns’ case	Garland v VanDerStok first in series of high-profile cases justices will hear in what is set to be contentious term The US supreme court will hear arguments in a case involving the regulation of -ghost guns- – firearms without serial numbers that are built from kits that people can order online and assemble at home. Garland v VanDerStok is the first in a series of high-profile arguments the court will hear in what is likely to be a contentious term. As ghost guns were increasingly used in crimes – including 1,200 homicides and attempted homicides between 2016 and 2022, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms – the Biden administration issued new rules regulating them in 2022. The new ATF rule classified ghost gun kits as firearms under the Gun Control Act of 1968, the US’s main firearms law – making them subject to the same regulations as all other guns.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/us-supreme-court-ghost-guns	2024-10-08T04:00:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bae31897cede8eabda1c4aa79518c2c7be8c22bf/0_161_7329_4397/master/7329.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5308d050a7e566ebe7be091af1a6fd3f

Harris takes narrow lead over Trump in New York Times poll as intense media campaign continues – US politics live	First time vice president has led Trump in Times/Siena poll since July when Joe Biden dropped out of race Good morning, US politics readers. The Democratic US vice-president, Kamala Harris, has taken a narrow national lead over her Republican rival, Donald Trump, in the race for the White House, according to the latest New York Times/Siena College poll, conducted between 29 September and 6 October. Harris has gained support from Republican voters – 9% said this time round they would support her, an increase from 5% last month. 46% of respondents said Harris, 59, represented change this election, compared to 44% for Trump, 78. 61% of non-white voters see Harris as the change candidate, while 29% view Trump this way. Trump was still viewed by more people as a -strong leader-, though this was by a small amount. Trump is leading among male voters by 11 points. 42% of voters surveyed said they personally benefited from Trump’s policies, when he was president between 2016 and 2020, compared to Biden’s policies. Respondents trusted Trump more than Harris to manage the economy, which 75% of the likely voters described as in a -fair or poor condition-, the same as last month. The percentage of voters holding favorable or unfavorable views of Trump and Harris has not changed since September.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/08/kamala-harris-donald-trump-us-election-hurricane-milton-latest-live-news	2024-10-08T03:09:52-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8648484e0249fae8740546a2dcbd6e85b9852d11/0_350_8192_4915/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c1941b215021e821991f2f44ec60dda7

There had been confusion about whether the Cybertruck could be driven in Europe, owing to strict road safety rules that ban sharp edges and require speed limiters on vehicles that weigh more than 3.5 tonnes when full. Tesla’s manual lists the angular steel vehicle as having a gross vehicle weight of 4 tonnes.

Experts warn such disasters will be deepened if Donald Trump is elected and follows the policy plans of the controversial rightwing Project 2025 manifesto. Under Project 2025, authored by numerous former Trump officials but disavowed by the former president himself, the federal forecasting of severe storms and aid given to shattered towns and cities would be drastically scaled back.

Labour won’t be able to rely on ethnic minority voters as ‘bloc’ of support in future, says major report – UK politics live	Thinktank UK in a Changing Europe has publishes major report on attitudes and voting behaviours of ethnic minority Britons Good morning. Labour has already been in office for almost 100 days, but in some respects it still feels like we’re at the start of a new political season. This morning Keir Starmer is chairing his first cabinet since Morgan McSweeeney replaced Sue Gray as the key aide in No 10 (a move which could have radical implications, as Pippa Crerar reports here), this afternoon Tory MPs are holding another ballot to elect their next leader, and, with the conference recess over, MPs are getting down to a busy three months of parliamentary business, with the budget only three weeks away tomorrow. Labour won a big majority at the election, but the big story of politics in recent years is the fragementation of the electorate, and this morning the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe has published a major report on the attitudes and voting behaviours of ethnic minority Britons. For anyone interested in this topic, it has lots of very good data, but two findings in particular stand out. Labour will not be able to rely on ethnic minority voters as a ‘bloc’ of support in the future, the report says. In his introduction James Kanagasooriam, the pollster from Focaldata who produced the data used in the report, says that it is still the case that, overall, ethnic minority Britons are much more likely to vote left than right than white Britons. He says: At the 2024 election, the combined vote share of Labour, the Greens and the Liberal Democrats was 66% among ethnic minorities, while that for the Conservatives and Reform UK was 26%. Among white voters, the equivalent figures were 53% and 41%. Any discussion over Labour’s problems with minority voters and Conservative gains needs to be tempered by these facts. At future elections, Labour cannot rely on ethnic minority voters as a ‘bloc’ of support. It is true that the Labour Party still convinces a far greater proportion of minorities with ‘warm’ views of the party to vote for it than the Conservative Party does. But among many ethnic groups, there is a fundamental disjunction between opinion on the salient issues of the day and voting patterns. Our polling suggests that Labour support among ethnic minorities is an ossified cultural and historical legacy that could disappear very quickly. Having a degree makes white voters more leftwing, but ethnic minority voters more leftwing, the report says. In his introduction Kanagasooriam describes this as the Lee Anderson-Rishi Sunak factor in Tory support. He explains: The demography of right and left is vastly different between white and non-white voters. White voters differ hugely on their educational profile, with non-graduates drifting right over the last 20 years, and graduates to the left. Amongst non-white Britons, graduate level education makes you proportionately more likely to be Conservative. Class cleavages and patterns that have disappeared from the voting patterns of white Britons exist and are indeed getting stronger amongst non-white voters. The Conservative Party will continue to have its esoteric coalition of affluent minorities and nongraduate whites and Labour the opposite. In other words, the Lee Anderson - Rishi Sunak spectrum is a feature, not a bug, of right-wing politics.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/08/labour-keir-starmer-tory-leadership-latest-politics-live-news	2024-10-08T01:17:28-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f312e371cdc8462f0af463e5817b68c979efe8d/0_267_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8a2b7d6f071c621adeadd89c354e0adc

Germans decry influence of English as ‘idiot’s apostrophe’ gets official sanction	Linguistic body has relaxed rules on use of apostrophe to show possession, not traditionally correct in German A relaxation of official rules around the correct use of apostrophes in German has not only irritated grammar sticklers but triggered existential fears around the pervasive influence of English. Establishments that feature their owners’ names, with signs like -Rosi’s Bar- or -Kati’s Kiosk- are a common sight around German towns and cities, but strictly speaking they are wrong: unlike English, German does not traditionally use apostrophes to indicate the genitive case or possession. The correct spelling, therefore, would be -Rosis Bar-, -Katis Kiosk-, or, as in the title of a recent viral hit, Barbaras Rhabarberbar.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/07/germany-influence-of-english-idiots-apostrophe	2024-10-07T12:19:31-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7661f39ffa2235475d11abcaa34bcdf072507d68/0_227_3369_2022/master/3369.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=98e7dc86766823753a656116dba11f02

Even a hint wouldn’t have made much difference. Are they east, west, south or north of Mauritius? To be in with a shout, you have to know where Mauritius is.

Trump allies threaten Deloitte contracts after employee leaks Vance comments	Donald Trump Jr leads charge to penalize consultancy firm after critical messages about his father were made public Donald Trump’s supporters have threatened the consultancy firm Deloitte with the loss of lucrative government contracts if he returns to the White House after the election in November because one of its employees leaked critical comments about his presidential performance made by his running mate JD Vance.

He had been fighting for hours with an AK-47 taken from a dead Hamas militant. Now he and three friends were headed to the town of Ohad to search for relatives who had gone missing. -Only when we set off south did we understand how big this was. It was like an apocalypse,- the engineer, who did not want to be named, said last week. -There were hundreds of bodies of civilians inside their cars or on the road, hundreds of dead terrorists with their pickup trucks or motorbikes.

First Thing: One year after the 7 October attacks	As Israel mourns those killed one year ago today, attacks on Lebanon and Gaza continue. Plus: the aftermath of Hurricane Helene Good morning. One year ago, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people – the deadliest event for Jewish people since the Holocaust. A further 251 were taken hostage. In the months that followed, the Israeli offensive in Gaza laid waste to the densely populated coastal territory and has so far killed almost 42,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities. How many hostages remain in Gaza, one year later? Nearly 100 hostages have yet to return home. While hopes were raised by the release of 117 hostages early in the war, including 105 in an exchange during a brief ceasefire in November 2023, more dead hostages than alive have been found during Israeli operations as the offensive has dragged on. One year later, some families are just learning that their loved ones had been killed in the initial attacks, with their remains still in Gaza. How are the families of hostages coping? -I’ve had enough. A year is just too long. I can’t take it any more,- says Aviva Siegel, who was held hostage for 51 days before being released but whose husband, Keith, is still captive. For the families of the six Thai migrant workers who are still being held, the lack of news has been unbearable. What is happening in Gaza? The Israel Defense Forces has called on residents in the northern Gaza Strip, where 300,000 people are estimated to have remained, to evacuate southward towards the so-called humanitarian zone of al-Mawasi, where an estimated 1 million displaced people are sheltering. One year later, what are conditions like for Palestinians in Gaza? Health workers who volunteered in Gaza say that beyond the airstrikes and military operations that have destroyed much of the territory, malnutrition is a huge problem, as well as worsening sanitation and the limited access to water. Medical supplies are hard to come by, with medics reporting that they are operating without essentials such as surgical gowns and gauze. While polio vaccinations started last month, the brutal reality was that some of the children being vaccinated in the morning would be seen as casualties by the evening, said one doctor.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/07/first-thing-one-year-after-the-7-october-attacks	2024-10-07T05:01:02-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85d4b828df8e3e707165f05df75e7065114325f8/0_0_4888_2933/master/4888.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=28f8c4cec69285dd08a261b6ad0cf74e

Israel’s lack of vision in multi-fronted war may be fatally exposed	After Iranian strikes damage bases and IDF take casualties in Lebanon, experts say Israel’s military doctrine could be found wanting As Israelis approached the beginning of the high holy days last week on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, the news began to circulate. Several IDF units fighting on the border with Lebanon had taken casualties in at least two different locations. Soldiers had died in combat, and many were wounded. The confirmation of the wounded and dead, if not the circumstances served as a stark reminder for Israelis of the blows that come in war, even as Israel’s punishing air offensive has killed hundreds of Lebanese and wounded more. The soldiers’ deaths came after two weeks in which Israel struck a series of blows against Hezbollah, including the assassination of the group’s leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and most of the top leadership.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/06/israel-iran-war-idf-lebanon-military-doctrine	2024-10-06T08:20:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53d846ef7777663f6693cdf042f2c9ecd14373ed/0_213_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=212ac06a0104c3d7abd1188e19f44f75

Harris campaign announces media blitz as Melania Trump gives interview to Fox – live	Donald Trump to speak at an event in Juneau, Wisconsin, his fourth scheduled stop in eight days in the state Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump is scheduled to speak at an event in Juneau, Wisconsin, on Sunday, his fourth scheduled stop in eight days in the state. Republicans are trying to rack up support in Wisconsin, which has only flipped red once in the past 40 years, when Trump won the state in 2016. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz are slated to sit down with major TV personalities this week. Walz is slated to sit down with Fox News’s Shannon Bream on Sunday for his first solo interview. On Monday, he’ll join Jimmy Kimmel Live. On Tuesday, Harris will be in New York for appearances on The View, The Howard Stern Show, and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. After the US supreme court granted Donald Trump significant immunity from prosecution for actions during his presidency, the court is set to embark on its next nine-month term on Monday with public confidence in the court still reeling following the ruling compounded by the ethically dubious conduct of some justices. The White House moved Saturday to quash claims that government officials control the weather, including a far-fetched rumor circulating on social media that Hurricane Helene was an engineered storm to allow corporations to mine regional lithium deposits. Republican fearmongering about crime in major cities like Atlanta is serving to stoke racial tensions and suppress the growing political power of Black Democrats, despite a decline in crime rates, writes The Guardian’s George Chidi.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/06/kamala-harris-donald-trump-melania-joe-biden-latest-us-politics	2024-10-06T07:39:23-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05b76046630db26a4c22dc39c3bf648835c8fcde/0_150_3105_1863/master/3105.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b24ee5f393efe51c8f21986a6624e8af

Parkrun at 20 years old: how a gentle jog turned into a 5km Saturday morning obsession	The event, which is celebrating its anniversary today, has grown into a global phenomenon – and made us feel a whole lot better Twenty years ago, on a windy, autumnal Saturday morning, 13 runners showed up to a park in south-west London for an event called the Bushy Park Time Trial. A 5km course was plotted and the organiser, Paul Sinton-Hewitt, a computer programmer who grew up in South Africa, bought washers from a hardware store to hand out as finish tokens. The times were tapped up on a laptop afterwards in a local Caffè Nero. This Saturday, the weather hadn’t much improved – overcast, with the sun straining to peek through – and the venue was the same: picturesque Bushy Park with its resident red deer squaring up, ready to rut. But pretty much everything else about the impromptu get-together has evolved. Since 2008, it has been known as Parkrun and there are now 2,500 weekly events – all 5km, all free – in 22 countries, everywhere from the slopes of Mount Etna to 25 UK prisons to the Falkland Islands. In a typical week, around 350,000 people will take part. Runner’s World hails it a -global phenomenon-.	https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/05/parkrun-at-20-years-old-how-a-gentle-jog-turned-into-a-5km-saturday-morning-obsession	2024-10-05T13:15:32-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67c502ff5689f3dc66e76c75801f22002edd2c34/918_1390_6804_4082/master/6804.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0893e5a4c568d46fca20b90e0d72b71a
Doubts grow over Labour’s VAT plan for private schools	The Treasury refuses to confirm 1 January start date as unions, tax experts and school leaders say it is unworkable Government plans to impose VAT on private schools from 1 January next year may have to be delayed because of warnings from unions, tax experts and school leaders that meeting the deadline will cause administrative chaos and teacher job losses, and put pressure on the state sector. The Treasury on Saturday night refused to confirm that the plan to impose 20% VAT on private school fees would go ahead from 1 January, as confirmed by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in July, instead saying it would be introduced -as soon as possible-.	https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/oct/05/doubts-grow-over-labours-vat-plan-for-private-schools	2024-10-05T12:00:33-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c03fd8ceb2b4f41369d6b59fac472c363b4fe1d3/564_843_4062_2437/master/4062.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=60b54543f6cb6ba032817a86cb9bd5ce

Waiter! Soho’s cafe society confused after law changes on tipping	Staff should now receive every penny paid in tips – including service charges Whoever said it’s better to give than to receive wasn’t talking about tipping. Waiters around the UK should be starting to receive a £200m-a-year bonanza thanks to a new law that means every penny paid in tips, including service charges, on a restaurant bill will have to go to staff. Yet exactly how much of the money will end up in servers’ pockets is unclear. The law was changed because some restaurants took service charges as part of their profits or to pay for overheads such as lighting.	https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/oct/05/waiter-sohos-cafe-society-confused-after-law-changes-on-tipping	2024-10-05T11:22:37-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b396c0cc4049d2116fa5726285f4b77d0bfdefae/0_541_8139_4883/master/8139.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=48bbcdfb8d05761094b880ba8ba29cc8

Wealthy, white and rightwing: the Tory members holding the party’s future in their hands	The electorate for the Conservative leadership contest likes a winner, but lately has had trouble picking one The Conservative party is more than just 121 MPs. It’s also tens of thousands of ordinary members. The £39 a year they pay to belong might not entitle them to any real say on the party’s policies, but it does give them the right to help select its candidates and, even better, its leader. Quite how many individual blades make up the Tory grassroots these days, we won’t know until we learn the result of the membership ballot, which starts on 31 October. In 2019, when Johnson was elected leader, it came in at 159,000. And in 2022, when Liz Truss got the nod, it had actually risen to 172,000. But that was considerably down on the 254,000 who got to choose between Davids Cameron and Davis back in 2005 and way off the 2.8 million members that the party claimed to have at its postwar peak in the mid-1950s.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/05/wealthy-white-and-rightwing-the-tory-members-holding-the-partys-future-in-their-hands	2024-10-05T10:31:46-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0259ef94d3210d378e5119acf9d9857df769923/0_350_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6485a8bcff272b48fd532baa02264425

Escalation with Iran could be risky: Israel is more vulnerable than it seems	Intelligence analysis of Tehran’s attack suggests that much-touted Israeli missile defences are not, in fact, impregnable In the aftermath of Iran’s attack on Israel on Tuesday night, Israeli officials claimed their defences had stood firm. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Iran had launched more than 180 missiles, but few details about the damage were released and the US’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the attack -appears to have been defeated and ineffective-. But as Israel prepares its retaliation, analysts believe those initial reports could have been misleading – and could change the calculus of Israel’s response if it fears getting into a bout of protracted -missile ping-pong- with Iran, especially should Tehran choose softer targets in the future.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/05/escalation-with-iran-could-be-risky-israel-is-more-vulnerable-than-it-seems	2024-10-05T09:38:48-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/884fe00fab030e4f8fe0b53646aa773b4e1a67a5/142_0_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b10eef5e809f16f3c4d8be77caf7071d

Donald Trump to appear at Pennsylvania rally, site of first assassination attempt – live	Former president will be joined by family of Corey Comperatore, rallygoer who was killed when gunman fired at Trump Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are touring the country this weekend, while their proxies do the same.

He’ll be joined by the family of Corey Comperatore, a rallygoer who was shot and killed at a July rally. Meanwhile, the vice-president is traveling to North Carolina today, where Hurricane Helene has devastated much of the state, killing at least 200 people.

Israeli strikes hit Beirut as key route out of Lebanon cut off | First Thing	Israel has ordered people in 20 more towns in southern Lebanon to evacuate immediately. Plus: the future of the death penalty in Japan Good morning. As Hezbollah continued to attack northern Israel, the Israeli military launched a series of strikes on southern Beirut in one of the most intense bombardments on the city since the campaign began last week. The New York Times and Axios have reported that Hashem Safieddine, the most likely candidate to replace Hassan Nasrallah as leader of Hezbollah and the head of its executive council, was the target of the strikes. The first airstrike by an Israeli jet in the West Bank since the second intifada: In addition to the attacks in Lebanon, an Israeli airstrike on a refugee camp in Tulkarm in the West Bank killed at least 18 people, including two children. The Israeli military claimed the airstrike killed a local Hamas leader. One year after the 7 October attacks: After one year of war, Israel is facing mounting diplomatic isolation. Pew Research found in May that although most Americans still sympathised with Israel, those under 30 did not, and seven in 10 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents had little or no confidence in the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. How will Israel respond to Iran? The former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak has predicted Israel is likely to mount a large-scale airstrike against Iran’s oil industry and possibly a symbolic attack on a military target related to its nuclear program. Who else is campaigning for Harris? Liz Cheney, one of Donald Trump’s most prominent conservative critics, spoke to undecided voters in Ripon, Wisconsin, on Thursday, asking them to -reject the depraved cruelty- of Trump. Meanwhile, Bruce Springsteen has endorsed Harris, calling Trump -the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime-. What is Tim Walz up to? In a final push to engage Muslim voters ahead of the election, Walz joined a virtual summit hosted by a Muslim advocacy group and called for an end to the war in Gaza. He pledged that if elected, the Harris administration would work -side by side- with Muslim Americans.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/04/first-thing-israeli-strikes-hit-beirut-key-route-lebanon-cut-off	2024-10-04T05:24:59-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d1604f7398daed78982b99beec806397dddc769/0_27_5500_3303/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=00533ffdba7e7d5aa26f8262c8396406

UK Palestinians on the nightmare of watching war unfold from afar	One year on, we speak to those who have lost more than 50 relatives and who call some ministers’ support for the Israeli government ‘shameful’ In September 2023, 45-year-old Mohammed Ghalayini travelled to Gaza from Manchester, where he had lived since 2004, to visit family. He was still there on 7 October when Hamas’s attack on Israel killed 1,200 people. In Israel’s subsequent bombardment of Gaza – which to date has killed more than 41,000 people – he and his family were displaced multiple times, faced shortages of food and water, and endured the relentless sound of drones. Ghalayini is now back in the north of England, but nearly a year into Israel’s war in Gaza, he says every day still brings bad news – whether from family members in WhatsApp messages, or in updates on Facebook, which has become like an -obituary page-. Ghalayini said he feels helpless.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/04/uk-palestinians-nightmare-watching-war-unfold-from-afar	2024-10-04T02:00:04-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95924e630023bc4c04d7b1b942f5265736a67977/0_343_6219_3731/master/6219.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bef8bf39382b752d7d9f5d79cabf6b81

Australia news live: pro-Palestine protesters plan vigil on Monday as NSW force vows ‘high visibility’ policing of Sunday rally	Activists have agreed that no Hezbollah flags will be flown, police say. Follow today’s news live NSW police say they have not opposed revised plans by the Palestinian Action Group for a public assembly on Sunday 6 October, after the group agreed to change the location and route of the rally. -Protest organisers have agreed that no flags, portraits or symbols connected to a prohibited terrorist organisation will be displayed,- police said in a statement on Thursday evening. A previous rally allegedly saw Hezbollah flags waved. One of the changes, having listened to the parliamentary debate, as I did, obviously there was a lot of concern around debt, and that concerned me greatly. And so we’ve made a bit of a tweak in the agency, that if the agency was ever to pursue a debt against a participant, it would need to be signed off by me first, and so that puts a whole lot of safety nets through the process to kind of make it be really clear that raising any debt against a participant would be an absolute last resort. We’re really clear that plan managers know what their expectations are. They know what they’ve got to be absolutely assisting participants. They should be in a really good place to know what you can and can’t claim for. One of the things they sign up for to be a plan manager is being compliant with the NDIS legislation.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/oct/04/australia-news-live-pro-palestine-rally-police-qld-election-youth-justice-teeth-dentists-healthcare-cost-of-living-ntwnfb	2024-10-03T13:54:59-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed48fc478ea24334f2bf4d4c0a19664c2965d97d/369_76_6420_3854/master/6420.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=92fddb25416d1347f1589564a52958d6

What are the risks involved in Israeli options for retaliatory strikes on Iran?	Israel has several possible targets including military, economic or even nuclear sites, but all come with caveats Israel has several options if its leaders want to launch retaliatory strikes against Iran, and while western leaders have urged restraint, a significant assault is expected. Possibilities could include strikes against military, economic or even nuclear targets, although Joe Biden said he had told Benjamin Netanyahu’s government the US would not support the last option. Iran has relatively weak air defences and it is expected it would struggle to prevent Israeli missiles or an air force bombing run, as was revealed on 19 April. Then, Israel, responding to Iran’s previous missile barrage, damaged part of Iran’s best air defence system, a Russian S-300, in the military-industrial city of Isfahan. It was a strike intended to showcase Iran what Israel was capable of.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/03/what-are-the-risks-involved-in-israeli-options-for-retaliatory-strikes-on-iran	2024-10-03T10:13:28-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b4209904db5606b015ade7aaa008e9b124d0e37/72_0_2892_1735/master/2892.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d80ffd2e818c81650668867ec539ffd0

Tories challenge other Labour ministers to follow Keir Starmer in paying back donations – UK politics live	The prime minister said he’d paid back £6,000 worth of gifts and hospitality, including Taylor Swift tickets and his wife’s rented clothing Good morning. Yesterday Keir Starmer made the surprise announcement that he has paid back £6,000 worth of gifts and hospitality, including Taylor Swift tickets and rented clothing for his wife, received since he became prime minister. The news overshadowed reports about what happened on his visit to Brussels to meet the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen (also important – here’s our story), but No 10 felt they had to put the news out yesterday because the donations were all being revealed in the latest update to the Commons register of members’ interests published yesterday. However, as is often the case when a politician under pressure over ethics/transparency makes a concession to critics/the media/public opinion, Starmer has now opened himself up to a whole new bout of questions. The Conservative party (which has a lot of experience of donation scandals) is on the case, and last night it issued this statement. Day after day more and more comes out about the scandal at the top of Keir Starmer’s government. This scandal has become a complete distraction from the job of governing. It appears Starmer will only be transparent when his backs against the wall. This announcement today poses more questions than it answers. Why did Starmer take these freebies in the first place? Why haven’t Angela Rayner and other senior party members not paid back donations?	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2024/oct/03/keir-starmer-angela-rayner-donations-labour-conservatives-uk-politics-news-live	2024-10-03T01:15:34-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83a806fdc65c6089a7752958823504796248be97/0_0_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4329cc32e447d1896d8b9c6726436372

Gulf leaders support Palestine – but many would not mind seeing Israel challenge Iran	The escalating Middle East conflict could create a dangerous vacuum – or an opportunity – for several states The coincidental timing of an emergency meeting of Gulf foreign ministers in Doha with a visit to the same city by the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, for talks with Qatar’s emir raises questions about how the Gulf states will react if Israel pushes ahead with its plan to use its recent military success not just to weaken Iran, but reorder the Middle East. This Sunni coalition of six Gulf monarchs is not naturally well disposed to Iran or its Shia proxies, and only in 2016 labelled Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation. But they also oppose further Israeli escalation, and believe it is ultimately only Washington that has the means to restrain the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/03/gulf-leaders-support-palestine-but-many-would-not-mind-seeing-israel-challenge-iran	2024-10-02T21:00:06-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acf40ffd21301285a47601fa5e0a56588424f14e/0_83_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d8cd5a4eb0f10ed8d35fa3bb37fcc1bd

The Tories’ Fearless Four battle to the end. Alas, that’s just the beginning | John Crace	By the end of the four candidates’ conference speeches, the audience was screaming to be let out. Even before the national anthem Welcome, my friends, to the Show That Never Ends. At least, that’s the way it feels. Hard to believe after weeks of nonsense and four days of the Fearless Four saying the same thing minute after minute that we’ve still got a month of the Tory leadership election to go. I guess we just need to be thankful for small mercies: we may not be at the beginning of the end, but we are at the end of the beginning. God it’s been one hell of a slog.

Middle East escalation, hurricane and strikes could cause Harris triple trouble	As Biden fights three fires at once, Trump sees chance to associate his rival for US presidency with chaos -100- was spelled out in giant numbers on the White House north lawn on Tuesday. It was a birthday tribute to the former US president Jimmy Carter, who served only one term after being buffeted by external events such as high inflation and a hostage crisis in Iran. The current occupant of the White House, Joe Biden, must know the feeling as he fights three fires at once. Iran has launched at least 180 missiles into Israel, six US states are still reeling from Hurricane Helene, and ports from Maine to Texas shut down as about 45,000 dockworkers went on strike.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/02/middle-east-hurricane-helene-dockworker-strikes-kamala-harris	2024-10-02T02:48:28-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c40e197a4ffe1a7d7fb8efa8a67341f3a8f810ae/0_300_4512_2707/master/4512.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f2a6bc17ca0f97f347b5e56d2f14ab82
High-profile Sydney man may have given woman ‘special drink’ spiked with drug before alleged assault, court told	Woman alleged the man gave her a drink in a martini glass and her next memory was waking up in the accused’s bed A -special drink- that a high-profile Sydney man gave to a woman when she visited his house was possibly spiked with a party drug that can result in people passing out, a court has heard. In his closing argument, crown prosecutor Adrian Robertson said the jury -might conclude- this after expert evidence that what the complainant had described was consistent with the consumption of GHB, a drug which can also affect people’s memory.

Walz and Vance embrace an endangered US political species: agreement	A Maga lion in sheep’s clothing and a coach with debate nerves brought brief hope of civility returning to politics There was a strange feeling as the vice-presidential debate got under way in the CBS News studios on Tuesday night that only intensified as 90 minutes of detailed policy discussion unfolded: was the United States in danger of regaining its sanity? After weeks and months of being assailed by Donald Trump’s dystopian evocation of a country on the verge of self-destruction, amplified by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s dire warnings of democracy in peril, here was something very different. The two vice-presidential nominees were embracing that most endangered of American political species: agreement.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/02/trump-vance-vp-debate-analysis	2024-10-02T01:00:34-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cc736d4185472b51bfd402c1e77069aead73674/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=02b6d34ea79cdf17ac1e2e5f33bfa14b
Tory leadership candidates in key face-off at party conference – UK politics live	Jenrick, Badenoch, Cleverly and Tugendhat to all get 20 minutes to pitch their vision to members Good morning. There are plenty of more important things in politics than who becomes the next Conservative leader – two thirds of voters don’t even care, according to Ipsos polling, including almost a third of people who backed the party at the election – but if you are interested in the outcome, today is the most important day in the contest so far. Over the past century most people elected Conservative leader have also been prime minister at some point, so it is normally a consequential choice. Although the four-day conference has, in effect, been a long husting, this morning we’re getting the key face-off. All four candidates are delivering a 20-minute speech in the conference hall. A platform speech to a big audience is always a challenge, but the candidates face two particular difficulties this morning. The truth is this. If we’re to tackle the immense challenges we face, if we’re to restore the public’s trust, we must build something new. A new Conservative party. That is what I call for today. Nothing less than a new Conservative Party built on the rock of our oldest values and best traditions. If I become our leader, this is what – together – we will build. The Conservatives have to be the party of wealth creation. Wealth is not a dirty word. It supports jobs and families. It pays for our schools, for our health service. We should encourage it. Let’s be enthusiastic; relatable; positive; optimistic. Let’s sell the benefits of a Conservative government with a smile. We will not win back voters by pretending to be something we’re not. We win back voters by being honest, by being professional, by being Conservative.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/02/tory-party-conference-jenrick-badenoch-cleverly-tugendhat-starmer-brussels-uk-politics-news-latest	2024-10-02T00:54:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24b7adfb022855c19c11606304eb71a9d3ee375b/0_97_3543_2128/master/3543.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6efaf132294f123945d6079bced10879
