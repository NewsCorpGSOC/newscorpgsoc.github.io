Who were England’s 2024 rioters? – podcast	Racist chants rang out, and homes, businesses and hotels housing asylum seekers were attacked – for a week this summer English towns and cities seemed on the brink of chaos. Josh Halliday reports on what we know so far about the people at the centre of the violence From Aldershot to Southport, riots broke out in English towns and cities this summer. Mosques, homes, shops and cars were attacked. A library was looted. Drivers were stopped and interrogated about their ethnicity, police officers were attacked. In a matter of days, however, many rioters found themselves in court and the violence stopped abruptly. Josh Halliday was in court to hear what many of the rioters, including children, said about why they had caused such havoc. He explains to Helen Pidd how the Guardian’s data team tracked the court filings of 500 rioters to glean information that helped build a picture of the people who terrified communities.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/audio/2024/oct/02/who-were-england-2024-rioters-podcast	2024-10-01T19:00:26-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b14b9ac022293409448d8b1bedd195da6db628b/0_186_6480_3888/master/6480.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1ac3fba2487f16f75947296f5e052a0f

Their sheer speed makes ballistic weapons challenging to intercept, but the initial reports of no fatalities within Israel and one in the West Bank would suggest despite the numbers of missiles launched it was a military failure, though some of the weapons or fragments appear to have struck the ground.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/stopping-iran-attack-would-have-forced-israel-to-use-sophisticated-and-expensive-defences	2024-10-01T13:06:12-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/859573648bd5c30b9f5ad946f08413669d18712e/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=081eb332d1716c4a8e12f3d683944cc6

US justice department announces investigation into Tulsa race massacre	Review of 1921 massacre comes months after Oklahoma supreme court dismissed lawsuit brought by two survivors Late Monday, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) announced it plans to launch the first-ever federal investigation into the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, in which hundreds of Black Tulsans were killed, thousands were displaced and forced into internment camps overseen by the national guard, and Greenwood, the thriving district once known as -Black Wall Street-, was decimated, looted and burned by a racist mob. The review, launched by the civil rights division’s Cold Case Unit, comes after a major setback for survivors and descendants of the massacre. In June, Oklahoma’s supreme court dismissed a lawsuit brought by two survivors, Lessie Benningfield Randle, 109, and Viola Fletcher, 110.

War risks reigniting tensions between Lebanon’s kaleidoscope of communities	If Hezbollah is substantially diminished, there could be an opportunity to rebalance power in the country once again To drive away from Beirut’s Mediterranean coastline is to climb, up into the rugged, unrelenting ridges of Mount Lebanon. The limestone mountain range that traverses huge lengths of Lebanon lent the country not just its name but beauty, diversity – and a combustible political culture that risks being inflamed again as Israeli forces invade. For centuries before modern Lebanon was established, its mountains were a natural barrier to invading armies. For the region’s religious minorities – especially Christians and Druze – they became a sanctuary. Ensconced in remote mountain villages, the kaleidoscope of communities that would eventually form the Lebanese nation developed distinct identities, histories and anxieties over their own survival. Lebanon, one of it great historians, Kamal Salibi, wrote, was -a house of many mansions-.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/war-risks-reigniting-tensions-lebanon-kaleidoscope-of-communities	2024-10-01T09:56:38-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f664117d8718745b6731dc162b5729749bcaffed/0_288_8640_5184/master/8640.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25a9341311cc52af723bd204a0d27cc8

First Thing: Israel launches invasion into southern Lebanon	Israel says ‘heavy fighting’ is under way as it targets Hezbollah. Plus, the Picasso in the cellar Good morning. Israeli forces crossed the border into southern Lebanon early on Tuesday morning, the first Israeli ground invasion into the country since 2006. Why is Israel launching the offensive now? It comes after two weeks of airstrikes, which killed the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on Friday, and a series of deadly explosions to pagers and walkie-talkies that Israel hopes has weakened the agility and organization of Hezbollah. There is also little political incentive for Benjamin Netanyahu to let up, as targeting Hezbollah has given the embattled Israeli prime minister a political boost. What does the invasion mean for the stability of the region? Fears of a wider regional conflict, sparked by the Hamas attacks on 7 October, are closer than ever. The US has called for de-escalation. But, as Joe Biden prepares to leave the White House, Israel’s strongest ally appears to have little leverage. Meanwhile, the reformist-led government of Hezbollah’s backer Iran said it had no plans to send troops to Lebanon, but it was coming under domestic pressure from hardliners.

‘Pattern of negligence’: a chemical plant fire in Georgia forces tens of thousands to take shelter	The smell of chlorine pervades Conyers as residents say BioLab’s accident was a danger hiding in plain sight For Vonnetta West the plume of smoke rising in the sky outside her home in the city of Conyers, Georgia, was a sign not just of immediate risk – but a danger that had been hiding in plain sight for years. The plume was the result of an accident at the BioLab pool and spa chemical company in the city of nearly 20,000 residents about 25 miles east of Atlanta. Tens of thousands of people were impacted by an evacuation order for those immediately nearby or by the wider shelter-in-place order for those further away.

Tory leadership rivals turn on Jenrick over claims SAS ‘killing, not capturing, terrorists’ – UK politics live	Tugendhat and Cleverly echo criticisms from Labour and the military as the Tory conference gears up for another day Good morning. In a leadership contest, sometimes the dynamic changes because one candidate has a postive breakthrough moment (like David Cameron did in 2005, when his passionate, no-notes speech to the Tory conference turned him almost overnight into the favourite). But more often the odds shift because someone has messed up. Kemi Badenoch’s campaign faltered this week after her maternity pay gaffe. And now Robert Jenrick, the bookmakers’ favourite, has also made an error serious enough to cost him support. Yesterday he released a video claiming that that UK special forces are -killing rather than capturing- terrorists because of fears that European laws would free any detained assailants. As Rajeev Syal, Jessica Elgot and Dan Sabbagh report, he has been condemned for saying this by Labour and by figures in the military. No, I don’t. I think what he said is wrong, and I’m afraid demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of military operations and the law of armed conflict. I’m extremely concerned that such words should not be seen in any way to encourage people to take any action other than surrender to British forces when asked to do so. You’re going to have to ask Robert to justify that statement. That’s not something which I have heard, that’s not something which I’m comfortable repeating. When we have a threat to the UK, this lunacy of being unable to render people across borders or arrest people in countries whose police forces are unacceptable, means that we are more often than not forced into taking lethal action than actually raiding and detaining.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/01/tory-leadership-rivals-turn-on-jenrick-sas-claims-tugendhat-cleverly-badenoch-tory-conference-uk-politics-live	2024-10-01T00:54:59-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbbea68be56598eb4b28034a85439fcda821a091/0_278_8192_4915/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2636c4fc4403b03a5a5849a93ac83988

‘Everything is dead’: Ukraine rushes to stem ecocide after river poisoning	Russia is suspected of deliberately leaking chemical waste into a river, with deadly consequences for wildlife Serhiy Kraskov picked up a twig and poked at a small fish floating in the Desna River. -It’s a roach. It died recently. You can tell because its eyes are clear and not blurry,- he said. Hundreds of other fish had washed up nearby on the river’s green willow-fringed banks. A large pike lay in the mud. Nearby, in a patch of yellow lilies, was a motionless carp. -Everything is dead, starting from the tiniest minnow to the biggest catfish,- Kraskov added mournfully. Kraskov is the mayor of the village of Slabyn, in Ukraine’s northern Chernihiv region. The rustic settlement – population 520 – escaped the worst of Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion. But the war arrived last week in a new and horrible form. Ukrainian officials say the Russians deliberately poisoned the Seym River, which flows into the Desna.

Swathes of Kathmandu were left underwater after the heaviest monsoon rains in two decades fell on Friday and Saturday, washing away entire neighbourhoods, bridges and roads. The heavy rains caused the Bagwati River, which runs through the city, to swell more than 2 metres higher than deemed safe.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/more-than-200-dead-in-nepal-floods-as-parts-of-kathmandu-left-under-water	2024-09-30T06:28:57-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9132a0e3db553a7dea6427893d5c01a323062bea/0_241_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9eb924cf1b18cef836d753d21481c2c7

Austrian parties to begin talks on forming government after far-right win	Exit polls show Freedom party’s election gains came thanks to strong support among younger voters Austria’s main parties are preparing to begin tense wrangling to form a government amid warnings about the country’s democracy after the far right’s watershed victory in a general election that saw angry voters punish centrist incumbents over migration and inflation. On Sunday the anti-Islam, Kremlin-friendly Freedom party (FPÖ) scored its strongest result since its founding after the second world war by former Nazi functionaries and SS officers with just over 29% of the vote. The outcome surpassed expectations and beat the ruling centre-right People’s party (ÖVP) by nearly three percentage points. The centre-left opposition Social Democratic party (SPÖ) turned in its worst-ever performance with 21% while the Greens, junior partners in government, sank to just 8%.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/austria-election-talks-forming-government-far-right-freedom-party-win	2024-09-30T06:01:43-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/371a530c1a7bfc2c99a0be9764be452a4ee402b3/0_0_4872_2923/master/4872.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f286b6502648adaa030c0f7ff3afe14f
Biden to address Hurricane Helene damage as Trump tries to turn it into campaign issue – US politics live	President to speak about response to storm; Trump to hit campaign trail in Georgia after accusing Biden and Harris of turning blind eye to destruction Good morning, US politics blog readers. After churning across the southern US and causing massive destruction and dozens of deaths in North Carolina, Georgia and elsewhere, Hurricane Helene appears set to collide with the presidential campaign. Donald Trump will speak this afternoon in Valdosta, Georgia about the storm, undoubtedly with an eye on turning the swing state’s voters away from Kamala Harris. The former president has already made the hurricane’s destruction into an attack line on the Democrats, reportedly accusing Joe Biden of -sleeping- as the storm raged. Speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania yesterday he also accused Harris of turning a blind eye to the destruction. Biden plans to speak from the White House at 10.30am ET about his administration’s response to the storm, while Harris has announced the cancellation of campaign events in Las Vegas today so she can return to Washington DC and be briefed on the storm’s impact at Fema headquarters. She’ll arrive just after 5pm. Harris’s economic policies are more popular with voters than Trump’s, new polling commissioned by the Guardian finds. The vice-president laid out her plans in a major speech last week. The vice-presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz is set for tomorrow evening, with both candidates preparing for what is currently the last scheduled debate before the election. Israel may or may not be on the verge of launching a ground invasion of Lebanon.

Plus, New Zealand reclaims haka world record Good morning. Hamas said on Monday the leader of its operation in Lebanon, Fatah Sharif Abu al-Amine, had been killed in an Israeli airstrike in the country’s south, with Lebanon’s national news agency reporting that the bombing struck a Palestinian refugee camp. What’s happening in Israeli politics? The opposition lawmaker Gideon Saar rejoined the government on Sunday, a step that is likely to strengthen the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. What did Netanyahu tell the UN? On Friday he shrugged off global appeals for a ceasefire in a defiant speech delivered barely an hour before massive airstrikes targeting Hezbollah’s leader levelled several apartment blocks in Beirut.

Jenrick tells Tory conference it’s ‘leave or die’ as he ramps up calls for UK to exit ECHR – UK politics live	The former immigration minister, currently the bookmakers’ favourite to become leader, will take part in a Q&amp;A at the Tory party conference today Labour has called for an investigation into £75,000 of donations to Tory leadership contender Robert Jenrick, saying it had -serious concerns- about the money’s ultimate origin, PA Media reports. PA says: Jenrick, the frontrunner for the Conservative leadership, received three donations of £25,000 in July from The Spott Fitness, a fitness coaching app provider. As first reported by the Tortoise news website, the company’s latest accounts show it has no employees, has never made a profit and has more than £300,000 of debts, and in January it registered a loan from Centrovalli, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands. Our party’s survival rests on restoring our credibility on immigration. If we continue to duck and dance around this question our party has no future. Despite what others might falsely claim, we’ve never had a legal cap on legal migration. Unless we introduce one – where no visas will be issued unless net migration is in the tens of thousands or lower – we will be powerless to end the cycle of broken promises.

Far-right Freedom party winning Austrian election, first results show	Party projected to beat centre-right People’s party by three points, surpassing expectations Preliminary results from Austria’s general election showed the far-right Freedom party (FPÖ) winning the most votes for the first time in the postwar period as it rode a tide of public anger over migration and the cost of living. It was projected to beat the co-ruling centre-right People’s party (ÖVP) by three points, surpassing expectations.

Middle East crisis live: Israel continues bombardment of Lebanon as Hezbollah mourns leader’s death	More than 1,000 people killed in Lebanon and one million displaced by Israeli strikes, Lebanese minister says Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the conflict in the Middle East. Israel has continued its attacks on Lebanon, with its military claiming to have hit dozens of Hezbollah targets in the past hours, a day after the Lebanese militant group confirmed its leader Hassan Nasrallah had been killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut. More than 1,000 people have been killed in Lebanon and more than 6,000 wounded as a result of Israeli attacks in the past two weeks, the health ministry said, and about one million Lebanese people have been displaced by the strikes, including hundreds of thousands since Friday, Nasser Yassin, the minister coordinating the government’s crisis response, has told Reuters. The Lebanese ministry of public health reported last night that the Israeli attacks across Lebanon yesterday killed 33 people and injured 195 others, according to Wafa, the Palestinian news agency. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has confirmed the death of Brig Gen Abbas Nilforoushan, deputy commander of IRGC operations. He was killed in the Israel’s air strikes on Lebanon on Friday which also killed other senior Hezbollah figures, including the group’s leader Hassan Nasrallah. In its statement mourning Nilforoushan’s killing, the IRGC condemned -crimes of the Zionist regime- in Lebanon and praised his role in defending the -resistance front- and Iran. It didn’t vow revenge against Israel. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has said Lebanese people are the new target of -Israel’s policy of genocide, occupation and invasion.- The Turkish leader, who has been highly critical of Israel’s ongoing assault on Gaza, said children were among Lebanese civilians who have been -murdered- by -brutal- Israeli strikes conducted on Lebanon this week. -By the grace and power of God, the blows struck by the Resistance Front on the worn-out, deteriorating body of the Zionist regime will become even more crushing,- said Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei about Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. He went on to add: -The foul-natured Zionist regime has not become victorious by carrying out this atrocity.- Iran’s parliament speaker, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, commenting on the killing of Nasrallah, said on Sunday that what Iran terms -resistance groups- will continue to confront Israel with the help of Iran, according to Iranian state media. Iran has called for the UN security council to meet over Israel’s assault on Lebanon and across the region. Joe Biden ordered the Pentagon to enhance America’s defence posture in the region. He said: -The United States fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and any other Iranian-supported terrorist groups.- UN secretary general António Guterres said he is -gravely concerned by the dramatic escalation of the events in Beirut in the last 24 hours-. He went on to add: -This cycle of violence must stop now. All sides must step back from the brink.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/29/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-bombardment-lebanon-hezbollah-hassan-nasrallah-latest	2024-09-29T00:33:49-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/069368af9afa369a52f22d68dabf30eaf6c45494/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3a20c1d8a0d4ee7410cffb47fba068cc

‘World of horrors’: families huddle on Beirut’s streets amid the bombs	Residents of Lebanon’s capital flee their homes and seek shelter as the death toll from Israel’s airstrikes rises Gunshots fired into the air, women wailing in the streets, the ever-present buzz of drones and the distant thud of Israeli airstrikes: this was the sound of mourning in Beirut on Saturday. Hassan Nasrallah, who led Hezbollah for 32 years, was dead, killed in an Israeli airstrike on Dahieh, in the southern suburbs of Beirut, the day before. For many in Lebanon, his killing had been unimaginable. But Israel’s war with Hezbollah had long surpassed what was previously thought possible. Pagers had exploded in hands, walkie-talkies blew up in belts and Israeli warplanes killed hundreds in half a day. The death of Nasrallah was one more blow to the Lebanese psyche, already struggling to grasp soaring death tolls and, for some, the loss of their home overnight.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/28/world-of-horrors-families-huddle-on-beiruts-streets-amid-the-bombs	2024-09-28T12:25:51-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e868600619a275d3bdf336c4abf96549eecf4f6/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a48dad94232565775e4248b4f2d42074

Writing in the Times on the eve of the party’s annual conference in Birmingham, Lady May said the remaining candidates for the Tory leadership could -play into Reform’s hands- by failing to understand the reasons behind their electoral humiliation.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/28/tories-too-focused-reform-lib-dem-threat-theresa-may	2024-09-28T04:35:12-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92f77ae34fb28a187044fd4b122f58a360cca2f2/105_694_5510_3306/master/5510.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ce6cf7afd6e0ac5b0b8d7e3eaa316e80

The Guardian’s newest poll tracker, based on a range of surveys conducted across a 10-day period, shows the vice-president and Democratic nominee at 48.2%, compared with 44.4% for Trump, the Republican candidate and former president – giving Harris a 3.6-point advantage.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/28/harris-stretches-lead-over-trump	2024-09-28T03:00:14-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16466f57d22dbf81438c8f8783215127213ee608/0_6_3014_1809/master/3014.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d176d88caf8448cb5945380a801f322b

Russia-Ukraine war live: six reported killed in Sumy after Russian strikes on hospital	Ukraine’s interior minister said one person killed in initial attack before the site was hit again during the evacuation At least six people were killed Saturday morning following two consecutive Russian strikes on a medical centre in Sumy, a city in northeastern Ukraine. Ihor Klymenko, Ukraine’s interior minister, said on Telegram that one person died in the initial shelling that destroyed several floors of the hospital – but during the evacuation of the hospital’s patients, Russian forces struck again, killing more. A policeman was one of the six confirmed dead. China and Brazil on Friday pressed ahead with an effort to gather developing countries behind a plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine – an effort that Zelenskyy has dismissed as one that serves Moscow’s interests. Seventeen countries attended a meeting on the sidelines of the UN general assembly chaired by China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, and Brazilian foreign policy adviser Celso Amorim. Wang told reporters they discussed the need to prevent escalation in the war, avoid the use of weapons of mass destruction and prevent attacks on nuclear power plants. Zelenskyy, in a speech to the assembly earlier this week, questioned why China and Brazil were proposing an alternative to his own peace formula. Proposing -alternatives, half-hearted settlement plans, so-called sets of principles- would only give Moscow the political space to continue the war, he said. US secretary of state Antony Blinken, speaking after a meeting with Wang, underscored strong US concerns about China’s support for Russia’s defence industrial base. He told reporters that China, while saying it seeks an end to the Ukraine conflict, -is allowing its companies to take actions that are actually helping Putin continue the aggression. That doesn’t add up.- South Korea’s foreign minister said Russia was engaging in illegal arms trade with North Korea, reiterating statements by the US, Ukraine and independent analysts that Pyongyang is supplying rockets and missiles in return for economic and other military assistance from Moscow. Misuse of Russia’s right to veto as a permanent member of the UN security council is hindering the UN’s efforts to end war, foreign minister Cho Tae-yul said during the UN general assembly on Saturday. Finland will place a key Nato base less than 200 kilometers (125 miles) from its border with Russia, -sending a message- to its eastern neighbour, the defence ministry said Friday. Finland became a Nato member last year, dropping decades of military non-alignment after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. A Russian drone may have breached the national airspace of Nato member Romania for -a very brief period of under three minutes- overnight during an attack on neighbouring Ukraine, the Romanian defence ministry said on Friday. Three people were killed in the attack, according to Ukrainan officials. Russia’s FSB security service is investigating three foreign journalists for reporting in parts of Russia’s Kursk region occupied by Ukrainian forces, bringing the total of such investigations to 12. The three, Kathryn Diss and Fletcher Yeung from Australia’s ABC News and Romanian journalist Mircea Barbu, are being investigated for illegally crossing the Russian border, state news agency Ria Novosti reported.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/28/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-putin-latest-news	2024-09-28T00:44:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eee381ef4c6ec3d72a8e51097bf4f2bbfcbe0af3/0_250_8640_5184/master/8640.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9db2efa71e9c893fb00be18cbaaab2dc

At least three killed as Hurricane Helene makes landfall | First Thing	Hurricane Helene is expected to bring life-threatening storm surges as high as 20ft. Plus, Eric Adams charged Good morning. Hurricane Helene made landfall as a category 4 hurricane in the Florida Big Bend region around 11.10pm ET on Thursday, one of the strongest hurricanes on record to hit Florida. The storm weakened to a category 1 overnight. How dangerous is a storm surge? As a hurricane approaches a coast, the churning winds force ocean water up onto land; atmospheric pressure from the storm also helps squeeze the water ashore. The shallower the continental shelf, the higher the threat of a dangerous surge. Water is heavy, and it can move fast in a surge, sweeping people to their deaths, throwing about boats and vehicles, and pulverizing structures. Follow our live blog here.

Donald Trump may be the president of the United States in a couple of months’ time so of course, it’s important to have meetings with him and to build a relationship with him. Whatever criticisms one may have of Donald Trump, the point is that the office of president is one that needs to be properly respected and the Americans are very close friends of ours.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/27/new-leader-scottish-conservatives-keir-starmer-labour-uk-politics-live	2024-09-27T01:27:10-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0d3769e338c4d59d03a47154f04c5143396b320/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d1d875842b3d0fe18b751f6997bb3fb5

Middle East crisis live: Israeli and US officials discuss Lebanon ceasefire proposal on sidelines of UN general assembly	The meeting comes after Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel would not stop its attacks on Hezbollah despite calls for a temporary truce Israeli and US officials have met to discuss a US-backed ceasefire proposal with Hezbollah, the office of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late on Thursday. The meetings – which happened in New York on the sidelines of the UN general assembly, would continue in the days ahead, Netanyahu’s office said, adding that they appreciated the US efforts. Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel -will not stop- its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon despite calls from the US, France and other allies for an immediate three-week ceasefire. The Israeli prime minister told reporters that his government’s policy was clear as he landed in New York on Thursday. -We are continuing to strike Hezbollah with full force, and we will not stop until we reach all our goals,- Netanyahu said. The US and France called for a 21-day temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah to make way for broader negotiations. A joint statement calling for -a diplomatic settlement- of the crisis was also endorsed by the UK, Australia, Canada, the European Union, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. It called for an urgent cessation of hostilities, which presented -an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation-. Lebanon’s minister for foreign affairs, Abdallah Bouhabib, has said his country is enduring a crisis that -threatens its very existence-. Speaking at the UN general assembly, he has said that his government welcomed yesterday’s ceasefire plan raised by the US and France – and demanded it be implemented. US officials hope to persuade Netanyahu to accept the ceasefire proposal by the time he addresses the UN general assembly on Friday. They argue that a pause in the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah could also provide a breathing space in which to revive long-stalled negotiations with Israel and Hamas over the release of Israeli hostages in return for a truce in Gaza. Hezbollah has yet to respond to the call for a truce, although it and its backer, Iran, have previously insisted it would halt its strikes only if there is a ceasefire in Gaza. Israeli airstrikes continued in Lebanon on Thursday, in which health authorities said 92 people had been killed. Two people were killed and 15 others injured, including a woman in critical condition, after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on Thursday, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. Israel said it carried out a strike that it said killed one of the heads of the Hezbollah air force unit, Mohammad Surur. Hezbollah later confirmed his death. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi movement said it had targeted the northern Israeli town of Safed with dozens of rockets on Thursday in response to Israeli attacks on Lebanon. Later on Thursday, air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and across central Israel. The IDF said the sirens were triggered by a missile fired from Yemen, which it said was intercepted by Israel’s Arrow missile defence system.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/27/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-war-hamas-middle-east-news-latest-updates	2024-09-26T23:26:30-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a20ef191343a34134591c54621c701795bc799a/0_546_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6424944b481a47db51bb8d69e60d3236

Israel has rejected a US-French proposal for a 21-day truce with Hezbollah to allow for comprehensive talks, after three days of Israeli bombing that killed more than 600 people in Lebanon. Why does the US not call for an immediate ceasefire? US diplomats suggested it could be seen as accepting a moral equivalence between the two sides’ behavior, and the US categorizes Hezbollah as a terrorist group. Have others been investigated?

The committee said the footage raised questions about fish mortality.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/25/scottish-salmon-farm-dunstaffnage-cleared-dead-fish-before-inspection-animal-charity-claims	2024-09-25T09:54:44-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e3c012fbce19cf819c2680e438bbccda0c9841d/158_0_2603_1562/master/2603.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bd3d9763afbbb1cadd62f19c2ca51e0d

Iran president’s high-wire appeal for diplomacy buffeted by winds of war	Masoud Pezeshkian calls for ‘new era of cooperation’ in UN speech while hemmed in by escalating tensions and critics at home On his first visit to the US, Iran’s new president has spoken of a -new era of cooperation- with the west. It is an offer that intrigued diplomats, but left them struck by the constraints – ideological, internal and geopolitical – standing in the way of a substantive change in relations. Masoud Pezeshkian came to New York for his first UN General Assembly since his election asking the west to look at Iran again – largely by challenging the double standards that led to its silence about the massacres in Gaza. He has insisted Israel and the US, not Tehran, were the region’s trouble makers.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/25/iran-masoud-pezeshkian-un-speech	2024-09-25T09:29:01-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aca8e29eaa30f7d284e2324431faebdb3c87bcce/0_0_6000_3601/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1328f607255ec8c9a3d42cc622e91296
Secret Service made numerous errors before first near-assassination of Trump, Senate report says	Senate inquiry finds there was no clear security decision-making at rally and general communications chaos The breadth of known Secret Service errors that led up to Donald Trump’s first near-assassination in July widened on Wednesday with the release of a report by the US Senate that found there was no one clearly in charge of decision-making for security at the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, that day – causing -foreseeable, preventable- failings prior to the former president being shot.

Starmer says Tories should apologise for winter fuel payments cut ahead of possible conference defeat – UK politics live	Labour party delegates expected to condemn decision to means-test winter fuel payments as prime minister says Conservatives should apologise Good morning. Keir Starmer is in New York, where he will be addressing the United Nations general assembly (UNGA) later, but the Labour party conference still has half a day to go in Liverpool. Starmer gave a series of media interviews before he left and they are playing out this morning. Speaking to Susanna Reid for ITV’s Good Morning Britain, he refused four time to apologise to pensioners for the cut in winter fuel payments. Delegates will debate the decision at the conference this morning, and they are expected to support a motion championed by the Unite union condemning the decision. On ITV Starmer was asked if he would apologise to a pensioner like Chrissy, who has arthritis and who told the the programme she was dreading winter because her fuel bills would go up by £40 a month, and she would lose the winter fuel payment. Starmer dodged the question, and instead said: Well, I am really concerned that we’ve been put in this position. When you inherit an economy with £22bn missing, it is a really difficult set of choices. The people who should be saying sorry are the last government who left a hole of £22bn, and they should be sorry for that and they should apologise for that.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/25/keir-starmer-labour-party-conference-winter-fuel-payments-conservatives-un-uk-politics-news-latest	2024-09-25T00:37:44-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68934201a6f978d3b4580f87b62f5fa92a3853e4/0_123_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0156a24a67a286591a20cea8e6ddc456

Healthier rice variety could counter rise in diabetes, Philippine scientists say	Researchers develop grain with lower glycaemic index and more protein that ‘could have big impact in Asia and Africa’ Scientists in the Philippines have created a new variety of rice that could help reduce the growing burden of diabetes. More than 537 million adults worldwide are living with the chronic disease – a number that is expected to grow to 783 million by 2045. Being overweight, genetics and a lack of exercise contribute to type 2 diabetes, which is the most common form. Type 2 occurs when the pancreas fails to produce enough of the insulin hormone, leaving too much glucose in the blood, and cells develop a resistance to insulin.	https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/sep/25/health-rice-variety-diabetes-heart-disease-scientific-research-irri-philippines-acc	2024-09-24T23:00:22-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c4386a9e2707e0dd308da15d705bb79acf5a7d4/0_130_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ff521e99a792636532f71cc696cb2196

Starmer needs the public’s trust to be able to make the hard choices to come	Labour needs voters to believe politics can make their lives better not that politicians are all the same, hence why the donations row was so damaging When Keir Starmer wanted to inject a moment of levity into his first speech as prime minister at Labour conference, he told a story about visiting a holiday cottage in the Lake District where the owner joked about wanting to push him down the stairs. As lighter moments go, it had a dark edge. It is British humour, of course, but there is a reason it made an impression on Starmer – it’s a microcosm of what he and his closest advisers see as their greatest threat: the cynicism and disdain with which ordinary people view politicians. The view that they are all the same, all on the take. The widespread lack of trust that politics can make lives better.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/24/starmer-needs-the-publics-trust-to-be-able-to-make-the-hard-choices-to-come	2024-09-24T11:29:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b9cad5327df068ea83e2e78a5df8e612b53a0aa/0_103_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3ef26f51a3ec1221a1e5e3b46c00dc1d

Escalation suggests Israel gambling on bombing Hezbollah into ceasefire	Efforts to bring peace to Gaza prove fruitless as Israel increases airstrikes on Lebanon and Hezbollah return fire with deadlier missiles It is now clear that last Tuesday’s exploding pager operation was just a first step. What is now unfolding is an Israeli strategy of military escalation against Hezbollah, premised on the risky belief that the militant group can be bombed into a ceasefire before fighting in Gaza ends. Monday’s wave of airstrikes in southern Lebanon killed at least 558 people and displaced many thousands, and there is little sign of the campaign slowing. Israel’s air force has said it had dropped 2,000 bombs in 24 hours – and there can be little doubt that this is now a full-on war, though it is not yet an all-out conflict.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/24/escalation-suggests-israel-gambling-on-bombing-hezbollah-into-ceasefire	2024-09-24T10:25:10-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/181bac92fc9d2630b25627adb41c377fcbae3a46/0_279_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=57d0a3dc1e42c1385a5bd064fbeb99b0

Biden to address UN leaders for final time; Trump to campaign in Georgia – live	Biden will make one of the final big speeches of his presidency at 10am ET to the UN general assembly in New York; Trump to speak in Savannah, Georgia, later today Good morning, US politics blog readers. Joe Biden will make one of the final big speeches of his presidency at 10am ET today, when he addresses the UN general assembly in New York. The annual gathering of world leaders is a significant moment for any president, but even more so for Biden, because he’s due to depart the White House in January. His administration has not given many hints of what he might say, but in his speech, you can expect him to make the case for his handling of everything from climate change to Israel’s invasion of Gaza, and potentially the escalating crisis in Lebanon. Donald Trump, meanwhile, will be in Savannah, Georgia, to give a speech at 1pm billed as discussing his policy on taxation and manufacturing. The ex-president’s economic proposals have centered on a combination of tariffs and tax cuts that he argues would lower prices for consumer, after several years of high inflation under Biden. Economists aren’t so sure, and chances are Trump veers away from the subject anyway – he’s known to go off topic throughout his speeches. We’ll be keeping an eye on what both men have to say. Antony Blinken may soon become the latest Biden administration official to be held in contempt. The Republican-led House foreign affairs committee has demanded he testify today, but he has reportedly told them he is busy with the UN general assembly, and when the committee meets beginning at 10.15am, they may vote to sanction him. A scandal brews in New York City’s suburbs. The New York Times reported yesterday that freshman Republican congressman Anthony D’Esposito gave part-time jobs to both his lover and his fiancee’s daughter, which may be a violation of House ethics rules.

Russia-Ukraine war live: War could be ‘closer to end’ than people think says Zelenskyy	Ukraine president says Vladimir Putin is ‘afraid’ of Ukraine’s Kursk occupation We are restarting our live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine and will give you the latest updates throughout the day. Here are the latest developments: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he believes the war with Russia is -closer to the end- than many believe and called on allies to strengthen Ukraine’s army. In excerpts of an interview with ABC News’ Good Morning America, set to be broadcast in full on Tuesday, the president said: -I think that we are closer to the peace than we think … We are closer to the end of the war.- He added: -That’s why we’re asking our friends, our allies, to strengthen us. It’s very important.- Zelenskyy told ABC that Vladimir Putin is -afraid- of Ukraine’s Kursk operation, in which it has taken more than 1,000 square km of Russian territory. Zelenskyy is in the US to attend sessions at the UN general assembly as well as to present a -victory plan- to US President Joe Biden and presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. After a bipartisan meeting with members of the US Congress, Zelenskyy said -decisive action now could hasten the just end of Russian aggression against Ukraine next year-. The US played a -critical role- in protecting freedom around the world, he said in a Telegram post, and praised the US Congress and both main parties for their -unwavering commitment to this cause-. His comments came as Republican presidential candidate Trump suggested Zelenskyy wanted Harris to win the November election. -I think Zelenskyy is the greatest salesman in history. Every time he comes into the country, he walks away with 60 billion dollars,- Trump said at a rally in Pennsylvania. -He wants them [the Democrats] to win this election so badly.- Trump said if he wins the election, he would call Putin and Zelenskyy and urge them to reach a deal to end the war. Zelenskyy also held talks in New York with German, Indian and Japanese leaders on Monday trying to shore up support for Kyiv’s war efforts. -We talked about how to make a just peace closer,- Zelenskiy said on his Telegram messaging app after meeting with German chancellor Olaf Scholz. -The main thing is to maintain unity.- He said he had discussed energy aid with Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida, and that Delhi and Kyiv were -dynamically developing- their relations after a meeting with prime minister Narendra Modi. Jails controlled by Russia are deliberately withholding medical care for Ukrainian prisoners, with doctors in one prison even taking part in what it called -torture-, according to a commission mandated by the UN rights council. The commission, set up by the Human Rights Council to investigate violations in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion, had already concluded that Moscow’s occupying forces were using torture -systematically-. But in his oral report to the council, commission chair Erik Mose said torture had become a -common and acceptable practice-, with Russian authorities acting with -a sense of impunity-. Russian forces launched the latest of a series of strikes on Ukraine’s southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia on Monday evening, killing one person, regional governor Ivan Fedorov said. A city official, quoted by public broadcaster Suspilne, put the injury toll at five, including a 13-year-old girl. Strikes on the city earlier in the day and the previous night wounded at least 23. Russian forces have begun storming the eastern Ukrainian town of Vuhledar, a stronghold that has resisted Russian attack since the beginning of the war, according to Russian war bloggers and state media. Russian state media said the hilltop town in the Donetsk region, which some cast as a fortress due to its enduring resistance to Russian attack, was caught in a pincer movement by Russian forces and that battles were under way in the east of the settlement. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the UN general assembly, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said it was clear that Russia was receiving new weapons, including Iranian missiles despite Tehran’s repeated denials.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/24/volodymyr-zelenskyy-russia-ukraine-war-live-latest-news-updates	2024-09-24T00:28:59-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbf614bd650644494a5d3c99f33ba3460d0a0f1d/0_98_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8d93a3728782cd674552c1dc1baa709b
Starmer to deliver Labour conference speech with left alarmed by plan for crackdown on benefit fraud – UK politics live	PM to deliver message of qualified optimism but expected announcement on benefit fraud concerns left of party Good morning. Keir Starmer is giving his speech to the Labour confernece this afternoon and, as the Guardian reports, his overall message will be one of qualified, long-term optimism. Another leader might have dressed this message up in poetic rhetoric, but Starmer will be using a straightforward cliche, telling the audience -there’s light at the end of the tunnel-. He will say: The truth is that if we take tough long-term decisions now, if we stick to the driving purpose behind everything we do: higher economic growth - so living standards rise in every community; our NHS facing the future - waiting lists at your hospital down; safer streets in your community; stronger borders; more opportunities for your children; clean British energy powering your home; making our country more secure ... then that light at the end of this tunnel, that Britain that belongs to you, we get there much more quickly. The legislation will allow fraud investigators to compel banks to hand over information about people’s finances if there is a suspicion they are claiming benefits they are not entitled to. It will also give them powers of -search and seizure- of people’s property in cases involving organised criminal gangs that are exploiting the benefits system.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/24/keir-starmer-labour-conference-speech-latest-live-politics-news	2024-09-24T00:27:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb7ea441523fac097a2dee348bb6171242af5b80/0_184_4991_2994/master/4991.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ed14d32bf1087a00612cb2e3fe773d0e

As it meets against backdrop of Israel’s bombing of Lebanon, is UN too broken to be fixed?	Supporters say UN mediation has prevented even worse outcomes, but security council is stuck in vicious circle As diplomats from nearly 200 member states gather in New York this week for the United Nations general assembly against the backdrop of a massive Israeli bombing campaign in southern Lebanon, a nagging question to be addressed is whether the UN is too broken to be fixed. UN officials are facing three intractable conflicts, in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan. While it remains one of the most important humanitarian organisations on Earth, organising relief efforts for refugees, natural disaster victims and others in dire need, the UN’s principal security body appears to be powerless to intervene in some of the world’s most grinding conflicts.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/24/israel-lebanon-un-general-assembly-united-nations	2024-09-24T00:02:54-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3353a56c8310ce2f2c807ba55034a46939ef64f8/0_126_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e3a8932277be4d22f21d063adc835ae6

Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus may have been co-written by forgotten dramatist	Exclusive: Scholar names Henry Porter as likely co-author of 1604 play after linguistic clues in his surviving work Scholars have long suggested that Christopher Marlowe had a collaborator for the comic scenes of his classic play Doctor Faustus, although his name alone is on the 1604 published edition. Now a largely forgotten dramatist, Henry Porter, has emerged as the likely co-author, based on comparative linguistic evidence that has been unearthed from his surviving play. Doctor Faustus is a tragic story of vanity and greed, in which a scholar sells his soul to the devil in return for knowledge and power. The tragedy is mirrored by scenes of comic horseplay that are now thought to have been written by Porter, who was described by a contemporary as -the best for comedy amongst us-.	https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/sep/24/christopher-marlowe-doctor-faustus-play	2024-09-23T22:00:30-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eb4f9d9f6f1b99ef0c35d6e8fdbb25c09ad2ae2/0_8_1584_950/master/1584.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=020a3147cc0fe6205de22f526576edde

Olaf Scholz’s centre-left party pulled off an unexpected victory in Brandenburg on Sunday, winning 31% after a mass tactical voting drive to exclude the far-right populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/23/germany-social-democrats-sdp-brandenburg-election-aftermath	2024-09-23T10:22:09-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61d9e1d6f15872a8428b4da87904946a88e34dd8/815_1619_5918_3552/master/5918.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bb328b03bd41885fd76d104f21d5e230

Reeves packs up her troubles until budget day and smiles, smiles, smiles | John Crace	The chancellor beamed her way through a conference speech that offered hope at least but little of substance Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone. If you had thought that maybe today was the day when you made that call to Dignitas, then think again. Cancel that flight to Zurich. At least postpone it. Things might not be quite as bad as you had been led to believe. Or rather, they are that bad but there is some small flicker of hope if you can hold on long enough. There will be pain in the short and medium term. There’s no avoiding that. Try to think of it as character building. But possibly, just possibly, you might come through. We happy few. Blinking into the light of the promised land. This was Rachel Reeves’s day. And she knew everything was going to be just fine the moment she woke up to find that Liz Truss had posted yet another cry for help on X. You can now follow the Trusster’s mental decline in real time on social media. It’s got so bad that she now films herself in front of a bookcase where everything is arranged by colour. The kindest explanation is that she thinks she’s filming a hostage video and the books are a coded message for -I’m being held against my will-.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/23/reeves-packs-up-her-troubles-until-budget-day-and-smiles-smiles-smiles	2024-09-23T09:51:12-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f65db6339ec022fa06c4c4541a0e03ecbf0fc298/0_316_6909_4145/master/6909.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9057f48ad0bcb3893baa88714918ecec

Russia-Ukraine war live: Volodymyr Zelenskyy in New York to meet and address UN	Ukraine president to present proposals for ‘victory plan’ to Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump Hello and welcome to the Ukraine live blog. I’m Yohannes Lowe and the time in Kyiv has just gone past 10:30am. Here are the latest developments: Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived in the US on Sunday for a crucial visit to present Kyiv’s plan to end two-and-a-half years of war with Russia. The Ukrainian president will present his proposals – which he calls a -victory plan- – to President Joe Biden, as well as presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and will also attend sessions at the UN general assembly. The visit comes after a summer of intense fighting, with Moscow advancing fast in eastern Ukraine and Kyiv holding on to swathes of Russia’s Kursk region. Kyiv has for weeks pressed the west to allow it to use delivered long-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia – so far to no avail. The Ukrainian president urged his partners to help achieve -a shared victory for a truly just peace-, in a post on X with his nightly video address. -This fall will determine the future of this war,- Zelenskyy said in the address, delivered from a plane. Ukrainian media later reported he landed in New York. He is also due to visit Washington later in the week. The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, indicated that delicate negotiations with the White House to allow Ukraine to use Storm Shadow missiles inside Russia are ongoing, arguing it was a time for -nerve and guts-. The apparent encouragement to Biden comes just over a week after Lammy and the prime minister, Keir Starmer, visited the US president in the White House but failed to resolve the sticking point between two countries. Speaking at a fringe event at the Labour party conference in Liverpool on Sunday, Lammy said it was -a critical time for nerve and guts and patience and for fortitude on behalf of allies who stand with Ukraine-. At least 16 civilians were injured, including a 15-year-old boy, on Sunday evening as a result of Russian airstrikes on the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, Ukrainian officials said on Monday. Rescuers evacuated residents from several damaged apartment buildings, Ukraine’s interior ministry said on Telegram. The ministry said that according to preliminary information Russia used its KAB guided aerial bombs to strike Zaporizhzhia. Russia launched new strikes in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv which hit high-rise apartment buildings, leaving at least 21 wounded in a second consecutive night-time attack, authorities said. The bombs fell on Saturday night on the district of Shevchenkivsky, north of the centre of Kharkiv, which is the second-largest Ukrainian city, local governor Oleh Syniehubov said. A firefighter was killed by a Ukrainian drone in Russia-controlled Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine, the Russian emergencies ministry said on Sunday. The drone’s explosives detonated when Vyacheslav Glazunov, 33, was extinguishing a fire in the Novoaidar district triggered by fallen drones, the ministry said on Telegram. Another two firefighters were injured, it added.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-volodymyr-zelenskyy-new-york-latest-news-updates	2024-09-23T00:34:57-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7285ace841a1848a84dd0167896d1195f8daaf7/0_106_4148_2490/master/4148.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=411ec171adb07841c5f2e1a716b0ea75

Middle East crisis live: IDF urges some residents of southern Lebanon to evacuate amid strikes on Hezbollah targets	Israeli military spokesman says it began striking militant group’s targets after indications Hezbollah was preparing to fire on Israeli territory Welcome to our live coverage of Israel’s war in Gaza and the wider Middle East crisis. The Israeli military said on Monday it was conducting extensive strikes against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon and urged villagers in the country’s south near areas used by the militant group to evacuate. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said it had in recent days dealt Hezbollah -a series of blows it could not have imagined-. The Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said operations would continue until it was safe for evacuated people on the northern Israeli side of the border to return. Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, said Israel did not want a war with Lebanon but that it had a right to self-defence. Israel’s civil defence agency, meanwhile, ordered all schools in the country’s north to close. Israel’s chief of the general staff, Herzi Halevi, said the military was well prepared for the next stages of fighting, which were coming in the next few days. -We will do whatever it takes to removes threats against Israel,- he said in a televised statement. Israeli forces raided the office of global news channel Al Jazeera in the occupied West Bank on Sunday and issued a 45-day closure order. The Israeli military said it closed the Al Jazeera TV office in Ramallah because it incited -terror-, an accusation the network vehemently denies. At least 41,431 Palestinian people have been killed and 95,818 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said. An Israeli airstrike killed at least seven people in the Kafr Qasem school in Beach camp – which was sheltering displaced families – in Gaza City on Sunday, Palestinian health officials said. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said 12 people had been arrested for being operatives collaborating with Israel and planning acts against Iran’s security. The arrests were in six different Iranian provinces, it said. Israel is examining a plan to use siege tactics against Hamas in northern Gaza, Benjamin Netanyahu was quoted by several Israeli media outlets as saying. The prime minister’s office did not respond to a request for comment. The reports on Sunday cited unnamed sources at a closed parliament committee meeting.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/23/middle-east-crisis-live-hezbollah-israel-war-lebanon-evacuations-latest	2024-09-22T22:49:16-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dd8298b1f51433b64da05cafed12022cd9d0e9d/0_239_5052_3031/master/5052.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1b43d4f9844cf674bf3de23902a95fb4
Monday briefing: Will Labour lift the gloom at its first conference in power?	In today’s newsletter: The party have been criticised for being too pessimistic while Keir Starmer has been rocked by a scandal over freebies. Can the party reset their message to the public in Liverpool? • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. Since the party won the election in July, Labour’s messaging has been downcast. Abandoning the high spirits that followed their seismic victory, Keir Starmer has opted for gloom-laden predictions of hard times ahead. The prime minister’s message to the country late last month was that -things will get worse before they get better-. Coming into office and immediately setting expectations so low is a political risk – if there was ever a moment to lead with hope and optimism, critics argue, it is now. As Labour’s annual party conference kicks off in Liverpool, there are big questions about whether the government will move on from the pessimism that has characterised their first few months in power, and steer the tone and tenor of the conversation on to something else. In a conversation in yesterday’s Observer, the prime minister was keen to stress that he offers more than just doom and gloom, with plans to provide a vision for what Britain could be. Israel-Gaza war | Seven people have been killed after an Israeli airstrike hit a school housing displaced people in western Gaza City, Palestinian health officials said. Meanwhile, Hezbollah has said it has entered an -open-ended battle of reckoning- with Israel after launching a series of rocket attacks on the north of the country as world powers implored both sides to step back from the brink of all-out war. Politics | Rachel Reeves will announce that she has ordered investigations into more than £600m worth of Covid contracts awarded under the Conservatives as Labour struggles to get back on the front foot over questions of ethics. Sudan | The UN secretary general, António Guterres, is -gravely alarmed- at reports of a full-scale assault on the Sudanese city of al-Fashir by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and has called on its leader to halt the attack immediately, according to Guterres’ spokesperson. Business | Fifty pubs a month closed for good across England and Wales in the first half of this year, with experts warning that tax rises in 2025 could make it even harder for some businesses to keep their doors open. Inflation | The price of petrol and diesel in the UK is falling at the fastest pace this year, with households paying about £4 less to fill up a family car than they did a month ago.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/23/monday-briefing-will-labour-lift-the-gloom-at-its-first-conference-in-power	2024-09-22T22:46:54-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/123c8e37f8bf27eb34c6a7110e708f86e6779cd8/0_293_6232_3742/master/6232.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b4fb45f636c3db117a95bf7aae290453

Teenage asylum seekers are seen as too old to be easily integrated into mainstream schooling and too young for further education, leaving many stuck in a limbo that leaves them vulnerable to isolation, mental health deterioration and exploitation, according to research conducted by the charity Refugee Education UK (REUK) and funded by the Bell Foundation, an education charity.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/23/teen-asylum-seekers-school-year-no-mans-land-report	2024-09-22T22:00:31-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea43e872fddfcf68ab6f687f8f9da7e200939458/0_716_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=917581e5ac3513cfcd1b36f5ef3fec90

Greens may bristle at comparison but their RBA interest rate cut ultimatum is Trumpist	No government institution is entirely at arm’s length, but an intervention by Jim Chalmers would likely be calamitous The Greens may bristle at the comparison, but their demand for the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, to order the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates now is Trumpist. Nick McKim, the Greens’ economic spokesperson, says his party won’t support the Albanese government’s RBA reforms unless or until interest rates fall. Given the central bank governor, Michele Bullock, has repeatedly said a cut to its cash rate is unlikely in the near term, Chalmers must use his existing powers to make it happen.

Follow the day’s news live Australia has jumped one place in the Lowy Institute’s annual Asia Power Index, largely due to Russia going backwards as a result of its war in Ukraine. The think tank ranks 27 countries and territories to rank their relative power in Asia. It is based on 131 indicators across eight broad themes: military capability, defence networks, economic capability, economic relationships, diplomatic influence, cultural influence, resilience and future resources. For the first time, experts surveyed for the Asia Power Index judged that China is better able to deploy rapidly and for a sustained period in the event of an interstate conflict in Asia. This increase in ranking, Australia’s second since the inception of the Asia Power Index (it surpassed South Korea in 2020), is more a function of Russia’s decline since 2018 than Australia’s rise.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/sep/23/australia-news-live-politics-debt-cut-chalmers-labor-russia-asia-influence-rankings-weather-fire	2024-09-22T14:39:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9be0b449e50bd54383c8fae1b66c8bae947617da/0_261_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ab73cfe2ac895605d6b4028ae2991d40

Don’t get distracted by the fight the Tories want to have on culture or tax – stick to the script and rise above it.

Labour delegates long to celebrate, but ministers can’t quite feel the joy | John Crace	The party should be toasting its landslide, but instead a state of near-paralysis seems to have set in We may need to have a rethink. Over the last few days it seemed to have become apparent that Keir Starmer wasn’t very good at the politics of being a politician. Taking the free suits and glasses. Being slow to realise this could make him look hypocritical. Sitting back while different factions within the Labour party elite kick lumps out of one another. Making a mess of the winter fuel allowance. Unsure whether he was making cuts or means-testing benefits. Unable to move on from days of bad media. Generally looking a tad on the dim side. Now not so much. Come the start of Labour’s party conference in Liverpool, Keir was a man on a mission. Willing to learn from his mistakes. Ready to do whatever needed to be done. And what needed to be done was … nothing. It’s usual for the prime minister to make himself available for TV interviews on the Sunday politics shows during conference. A rite of passage.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/22/labour-delegates-want-to-celebrate-but-ministers-cant-quite-feel-the-joy	2024-09-22T10:06:56-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a00ceda1a5227669639dff5230b9058936bcb42/0_100_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=51e2f1222782fa79a60a711f1e8c1c19

CBeebies at the Baftas? Awards aim to revive magic of kids’ TV	Categories will boost visibility of shows in a new, fractured media landscape Children’s television was once a thriving, fantastical realm, peopled by Wombles, Tweenies and Danger Mouse – not to mention a car called Brum, an engine called Ivor and a dog called Roobarb – and British-made shows were available every day on the major terrestrial channels. Since then, the magic has largely retreated to the margins of broadcasting. But the embattled landscape is to receive a high-profile boost from Bafta, the Observer has learned. After prolonged campaigning from influential figures such as the former PlaySchool presenter Floella Benjamin, the children’s maths whiz Johnny Ball, the Dr Who writer Russell T Davies and Anne Wood, a veteran creator of worldwide hits such as Teletubbies, Bafta is to recognise the inventive work that is still entertaining Britain’s children. The British Academy has created three high-profile awards to sit alongside the trophies it hands out to adult television shows. The new categories will go some way to replace Bafta’s abandoned children’s TV awards event.	https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/sep/22/cbeebies-at-the-baftas-awards-aim-to-revive-magic-of-kids-tv	2024-09-22T04:00:07-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3a1b4dca0b74438d2f5f65fa3353b2513226eb6/0_222_2413_1447/master/2413.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ea6eeb2d7add6e5fa287c8772cc1aef2

Middle East crisis live: Overnight barrage of Hezbollah rockets launched into Israel, IDF says	Hezbollah launches widespread attacks across northern Israel on Sunday, with some landing near the city of Haifa The United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, has warned of an -imminent catastrophe- in the Middle East. -With the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is no military solution that will make either side safer,- she wrote in a brief statement on X. Hospitals in northern Israel have been instructed to transfer their operations to facilities with extra protection from rocket and missile fire, the health ministry said on Sunday. Rambam hospital in Haifa will transfer patients to its underground, secure facility, the ministry said.

In a statement, the Palestinian Journalists’ Syndicate condemned the raid, saying -this arbitrary military decision is considered a new violation against journalistic and media works-. The US state department has urged Americans in Lebanon to leave the country while commercial options remain available. -At this time, commercial flights are available, but at reduced capacity. If the security situation worsens, commercial options to depart may become unavailable,- it added. The death toll from an Israeli strike on Saturday on a school-turned-shelter in Gaza city included -13 children and six women-, one of whom was pregnant, said civil defence agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal. The Gaza health ministry said at least 22 had died as a result of the strike.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/22/middle-east-crisis-live-hezbollah-israel-lebanon-gaza-latest-news-updates	2024-09-22T00:33:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c403d90a501ce31eaaddfff817af74e2d65a796/0_273_5756_3454/master/5756.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=89e1d754fd1746a17d07c3fe1acdc14c
Starmer says he wants to give ‘hope’ he can deliver ‘massively different and better country’ – Labour conference live	Labour conference opens as PM sees approval ratings plunge amid warnings on economy and controversy over freebies and Sue Gray Good morning. The last time Labour held a conference after a summer general election was in 2017. The party lost, but because Jeremy Corbyn did much better than expected, conference ended up feeling like a victory party. This time Keir Starmer won a landslide. But early messaging from the government has focused on the dire economic inheritance, and the need for tough decisions in the budget, Starmer’s approval ratings have plunged, and the past week has been dominated by controversy caused by unforced errors (freebies, and feuding about Sue Gray). It is too early to assess the mood of Labour, holding its conference in Liverpool as a party of government for the first time in 15 years, but no one is describing it as pure celebratory. In an interview with the Observer ahead of the conference, Starmer said he would protect public services from further austerity. I was running a public service when the coalition government went down the austerity route. It did a huge amount of damage to our public services and we are still feeling the damage even now. So we are not going down the road of austerity. We’ve got to deal with the problems we’ve inherited, that’s what we are doing. What we’ll set out at conference is the why. What do you get for this?

Putin regime will collapse without warning, says freed gulag dissident	Vladimir Kara-Murza and his wife, Evgenia, speak of his time in a Siberian jail and why the truth about Russia will come out The last time I met Evgenia Kara-Murza, it was a grim day in early March. The timing couldn’t have been worse. As we spoke, Alexei Navalny’s coffin was being lowered into the frozen ground in a Moscow cemetery. Meanwhile Evgenia’s husband, Vladimir Kara-Murza, was still incarcerated in a Siberian prison cell almost identical to the one in the Arctic Circle in which Navalny had been found dead, presumed murdered. The parallels were eerie. Because Vladimir, a journalist turned political activist, was not just also loathed and feared by the Kremlin and imprisoned on spurious charges, he’d also been poisoned – twice – targeted by the same FSB (Federal Security Service) unit that had poisoned Navalny.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/22/putin-regime-will-collapse-without-warning-says-freed-gulag-dissident	2024-09-21T21:00:01-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c688a92461a3dc19bb5834a13f2786e10c9b0a0/0_121_4390_2634/master/4390.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25ce6077a2687a5945ca8346dcba1736

Louisiana Catholic church turns to federal court to attack law aiding abuse victims	‘If anyone could undo … the will of Louisiana … the Catholic church can and will,’ says survivor whose case is targeted Months after Louisiana’s supreme court upheld the constitutionality of a state law that let child molestation victims sue for long-ago abuse, despite arguments to the contrary by a Roman Catholic diocese, another church organization is asking the federal government to strike the statute down. Behind the request in question are the Dominican Sisters of Peace and a law firm that boasts about having represented Catholic institutions in Louisiana courts for more than a century. Another of the law firm’s clients in question, the archdiocese of New Orleans, is offering clergy molestation victims less than 10% of what they are requesting in a bankruptcy settlement, in part by arguing the so-called -lookback window- law doesn’t apply to more than 600 abuse claims.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/21/louisiana-catholic-church-sexual-abuse-victims-lawsuit-window	2024-09-21T04:00:40-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b10508b3d29cfbe71539145307b47f70a62a5c1/0_4_5100_3059/master/5100.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=66079d038e0df2add9eaa1180aef93c8

‘Stop doing dumb stuff,’ economist warns as housing affordability in Australia slips	Saul Eslake says decades of ‘bad policies’ have inflated demand as report finds about 20% of households effectively ‘locked out’ of the market Housing affordability has deteriorated over the past year to reach its worst level since records began in 1995. First home buyers now rely on wealthy families or high-income jobs to enter the market, according to the latest housing affordability report from PropTrack. Driven by high mortgage rates and increasing home prices, affordability further deteriorated this financial year to the point where a median-income household earning about $112,000 could afford just 14% of homes sold – the smallest share since records began. This share has declined from 43% in just three years.

Slovakia targets ‘wealthy’ book buyers with steep VAT rise	Proposed rate increase to reduce public deficit derided by booksellers, publishers and pro-Russia groups Slovakia’s populist government has announced plans to drastically raise value-added tax (VAT) on books to help fix its public finances, drawing condemnation not only from booksellers and publishers but also far-right, pro-Russian propaganda groups seeking to circulate their ideas in print. Announcing the new VAT rate this week, Slovakia’s finance minister, Ladislav Kamenický, claimed studies had shown that books were -primarily purchased by wealthier segments of the population- and could therefore be taxed at the new basic rate of 23% rather than the current rate of 10%.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/20/slovakia-targets-wealthy-book-buyers-with-steep-vat-rise	2024-09-20T06:51:38-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edb754aa4e6915757808827a9f71739d27073111/1161_266_3231_1938/master/3231.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9f8f17ef4f84053bfc3a909ba19dc8c4

Israel conducted dozens of strikes across southern Lebanon on Thursday night, hours after Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, threatened retribution and -punishment- for the unprecedented attacks that blew up pagers and walkie-talkies bought by the group. What has Israel said about the explosions? It has not commented but announced, just hours before Tuesday’s pager attacks, that it was broadening its war aims to return Israelis who had been evacuated from the north. Does X still use the tags?

The study, authored by John Blanchard, an assistant professor from the University of Minnesota, Duluth, and Catherine Norris, an associate professor from Swarthmore College, looked at data from a sampling of 1,072 Americans surveyed in December of 2020.

Trump bemoans lack of support from Jewish voters as claims of ally’s antisemitism emerge – US politics live	Republican candidate claims Israel would cease to exist if Harris wins as explosive allegations emerge that North Carolina’s Mark Robinson referred to himself as a ‘black Nazi’ Good morning and welcome to our blog covering US politics in the run-up to the presidential election following another tumultuous evening where Donald Trump bemoaned a lack of support from Jewish voters just hours after allegations emerged that a Republican ally had referred to himself as a -black Nazi- on a pornography website. Trump failed to mention the claims in a CNN report against Mark Robinson, North Carolina’s Republican gubernatorial nominee, during a speech on Thursday at the Israeli-American Council national summit in Washington. If I don’t win this election - and the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that if that happens because if 40%, I mean, 60% of the people are voting for the enemy - Israel, in my opinion, will cease to exist within two years. Harris sat down with Oprah Winfrey on Thursday for a -virtual rally- that included a wide-ranging sit-down interview, during which Harris attacked Trump’s stance on reproductive rights and pledged to sign a border security bill thwarted by Senate Republicans. On Friday, the vice-president will be attending campaign events in the swing states of Georgia and Wisconsin. In the evening, Trump will be in another swing state – Arizona –at a town hall event. He will appear alongside Monica Crowley, a commentator and former assistant secretary for public affairs, and Chad Wolf, who was an acting secretary for public affairs in his administration.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/20/donald-trump-mark-robinson-kamala-harris-us-politics-live	2024-09-20T02:01:02-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a04f253d5d56aefddd2bf3f7c511c0e1eea0f29/0_0_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ed93d3c379ddb391fd81ac9f92bdfe24

Russia-Ukraine war live: Italy calls for ‘fair peace’ and says defence of Ukraine must not lead to world war	Italian foreign minister announces new weapons for Ukraine but warns of risks as conflict escalates Italy is about to send another Samp-T anti-missile system to Ukraine, foreign minister Antonio Tajani said on Thursday, underlining the need, however, to avoid entering war with Russia. -We are sending a new Samp-T (anti-missile system) to protect hospitals, schools, universities … for this country that was attacked by Russia,- Tajani told Radio 24. Ukraine’s offensive into the Russian border region of Kursk diverted about 40,000 Russian troops away from the frontline, Zelenskyy said on Thursday. Kyiv launched its Kursk offensive on 6 August in a bid to pull Moscow’s forces away from eastern Ukraine, where the Russian army has captured a string of villages in recent months. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had captured the village of Heorhiivka, east of the city of Kurakhove, in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. The General Staff of Ukraine’s military, in an afternoon report, referred to the village as one of several engulfed by fighting. Popular Ukrainian military blog DeepState said the village was in Russian hands. In his nightly video address, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine’s forces had -managed to diminish the occupiers’ assault potential in Donetsk region,- though the situation remained difficult in areas subjected to the heaviest attacks, near Kurakhove and another key Russian target, the city of Pokrovsk. Russian forces hit a geriatric care home in the Ukrainian city of Sumy and targeted its energy sector in a new wave of airstrikes on Thursday, killing at least one civilian, Ukrainian officials said. During a daytime strike on the northern city, a Russian guided bomb hit a five-storey building, regional and military officials said. One person was killed and 12 wounded, the interior ministry said. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said rescue teams were checking to see whether people were trapped under rubble. Images from the site shared alongside the ministry’s post showed elderly patients evacuated from the damaged building lying on the ground on carpets and blankets. The UN human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine said attacks on the power grid probably violated humanitarian law while the International Energy Agency said in a report that Ukraine’s electricity supply shortfall in the critical winter months could reach about a third of expected peak demand. Moscow has repeatedly attacked the Sumy region, which borders Russia’s Kursk region, the site of a major Ukrainian incursion in which Kyiv says it seized over 100 settlements. Zelenskyy will meet Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House next week in what is likely to be his last such visit before US elections that could upend Washington’s policy on Kyiv. Zelenskyy is expected to share a -victory plan- with the US leaders to end the war with Russia during the visit on 26 September – as Kyiv frets that a second Donald Trump presidency could loosen US commitment to Ukraine. In a separate announcement, Zelenskyy said he would also meet Trump. Ramzan Kadyrov, the powerful leader of Russia’s Chechen Republic, accused Elon Musk on Thursday of disabling a Tesla Cybertruck that he claimed to have received from the billionaire last month. Kadyrov, who has ruled Chechnya with an iron fist for over 17 years, shared a video in August of him driving around in the electric vehicle with what appeared to be a machine gun mounted on its roof. Kadyrov said he received the vehicle from Musk, a claim that the Tesla owner called a lie on his social media platform, X. -Now, recently, Musk remotely disabled the Cybertruck,- said Kadyrov in a post on his Telegram account. It was not possible to independently verify Kadyrov’s claims.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/20/russia-ukraine-war-live-italy-calls-for-fair-peace-and-says-defence-of-ukraine-must-not-lead-to-world-war	2024-09-20T00:25:50-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e5709aa65502db4119e2c6389e7c40edfd97c7d/0_282_4357_2614/master/4357.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f2daaa170459707c37ceebfe6c779f89

How Lebanon’s pagers and walkie-talkies became deadly weapons – podcast	On Tuesday, dozens of people were killed when electronic pagers blew up. The next day walkie-talkies exploded. What was the goal of the attacks? William Christou reports On Tuesday, William Christou, a journalist reporting from Beirut for the Guardian, began hearing about simultaneous explosions across the city. Then videos began to emerge of small blasts in shops, cars and people’s homes. The death toll began to rise. Then came the extraordinary reason: electronic pagers, used by members of Hezbollah to communicate, had blown up, wounding their owners and whoever was nearby. Israel was blamed by its critics and supporters alike and questions multiplied: how could such an attack have been carried out, and why now? Israel and Hezbollah have been trading attacks over the Lebanese border since the beginning of the war on Gaza, but this operation took everyone by surprise. Then came more deadly explosions – this time walkie-talkies blew up.	https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2024/sep/20/how-lebanon-pagers-and-walkie-talkies-turned-deadly-podcast	2024-09-19T19:00:01-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/131fcc5d5e720730d7fe05a483425a1e06fd7ca4/172_0_3118_1872/master/3118.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c6dcb4ba6ef6625fae5a26fb653defbd

Nearly 600 delivery drivers at Eaze in California voted to unionize in 2023 with the United Food and Commercial Workers, and secured a first contract earlier this year after threatening to strike in April.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/19/eaze-delivery-cannabis-union	2024-09-19T04:00:19-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa4e2a5051c01af48721848cdf4e133e828a56bb/127_754_2675_1606/master/2675.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=20a955a2bcdfb04bcc6ab9858759cc03
Home Office urged to scrap long, expensive and ‘racist’ visa route	Most applicants who felt forced to use 10-year immigration route were people of colour, analysis of FoI data shows A long and expensive visa route for immigrants has been called -racist- after analysis showed most applicants who feel forced to go through it were people of colour. The -10-year route- visa is used by hundreds of thousands of people who are not eligible for other immigration schemes because of a lack of income or professional qualifications. Many work in low-paid jobs such as cleaners or carers.

Donald Trump staged his first rally on Wednesday night since the second apparent attempt on his life, telling his supporters in New York that -these encounters with death- had made him stronger and attributing his survival to divine intervention. Why did he pick New York? While Kamala Harris has a double-digit lead in the state overall, Long Island itself has moved rightwards in recent years. Why would Iran do this?

Minister rejects claim that Sue Gray showed ‘stunning arrogance’ accepting higher salary than Keir Starmer – UK politics live	Jonathan Reynolds, business secretary, suggests Starmer himself did not decide pay for his chief of staff Good morning. Yesterday the BBC broke the story that Sue Gray, Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, is paid £170,000 a year, which is about £3,000 a year more than the PM himself. It is not a typical BBC story (more on that later), and it would be a classic prosecution exhibit for anyone arguing that political journalists are too obsessed with insider processology. There is also a strong argument that ministers and officials at the very top of politics are paid relatively little anyway if you take into account the skill set required, the hours worked, and what they might earn in the public sector. Yes, as Chris Mason, the BBC’s political editor has argued in a blog about the story, this is more than just a slice of Whitehall trivia. That is because the story suggests serious feuding is happening within the Labour adviser machine in government. A story like this would not have ended up on the BBC without someone quite important briefing viciously against Gray, and the revelation has angered other special advisers who claim that Gray is to blame for them being offered measly salaries, at least compared to what their Tory predecessors were on, or what they were earning when they were paid by the Labour party. Clearly this an important job. There’s a process that sets these paybands. It will reflect previous experience … It is a long-established way of establishing within certain pay bands renumeration relating to the job that you do. That’s what have been followed in this case. I think it’s important people understand that the pay bands for any official, any adviser, are not set by politicians. There’s an official process that does that. I don’t, for instance, get to set the pay for my own advisers who work directly for me. So, there’s a process, we don’t have political input into that. There’s a process that sets these things. It is widely recognised. It’s long-standing. It hasn’t changed and that is how pay bands are set for any adviser.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/19/keir-starmer-sue-gray-labour-conservatives-uk-politics-latest-news	2024-09-19T01:28:18-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/380afd90a9a83ed36590529875a9e93c282afb62/1089_88_2515_1509/master/2515.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c44735e3b4f82b3daf5afea6366aca07

It may be years before the full story is told of how coordinated explosions of thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah was orchestrated. But, even without Israel publicly admitting responsibility, it is clear that the attack must have been carefully planned – however uncertain its consequences. Experts generally believe a small mount of stable explosive was carefully implanted into each sabotaged device. Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University, says: -There wouldn’t need to be much explosive, as proximity to a human body means it would cause injury even if it was a few grams.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/18/pager-and-walkie-talkie-attacks-on-hezbollah-were-audacious-and-carefully-planned	2024-09-18T11:52:10-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2e1a8de1b639c5b17d9e481f5bc6d13099a8365/0_145_3193_1916/master/3193.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a823171ba2028713f4af42c94e51273e

Coalition plan to give first home buyers access to super would benefit ‘those who already own housing’	Saul Eslake report finds plan would cause Australian property prices to rise at a faster rate The Coalition’s plan to allow first home buyers access to their superannuation would heavily favour older and wealthier people, with the median couple aged 25 to 34 likely to be able to withdraw only $18,000. That is the conclusion of Saul Eslake, the principal of Corinna Economic Advisory, in a report commissioned by the Super Members Council which points to -six decades of evidence- that policies to boost housing demand -result in more expensive housing to the benefit of those who already own housing-, rather than boosting ownership.

‘Only consequential presidents get shot at,’ Trump tells event – US politics live	Running for president is ‘a dangerous business,’ Republican nominee says at a town hall event in Michigan, following Sunday’s apparent assassination bid Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the run-up to the US presidential election. The fallout from Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt on Republican nominee Donald Trump is continuing. Last night the former president made his first public appearance since the incident, which occurred while he was playing golf in Florida. On Tuesday, Kamala Harris was interviewed by a panel of three National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) members, during which the vice-president talked about the anti-immigrant sentiment toward Haitians in Springfield, Ohio; Israel’s war in Gaza; domestic economic issues; gun violence; and reproductive rights. The conversation was one of the few interviews Harris has done since becoming the Democratic nominee. JD Vance defended his comments about Haitian immigrants eating pets during a Tuesday rally, saying that -the media has a responsibility to factcheck- stories – not him. The rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, came two days after the Ohio senator told CNN host Dana Bash it was OK -to create stories- to draw attention to issues his constituents care about, regarding inflammatory and unfounded claims that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, had eaten residents’ pets. The FBI and the US Postal Inspection Service on Tuesday were investigating the origin of suspicious packages that have been sent to or received by elections officials in more than 15 states, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or that any of the packages contained hazardous material. The latest packages were sent to elections officials in Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York and Rhode Island. Donald Trump is planning to appear with Polish President Andrzej Duda in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Sunday, according to two sources familiar with the plan, reports Reuters. The dual appearance is not yet finalised, said one of the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss plans that are still private. But if the dual appearance goes forward, it would mark a rare instance of a foreign leader appearing alongside a US presidential candidate on the campaign trail. A false claim circulating on social media that Kamala Harris was involved in an alleged hit-and-run in San Francisco in 2011 is the work of a covert Russian disinformation operation, according to new research by Microsoft. The Russian group responsible, which Microsoft dubs Storm-1516, is described as a Kremlin-aligned troll farm. America Pac, one of the largest and the most ambitious of the groups supporting Donald Trump’s campaign, is replacing its voter turnout operations in the crucial battleground states of Arizona and Nevada, according to two people familiar with the matter. The political action committee, backed by billionaire Elon Musk, has ended its contract with the September Group and will hire a new company to knock on doors with fewer than 50 days left until the election.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/18/donald-trump-kamala-harris-us-election-politics-latest-news-updates	2024-09-18T02:03:27-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa80c278b632acb1816609d504bf778c97919e60/0_95_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=26e2bd39dd2f56efe24576831d594723

‘Un-British, un-Christian, unconscionable’: Major condemns Tories’ Rwanda policy – UK politics live	Former PM, in rare interview, says he has not decided who to back for Tory leadership but urges party not to lurch to the right Good morning. Judged by the amount of time he spent as prime minister, John Major was one of the most successful Conservative prime ministers of the post-war period. Only Margaret Thatcher and Harold Macmillan outlasted him in No 10. But he has not been aligned with mainstream thinking in his party since he resigned after losing the election in 1997, and in an interview being broadcast tonight he has unleashed a fresh attack on the policies of the party he used to lead. While his views are not 100% surprising to anyone who has been listening to him in recent years, they are a stark reminder of how much the political landscape has shifted in the last 30 years. The interview, with Amol Rajan from the BBC, is being broadcast tonight. Here are the key lines. Major strongly condemned the Rwanda deportation plan proposed by the last government (and defended by all four candidates still in the Tory leadership contest). He said: I thought it was un-Conservative, un-British, if one dare say in a secular society, un-Christian, and unconscionable and I thought that this is really not the way to treat people. We used to transport people, nearly three hundred years ago, from our country. Felons, who at least have had a trial, and been found guilty of something, albeit that the trial might have been cursory. I don’t think transportation, for that is what it is, is a policy suitable for the 21st century. Major implied the last government deserved to lose the election. He said he did not give many interviews before the election because -there’s not been a great deal I could say, I would wish to say, in favour of what the previous government were doing.- And, talking about the election result, he said: There’s a time of when democracy needs a change in government. I could see that in 1997, we had been in government for 18 years and it was perfectly true to say, that we were tired and that we were running out of fresh people to make ministers and reinject the government with vigour. And of course the same thing applies [with the recent election results], although it was only 14 years. He said it would be a mistake for the party to shift further to the right. He said: The only party that can legitimately appeal to the centre right is the Conservative party. And that is what we have to do, we have to decide where our natural support really lies and appeal to them. People may have made a misjudgement about the last election. We lost five votes to Reform UK and people are jumping up and down, and some, rather reckless people are saying, well we must merge with them. Well, that will be fatal. We lost 50 to the Liberals, and we lost a huge amount to Labour. We lost the vote on the left, more than on the right. And we have to focus on that centre right position, and we’re not an ideological party, I do think traditionally we have been a commonsense party.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/18/john-major-condemns-tory-rwanda-policy-uk-politics-live	2024-09-18T01:26:06-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14051633d367ac9dfdce80aca1ba58020ae7b53e/5_85_1874_1125/master/1874.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a85125222e1ecad824f579f3ea6fb02c

Wednesday briefing: Why Labour seems to be walking the walk on the climate crisis	In today’s newsletter: The party talked up its plans for the climate during this summer’s election – and now seems to be backing that up with real action • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. During their election campaign, Labour made it clear that the climate crisis would be a key focus should they make it into government. It looks as if they are making good on that promise. A number of senior cabinet ministers have come out this week, banging the drum for the government’s climate policies and reminding the public and the media that the climate crisis and its effects are at the top of their agenda. Labour | Keir Starmer has declared more free tickets and gifts than other major party leaders in recent times, with his total now topping £100,000 after recent support for his lifestyle from Labour donor Waheed Alli. Middle East | Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate against Israel after pagers used by its members exploded across Lebanon simultaneously, killing at least nine people and wounding almost 3,000. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. The apparent sabotage attack followed months of targeted assassinations by Israel against senior Hezbollah leaders. Music | Sean -Diddy- Combs has been charged with sex trafficking and racketeering, according to a federal indictment unsealed Tuesday. Combs had been arrested late Monday in Manhattan, roughly six months after federal authorities conducting a sex trafficking investigation raided his luxurious homes in Los Angeles and Miami. NHS | A fifth of GPs are using artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT to help with tasks such as writing letters for their patients after appointments, according to a survey. Aid | UK aid spending will fall to its lowest level since 2007 unless the government takes urgent remedial action in the autumn budget, a group of more than 100 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the aid and humanitarian sector jointly warned on Wednesday.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/18/first-edition-labour-environment-policy	2024-09-17T22:38:43-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f6a0bbbfcc15a7eac079a574b6231b2642e23be/0_595_7503_4505/master/7503.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40f44b97d67b6860cd7958bdf19b3232

The incident took place in international airspace over the South China Sea in 2022.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/sep/18/china-adf-plane-intercept-footage-j-16	2024-09-17T22:20:22-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/479f42c43529a40e6172f9605185356718cf96a6/124_135_1354_812/master/1354.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=224530668c07110d1b26716695e9ff51
