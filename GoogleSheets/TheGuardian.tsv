Wednesday briefing: Why Keir Starmer cut foreign aid to pay for defence – and who loses out	In today’s newsletter: The prime minister announced a significant increase in defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, funded entirely by a cut in the aid budget Good morning. On Tuesday, Keir Starmer confirmed that the government will increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, with plans to raise it further to 3% during the next parliament. The announcement marks the biggest increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war, but the even bigger surprise came with the announcement that the additional funding would come directly from the overseas aid budget, which will fall from 0.5% to 0.3% of GDP – a cut of around £6bn. Ukraine | Donald Trump has said that Volodymyr Zelenskyy is likely to visit the White House on Friday to sign a rare earth minerals deal worth $500bn to pay for US military aid. Gaza | Israel is seeking to extend the first stage of the ceasefire agreement in the war with Hamas in Gaza and is prepared to resume fighting if there is no progress in crucial talks this week, according to reports. Health | Wes Streeting will axe thousands of jobs at NHS England after his ousting of its chair and chief executive in what health service staff fear is a power grab. The health secretary’s plan follows Amanda Pritchard’s shock announcement on Monday that she was stepping down as the organisation’s chief executive next month. She will be replaced, for the foreseeable future, by Sir Jim Mackey. Education | British universities have been warned to -stress-test- all assessments after new research revealed -almost all- undergraduates are using generative artificial intelligence in their studies. A survey of 1,000 students – both domestic and international – found there had been an -explosive increase- in the use of genAI in the past 12 months. 88% said they used tools such as ChatGPT for their assessments, up from 53% last year. BBC | The BBC has admitted that it -fell short and failed people- by not dealing with -bullying and misogynistic- behaviour by its former Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood. A major external inquiry found it -missed opportunities- that could have led to action. The inquiry was triggered by a 2022 Guardian-BBC News joint investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct and predatory behaviour by the DJ.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/26/first-edition-keir-starmer-defence-spending	2025-02-25T22:44:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c77b18fb45d845cd5fad233dbb42d30a6196bce5/0_137_5830_3498/master/5830.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b1284a555883bdd905773a05d76eb2bf
Dutton defends ‘astute’ share purchases and late property disclosures as Labor demands details	Opposition leader says he made required disclosures to parliamentary register and defends lucrative property and share investments Peter Dutton has refused to reveal details about bank shares he bought at the height of the global financial crisis in the days before a bank bailout, defending his lucrative property investment history and stock market decisions as Labor tries to discredit him as out of touch with ordinary Australians. The opposition leader said he properly made the required disclosures about his investments to the parliamentary register.

Tim Westwood inquiry report: what new allegations against him have emerged?	The document contains a series of previously unpublished claims, including 22 from members of the public The independent inquiry into what the BBC knew about the former Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood’s conduct has been published almost three years after a joint investigation by the Guardian and BBC News. The investigation told the stories of a number of women who accused the 67-year-old of sexual misconduct and predatory behaviour. -Hounded- a 17-year-old Black woman with phone calls and texts. Invited a girl who was 15 or 16 back to his home following an under-16 night, after she had added him on Blackberry to get information about the event. Contacted a woman who had shared her business card, and appeared agitated when she did not want to meet late at night. -Hurled- a can of drink at a woman who was serving in a club. A former BBC staff member told the corporation their son had witnessed Westwood propositioning a 15-year-old girl in a night club in around 2007. The BBC reported the complaint to the Metropolitan police, who took no action. A BBC employee said in 2022 that a guest on Radio 1 had described potential sexual assault by Westwood between 2004 and 2007. They said they had reported it to a more senior employee, but White found no evidence the complaint had been documented. Westwood’s lawyers said he was never spoken to about the incident. A student told the review about Westwood referring to her breasts during a 1Xtra DriveTime show in 2010, calling her her -cuddly- and miming grabbing her breasts, which his lawyers say he strongly denies. A Sun journalist contacted Radio 1 in November 2012 saying they had been given tipoffs about Westwood and -inappropriate relations with young girls-. A senior figure flagged allegations made about Westwood on Twitter to HR and the corporate investigations team, which decided that no action would be taken without further evidence. White concluded that senior BBC did not think Westwood had had sexual contact with 15-year-old girls, but that the issue -ought to have been formally raised with him- and the online allegations should have been examined further. -Many- BBC employees -perceived there to be a close relationship between the controllers and Tim Westwood-. Witnesses felt they were unable to complain because of the -feeling that … that senior management were likely to side with presenters-. Westwood made repeated comments about guests and staff members’ bodies, particularly about women’s breasts. Until Westwood was removed from the 1Xtra DriveTime show in 2012, -the approach appears to have been to raise issues informally … and, when the situation did not improve, to move BBC staff working on the 1Xtra DriveTime show to other programmes-.	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/feb/25/tim-westwood-inquiry-report-what-new-allegations-against-him-have-emerged	2025-02-25T11:41:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2f68fa13a789ef1e109396baf0f195baa1d5695/0_0_4250_2551/master/4250.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=645d08ddf560b4bd2b4cf1828a3bf50f

Starmer can only hope aid grab-raid to lift defence budget wins Trump’s favour	PM’s Washington trip clear impetus for abrupt news of budget switch to meet defence commitment by 2027 Before Keir Starmer’s meeting with Donald Trump on Thursday, the prime minister thought it necessary to offer the president a gift. Britain’s defence spending will increase by 0.17 percentage points to 2.5% of GDP by April 2027, he told MPs in a hastily arranged Commons statement. The money, he added, would be taken directly from the overseas aid budget, whose level will be cut by nearly half to 0.3%. The last measure is a remarkable turn for a Labour government. Uncomfortably, it comes at a time when Donald Trump wants to shut down perhaps the entire $40bn US aid budget – and at a stroke eliminates a signature commitment from the Blair-Brown years. It was back in 2004, when Tony Blair was prime minister, that Labour first committed to increasing aid spending to 0.7% of GDP.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/25/starmer-can-only-hope-aid-grab-raid-to-lift-defence-budget-wins-trumps-favour	2025-02-25T11:27:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4247e195c8c053e7715f4662ab06674ab669f603/0_124_5872_3524/master/5872.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2653de9e05276f944c5a2d208472c11e

Peter Dutton says public service cuts will fund his election promises. But he can’t say how they’ll be made	Spending plans remain murky with the Coalition leader having suggested at least three different ways that the ‘savings’ could be used Peter Dutton’s murky and contradictory plans to slash the public service got a little clearer this week, as he appeared to suggest he wanted to cut essentially all the new public servants Labor has employed since coming to office, and use the savings to pay for Medicare boosts. But this is at least the third way Dutton has pledged to redirect -savings- from the public service, raising questions about how he would pay for various promises.

Donald Trump said Vladimir Putin would accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential deal to end the three-year war. Trump was speaking alongside French president Emmanuel Macron at the White House as the leaders sought to smooth over a transatlantic rift to achieve peace. The Trump-Macron meeting came as the US voted against a United Nations resolution condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, siding with countries such as North Korea, Belarus and Sudan over European allies. Trump said the US and Ukraine are -very close- to coming to terms on a rare earth minerals agreement, in comments made during a visit from French president Emmanuel Macron amid European concerns over the US position on Ukraine. A federal judge on Monday denied a request by the Associated Press to immediately restore full access to presidential events for the news agency’s journalists, but said the issue required more exploration before ruling. The Trump administration barred the outlet earlier this month for continuing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico in its coverage after the president renamed it the -Gulf of America-. A federal judge has blocked the government downsizing team Doge from accessing sensitive data maintained by the US education department and the US office of personnel management. US district judge Deborah Boardman in Greenbelt, Maryland issued the temporary restraining order at the behest of a coalition of labour unions. A federal judge has extended protections for trans women in prison. The judge, who blocked the Federal Bureau of Prisons from carrying out Donald Trump’s executive order that would have transferred three incarcerated trans women into men’s facilities earlier this month, has extended protections for nine additional women. A federal judge blocked immigration agents from conducting enforcement operations in houses of worship for some religious groups, the Associated Press reported. US district judge Theodore Chang found that the Trump administration policy could violate their religious freedom and should be blocked while a lawsuit challenging it plays out.

Good morning. The meeting was cordial, at times even warm, but the fracture lines in the transatlantic partnership were clear. Here’s what Macron said: -This peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine. It must not mean a ceasefire without guarantees. This peace must allow for Ukrainian sovereignty and allow Ukraine to negotiate with other stakeholders.- Here’s what Trump said: -I believe that Emmanuel agrees with me on many of the most important issues. … Europe must take a central role in ensuring the long-term security of Ukraine.- Trump also said a US-Ukraine minerals deal was -very close-. How are unions challenging Musk’s moves?

Yvette Cooper says it’s ‘unacceptable’ jailed ex-Labour MP still qualifies for parliamentary salary – UK politics live	Mike Amesbury was sentenced to 10 weeks in jail for assault but is still being paid his Commons salary Good morning. Today the government is publishing its crime and policing bill. As the home affairs commentator Danny Shaw explains in a helpful social media summary, it is a -huge and unwieldy- bill, tackling various Labour law and order priorities, as well as a raft of ones that the last Conservative government was planning to legislate for before the election got in the way. Most of what is in the bill has already been well trailed. As Peter Walker reports, overnight the Home Office has been highlighting the provisions that will allow the police to search properties for stolen phones or other electronically geotagged items without a warrant. I think the Runcorn constituents deserve better, and we wanted to see a new MP in place as swiftly as possible. We look forward to Runcorn constituents getting the representation that they deserve from a newly elected Labour MP. I think everything that’s happened is unacceptable here. You’re asking me about parliamentary rules and procedures, which obviously are separate from those that the government runs. They’re separately ones for parliament.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/25/yvette-cooper-labour-mike-amesbury-keir-starmer-conservatives-kemi-badenoch-uk-politics-live-news-updates	2025-02-25T01:10:54-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23f7da94b969ea8d2197a964b0a9a9bc60c4f4d7/61_8_5823_3494/master/5823.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=57f201d21f501eaa7c6adf0eb113a77b

Merz makes moves to build coalition as German parliamentary groups meet for first time since election – Europe live	Friedrich Merz aiming to build government before Easter after winning most votes in Germany election Deutsche Presse-Agentur, the German news agency, has ruled that the new expected coalition between the conservative CDU/CSU union and the Social Democratic party will no longer qualify as a -grand coalition-, or GroKo, as it was known in Angela Merkel years.

Russia-Ukraine war live: Macron says ceasefire could come in ‘weeks’ as US sides with Russia at UN	French president says he told Trump deal should be ‘substantial for Ukraine’; UN security council backs US resolution that fails to mention Russia as aggressor Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. French president Emmanuel Macron has said a truce -could be done in the weeks to come-, shortly after meeting Donald Trump at the White House where he told the US president a deal should not mean the -surrender- of Ukraine. Donald Trump said Vladimir Putin would accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential deal to end the three-year war. Speaking before bilateral talks at the White House, French president Emmanuel Macron said Europe was prepared to provide security guarantees to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire including peacekeepers, although they would not be sent to the frontline. Trump said he saw no objection to European troops being sent to Ukraine to serve as peacemakers, adding that he had raised the idea with Putin. Trump described a potential minerals deal with Ukraine as -very close- and said he might meet Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy soon to seal the agreement. Trump added that he would also be meeting Putin at some point. Zelenskyy last week rejected US demands for $500bn in mineral wealth from Ukraine to repay Washington for wartime aid, contending that the US had supplied nowhere near that sum so far and offered no specific security guarantees in the agreement. More than a dozen world leaders gathered in Kyiv on Monday to mark the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion. A coordinated Europe-led show of solidarity took an overnight train for a summit with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, including the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb. The coordinated Europe-led show of solidarity on Monday came after a torrid week, in which Trump blamed Ukraine for starting the war against Russia, described Zelenskyy as a -dictator without elections-, and made it clear Europe would have to enforce and pay for any future peace settlement. There was strong collective pushback against the US president’s upside down version of recent history and a consensus that Ukraine had to take part in negotiations over its future. Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow will cease its military actions only if the outcome is -satisfactory- to Russia. He said that many more countries had become -realistic- in their position on Ukraine, and that the recent meeting in Riyadh raised the hope of having normal dialogue between Russia and the US. EU foreign ministers have discussed sending billions of military aid to Ukraine, ahead of a summit dedicated to European defence next week. At a meeting in Brussels on Monday a handful of countries proposed military aid for Ukraine in 2025 ranging from €20bn to €40bn, according to several diplomatic sources. The EU is spending more money on Russian fossil fuels than on financial aid to Ukraine, according to a new report. The EU bought €21.9bn (£18.1bn) of Russian oil and gas in the third year of the war, an amount equalling one-sixth greater than the €18.7bn the EU allocated to Ukraine in financial aid in 2024. Downing Street said Trump has changed the global conversation around Ukraine -for the better-, as the UK imposed further sanctions on Russia in an effort to force Putin to make concessions. Keir Starmer’s spokesperson did not comment on Trump’s false claims that Volodymyr Zelenskyy was a dictator. Starmer will hold talks with Trump in Washington on Thursday.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/25/ukraine-russia-trump-putin-zelenskyy-macron-ceasefire-latest-news-updates-live	2025-02-24T23:28:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e030638fd5ed9275565878dc1dd6963293d77f1f/0_186_5708_3426/master/5708.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=df01dda261fd32e366b7d3c48381c04d

Tuesday briefing: Farmers prepare to give minister chilly reception as Labour seeks to mend fences over inheritance tax	In today’s newsletter: The government is refusing to back down over its changes to inheritance tax breaks for farmers – here’s why the issue is still rumbling on Good morning. It’s a time-honoured tradition: the minister arriving to speak to a conference hall full of people who absolutely hate him, and getting roundly pilloried as he sticks to the government line. Today, it might be the environment secretary Steve Reed’s turn. His adversaries: a large number of implacably angry farmers. Whether or not they bring pitchforks, the attendees who listen to his speech at the National Farmers’ Union conference are up in arms because of the government’s refusal to back down over its changes to inheritance tax breaks for farmers. And while Reed is coming with policy changes that he says will be to the benefit of British farmers, like a five-year extension of the seasonal farm workers’ scheme, they are unlikely to be enough to earn him a warm welcome.

From Creative Australia to Sydney writers’ festival, the direct threat facing the arts is coming from within | Louise Adler	In this adapted extract from What’s the Big Idea? Louise Adler looks at the failure of Australian cultural leaders shying from risk and artistic vision – and letting the tail wag the dog All around the world, a succession of arts organisations across all sectors have come under pressure from artists – surely their first and most important stakeholders – to -take a stand- on a range of topical issues from the climate crisis to Israel’s war on Gaza. If artists engage with the issues of the day, what is the appropriate response of the boards and managers of arts organisations? On Monday we saw the resignation of Kathy Shand, chair of the Sydney writers’ festival.

Revealed: how members of House of Lords benefit from commercial interests	Months-long Guardian investigation exposes weaknesses in code of conduct that could trigger calls for greater reform A Guardian investigation into the House of Lords raises questions over the accountability of parliament’s second chamber, with revelations about how a string of peers are benefiting from commercial interests. One in 10 members have been hired to give political or policy advice, according to their own declarations, and others do paid work for companies that could conflict with their role as legislators. The findings expose weaknesses in the Lords code of conduct and raise questions about whether the rules on lobbying and paid employment should be tightened in line with restrictions signed up to by MPs. Nearly 100 members of the Lords are paid to give political or policy advice by commercial firms. A Labour peer offered access to ministers during discussions to sponsor an event in parliament. A former minister has earned millions of pounds since entering the Lords by working for 30 companies. Multiple peers are being paid by foreign governments including repressive regimes. More than £1 in every £14 donated to political parties since 2001 came from those who have sat as peers in the last parliament.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/24/revealed-how-house-lords-benefit-from-commercial-interests	2025-02-24T06:15:01-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f9944a58952b583d8856dd388e55d95d21be1ca/1_0_4999_3000/master/4999.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1bbd05d121c88bdad15aad978d4d6679

Instead, conservative lead candidate Friedrich Merz posted on social media that it would be led by -someone who understands that economic policy is more than being a representative for heat pumps-. Climate action barely featured on the campaign trail before Germany’s federal elections on Sunday – except when right-leaning parties used it to swipe at the Greens. Merz’s jab was at the tamer end of attacks aimed at the Green party candidate, Robert Habeck, the economy and climate minister who pushed through an unpopular law to promote clean heating, but is a sign of how far the political conversation around climate action has shifted.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/24/german-election-shows-how-far-green-wave-has-receded-in-europe	2025-02-24T05:12:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6d87f75e78baadba7ff5696815c6bf373972647/0_90_6713_4026/master/6713.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=57cdf47e6ec8d7172269a18dfaf5e30a

Confusion at US agencies over whether to comply with Elon Musk email demanding workers justify their jobs – US politics live	Government agencies give conflicting advice after email from Elon Musk demanding employees list accomplishments from past week Hello and welcome to our US politics rolling coverage. Elon Musk’s email demanding all 2.3 million government workers justify their work has caused confusion with several administration officials telling workers not to reply to the missive. French President Emmanuel Macron will meet with Donald Trump in Washington on Monday, saying he will present -proposals for action- to counter the -Russian threat- in Europe and ensure peace in Ukraine. Conservative podcaster Dan Bongino has been appointed as FBI deputy director. Bongino, a former Secret Service agent and NYPD officer turned conservative radio host, puts a second Trump ally at the top of the agency. Trump announced the appointment on Sunday night in a post on his Truth Social platform, praising Bongino as -a man of incredible love and passion for our country-. The Trump administration on Sunday said it was placing all but a handful of USAid personnel around the world on paid administrative leave and eliminating about 2,000 of those positions in the US, according to a notice sent to agency workers and posted online. More than 150,000 people from Canada have signed a parliamentary petition calling for their country to strip Elon Musk’s Canadian citizenship because of the tech billionaire’s alliance with Donald Trump, who has spent his second US presidency repeatedly threatening to conquer its independent neighbor to the north and turn it into its 51st state.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/feb/24/elon-musk-email-donald-trump-us-government-latest-live-politics-news	2025-02-24T03:40:46-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76b7451ede5e4397f736a948dc0c70d1f46180b1/901_1192_4840_2904/master/4840.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=abc2012271a28a3f2a7048c03bece380
First Thing: Zelenskyy hails ‘three years of resistance’ on anniversary of Russian invasion	It follows Russia’s biggest ever aerial attack on Ukraine. Plus, far-right AfD doubles support in German election Good morning. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, hailed -three years of resistance … three years of absolute heroism of Ukrainians,- as foreign leaders arrived in Kyiv to mark the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion. What’s the latest war news? Russia launched its biggest ever drone attack on Ukraine, using 267 drones and killing at least four people. What did Zelenskyy say about US demands? He claimed the Trump administration was asking Ukraine to pay back $2 for every $1 of military aid the US provides going forward. What do we know about the death toll after three years of war? Zelenskyy said in December that 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed, with 370,000 injured. US officials estimated last October that 600,000 Russian troops had been killed or wounded. In November, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights verified 12,162 civilians killed, including 659 children, though the total is likely much higher.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/24/first-thing-zelenskyy-hails-three-years-of-resistance-on-anniversary-of-russian-invasion-ukraine	2025-02-24T03:34:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbbac5474a87878d48d7c4ec968399db7acad947/0_241_5887_3533/master/5887.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1c9a6166b6d756e341c9b0c822c8d64d

Home Office says it will tighten rules to keep ‘Kremlin-linked elites’ out of UK as Starmer speaks to European leaders – UK politics live	Keir Starmer to join European leaders on call to Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss Ukraine war Good morning. At least this week we’re not going to have to put up with all the usual guff about the special relationship. UK politics this week will be dominated by Keir Starmer’s meeting with Donald Trump in the White House on Thursday, which was described on the Westminster Hour last night as -probably is one of the most consequential meetings of a British prime minister and president that we have had since the second world war- by Sir Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador to Washington. For the last 30 years at least, whenever a PM has met a new US president for the first time, commentary has inevitably focused on what it said about the state of the -special relationship-. Despite making the British sound insecure and needy, as a media narrative it always worked because it was simple and appealed to patriotic notions of British exceptionalism. But last week it became clear that the -special relationship- that seems to matter most to Trump is the one he has with Vladimir Putin. There will still be huge interest in the outcome of the Starmer/Trump meeting. But the parameters have now shifted, and No 10 will probably be happy with a relationship that is positive, functioning, and not entirely disastrous for Ukraine. Under the new measures, the government will expand the criteria for exclusion to cover Kremlin-linked elites. This will ensure that, while Russia remains an acute national security threat, elites linked to the Russian state can be prevented from entering the UK. Those who could be barred from the UK include anyone who provides significant support to the Russian state and/or those who owe their significant status or wealth to the Russian state and/or those who enjoy access to the highest levels of the Russian state. Successive governments have welcomed the oligarchs and their money with open arms, providing them with a means of recycling illicit finance through the London ‘laundromat’, and connections at the highest levels with access to UK companies and political figures.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/24/keir-starmer-labour-latest-politics-live-news-updates	2025-02-24T01:29:38-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b6e0110e1966e56aae935f45e3e92bf3eaea641/0_376_5808_3485/master/5808.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b3592f48b1aa2d83d45e37138d8e80e0

Monday briefing: Merz will be Germany’s chancellor – but extremists are waiting in the wings	In today’s newsletter: The far-right AfD may have come second, but at 20% they have been held off by the performance of mainstream parties, with the CDU leader Friedrich Merz on course to be the new chancellor Good morning. Germany’s elections always matter far beyond the country’s borders – but yesterday’s vote could be the most important in a generation. After decades as the stable linchpin of European liberal democracy, Germany has found itself sucked into the same crises that are erupting all over the continent – over its economy, attitudes to immigration and the war in Ukraine. And after the shocking interventions of JD Vance and Elon Musk in favour of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, the election became a symbol of a wider struggle for ideological supremacy – and posed a serious question over whether the centre can hold across the continent. Ukraine | Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he is not willing to cave in to intense pressure from the Trump administration to sign a $500bn minerals deal – adding that that he was ready to quit as president if it meant -peace for Ukraine- or membership of Nato. Catholicism | Pope Francis, who is battling pneumonia and a complex lung infection, remains in a critical condition, the Vatican has said. Archbishop Rino Fisichella, a senior Vatican official, told participants at a mass in St Peter’s Basilica on Sunday morning they should make their prayers for Francis -stronger and more intense-. Afghanistan | The Taliban have arrested a British couple in their 70s for -teaching mothers parenting with children-. Peter Reynolds, 79, and his wife, Barbie, 75, have been running projects in schools in Afghanistan for 18 years. Farming | Hospitals, schools and prisons are to be urged to buy more British food, as part of a government push to heal a rift with farmers over changes to inheritance tax. The environment secretary, Steve Reed, will set a target of sourcing at least half of public sector food from farms with the highest welfare standards, which should benefit British producers. Green economy | The net zero sector is growing three times faster than the overall UK economy, analysis has found, providing high-wage jobs across the country while cutting climate-heating emissions and increasing energy security. 22,000 net zero businesses generated £83bn in gross value added last year.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/24/monday-briefing-merz-will-be-germanys-chancellor-but-extremists-are-waiting-in-the-wings	2025-02-23T23:10:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ce1c53e13ac5f40618a7bb1aa6e45fc62fb2719/0_4_1652_991/master/1652.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1aa0b8ecc6af299c9f5a7e249d4bf89b

Ukraine war live: Zelenskyy hails ‘three years of resistance’ on anniversary of Russian invasion	Ukraine president pays tribute to ‘absolute heroism’ of Ukrainians as EU leaders arrive in Kyiv Welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine, on the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed -Three years of resistance- and the -absolute heroism- of Ukranians this morning. In a post on X he wrote: Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he would be willing to resign in exchange for peace or Nato membership, telling reporters he doesn’t plan to stay in power for decades. -But we won’t let Putin stay in power over Ukrainian territories either,- he said Sunday. He made his remarks just hours after Russia launched its biggest ever aerial attack on Ukraine, using 267 drones, killing at least four people across the country. Kyiv echoed with the booms of anti-aircraft fire as crews spent the night trying to shoot the drones down. Zelenskyy also said he would not bow to pressure from Washington to hand over $500bn worth of Ukraine’s minerals, adding: -I’m not signing something that 10 generations of Ukrainians are going to pay later.- Around $350bn worth of Ukraine’s critical resources are in areas captured by Russia, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, told reporters. Zelenskyy also revealed the Trump administration was asking Ukraine to pay back $2 for every $1 of military aid the US provides Ukraine going forward – an interest rate of 100%. The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, will separately meet Trump early this week and have agreed to show -united leadership in support of Ukraine-. EU leaders will meet on 6 March for a special summit -to take decisions- on Ukraine and European defence, Costa said, as pressure mounts on European nations to boost defence spending. Meanwhile, US and Russian officials are planning to meet again at some point in the next two weeks, Russian state news agency RIA reported over the weekend, citing the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov. Russian government spokesperson Dmitry Peskov supported comments made by Trump about Zelenskyy – such as calling the Ukrainian leader a dictator – as -understandable- after Zelenskyy made -inappropriate remarks- about Trump. Zelenskyy had accused Trump of being -trapped- in a Russian -disinformation bubble.- Despite Zelenskyy’s growing frustration with the Trump administration, he repeated his hopes in keeping the US allied with Ukraine, and to be included in any peace talks. -We would really like it as a priority for the US to first talk to us, then to Russia.- He added, -it is not possible to decide anything about Ukraine without us.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/24/ukraine-war-live-zelenskyy-hails-three-years-of-resistance-on-anniversary-of-russian-invasion	2025-02-23T22:26:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/052512656caf71b6d9711aa38a07ccf35d731dad/0_187_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fe093dfea55ffcd905e103621afbdeb2

German election live: Merz says priority is to make Europe independent from US on defence as coalition talks to begin	Donald Trump has made it clear he is ‘fairly indifferent to Europe’s fate’, says CDU leader who plans to form a coalition by Easter Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the German election results. CDU leader Friedrich Merz has said his -absolute priority- will be to strengthen Europe so as to achieve independence from the US in defence matters as he prepares to embark on coalition negotiations that are expected to last until Easter. The Greens, the SPD’s coalition partner, slumped by three percentage points to 11.6%. The Left has surged to 8.8% and the liberal FDP – which triggered the early election by collapsing Olaf Scholz’s coalition – along with the far-left Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance failed to meet the 5% threshold required top get into parliament. The results mean Merz could form a so-called -grand coalition- with the SPD, without needing to find a third party. That would mean a future government would be more stable and less fractious than for example Scholz’s. The Social Democratic party was left reeling on the back of a historically low vote share, with outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz, admitting it was a -bitter result-. He said he would not be involved in any coalition talks with the CDU/CSU, with other SPD leaders expected to lead negotiations. Merz hailed -a historic election evening,- and acknowledged the responsibility and the scale of the task ahead. He said he planned to form a coalition by Easter and told party faithful that -the world out there is not waiting for us and for lengthy negotiations.- Alice Weidel, co-leader of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) called the result -historic- for her party, having doubled the number of votes from 2021. Weidel said her party remained open to coalition talks with other parties, and said excluding the AfD was the equivalent to -voter fraud-. The AfD swept all five former East German states: Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony and Thuringia. It won well over 30% of the vote in each state and as much as 38.6% in Thuringia – that’s where the AfD made history in September as the first far-right party to win a state election since the second world war. Christian Lindner, the leader of the liberal FDP whose falling out with Scholz triggered the collapse of his coalition government and paved the way for early elections, resigned after his party failed to reach the 5% threshold to re-enter parliament. In a post on X, he said would retire from active politics and said he hoped the election would bring a -new start for Germany-.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/24/german-election-live-results-updates-2025-cdu-afd-widel	2025-02-23T21:08:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c059e777504ba41196add95b7e3146a3451e933/0_6_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42fc97d5f91fbbcd3e0eb456f0081c42

Will Germany’s new government restore its role as a bold leader of the EU?	Friedrich Merz can rebuild European relationships and be a driving force on defence spending, but faces Trump’s upending of postwar certainties Germany has long been seen as the EU’s -indispensable nation- – the biggest, richest and most consequential power. But in recent years Berlin has widely been regarded as missing in action in the EU, hobbled by internecine feuding in a coalition government that has caused flip-flops and delayed decisions. Olaf Scholz has a cool relationship with Emmanuel Macron, slowing down the fabled Franco-German motor that powers the EU.

Literary gold … or betrayal of trust? Joan Didion journal opens ethical minefield	Soon we can all read the late author’s private notes about her therapy. But should we? In 1998, the late journalist Joan Didion wrote a scathing essay about the posthumous publication of True at First Light, a travel journal and fictional memoir by Ernest Hemingway, 38 years after the author killed himself. -This is a man to whom words mattered. He worked at them, he understood them, he got inside them,- Didion wrote. -His wish to be survived by only the words he determined fit for publication would have seemed clear enough.- Just over a year later, in December 1999, Didion began writing her own journal about her sessions with a psychiatrist. She addressed these notes – detailing her struggles with alcoholism, anxiety, guilt and depression, a sometimes fraught relationship with her adopted daughter Quintana and reflections on her childhood and legacy – to her husband, John Gregory Dunne.	https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/feb/23/literary-gold-or-betrayal-of-trust-joan-didion-journal-opens-ethical-minefield	2025-02-23T01:00:30-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12785d80570bfd3b6b586bdb24330bc6a9576dbe/0_913_2672_1603/master/2672.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d62a2d29cab4409e20c18ca5e26e1160

How UK and EU could find more money for defence without spooking the markets	There is political agreement that Britain and Europe need to increase military spending. But in straitened times, how can it be done? Can Britain increase defence spending without cuts elsewhere?Rachel Reeves is constrained by fiscal rules that govern the extent of the UK’s debts and the annual spending deficit by the end of the parliament. Following lower than expected tax receipts and higher borrowing costs in the current financial year, it looks likely that the chancellor will need to make budget cuts when she makes her next financial statement on 26 March. Last week she said a rise in defence spending would mean making -difficult decisions across the board-. Reeves fears a backlash from financial markets in response to higher, unfunded spending, pushing the cost of borrowing up in a repeat of the Liz Truss mini-budget debacle. Most analysts believe a rise in borrowing is expected by international lenders.	https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/feb/23/how-uk-and-eu-could-find-more-money-for-defence-without-spooking-the-markets	2025-02-22T22:00:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc442bfa49dc954ec094290bf375be3e9fa379b7/0_155_4677_2807/master/4677.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8ebee58ab96bc64483ef26fcbf5857e0

Coalition to match ‘dollar for dollar’ Labor’s plan to make GP visits cheaper in $8.5bn Medicare boost	Less than half of Australians were always bulk billed when they saw a GP in 2023-24, government data says The Coalition says it will match -dollar for dollar- Labor’s landmark $8.5bn proposal to dramatically increase Medicare bulk-billing rates for GP visits, pledging to meet Anthony Albanese’s commitment to make nearly all doctors’ appointments free. Doctor’s groups have welcomed Labor’s pledge to fund 18m extra bulk-billed GP visits annually, but have warned some patients will still miss out because government rebates are sometimes still too low to cover the cost of all appointments. The health minister, Mark Butler, says nine out of 10 GP visits will be covered by 2030 under Labor’s plan, and has accused the Coalition of -cooking the books- on bulk-billing statistics during their time in office.

The Colonial Frontier Massacres Digital Map Project, spearheaded by the late emerita professor of history at the University of Newcastle, Dr Lyndall Ryan, officially concluded in 2022. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email At least 10,657 people were killed in at least 438 colonial frontier massacres. 10,374 of them were Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people killed by colonists. Only 160 of those killed were non-Indigenous colonists. There were 13 massacres of colonists by Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people. The most intense period of massacres was from the late 1830s into 1840s, with a pivotal point being the Myall Creek massacre in 1838 – the first time any perpetrators had been punished. After the Myall Creek convictions, the government could no longer involve the military and new -police- forces were created, which set a pattern for the rest of the conflict. About half of all massacres of Aboriginal people were carried out by police and other government agents. Many others were perpetrated by settlers acting with tacit approval of the state. Some perpetrators were involved in many massacres.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/23/more-than-10000-first-nations-people-killed-in-australias-frontier-wars-final-massacre-map-shows-ntwnfb	2025-02-22T16:52:25-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7db9294df616e96913084c0a8ff7397bdf1685da/0_282_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2bfb9fc3c42c5eaa5ae4381bb5be4518

‘It’s blackmail’: Ukrainians react to Trump demand for $500bn share of minerals	Ukraine’s lithium deposits are among biggest in Europe and the US is looking for ‘payback’ for previous military assistance Drawing in the snow with his finger, Mykola Hrechukha sketched out how Ukraine’s new lithium mine might look. It would have a deep central shaft, with a series of side tunnels, he said. -The lithium is good everywhere. The biggest concentration is at a depth of 200-500 metres,- he said. -We should be able to extract 4,300 tonnes a day. The potential is terrific.- For now, though, there is little sign of activity. The deposit is buried under a large sloping field, used in communist times to grow beetroot and wheat. The mine’s proposed entrance is in an abandoned former-Soviet village, Liodiane, today a scruffy grove of acacia and maple trees. The only inhabitant is a security guard, who lives on the 150-hectare site in an ancient Gaz-53 truck.

But a big question mark now hangs over the future of the National Parking Platform (NPP), a government-funded scheme designed to make drivers’ lives easier by letting them use one app of their choice to pay for all their parking.	https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/feb/22/uk-wide-parking-app-out-of-road-government-funding-withdrawn	2025-02-22T02:00:05-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4ec53b76ad04974aa7769ef908accc4ff7d399d/0_246_7373_4426/master/7373.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9cdfdc96796b480a1dbf7e744998f971

Americans sharply divided over Trump’s embrace of Putin	While US allies are alarmed at changing loyalties, new poll finds starkly partisan reaction to president’s Ukraine policy Donald Trump’s shocking and mendacious attack this week on the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as a -dictator- while cozying up to the Russian president and indicating that traditional US security support for Europe is waning may have alarmed US allies abroad but has prompted a more starkly divided response among Americans at home. Reflecting the country’s deeply partisan attitude to the new president and his -America first- foreign policy doctrine, polling suggests that Republicans are much more likely to oppose additional help for war-torn Ukraine. A Pew Research Center survey earlier this month found that 47% of Republicans but just 14% of Democrats thought the US was providing too much support to Ukraine – views that have changed dramatically since the war began three years ago, when just 7% of all American adults (9% of Republicans and 5% of Democrats) said the US was providing too much support to Ukraine.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/22/trump-putin-friendship	2025-02-22T00:01:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8a63bd83cb96794242c15180a31c68d1505673c/0_480_7176_4304/master/7176.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=929f49e6c2af508ddf182fce7b30f468

Middle East crisis live: Gaza hostage-prisoner exchange set to go ahead	Hamas says six captives expected to be freed from Gaza on Saturday in swap for about 600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, after return of wrong body risked derailing ceasefire Welcome to our live coverage of the Middle East crisis. It’s just after 8.30am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv – here’s the latest news. Israel prepared on Saturday to receive six more hostages from Gaza in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, after accusations over the return of a misidentified body this week threatened to derail a fragile truce. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, vowed revenge for what he described as a -cruel and malicious violation- of the ceasefire agreement after authorities determined that a body released by Hamas on Thursday was not Shiri Bibas. The body was determined to be of an unidentified woman from Gaza. The Bibas family accused Netanyahu of failing to protect their loved ones during Hamas’s 2023 attack and of failing to bring them home. -There is no forgiveness for abandoning them on October 7, and no forgiveness for abandoning them in captivity,- said Ofri Bibas, the sister-in-law of Shiri Bibas, in a statement. Netanyahu said he has ordered the Israeli military to carry out an intensive operation against what he called -centres of terrorism- in the West Bank. He also said on social media that he had ordered Shin Bet and police to increase -preventative- measures against attacks on Israeli cities. It followed a series of explosions on three parked buses in Bat Yam, a city outside Tel Aviv, on Thursday night. Authorities said they were a suspected terrorist attack. No injuries were reported. More than half a million children have been left without education across Gaza and the West Bank, according to the International Rescue Committee. The NGO warned that vital aid for children in the region was being scuppered by increasing violence. Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman held a meeting of Egyptian and Jordanian leaders described as -an informal brotherly gathering- by the state-run Saudi Press Agency. It came ahead of an Arab League summit likely to discuss the Gaza Strip after the US president, Donald Trump, proposed it -take over- the territory and permanently resettle its Palestinian residents, a plan Arab countries have universally rejected. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald will boycott St Patrick’s Day events in the US over Gaza. She and Northern Ireland’s first minister, Michelle O’Neill, said they would not attend the celebrations after Trump’s call to exile Palestinians from the territory.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/22/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-hamas-new-gaza-hostage-prisoner-exchange	2025-02-21T22:40:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1b7d6bb8cf37ae714b8079ac16a93de35a4769c/0_210_3173_1904/master/3173.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b836f14a874494485f41a197b82c5e2c

Prominent figures in the arts say class is a key factor that determines who can make it in the creative industries In recent years, a string of academic reports have shown in stark terms just how elitist the arts have become over the last four decades. The proportion of working-class actors, musicians and writers has shrunk by half since the 1970s, according to one piece of research, while another study found fewer than one in 10 arts workers in the UK had working-class roots. Sutton Trust research released last year found the creative industries were dominated by people from the most affluent backgrounds, which it defined as those from -upper middle-class backgrounds-, while a Netflix report claimed working-class parents did not see film and TV as a viable career for their children.	https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/feb/21/who-is-working-class-and-why-does-it-matter-in-the-arts	2025-02-21T09:00:42-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/791345572439521046050e0490984ba262398845/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a3c51f2a38db29f61f160a17d90d258d

Jaysley Beck inquest prompts flood of testimonies of abuse in UK military	Ministry of Defence says lessons learned from death will make military safer, but victims and families say they have heard it all before A soldier left suicidal after complaints about a senior officer were ignored. Two women told they needed to grow up or their heads would be banged together after they complained about sexual harassment by their major. A servicewoman raped and left with post-traumatic stress disorder while her attacker was given a slap on the wrist. Online army forums have been flooded this week with testimonies of abuse – and the military’s failure to tackle it – sparked by the inquest into the death of 19-year-old gunner Jaysley Beck. The head of the army, Gen Sir Roly Walker, has expressed his disgust and suggested senior ranks may even be -actively complicit- in abusive behaviour. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has promised that lessons will be learned.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/feb/21/jaysley-beck-inquest-prompts-flood-of-testimonies-of-abuse-in-uk-military	2025-02-21T06:26:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dac45c35509a47bc1467e4f5d01237c50867c5cb/0_8_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5ab2b1ec8165585ca9eb11762b3b793c

‘This could have all been avoided’: how Creative Australia allowed itself to be blind-sided over its Venice Biennale pick	High-profile artists and curators stunned by Creative Australia’s swift abandonment of Khaled Sabsabi, the art community, and the complex nature of art itself A week after Creative Australia controversially dumped artist Khaled Sabsabi as Australia’s representative for the 2026 Venice Biennale, Richard Bell still can’t understand the decision. The Kamilaroi, Kooma, Jiman and Gurang Gurang artist has a long history with the Venice Biennale and Australia’s peak arts funding body – in 2019, he crashed the prestigious showcase after being passed over to officially represent Australia. He’s shocked that Creative Australia would allow itself to be blind-sided by criticism of Sabsabi’s past work, and its refusal to answer predictable attacks with a nuanced conversation.

‘He’s selling the city’: behind Eric Adams’s New York City administration	The mayor of America’s largest city is caught up in a swirl of indictments, immigrants, Rikers and Donald Trump This Valentine’s Day, a new political power couple said their vows on the plush white couches of Fox &amp; Friends in midtown Manhattan: Donald Trump’s border tsar, Tom Homan, and the New York City mayor, Eric Adams. The pair appeared on the conservative TV show to discuss an agreement they had reached the day before. Their deal reversed longstanding New York City policy by letting federal immigration agents back onto Rikers Island, the city’s jail complex that largely holds people who have been charged but not yet convicted of crimes. The surprise agreement came as the newly installed leaders of Trump’s Department of Justice were making an extraordinary push to dismiss criminal corruption charges that the agency had been pursuing against Adams.

The Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey has said the government must swiftly ramp up defence spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP).

So we have to debate it, it is going to be difficult. I don’t think there’s an easy solution, but we have put some ideas on the table. One idea we have put is to increase the digital services taxes, a tax on about 20 multinational companies with turnovers of over £500m and we would raise it from the current 2% to 10%.

Macron and Starmer to lead Europe’s Trump charm offensive when they travel to US – Europe live	French president and UK prime minister are due to meet Donald Trump next week French president Emmanuel Macron and UK prime minister Keir Starmer will lead Europe’s charm offensive next week as they both travel to the US to meet with president Donald Trump in an increasingly desperate bid to change his mind on Ukraine and European security. Macron outlined parts of his strategy on Thursday night. During a Q&amp;A session on social media that he would tell Trump not to be -weak- on Russian president Vladimir Putin, warning about the consequences that would have in relation to other powers around the world, like China. -That’s not who you are, it’s not your trademark,- he said he would argue.

Peter Dutton says Labor is fast-tracking citizenship so that migrants can vote. Here’s what we know	The opposition leader picked up on News Corp claims that Tony Burke was conducting ‘industrial-scale’ ceremonies. Labor denies it has anything to do with the election This week Peter Dutton has claimed Labor wants to -expressly push- new Australians through citizenship ceremonies ahead of the federal election – allegations the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, has strongly denied, accusing critics of a -whinge-. In the same remarks, Dutton also again claimed the government wanted to -bring people in from a war zone-, referring to Gaza, and appeared to insinuate people from that region were among those being offered citizenship. Tony Burke is spending today and the rest of this week, as I understand it, conducting as many citizenship ceremonies as you can, and literally putting thousands of people through an express citizenship process so that they can vote in the election within a few weeks, which I think is quite remarkable. And I just question whether there has been any slackening of the process, whether there has been any compromise on the security checks, and whether it’s in our country’s best interests for people to receive citizenship before the proper security checks have been undertaken, or people have had – within the home affairs department – the time to be able to conduct the searches that we would expect to be conducted.- What would you like to happen to be assured that the processes are being followed?- There needs to be transparency. If the government’s giving a nod and the wink to a particular part of society – they’re obsessed with the Green vote and they’re worried about losing seats, without being political about it – but let’s be frank about the motivation. Why would you bring people in from a war zone without the requisite checks, on a tourist visa, without precedent? Why would you do that and knowing that it’s territory controlled by a listed terrorist organisation? Why would you expressly push people through the process to receive citizenship in advance of an election which is pending?-	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/21/peter-dutton-says-labor-is-fast-tracking-citizenship-so-that-migrants-can-vote-heres-what-we-know-ntwnfb	2025-02-20T22:19:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ffbb702b6b2ce00338b2a69a40d20ad058925bc/0_255_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7c012b7638859b17dfd74c8e6d871767

Starmer tells Zelenskyy it was ‘perfectly reasonable’ to suspend elections during war – UK politics live	Downing Street says the two leaders spoke overnight, after Donald Trump accused the Ukrainian president of being a ‘dictator’ Shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel told viewers of Sky News this morning that she could not comment on the -motivation- of Donald Trump in criticising Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but said that Trump was -wrong-. Ask what she made of the comments, Patel said: First of all, that’s wrong. President Zelenskyy is not a dictator. Let’s just put some context of this. For three years – the third anniversary of the conflict is on Monday – for three years he has led his nation in terms of this conflict, standing up to Putin, Putin’s aggression, and the appalling conduct that we’ve seen. [Zelenskyy] is fighting for sovereignty and the freedom of his country. And this is a significant conflict in our neighbourhood, effectively on European soil, and this is the most brutal conflict that we’ve seen in Europe since, clearly, the second world war. So here’s a man that’s fighting for sovereignty, freedom, and actually standing up for the rule of law, and many of the values that we all hold very dearly. I think I said at the weekend too that there is a lot of chatter, there’s a lot of noise. There are no clear solutions right now. And I think, you know, I say this not just as a member of the Conservative frontbench, but actually as a British politician, having led the support for Ukraine, this is why we must really be quite strong all over again in our support for greater defence and military spending and capability. I think we need to take the heat down from what has become a very heated conversation in public over recent days. That’s what the prime minister has been doing, meeting with European leaders, speaking to President Zelenskyy. Next week, he’ll travel to the US to meet with President Trump. The truth is that if we want a solution to what is happening in Ukraine –and we absolutely do, because it’s in British interests to do so, and it’s the right thing to do – then we know in our country from the experience of dealing with very difficult matters on our own shores, that the only way that you reach a solution is to bring all parties around the table, to take the heat down, to have cool heads, and to bring people together for a negotiated solution. We’ve got our own view as the UK. And our view is that the US matters, Ukraine must be involved in negotiations about Ukraine’s own future, and that Europe matters as well. And we need to make sure with all parties around the table that our alliance doesn’t fracture. We’re absolutely committed to Nato. We have to hold that coalition together. We have got a real threat here in Vladimir Putin. We have got to work together with our allies in order to make sure that we don’t just win the war and win the peace in Ukraine, but we also make sure that we don’t see the like of this happening again. The prime minister has made his own view clear. He spoke to president Zelenskyy in the last few days and made clear that he understands, first of all, that he is an elected leader, and we consider him in the United Kingdom to be a legitimate leader. We do not consider president Zelenskyy to be a dictator. He was elected by the people of Ukraine. And the reason that there haven’t been elections is because of Russian aggression, and that is something that is out with Ukrainian control. We stand with Ukraine, and our belief in that, our support for Ukraine is unshakable.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/20/uk-politics-latest-news-starmer-zelenskyy-ukraine-labour-tories	2025-02-20T01:00:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69ce4ace94c2fa70737c156af976fd0ba299a3ec/0_360_8192_4915/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=73e5769b8303bb07bf9189fc3305acac

Middle East crisis live: Hamas to return bodies of four Israeli hostages, including two children	Bodies of Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir, who Hamas says were killed in an Israeli airstrike, as well as Oded Lifshitz, 83, to be handed over Hello, we are restarting our live coverage of the Middle East. Hamas is set to return the bodies of four Israeli hostages on Thursday, including a mother and her two children who have long been feared dead and had come to embody the nation’s agony following the 7 October 2023 attack. Hamas has said it is ready to release all its remaining hostages in a single exchange if the ceasefire agreement with Israel moves forward to a second phase next month. A senior Hamas official, Taher al-Nunu, told Agence France-Presse -We have informed the mediators that Hamas is ready to release all hostages in one batch during the second phase of the agreement, rather than in stages, as in the current first phase.- The offer came as the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, signalled his readiness to talk about a second phase of the Gaza ceasefire after an extended delay, by appointing one of his closest advisers, Ron Dermer, a US-born cabinet minister and former ambassador to Washington, to lead the Israeli delegation to the talks. Dermer replaces the heads of the Mossad and the Shin Bet security service, who have led the negotiations until now and have frequently been at odds with Netanyahu over his reluctance to move forward with the ceasefire. Arab leaders will gather in Saudi Arabia on Friday to counter President Donald Trump’s plan for US control of Gaza and the expulsion of its inhabitants, diplomatic and government sources said. The plan stirred rare unity among Arab states which roundly rejected the idea, but they could still disagree over who will govern the Palestinian territory and who will pay for reconstruction. US secretary of state Marco Rubio met on Wednesday with the leader of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, after talks in Israel and in Saudi Arabia. The UAE has been key in mediating between Israel and Gaza. Wednesday’s meeting included discussions on artificial intelligence, the Gaza Strip, Syria, Lebanon and the Red Sea, which had been the site of attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels until the Gaza ceasefire a state department spokesperson said.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/20/israel-gaza-war-hostages-shiri-bibas-ariel-kfir-oded-lifshitz	2025-02-19T23:09:48-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73891f9f79f4910a304405824a81b664c130c455/763_0_7500_4500/master/7500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=205bcf3d6b56c0d6f052cec764a1a489

Thursday briefing: The real reasons that Volodymyr Zelenskyy can’t face a new election yet	In today’s newsletter: Zelenskyy described Trump’s claims as -disinformation- – only for the US president to double down. But his claims have no plausible basis in fact Good morning. Donald Trump’s view of Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un: -The smartest one gets to the top-. Donald Trump’s view of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who won Ukraine’s presidency in a landslide, enjoys continued popular support, and had to postpone new elections because his country was, as you will remember, invaded: he’s a dictator. Zelenskyy earned that astonishing designation yesterday by rejecting Trump’s claims that he is very unpopular, that Ukraine brought the invasion on itself, and that to be considered a legitimate leader he must hold new elections even under the threat of Russian attack. At a press conference in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said: -Unfortunately, President Trump, with all due respect for him as the leader of a nation that we respect greatly … is trapped in this disinformation bubble-. And he added: -I would like to have more truth with the Trump team.- Bills | The companies behind Great Britain’s gas pipes and power lines have pocketed a windfall of nearly £4bn from household bills during the energy and cost crisis, according to a report. The analysis, by Citizens Advice, argued that energy network owners were able to make the -excess profits- over the past four years after the industry regulator misjudged their costs. Brazil | British journalist Charlotte Alice Peet, 32, has been missing in Brazil for 11 days, a foreign correspondents’ association in the country has said, urging authorities to step up their search efforts. Peet has worked as a freelance journalist for outlets such as the Independent, Times, Telegraph and Al Jazeera. Immigration and asylum | Plans to prevent refugees who arrive in the UK on a small boat, lorry or via other -irregular- means from becoming a British citizen are facing their first legal challenge. The case is being brought by a 21-year-old Afghan refugee who arrived in the UK aged 14, after fleeing the Taliban and being smuggled to Britain in the back of a lorry. Sellafield | The UK nuclear industry regulator has taken Sellafield, the world’s largest store of plutonium, out of special measures for its physical security – but said concerns remained over its cybersecurity. In 2023, the Guardian revealed a string of safety concerns at the site – from issues with alarm systems to problems staffing safety roles at its toxic ponds – as well as cybersecurity failings.

Trump signs executive order targeting ‘benefits for illegal aliens’	US president issues order aimed at preventing taxpayer dollars supporting illegal immigration and another designed to get rid of regulations Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at ending federal benefits for people in the country illegally, his latest in a blizzard of moves to crack down on immigration. The White House said the order seeks to end -all taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens- but it was not clear which benefits will be targeted.

On the ground in a new Lebanon – podcast	Israel’s war has left many Lebanese people contemplating what once seemed unimaginable: is Hezbollah finished? Michael Safi reports from Beirut Michael Safi was in Lebanon in the summer, when it was on the brink of war between Israel and Hezbollah, the most powerful force in the country. Months later, in October, Israeli troops invaded Lebanon amid a wave of airstrikes and assassinations of top Hezbollah leaders and commanders. Michael returned this month and visited destroyed villages in southern Lebanon as civilians were returning to their homes. On the ground, it appeared the Israeli military had a political strategy too: splintering Lebanese society by driving a wedge between the community that traditionally supports Hezbollah and everybody else.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2025/feb/20/on-the-ground-in-a-new-lebanon-podcast	2025-02-19T19:00:25-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d58e8cb6e1439f10918610721d381f7db0c71969/0_149_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=35b9068e1a3363736ea60f96fa18acc6

Knife crime strategy needs to focus on stopping supply as well as possession, says policing minister – UK politics live	Diana Johnson defends Labour’s knife crime plan amid crisis in prison capacity in England and Wales Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey has said that the Labour government’s policies are causing the cost of living crisis started under the Conservatives to -drag on-. Reaction to the rise in inflation, Davey said: The chancellor’s misguided policies are putting us at risk of a new era of stagflation. The economy still isn’t growing, and now people are being hit in their pockets too. The Conservative government plunged Britain into a cost of living crisis, and Labour’s failures are just making the misery drag on and on. Well, look, we inherited a terrible situation from the previous government, and their failure to make sure that sufficient prison places were built. It is a disgrace. And unfortunately, that’s the inheritance we had. The lord chancellor had to take some really difficult decisions because of that. We are committed, obviously, to building the 14,000 additional places that we need.

‘No artist’ will want to represent Australia at Venice Biennale after Sabsabi dumped, former museum head says	Elizabeth Ann Macgregor says Tony Burke has questions to answer after Khaled Sabsabi’s offer was rescinded but the arts minister has denied involvement The Australian Pavilion at the 61st Venice Biennale is likely to remain dark next year for the first time, the former director of the Museum of Contemporary Art says.

Middle East crisis live: Israeli troops remain in five locations in Lebanon after deadline for withdrawal expires	Original deadline in late January extended to 18 February by both Israel and Lebanon as both sides claim the other has violated ceasefire agreement Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of developments in the Middle East. Israel’s army has left southern Lebanese villages but remains in five positions, a Lebanese security source told Agence France-Presse (AFP), as a deadline for their withdrawal agreed to under a peace deal with Hezbollah expired. Itamar Ben-Gvir has suggested that the Egyptian government may have had a role to play in the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. -They [Egypt] have a role in what happened on October 7,- the former national security minister, who resigned from Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet in protest over the Gaza ceasefire deal, said in comments carried by Israeli state radio. -There was probably some partnership, or at the very least, a willful blindness.- An alternative to Donald Trump’s proposal for the effective ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from Gaza is being prepared by Egypt, under which Hamas would be formally excluded from governance and control of the territory’s reconstruction. The process would be handed over on an interim basis to the control of a social or community support committee. No member of Hamas would sit on the committee (you can read more about the alternative plan here). The World Bank will release an assessment of damages to infrastructure in Gaza in coming days. It is expected to provide a fuller overview of damage done to the territory by Israeli airstrikes after an interim report in April showed it suffered $18.5bn in damages to critical infrastructure in the first four months of the war.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/18/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-troops-lebanon-withdrawal-deadline-passes-egypt-gaza-latest-updates-news	2025-02-17T23:58:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecab4c4e38ec405cd9e3cc0ff4d45b715e02f3b4/0_102_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f9b4a4fc474243255915cc145e50ebce
How Spain’s radically different approach to migration helped its economy soar	As immigration has increased, GDP has surged and unemployment has fallen to lowest level since 2008 From Madrid to Barcelona, restaurants and bars are brimming with people, and reservations have become essential for everything from fine dining to high-end hotels. It’s a glimpse of how Spain has become Europe’s buzziest economy – named the world’s best by the Economist in 2024 – fuelled in part by what analysts have described as the government’s strikingly different approach to migration.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/18/how-spains-radically-different-approach-to-migration-helped-its-economy-soar	2025-02-17T23:00:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cae13a1801fe3ed75493eceeaec8a0f2ff1827ed/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a1efba8b856e412f286bb7884c372495

Tuesday briefing: Europe faces tough choices on Ukraine as US pursues own path	In today’s newsletter: As the US and Russia go ahead with talks in Saudi Arabia, Keir Starmer and other European leaders are grappling with their next move Good morning. Yesterday, European leaders attended an emergency meeting in Paris to discuss how best to respond to the shift in Ukraine policy from the US under Donald Trump. Today, US and Russian officials will meet in Saudi Arabia for preliminary peace talks. And while Volodymyr Zelenskyy says that there can be no -agreements about us without us-, events of the last week have made it clear that the second of these summits is likely to be more consequential than the first. As shocking as interventions from the US vice-president, JD Vance, and the secretary of defence, Pete Hegseth, were last week, part of their argument was emanating from Washington even before Trump’s first term: the demand that European nations take more responsibility for their own security as the US seeks to shift its focus towards Asia. Prisons | Successive governments’ overreliance on longer prison sentences and desire to seem -tough on crime- have driven the justice system to the brink of collapse, an official review has found. The prison population in England and Wales was more than 85,000 at the end of last year, having increased by more than 40,000 since 1993. UK news | A woman shot dead at a Kent pub on Valentine’s Day has been named as Lisa Smith. The 43-year-old from Slough was killed in Knockholt near the Three Horseshoes pub shortly after 7pm on Friday, Kent police said. Conservatives | Kemi Badenoch has said -our country and all of western civilisation will be lost- if efforts to renew the Conservative party and drive forward rightwing ideas globally fail. In a speech at a right-wing conference attended by Jordan Peterson and Nigel Farage, Baedenoch said that -pronouns, diversity policies and climate activism- are a -poison-. Canada | A plane carrying 80 people crash landed at Toronto Pearson airport on Monday, flipping upside down and leaving at least 18 people injured. Video from the scene showed a Delta Air Lines plane belly-up on snow-covered tarmac and people walking away. Religion | Pope Francis will remain in hospital for as long as required after tests in recent days showed a -complex clinical picture-, the Vatican has said. The pontiff, 88, was admitted to Gemelli hospital in Rome on Friday with worsening bronchitis and was diagnosed and treated for a respiratory tract infection. If current trends in the decline of European defence capabilities are not halted and reversed, future US political leaders – those for whom the cold war was not the formative experience that it was for me – may not consider the return on America’s investment in Nato worth the cost.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/18/tuesday-briefing-europe-faces-tough-choices-on-ukraine-as-us-pursues-own-path	2025-02-17T22:51:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/476db846c2b307d8aaca7a3f876ebe7c9d78dd90/0_193_4675_2805/master/4675.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5493440d148fd4666e280dc53aec9a34

Russian and US officials meet in Saudi Arabia for high-stakes talks on war in Ukraine, without Kyiv – Europe live	European officials not part of discussions as Volodymyr Zelenskyy warns his country will not recognise peace deals made without Ukrainian participation Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the US-Russia talks in Riyadh – it’s approaching 8am in the Saudi capital. Today’s talks aim to pave the way for the first exchanges on a potential peace deal to end the Ukraine war. However, Kyiv and European leaders have been excluded, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that Ukraine -cannot recognise any things or any agreements about us without us-. Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s foreign policy adviser, said on Monday upon arrival in Riyadh that talks on Ukraine would be strictly bilateral, Russia’s RIA state news agency reported. -We came to negotiate with American colleagues,- it quoted Ushakov as saying. -These are bilateral talks, purely bilateral. There can be no trilateral talks in Riyadh.- The Riyadh talks are proceeding to follow up on a surprise phone call to Putin initiated by Trump last week. Trump’s special Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, stressed Trump wanted a quick deal: -We are now at Trump time, which means I get an assignment today and tomorrow at noon he asks me why it hasn’t been done yet.- Russia said ahead of the meeting that Putin and Trump wanted to move on from -abnormal relations- and that it saw no place for Europeans to be at any negotiating table. Zelenskyy accused Washington of wanting -to please- Putin by -now saying things that are very favourable- to him. The Ukrainian president said any peace deal would need to include -robust and reliable- security guarantees, which France and Britain have called for but not all European powers support.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/18/russia-us-ukraine-peace-talks-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-volodymyr-zelenskyy-saudi-arabia-live-latest-updates-news	2025-02-17T21:02:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/622c4bb6b535f011d104729e1b824259ef95b88f/0_436_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=55af9545ebb57f8fb79fce600939363e
Primary-age child constipation rates up 60% in England and Wales	Experts say greater awareness is needed of the misery that can be caused by the condition More than 44,000 children were admitted to hospital with constipation last year, according to NHS figures that highlight the potentially serious health consequences of the condition. Data for England and Wales reveals a 60% rise in hospital diagnoses of constipation in primary schoolchildren in the past decade, with increases also seen in preschool and secondary age groups.

Weatherwatch: Cyclone Zelia brings 130mph winds to north-west Australia	Tropical cyclone first to make landfall this year, while a winter storm causes extreme cold across north-eastern US Cyclone Zelia became the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in 2025, hitting north-west Australia on Valentine’s Day as a category 4 system. It brought damaging winds of 130mph and heavy rainfall, with 440mm of rain falling in two days. Prior to landfall, Zelia affected southern Indonesia, including Bali, with winds of more than 45mph. The storm weakened into a tropical low by Saturday, but continued to cause widespread flooding, particularly near the Pilbara rivers and the Great Sandy Desert. Zelia intensified rapidly because of the record-warm Indian Ocean temperatures, which were 1-2C above seasonal average, providing increased energy and moisture to fuel the storm. While Port Hedland in Western Australia had minimal damage, nearby areas like Pilbara and Marble Bar faced flooding and fallen trees. The Great Northern Highway remains closed, disrupting food supplies and leaving supermarket shelves empty. The tropical low is now tracking southwards, with rainfall becoming patchier and lighter.	https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/feb/17/weatherwatch-cyclone-zelia-brings-130mph-winds-to-north-west-australia	2025-02-17T02:37:42-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06272b018467c240a6bf8e5d338236bd8a6e8cc5/0_46_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6e5bc709d2fbbac52f5225f3bb5f8303

Egypt draws up Gaza reconstruction plan that would exclude Hamas	Alternative to Trump plan would involve committee of technocrats but future military status of Hamas unresolved An alternative to Donald Trump’s plan to turn the Gaza Strip into a US-owned -Riviera of the Middle East- is being prepared by Egypt in conjunction with the World Bank, under which Hamas would be formally excluded from governance and control of the territory’s reconstruction. The process would be handed over on an interim basis to the control of a social or community support committee. No member of Hamas would sit on the committee. But the future military status of Hamas within Gaza is unresolved, which is likely to be a barrier to Israeli endorsement of the plan.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/16/egypt-gaza-reconstruction-plan-hamas	2025-02-16T09:44:46-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2458070a8b94463bf20cc5eb64cd6402deaac52/0_0_4801_2881/master/4801.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=69f251aac1ed7ae64afec735108c6808
Trump’s return means UK must swiftly find a way to increase defence spending | Peter Walker	Under Biden, the move could wait until the UK worked out how to meet its 2.5% GDP commitment. Not now It has been one of the few political constants in a turbulent period for British politics: an agreement that defence spending really should increase. But in the second era of Donald Trump, what was a consensual background hum has suddenly become an ear-splitting alarm. European Nato members, the UK among them, have long been used to US presidents urging them to spend 2% of GDP at a bare minimum, something only a minority of them manage.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/16/trumps-return-means-uk-must-swiftly-find-a-way-to-increase-defence-spending	2025-02-16T09:35:56-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e00633b0f12ce93a2eaa1493916bc78c84d192d/0_0_3999_2400/master/3999.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ce15e00aa72391f6887145f298e741f7

Trump vowed to champion US workers - the reality has been a relentless assault	President has begun slashing federal workforce while hobbling labor watchdogs NLRB and EEOC As a presidential candidate last fall, Donald Trump repeatedly promised to battle for US workers, but ever since he returned to the White House, he has taken a surprisingly large number of anti-worker actions, labor experts say. Some of those moves, among them hobbling the National Labor Relations Board, will help Trump’s billionaire business friends, most notably Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. In his first few weeks back in office, Trump fired the acting chair of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), leaving the US’s top labor watchdog without a quorum to enforce laws that protect workers’ right to unionize. Trump has designated Musk, a vehemently anti-union billionaire, to launch an all-out war against the federal bureaucracy and workforce, and Trump and Musk have essentially treated the country’s 2 million-plus federal employees as if they were disposable.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/16/trump-anti-worker-actions-unions	2025-02-16T04:00:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b5183e9e7d14cb5785e66134d6df6fc744b6431/0_83_8640_5182/master/8640.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a160f433cf0dfc34a0e76f1856483368

While the immense cuts are framed as a means of removing waste, they may also become a boon to private companies – including Musk’s own businesses – that the government increasingly relies on for many of its key initiatives. Musk and his allies in the -department of government efficiency- (Doge), the unofficial committee acting as the operations arm of his cost-cutting efforts, have targeted a range of major government departments. They have moved to close the United States Agency for International Development, slashed the Department of Education and taken over the General Services Administration that controls federal IT structures. Doge staffers have also gained access to the treasury department, as well as set their sights on the Department of Defense, energy department, Environmental Protection Agency and at least a dozen others.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/16/elon-musk-doge-government-privatization	2025-02-16T04:00:05-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c63b8543ab23600247d78b8fab60446a4f259d2d/0_0_8041_4827/master/8041.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d4468700e2330e3e5519c2b961a65152

‘There has been an awakening’: ancient sects on the rise in Modi’s India	Some 400 million devotees will attend this year’s Kumbh Mela festival. Pilgrims and politicians explain why it’s bigger than ever They sat quietly together on the banks of the Ganges river, heads bowed in sombre meditation. Some men were naked, their bodies smeared grey with ash. Others had a simple saffron cloth tied around their waist. Nearby, barbers balanced on their haunches, shaving the head of each man clean with a flick of their knives, save for a small strand at the back. This ceremony, in which millions of pilgrims seek to cleanse their sins to break the cycle of reincarnation has been taking place at the Kumbh Mela festival for centuries. It is mandatory for thousands of sadhus – Hindu holy men who live an austere life of strict spiritual discipline. Among the most sacred events in the Hindu calendar, the festival occurs every 12 years across four sacred locations in India where it is believed the Hindu god Vishnu once spilled drops of the nectar of immortality.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/16/modi-india-kumbh-mela-hindu-festival-sects	2025-02-16T01:00:05-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16f9931a617907325e9faf12087ec4efe52b3aa1/370_0_6356_3815/master/6356.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ae7699d0e64f733f4585ebbc442b79ff
Munich security conference concludes as Europe scrambles to mount united front amid warming US-Russia ties – Europe live	Reports of planned meeting between US and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia leaves Europe concerned over Ukraine ceasefire negotiations The Munich security conference concludes today after a dramatic two days during which the US vice-president, JD Vance, excoriated European leaders, accusing them of suppressing free speech, and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, declared it was time to create a European army. With Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine looming over the conference, the two men met at its sidelines, with Zelenskyy demanding -security guarantees- and a joint US-Ukrainian peace plan before he enters into any talks with Moscow. Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said Europe will be consulted – but ultimately excluded – from the talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US. -To my European friends, I would say: ‘Get into the debate, not by complaining that you might, yes or no, be at the table, but by coming up with concrete proposals, ideas, ramp up [defence] spending’,- Kellogg said at the Munich conference on Saturday. Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb, said -Europe needs to talk less and do more-, in response to the prospect of being shut out of talks. -There’s no way in which we can have discussions or negotiations about Ukraine, Ukraine’s future or European security structure, without Europeans,- Stubb told reporters in Munich. -But this means that Europe needs to get its act together.- The Nato chief, Mark Rutte, said Europe had to come up with -good proposals- for securing peace in Ukraine if it wanted to be involved in US-led talks. -If Europeans want to have a say, make yourself relevant,- Rutte told journalists. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, and Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, have discussed Kyiv’s vision of a path to peace with China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi. Sybiha said on X the meeting that took place on the sidelines of the Munich conference was to -reaffirm mutual respect for territorial integrity-. On Friday, Wang told the conference that China believes all stakeholders in the war in Ukraine should participate in the peace talks, underscoring Europe’s role in them.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/16/ukraine-us-europe-donald-trump-russia-uk-relations-munich-conference-keir-starmer-live-latest-news	2025-02-16T00:34:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc1340e562fb3621e899bff82a7a81c1281bda60/0_280_7677_4608/master/7677.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=52c9812c64eb75be2e80ea40357c2a02

Australia news live: Dutton suggests teal MPs ‘will never come our way’ in event of a hung parliament; poll points to Coalition wave in outer suburbs	Follow all today’s headlines live On the upcoming election, Spender says -we need to see how this plays out- and that -it is very unclear exactly what [parliament] is going to look like in the end.- On statements from Peter Dutton this morning that the Independents should back him in any minority government: Yes, I’m sure that is what he thinks and it will depend on the numbers and the shape of the crossbench and what people are willing to negotiate and back at that time so I think we really need to look at it at the time. In relation to climate, I haven’t worked with the Coalition because I don’t think they are committed to a transition in terms of the most cost-effective and frankly good for the climate transition that we have at the moment. So my point is I take things on the basis of the arguments and on the basis of the evidence and I am very open to working with a coalition government and I’m open to working with the Labor government, but that depends on what they are actually going to put on the table. What I want to see is good process, good parliamentary process where all of these issues are really fleshed out, where community can actually listen to the experts arguing about these laws so that we can get one answer that is going to get big money out of politics and make sure there is a level playing field. Myself and I think others on the crossbench have approached decisions on parliament and how we vote and what we support really on the basis of what the evidence is saying. Is it in our long-term interests? What do our communities think? What are the experts think? Bringing that together, backing good ideas from all sides, working with all sides to try and get good policy through – that is how I will continue to behave whatever form the next parliament takes.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/feb/16/australia-news-live-tropical-cyclone-zelia-foreign-investors-housing-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-federal-election-ntwnfb	2025-02-15T15:43:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb828aba8f44a179a149d9d3830dc6f16efe0e14/0_277_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c3f61b4d4c1945c044f0d2b37e30613f

JD Vance’s Munich speech laid bare the collapse of the transatlantic alliance	The US vice-president was hypocritical and insensitive, but bracingly clear in his resetting of relationships Since 1963, the Munich Security Conference has seen many consequential speeches, notably Vladimir Putin announcing in 2007 that Russia would never accept a subordinate role in the new world order. But Friday’s speech by JD Vance, the US vice-president, has the potential to be the most consequential – the moment the world order against which Putin railed fell apart. Sometimes, even in this digital age, speeches can act as clarifiers. Yes, the 22 minutes were full of laughable hypocrisy, distorted portraits of European democracy and insensitivity to Europe’s trauma with fascism, but for what it said about the chasm in values between most in Europe and the Trump administration, it was hard to overlook.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/15/jd-vance-munich-speech-laid-bare-collapse-transatlantic-alliance-us-europe	2025-02-15T05:20:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fede26e2075023a08e341126494482c24e421d78/0_94_2526_1516/master/2526.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0b657cb7de8bf912e4468208ba3d036c

There are only two possible outcomes for any deal with Putin. If he remains in power, he will find a way to break the agreement. If he loses power, the agreement will become meaningless.- Probably it will be very, very, very difficult. And of course, in all the difficult situations, you have a chance. But we will have low chance – low chance to survive without support of the United States.- The widow of Russian dissident Alexei Navalny has warned there is -no point trying to negotiate- with Putin on Ukraine. -Just remember: he will lie,- Yulia Navalnaya told the Munich Security Conference on Friday. -If he remains in power, he will find a way to break the agreement.

Musk-linked group offered $5m for proof of voter fraud – and came up with nothing	Fair Election Fund has yet to reveal evidence of voter fraud despite deep-pocketed backers – and has now gone silent In May 2024, a flashy ad went viral on social media warning that -across the country, there are real cases of fraud and abuses of the [election] system that have eroded our trust-.

Trump administration continues to gut federal workforce – US politics live	Tens of thousands of government employees told to leave amid Elon Musk’s call to ‘delete’ entire agencies Good morning, US politics blog readers. The Trump administration’s drive to downsize the federal workforce continues, with news that thousands of US government employees across the United States have been told they are being let go. The latest cuts target employees in their probationary periods at agencies that include the Department of Veterans Affairs, Small Business Administration and US Forest Service. That’s in addition to the 75,000 employees the White House said accepted its legally questionable offer of deferred resignations. All this is taking place after Elon Musk, who Trump has appointed as chair of his -department of government efficiency- said that his intention was to -delete entire agencies-. Federal worker unions have sued over his moves, while warning that the Trump-Musk drive to downsize government by going after the people who work there threatens to undermine programs Americans depend on. We’ll tell you more about that today. Here’s what else is going on: Trump is heading to Mar-a-Lago for the weekend this afternoon, but before he does, he’ll sign executive orders at 1pm. He often invites the press into the Oval Office to watch him do so. Top federal prosecutors have resigned after receiving orders from the justice department to drop bribery charges against New York mayor Eric Adams. We expect to hear more about the fallout from the decision throughout the day. JD Vance is scheduled to meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and deliver remarks at the Munich security conference, where America’s European allies are grasping for details of the Trump administration’s new policy on Ukraine.

Middle East crisis live: Hamas expected to name Israeli hostages it will free this weekend	Israel warned Thursday that Hamas must release three living hostages this weekend or face a resumption of the war in Gaza Hamas is expected on Friday to name three hostages it will release this weekend as part of a planned exchange for Palestinian prisoners and detainees, according to local media. Israeli media reported on Thursday that Hamas was to name three hostages it would release on Saturday, after it reiterated its commitment to the ceasefire and to carrying out the next exchange -according to the specified timetable-. The Israeli government has signalled that it intends to stick to the hostage-release schedule agreed in the ceasefire deal with Hamas, but warned that if the anticipated three hostages are not released on Saturday, it would go back to war. Hamas said on Thursday it will continue implementing the Gaza ceasefire deal, including hostage exchange. Yemen’s Houthis said they will immediately take military action if the US and Israel attack Gaza, the group’s leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, said in a televised speech on Thursday. In Israel, dozens of relatives of hostages held in Gaza blocked a highway near Tel Aviv, waving banners and demanding the terms of the ceasefire be respected, an AFP journalist said on Thursday. US secretary of state Marco Rubio is expected to visit Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates soon to discuss the fragile Gaza ceasefire. On Thursday, for the first time since the truce began, Israel’s military said it identified a rocket launch from Gaza. The rocket landed back inside the Palestinian territory and the military later said it had struck the launcher. Two Jerusalem booksellers detained this week on charges their books were causing -public disorder- have said the experience reflected an intensifying campaign by the Israeli government against Palestinian culture and free speech. Mahmoud Muna and his nephew Ahmed, whose family has owned the Educational Bookshop for more than 40 years, spent two days in detention and will remain under house arrest until Sunday, despite the absence of evidence to support the vague accusations against them.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/14/israel-gaza-war-hostages-ceasefire-middle-east-latest-news	2025-02-13T23:41:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff04320e94723d3eb6b98b1d9ada2fdd83cbdcb8/0_168_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8092470913aae97059028299b105d7aa

EU failed to Trump-proof Europe and now faces humiliation over Ukraine	As Putin’s actions again disrupt the start of a Munich security conference, Brussels largely has itself to blame The start of the Munich security conference has a habit of being disrupted by a display of power by Vladimir Putin. In 2022, the transatlantic security establishment gathered in the knowledge that Putin was days from launching his attack on Kyiv. In 2023, the opposition leader Alexei Navalny died in disputed circumstances in a Russian jail and this year Russia’s leader is on the brink of opening talks with Donald Trump that many analysts predict will end with Russia not just gaining Ukrainian territory but dismembering Ukraine as a sovereign independent state. For Europe it is a humiliation. And yet little that Trump or his defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, said on Wednesday about their approach to a ceasefire including the US’s refusal to commit further resources to Ukraine could have come as a shock. Indeed Europe largely has only itself to blame.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/13/eu-failed-trump-proof-europe-humiliation-ukraine	2025-02-13T10:35:39-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff6f8280eb4bf537d4241a1670b083db040b64f4/0_216_2962_1777/master/2962.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a2377b9c40b84246b6935159df785531

Ukraine just the latest Trump wheeze for Labour to try to defend and disown | John Crace	It was left to the poor junior defence minister Maria Eagle to walk that particular tightrope in the Commons In his ghostwritten 1987 bestseller, The Art of the Deal, Donald Trump delivers his own version of the American Dream. Get as much as you can for yourself. There’s always someone out there who’s stupider than you. Any attention is better than none. Promise people the Earth even if you know you can never deliver. Paint yourself orange and glue what’s left of your hair to your head. This is business as a macho willy waving contest. So much so you suspect The Donald is deeply insecure about the size of his own. But maybe we should have read between the lines better. For the real message is: -Always let someone else take the hit.- After all, it wasn’t Trump who was left out of pocket when his hotels and casinos six times filed for bankruptcy between 1991 and 2009 due to an inability to meet scheduled payments. It was his creditors. That’s a business style The Donald has taken into his presidency. After the Trump Plaza and the Trump Tower, we now have the Trump Toilet. To flush away Ukraine.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/13/ukraine-just-the-latest-trump-wheeze-for-labour-to-try-to-defend-and-disown	2025-02-13T10:16:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b116ce9914af7ea96a5380227dbcc835a6098618/0_314_2987_1792/master/2987.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2c9e44ab5be7562a4d5991b8e7671d88

The rapid push to bring Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table is -not a betrayal- of Ukraine, the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, has insisted, after Donald Trump said he and Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin ceasefire talks and that Kyiv was unlikely to regain much territory or join Nato.

Google defends scrapping AI pledges and DEI goals in tense all-staff meeting	Exclusive: Google executives gave employees details on dropping the company’s promise against weaponized AI and nixing diversity goals Google’s executives gave details on Wednesday on how the tech giant will sunset its diversity initiatives and defended dropping its pledge against building artificial intelligence for weaponry and surveillance in a tense all-staff meeting.

It was the first time company executives have addressed the whole staff since Google announced it would no longer follow hiring goals for diversity and took down its pledge not to build militarized AI.

He said it would -good for society- for the company to be part of evolving geopolitical discussions in response to a question about why the company removed prohibitions against building AI for weapons and surveillance.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/google-all-staff-meeting-ai-dei	2025-02-12T10:49:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/102a4baa4e6267059acf012706e7e0d6f4188820/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=607f10bd3d2963104c6cd44596a5a84a

The workers from Mexico earned per day about the same as their US counterparts were paid by the hour, according to the American and Mexican sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of nervousness about speaking out publicly against the company.

Backlash over ‘spiteful’ move to block small boat refugees from ever claiming British citizenship – UK politics live	Stella Creasy says Home Office decision ‘erects more barriers’ to refugees integrating and contributing to communities in UK Good morning. On Monday MPs debated, and passed, the second reading of the border security, asylum and immigration bill. It is a signficant piece of legislation that repeals a lot of the Rwanda-policy law passed by the Tories and gives the authorities new anti-terrorism-style powers to tackle people smuggling. There is a good summary of it here. During the debate Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said one reason why the Conservatives were opposed to the bill was because it repealed section 32 of the Illegal Migration Act 2023 which -prevents people who enter the country illegally from gaining citizenship-. He went on: By repealing that section, the bill will create a pathway to citizenship for people who entered the country illegally, and I think that is unconscionable. This change flies in the face of reason. The British public want refugees who have been given safety in our country to integrate into and contribute to their new communities, so it makes no sense for the government to erect more barriers. We know that men women and children who are refugees want to feel part of the country that has given them a home, and support to rebuild their lives. So many refugees over many generations have become proud hard working British citizens as doctors, entrepreneurs and other professionals. Becoming a British citizen has helped them give back to their communities and this should be celebrated, not prevented. We urge ministers to urgently reconsider. What this message is saying is that we will judge your asylum claim, so we will let you stay in the country, but we will not expect you to be part of our community. I just genuinely, gently, say to my colleagues on the front bench, I think that is counterproductive. That is not where the British public are at. They recognize that there are not safe routes [for many refugees wanting to come to the UK]. If you are an Iranian dissident right now fleeing the regime, there is not a safe route. So you may well have come in a boat. We should absolutely interrogate your claim. If your claim is not well founded, you should not be able to stay. At first I hoped this was some sort of accident, a residue of the Illegal Migration Act, which legislated to have this same effect, still making its way through the system. But it doesn’t look like it. It looks deliberate. Even though those provisions of the Illegal Migration Act are being scrapped by this government. A permanent bar on citizenship for illegal entrants is a bad idea. It creates a permanent group on non citizens who are forever excluded from civic life no matter how long they live here and no matter what they do.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/12/pmqs-starmer-badenoch-small-boat-arrivals-citizenship-blocked-uk-politics-live-news	2025-02-12T01:22:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb7918a41f20b36de1b6b6419940b9c7c446def2/0_138_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8305877a5c6da4a780f0e8fdce0d85ec
