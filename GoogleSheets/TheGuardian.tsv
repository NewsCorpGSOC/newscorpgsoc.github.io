Minister says welfare budget ‘unsustainable’ amid reports Reeves has earmarked billions in cuts – UK politics live	Justice secretary said there is a ‘moral case’ for getting people into work when asked about the chancellor’s reported plans Good morning. Three weeks today Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, will present her spring statement. Originally this was not meant to involve budget-scale changes for plans to tax or spending (Reeves says she is only going to have one proper budget a year, in the autumn, to ensure stability), but changes to the country’s economic situation mean this statement is going to be more consequential than originally intended and this morning the BBC is running a story that looks like classic Treasury pitch rolling. The markets don’t like surprises and, while exact details of budget announcements are kept secret until the chancellor speaks to MPs, the Treasury invests a lot of effort in ensuring that people have a rough idea of what’s coming. According to a report by the BBC’s economics editor Faisal Islam, Reeves is going to announce cuts, worth several billions pounds, particularly affecting welfare. He says: The Treasury will put the proposed cuts to the government’s official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), on Wednesday amid expectations the chancellor’s financial buffer has been wiped out. Sources said -the world has changed- since Rachel Reeves’s Budget last October, when the OBR indicated she had £9.9bn available to spend against her self-imposed borrowing rules. Clearly the world has changed a lot since the autumn Budget. People are watching that change happen before their eyes. The Office for Budget Responsibility will reflect that changing world in its forecasts later this month and a changing world will be a core feature of the chancellor’s response later this month. This is the Labour party. The clue is in the name. We believe in work. We know that there are many people who are currently receiving state support for being out of work who want to be in work. We know that we have too many of our young people currently out of work, not in education, employment or training. It is right that a Labour government strains every sinew to make sure that the support is available to prevent people from leaving the labour market or, if they have left the labour market, to help them get back. We’ve seen a huge rise in that welfare budget. We know that there are millions of people who are out of work in our country who want to be in work. It is absolutely morally the right thing to do to support people, to make sure either they don’t leave the labour market, or if they have, they’re supported to get back into it.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/05/rachel-reeves-welfare-budget-spring-statement-pmqs-labour-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-news-uk-politics-live	2025-03-05T01:23:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ebe1389c6c5f4b6686a58a386eddef45b65dc9b/0_97_4127_2477/master/4127.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=890ae1635d150bf8d4ffe531dfe49d93

Wednesday briefing: The view from ​Russia as ​Trump upends the world order	In today’s newsletter: Pjotr Sauer explains Russia’s response to the new Trump administration following a fraught week in global relations Good morning. In his address to Congress last night, Donald Trump recited a letter from Volodymyr Zelenskyy offering to return to the negotiating table – and warmly welcomed the tone of discussions his administration has held with Russia. -We’ve received strong signals that they are ready for peace,- he said. -Wouldn’t that be beautiful?- That was not the first sign of Trump’s faith in Vladimir Putin’s promises – but it served to underline what is surely the most radical US foreign policy shift in a generation. Whether parroting Kremlin talking points on Zelenskyy’s democratic credentials, making false claims that Ukraine started the war or cutting off vital military aid to Kyiv, the US president has created a dynamic that would have scarcely been believable six months ago. Killed women count | Nearly one in 10 of all women who died at the hands of men in the UK over the past 15 years were mothers killed by their sons, a report reveals. The statistics have led to calls for the government to take specific action to tackle matricide. Tariffs | Justin Trudeau has claimed the aim of a -dumb- trade war launched by Donald Trump is to usher in the -complete collapse- of the Canadian economy and make it easier for the US to annex Canada. Leading stock market indices fell sharply, with the US benchmark S&amp;P 500 losing all its post-election gains, as the US slapped 25% taxes on Canadian and Mexican goods and hiked tariffs on China. Scams | An organised network operating from the former Soviet state of Georgia has scammed thousands of savers from the UK, Europe and Canada out of $35m (£27m) after they fell for fake celebrity adverts on Facebook and Google. The scheme was revealed in a leak of call centre data covering more than 1m recordings. Gaza | Arab leaders have endorsed a $53bn (£42bn) plan to rebuild Gaza under the future administration of the Palestinian Authority (PA), in a rushed attempt to present an alternative to Donald Trump’s idea for a property development-style plan. The Arab League presented the plans at a summit in Cairo.

More than 170 mothers killed by their sons in 15 years in UK, report reveals	Number is nearly one in 10 of all women killed by men, leading to calls for government action to tackle matricide Nearly one in 10 of all women who died at the hands of men in the UK over the past 15 years were mothers killed by their sons, a report reveals. Data analysing the deaths of 2,000 women killed by men since 2009 has given an unprecedented insight into the hidden scourge of matricide, with more than 170 mothers killed by their sons. 61% of women were killed by a current or former partner, 9% of women were killed by their sons, 6% by other family members, 15% by other men they knew and 10% by someone they did not know. Of the 213 women killed by a close family member, 80% were mothers killed by sons. Nearly half of women were stabbed, 27% strangled and 17% hit with a blunt instrument. In 16% of cases, a man used kicking, hitting or stamping as the weapon. In almost a quarter of cases, more than one form of violence was used. Overkill – the use of excessive, gratuitous violence beyond that necessary to cause the victim’s death – happened in 59% of femicides. Leicestershire had the highest rate of femicide over the period, followed by Merseyside, the West Midlands, Greater Manchester and London. Killed women involved in prostitution were younger and less likely to have been born in the UK. Children witnessed at least 163 femicides, while 37 women were killed alongside 53 children, most commonly by their father.

‘A real injustice’: mothers killed by their children is still a hidden issue in UK	Research shows that mothers are seen as a ‘safe space’ for their offspring – nearly all of them sons – to use violence The thought of mothers being abused or killed by their own children – the people they have carried, cared for and nurtured since birth – is something of an underexamined and almost taboo issue in Britain. There is a slowly growing body of research into why children under 18 use violent behaviour towards their parents. There is an even smaller body of research showing why adults – nearly all of them sons – do the same.

Failings in pulled Gaza documentary a ‘dagger to the heart’ of BBC’s credibility, says chair	Samir Shah told MPs ‘people weren’t doing their job’ in relation to the film Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone Failings in the making of a documentary on Gaza are a -dagger to the heart- of the BBC’s claims of trustworthiness and impartiality, the corporation’s chair has said, as he indicated that figures inside the corporation had fallen short in their handling of the film. Samir Shah said that he believed -people weren’t doing their job- in relation to the oversight of Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone.

First Thing: US suspends all military aid to Ukraine after Trump-Zelenskyy row	The drastic move came as JD Vance claimed that attracting US economic interest to Ukraine was the country’s best bet at security. Plus, the date by which the majority of adults globally will be overweight Good morning. The Trump administration has halted all US military aid to Ukraine, blocking the delivery of ammunition, vehicles, and other equipment as it pressures Kyiv to agree to a peace deal. What has the vice-president, JD Vance, said? That the US having financial interest in Ukraine is the best way to guarantee the country’s security. The comments come amid the minerals deal Washington wants Kyiv to sign. How do Americans feel about Ukraine? 52% of Americans said they -personally support- Ukraine, while only 4% of back Russia, a poll last week found. 44% said they do not support either. A separate poll conducted after the confrontation found that 49% said Trump and JD Vance had a stronger argument over the value of diplomacy with Russia. The 2Way poll also found that 62% thought Zelenskyy’s remarks at the White House were offensive – and 55% said Ukraine needed to negotiate and end the war. What about Mexico? The country’s president is expected to announce her response on Tuesday morning.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/04/first-thing-us-suspends-military-aid-ukraine-trump-zelenskyy-row	2025-03-04T03:30:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3deb44ed65c4f8071763ada2b533faf110d35d29/0_0_5770_3462/master/5770.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ebf716713b25c5dabdd4c5f9b66004b4

Trump to address Congress as policy decisions divide nation – US politics live	President expected to ask for more money for immigration crackdown as Democrats invite fired federal workers to speech Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. My name is Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news over the next few hours. We start with news that president Donald Trump will stand before a joint session of Congress today to give an accounting of his turbulent first weeks in office as a divided nation struggles to keep pace. The Trump administration has suspended delivery of all US military aid to Ukraine, blocking billions in crucial shipments as the White House piles pressure on Ukraine to sue for peace with Vladimir Putin. The decision affects deliveries of ammunition, vehicles, and other equipment including shipments agreed to when Joe Biden was president. It comes after a dramatic blow-up in the White House on Friday during which Donald Trump told Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he was -gambling with- a third world war. The Ukrainian president was told to come back -when he is ready for peace-. US vice-president JD Vance said that the best way to protect Ukraine from another Russian invasion is to guarantee the US has a financial interest in Ukraine’s future. -If you want real security guarantees, if you want to actually ensure that Vladimir Putin does not invade Ukraine again, the very best security guarantee is to give Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine,- Vance said in the interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity which aired Monday night. China and Canada unveiled retaliatory measures against the US after Donald Trump imposed his sweeping tariffs plan at midnight US time, despite warnings it could spark an escalating trade war. US tariffs have come into force of 25% against goods from Canada and Mexico, the US’s two biggest trading partners, and 20% tariffs against China – doubling the levy on China from last month. The duties will affect more than $918bn-worth (£722bn) of US imports from Canada and Mexico. The US health department told employees on Monday they could apply for early retirement over the next 10 days and should respond to a request for information on their accomplishments of the past week, according to emails seen by Reuters. Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, who oversees the so-called -department of government efficiency-, are spearheading an unprecedented effort to shrink the federal bureaucracy, including through job cuts. The US Senate has confirmed Linda McMahon as the nation’s next education secretary, entrusting the former wrestling executive with a department marked for dismantling by Donald Trump. The 76-year-old billionaire businesswoman and longtime Trump ally was approved 51-45, reflecting deep divisions over her qualifications and the administration’s education agenda. McMahon, who previously led the small business administration during Trump’s first term, now faces the paradoxical task of running an agency while simultaneously working toward its potential elimination. Two alleged leaders of a criminal organization suspected of smuggling 20,000 people without permanent legal residency into the US from Guatemala have been arrested in Los Angeles, federal prosecutors said on Monday. Eduardo Domingo Renoj-Matul, known as -Turko-, and his lieutenant, Cristobal Mejia-Chaj, were taken into custody Friday and have pleaded not guilty to multiple charges related to smuggling migrants across the border over five years, the US attorney’s office said. A federal judge ordered the men, who themselves are in the country illegally, jailed without bond until their trial in April.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/mar/04/donald-trump-congress-speech-ukraine-tariffs-democrats-federal-workers-us-politics-live-news	2025-03-04T02:52:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e385535968c59d843c6994afe48c3642d3edc59d/0_163_6000_3601/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c05084401e49dc4339b3c339fc4c6819

Starmer won’t be derailed from Ukraine plan, Rayner says, amid claims Trump’s aid decision ‘humiliated’ PM – UK politics live	Few hours after Starmer’s statement to Commons on Monday, White House suspended all military aid to Ukraine Good morning. Yesterday Keir Starmer had a comfortable two hours in the Commons during which MPs from all sides praised him, lavishly and sincerely, for the leadership he has shown on Ukraine, trying to hold the US and Europe together, while mobilising European efforts to build up support for Ukraine. There were probably only two moments when Starmer lashed out; first at Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, whom he accused of fawning over Vladimir Putin; and then at Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminser, whom he accused of being a keyboard warrior (in response to a question from a Labour MP who was even more critical). The attack on Flynn came about half an hour after Flynn asked a perfectly reasonable question. Unfortunately, it has been reported this afternoon that President Trump is set to meet American aides to discuss withdrawing military aid to Ukraine. Are those reports something that the prime minister recognises, and, if so, what impact will that have on the timetable to which he and President Macron are currently working? I have not seen reports of the United States withdrawing support for Ukraine, and, as I understand it, that is not its position.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/04/keir-starmer-ukraine-plan-donald-trump-aid-labour-conservative-uk-politics-latest-news	2025-03-04T01:12:34-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2baf10edcd01a6346a3265d1a3647d31816d139e/0_259_7775_4665/master/7775.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=76b42ddc4272d30109c864d899ad9c19

Tuesday briefing: Where Gaza’s fragile ceasefire stands – and what it will take to move it forward	In today’s newsletter: With talks stalled, aid blocked and a truce in question, can the path to peace get back on track? Good morning. The first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza expired over the weekend – and now, the only thing stopping the resumption of Israel’s assault on the territory is the will of Benjamin Netanyahu. That is the bleak reality for the hostages still alive in Gaza, and the Palestinian civilians there who were subjected to a new aid embargo on Sunday. Last night, the Israeli government was reported to be planning to ratchet the blockade up further – with a programme of measures referred to as the -hell plan-. When the ceasefire was agreed in January, the theory was that the first phase would provide space for negotiations over a more durable truce. But those talks simply have not happened. Israel is pushing for the release of more hostages in an extension to the first phase – a step that Hamas, fearing the loss of its only source of leverage, refuses to countenance. Both sides are now making preparations for the resumption of violence.

Education | Labour is preparing major changes to special educational needs provision in English schools, as individual councils raise the alarm over debts running into hundreds of millions of pounds. With councils currently paying to send many children to private schools because of a lack of adequate local options, the government is believed to be considering measures that would prioritise state provision.

Ministers plan major changes to Send education in England	White paper being prepared as councils hope for relief from huge deficits in special educational needs budgets Labour is preparing major changes to special educational needs provision in English schools, as individual councils raise the alarm over debts running into hundreds of millions of pounds that have pushed many to the brink of bankruptcy. A Guardian analysis has found the vast majority of English upper-tier councils have accumulated often eye-watering special educational needs spending deficits. At least 12 have forecast accumulated deficits of more than £100m, running as high as £312m, when the debts have to be settled in a year’s time. Some councils have raised concerns about profiteering amid frustration over huge fees from private specialist schools, which can charge between £50,000 and £100,000 per place, typically two to three times the cost of state provision. Tensions between headteachers and councils over attempts by the latter to shift millions of pounds from local school budgets to ease high needs deficits. Some schools have said such moves would force them to sack Send support staff. Attempts to rein in local Send demand and spending via -safety valve- initiatives at 42 councils have largely failed, with most failing to hit savings targets on time, despite receiving government grants running into tens of millions of pounds.	https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/mar/03/ministers-plan-major-changes-to-send-education-in-england	2025-03-03T06:32:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d28c9276148911acb41375e2c52fe95c27a6644e/0_197_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=151a5af5a31c6fbcbbeb51dd61556a05

Thailand condemned for ‘shameful’ mass deportation of Uyghur refugees to China	Amid claims that deportees may face torture, family of one man say he was forcibly repatriated and will never see his children again The family of one of dozens of Uyghurs feared to have been forcibly deported from Thailand to China have condemned the decision as -shameful-. The deportations came despite a UN statement saying those being sent to China faced a -real risk of torture- on their return. Thailand ignored protests by the UN refugee agency, EU and US in deporting 40 Uyghurs who had been detained in the country for a decade, claiming they had returned voluntarily -to their normal lives- with their families.	https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/mar/03/thailand-condemned-for-shameful-mass-deportation-of-uyghur-refugees-to-china	2025-03-03T05:45:05-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c78bd30fc7b651c79c12020cb70e00212ed3565c/886_325_3130_1879/master/3130.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ffcbfc45fdeb858b100844eafcf9fa70

Tories fight abolition of hereditary peers as Labour’s Lords reforms stall	Keir Starmer’s plan to replace upper house was scaled back to scrapping hereditaries – but even that is proving difficult Abolishing hereditary peers was supposed to be the easy part of House of Lords reform for Labour, which grandly set out plans three years ago to replace the second chamber altogether. But on Monday Conservative peers will make an effort to clog up the legislation as it goes through parliament, suggesting delays to allow abolished hereditaries more time to find a job, allowing some of them to stay, or even converting them to become life peers. As a detailed scrutiny of the bill gets under way, 116 amendments have been put forward, which are likely to be debated individually. Some propose progressive changes such as cutting numbers of peers, introducing attendance requirements and getting rid of bishops from the house, but many are aimed at watering down the abolition of hereditaries.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/03/abolition-hereditary-peers-labour-lords-reform	2025-03-03T04:00:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bb62dabf7e54e75f6a36aebb5b82b4e3787ba87/1_0_4999_3000/master/4999.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=888ca7da988529f7624ab90f1ad39413

Peter Mandelson criticised after saying Ukraine should give ‘unequivocal backing’ to Trump’s plan – UK politics live	Defence minister Luke Pollard tries to distance the government from the US ambassador’s comments to the media Good morning. Domestic politics has not gone away, but it is all being eclipsed at the moment by the Ukraine crisis, and the efforts Keir Starmer is leading to develop a Europe-led peace plan and – crucially – to keep the US and Europe at least broadly aligned. The stakes are enormous. Labour is very proud of the role the Attlee government played in creating Nato, but now its future as a funtioning alliance is in doubt. In his press conference yesterday Starmer said he did not accept the US is now an -unreliable ally-. But many Europeans who watched President Trump and JD Vance bully and belittle President Zelenskyy on camera in the Oval Office on Friday will have come to a different conclusion. Starmer is expected to make a statement to MPs about his visit to the White House, and yesterday’s summit in London, and that should start after 3.30pm. We need a very radical reset. The reset has to consist of the US and Ukraine getting back on the same page. And President Zelenskyy giving his unequivocal backing to the initiative that President Trump is taking to end the war and to bring a just and lasting peace to Ukraine. And the Europeans too need to back the calls for a ceasefire. And by the way, I think that Ukraine should be the first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow. The UK ambassador to Washington isn’t meant to communicate his own opinion, he is meant to communicate the UK government opinion. Lammy and Starmer need to grip this. What is Mandelson up to? You cannot square what the Prime Minister said this morning with this. What is the Government’s actual position? Our man in DC should be securing US protection for our brave Ukrainian allies, not telling President Zelensky what to do. No. It’s certainly right that Ukrainians want peace. I think of all the people on our continent that want peace, the Ukrainians want it the most. But we’re still in discussions, diplomatic engagement with our European, US and Ukrainian friends as to the shape of that deal. That’s not government policy and you wouldn’t expect me to commentate on every ups and downs in negotiations.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/03/peter-mandelson-ukraine-donald-trump-volodymyr-zelenskyy-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live	2025-03-03T01:12:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72e7098aa494ad66591abd150135b84a45ca41db/0_199_7599_4559/master/7599.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4fd849e23e71bb7de435a6bf864240b9

Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said yesterday that it was imposing a blockade on Gaza because Hamas would not accept a plan which it claimed had been put forward by the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to extend phase one of the ceasefire and continue to release hostages, and postpone phase two, which should, in theory, see Israel completely withdraw its forces from Gaza, in effect ending the war.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/mar/03/middle-east-crisis-live-news-israel-criticised-aid-blockade-gaza	2025-03-03T00:54:47-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08c61561998bc2262ffdebb2d82718d209d0a54d/0_169_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ab7b2d3412798fdb23079a2c1aed635c

Monday briefing: UK and Europe pick up the pieces after White House car crash	In today’s newsletter: After Friday’s clash meeting in the Oval Office between Trump and Zelenskyy, Keir Starmer and his European allies will try to broker the peace Ukraine desperately needs Good morning. After the shocking treatment he received at the White House on Friday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy was on friendlier turf yesterday – but whether a bear hug from Keir Starmer and an audience with King Charles will ultimately prove consequential for the war in Ukraine is still anyone’s guess. The Ukrainian president was in the UK to attend a European summit, convened by Starmer, to take steps towards new proposals that might be able to find support in Kyiv and Washington alike. And while there were some signs of European unity, the White House and its surrogates were still suggesting that Zelenskyy was guilty of some sort of insult to the United States that might be enough to make a durable peace impossible. Last night, Zelenskyy refused to say whether he believed he had been ambushed – but said that he was ready to talk to Trump again.

Amid brutal foreign wars and democracy under siege, the Oscars were silent on Trump	No one uttered the US president’s name, and speeches bore few references to Gaza or Ukraine, focusing on the LA fires The 97th Academy Awards had one of the longest run times for the annual show in recent history, yet the least mentions of the current political climate – with not a single person uttering the name -Donald Trump-. While few people watch awards shows – least of all the Oscars – for political discussion, comments on world events have long been an expected part of the broadcasts. Trump himself has even weighed in on a show – at least once while it aired: last year, while campaigning for re-election, he posted on Truth Social and asked rhetorically whether there was ever a -worse host- than Jimmy Kimmel at the 2024 Oscars and criticized his opening monologue.

Labour unveils sick-pay guarantee for 1.3m lowest-paid workers	Workers earning under £123 a week to get 80% of salary in sick pay, keeping more people off benefits More than 1 million of the lowest-paid UK workers are to be guaranteed sick pay worth up to 80% of their weekly salary from the first day of sickness, under changes intended to boost living standards. The UK has one of the stingiest rates of statutory sick pay in the developed world, according to the Resolution Foundation, with those earning less than £123 a week not entitled to anything. For the rest, the rate is set at just £116.75 a week at present, rising to £118.75 – or £3 an hour – for full-time workers from April, but that only kicks in after three days of sickness.	https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/mar/03/labour-unveils-sick-pay-guarantee-for-13m-lowest-paid-workers	2025-03-02T21:00:28-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da8d367866c993073c364c4fbc200cb128bb2733/0_59_4425_2655/master/4425.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=979cc0d0432b75c0d5cc2f0270c7075f

Europe has a lot to do before it can exert real influence on a Ukraine peace deal	The continent’s role in any ceasefire will be limited unless countries commit more to Kiev and the Zelenskyy/Trump relationship is repaired Europe and the UK are hoping they are on the brink of assembling a credible military coalition that Donald Trump can only refuse to support at risk of appearing openly to ally with Vladimir Putin – an alliance many grassroots Republicans reject.

Keir Starmer, it seems, is the person now forced to say: hang on, it is a bit more complicated than that.

‘Trump doesn’t understand who the aggressor is’: fatigue and anger in Odesa	Russian attacks on Ukrainian city that was initially spared worst have increased since Washington-Moscow detente Olena Palash heard a loud buzzing above her flat in the Ukrainian port of Odesa. It was 11pm. First one drone, and another, then more. Soon afterwards, one of the Shaheeds crashed into the children’s clinic where she works. An explosion shredded the building’s facade. The metal covering of a car park was remade into a spaghetti-like jumble. Another drone smashed into a nearby kindergarten. The attack on 18 February knocked out a substation and plunged some of the city into darkness. Four people were injured, including a 10-year-old girl, and 80,000 were left without heat.

Revealed: New Orleans touted public safety street closures for years but didn’t implement them	A Guardian analysis shows that vehicles were allowed to approach Bourbon Street despite safety plans in years leading up to deadly attack Local government officials in New Orleans, which endured an intentional, deadly truck ramming attack on its most famous street during New Year’s Day celebrations, have not shut down vehicular cross traffic on that street during major events nearly 90 times – evidently failing to fully enact public safety plans that they touted ahead of the gatherings, a Guardian investigation has confirmed. In many cases, cars and other vehicles were allowed to cross the street for the entire period that the city’s press releases said they would be forbidden from doing so. And during all but a handful of days, officials failed to place any physical barriers that would prevent motorists intending to attack crowds there from turning in either direction on to Bourbon Street, a one-way thoroughfare, leaving pedestrians vulnerable to terrorists for many years.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/02/new-orleans-public-safety-measures	2025-03-02T05:00:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69176fc58661a34123b7e128d00572f9aebb575f/0_18_1137_682/master/1137.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a7b52c03ff97e472666d89c8614f829f

ACLU sues to block White House from sending 10 immigrants to Guantánamo	Latest federal lawsuit so far applies only to 10 men detained in the US and facing transfer to the naval base in Cuba Civil rights attorneys sued the Trump administration Saturday to prevent it from transferring 10 undocumented immigrants detained in the US to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, their second legal challenge in less than a month over plans to hold up to 30,000 people there for deportation. The latest federal lawsuit so far applies only to 10 men facing transfer to the naval base in Cuba, and their attorneys said the administration will not notify them of who would be transferred or when. As with a lawsuit the same attorneys filed earlier this month for access to people already detained there, the latest case was filed in Washington and is backed by the American Civil Liberties Union.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/01/aclu-immigration-trump-guantanamo	2025-03-01T12:46:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcbd9d069ed2dbca4aeb1247ebc3e9e3e83f6eac/0_550_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d7a8ddd40563bef0911c85144b6b80d6
Trump officials fume at Zelenskyy for disregarding advice before meeting	Officials say minerals deal would serve as commitment to US security guarantee and Ukraine leader shouldn’t have pressed issue Inside the Trump White House, officials blamed the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, for the meltdown in the Oval Office on Friday, and expressed frustration that he pushed for security guarantees even though the US had made clear they wanted to negotiate that later, according to people familiar with the matter.

Friend or foe? Keir Starmer now walks a tightrope between Europe and US	No sooner had the PM charmed the president in the Oval Office than consensus over Ukraine – and the future of Nato – was starting to fall apart Even as Keir Starmer and his entourage heaved sighs of relief and tried not to grin too broadly as they filed out of the Oval Office after the prime minister’s meeting with Donald Trump, there were some in British circles who were, even then, anxious. The invitation from King Charles for a second state visit had been handed over to Trump in person and opened before the cameras. Trump, for once, had seemed genuinely lost for words. Starmer had at one point put his hand on Trump’s shoulder like a close friend or relative to emphasise their closeness as the UK delegation looked on, stony-faced but amazed.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/01/friend-or-foe-keir-starmer-now-walks-a-tightrope-between-europe-and-us	2025-03-01T11:57:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75b24ea1b6238eae13be2cbe8d392422dfc8d0c9/0_275_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=43aa591089dc5f436fcfe4a4380a20df

The last week of meetings between Trump, Macron, Starmer and finally Zelenskyy always felt like crawling across a minefield. Some might agonise about whether Zelenskyy could have played things differently. It’s the wrong question. The point is that we can’t carry on being so dependent on every meeting at the White House. Until we start taking charge of our future, we will always be one heart palpitation away from dreading doomsday.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/01/how-do-we-make-europe-more-secure-here-are-five-steps-we-need-to-take-now	2025-03-01T08:29:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fd49d68fcd62ac5deadad0b8b10a29a10687172/0_185_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7f4eebbcdbe5924b221a34f3c82754d3

The Miami Waterkeeper says the ageing Turkey Point facility in south Miami-Dade county, which was built in 1967 and generates power for a metropolitan area covering about 3 million people, is especially vulnerable to flooding and excessive heat from the climate emergency, in part because of its low-lying position and coastal exposure to a major hurricane.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/01/nuclear-power-plants-miami-florida	2025-03-01T06:00:43-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eae5876a73085e00fe6a76f728f54c1dd191dbd3/0_237_4688_2814/master/4688.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cc4394d0f7590b8820c9a16de11262a9

Live: European leaders rally behind Zelenskyy after stunning Trump clash – updates	European leaders voice support for Ukrainian leader as US support for Kyiv hangs in the balance following disastrous meeting Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine, hours after an unprecedented showdown between US president Donald Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. European leaders have voiced their solidarity with Ukraine in the wake of the disastrous summit, in which Trump said the Ukrainian leader was not -ready for peace- and accused him of -gambling with world war three-. European leaders have rallied behind Zelenskyy after the unprecedented exchange. The heads of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the European Council, Antonio Costa, were among the leaders who assured Zelenskyy of Europe’s support. -Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader,- said the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas. German chancellor Olaf Scholz said: -Ukraine can rely on Germany – and on Europe.- French president Emmanuel Macron said: -Russia is the aggressor and Ukraine is the aggressed people.- A spokesperson for UK prime minister Keir Starmer said: -He retains his unwavering support for Ukraine.- Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán stood out in Europe for thanking Trump for having -stood bravely for peace-. Moscow, meanwhile, reacted with glee to the Trump-Zelenskyy clash, with former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev – now deputy head of Russia’s security council – saying on Telegram: -A brutal dressing down in the Oval Office.- In an interview with Fox news, Zelenskyy expressed regret that the Trump meeting became acrimonious but insisted their relationship could be salvaged. The Ukrainian leader defended himself, but also acknowledged the dispute was -not good for both sides-. Asked if he felt he owed the US president an apology, as many of Trump’s Republican allies have demanded, Zelenskyy did not directly answer, saying instead: -I think that we have to be very open and very honest. And I’m not sure that we did something bad.- US secretary of state Marco Rubio called on Zelenskyy to apologise after the disastrous exchange, while questioning whether the Ukrainian leader really wanted a peace deal. Zelenskyy should -apologise for turning this thing into the fiasco for him that it became-, Rubio told CNN. -There was no need for him to go in there and become antagonistic.- The Trump administration is considering ending all ongoing shipments of military aid to Ukraine after the Oval Office meeting, according to a report. The decision, if taken, would apply to billions of dollars of radars, vehicles, ammunition and missiles awaiting shipment to Ukraine through the presidential drawdown authority, the Washington Post reports, citing a senior US official. US Democratic lawmakers came to Zelenskyy’s defence, condemning Trump and Vance’s -shameful- and -disgraceful- treatment of the Ukrainian leader. But Trump’s Republican colleagues described the Oval Office exchange as evidence that the president was -putting America first-. US senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, who was once among the most outspoken advocates for supporting the Ukraine war effort, called on Zelenskyy to resign. A Russian drone strike on a medical facility and other targets in Kharkiv late on Friday injured at least five people, according to local officials. Regional governor Oleh Syniehubov said eight drones hit civilian areas in three central districts of Ukraine’s second largest city. More than 50 people were evacuated from the medical facility and emergency crews were bringing a fire triggered by the strike under control, he said. Dozens of buildings were damaged.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/mar/01/live-european-leaders-rally-behind-zelenskyy-after-trump-vance-clash-updates	2025-02-28T22:53:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/762c41c53d0bef46ae2f32744fbe359f74be911e/0_206_7451_4473/master/7451.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=55082309b73a0b76e0c6bb09d8cdf42a

Two cameras recorded the circumstances of one such death The last time Nassar al-Hammouni talked to his son, Ayman, it was by telephone and the 12-year-old was overflowing with plans for the coming weekend, and for the rest of his life. He had joined a local football team and planned to register at a karate club that weekend. When he grew up, he told Nassar, he was going to become a doctor, or better still an engineer to help his father in the construction job that took him away from their home in Hebron every week. None of that – the football, the karate or his imagined future career – will happen now. Last Friday, two days after the call to his father, Ayman was killed, shot by Israeli fire, video footage seen by the Guardian suggests.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/01/footage-shows-last-moments-boy-12-killed-in-west-bank	2025-02-28T21:00:29-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be4cd3e63a8d4a045624574ea5a7198477afabff/0_82_665_399/master/665.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bcf395f4496782a22e1075f8e4d9e90a

Sex 20 times a week? New study identifies four types of romantic lover	Australian research is ‘first to empirically show that we don’t all love the same’, lead author says New research has identified four types of romantic lover, including one that has sex up to 20 times a week. The research, published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences, categorised lovers as mild romantic, moderate romantic, intense romantic, and libidinous romantic. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Mild: About one in five – 20.02% – fell into this cluster, characterised by -the lowest intensity, lowest obsessive thinking, lowest commitment, and lowest frequency of sex-. This group also had the lowest proportion of people who thought their partner was -definitely- in love with them – just 25.31% – and the lowest proportion having sex, at 82.72%. Moderate: About four in 10 – 40.91% – landed in this category, which Bode described as -fairly stock-standard- – or in the words of the journal article, -entirely unremarkable-. Those in this category were more likely to be male, and less likely to have children. This group had -relatively low intensity, relatively low obsessive thinking, relatively high commitment, and relatively moderate frequency of sex-. Intense: This category described about one in three – 29.42% – of survey respondents, who Bode described as -crazy in-love- types. They were characterised by -the highest intensity, highest obsessive thinking, highest commitment, and relatively high frequency of sex-. About six in 10 people in this group were female. Libidinous: About one in 10 – 9.64% – were libidinous romantic lovers, who had sex an average of 10 times a week and up to 20 times. They were characterised as -relatively high intensity, relatively high obsessive thinking, relatively high commitment, and exceptionally high frequency of sex-. This group were slightly more likely to be male, and had the highest proportion of people in a committed relationship but not living together.	https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/mar/01/sex-20-times-a-week-new-study-identifies-four-types-of-romantic-lover	2025-02-28T15:00:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20fb8153df8ca00ed2e36a7cdddffd51df435e85/0_88_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cf4f5d5ca251ed73021c1687e145b9dc

Labor unions cheer court ruling that blocked Trump’s mass firings – US politics live	Lawyers for the unions hail ruling as ‘important initial victory’ An official at the Health and Human Services agency (HHS) has criticised Robert F Kennedy’s failure to address a measles outbreak in Texas which has led to the first recorded measles death in the US since 2015. Speaking to NBC News anonymously, the official told the news network Kennedy has done nothing about the outbreak, observing: -It’s almost like he’s still in campaign-mode rather than realizing he’s head of a large agency and workforce.- The Trump administration has fired hundreds of workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the US’s pre-eminent climate research agency. The Trump administration has taken down the online application form for several popular student debt repayment plans, causing confusion among borrowers and likely creating complications for millions of Americans with outstanding loans. The US justice department has released additional files related to the late disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. New laws in Florida impose harsher penalties for offenses committed by people illegally in the US than for everyone else, with an automatic death sentence for anyone who is in the US illegally and is convicted of first-degree murder.

Starmer’s Trump meeting ‘spectacular success’, says Streeting, as Tories dismiss president’s backing for Chagos deal – UK politics live	Health secretary hails talks over defence, security and trade as Badenoch says her party will continue to oppose Chagos deal Good morning. Keir Starmer is back in the UK and, in the unlikely event that he goes into a newsagent’s this morning, he will find that his meeting with President Trump in the White House has secured him perhaps the most favourable press coverage he has had since the general election. Gloria De Piero, the broadcaster and former Labour MP, has the headlines laid out here. Of course, the success of a government should never be judged by what the national newspapers are saying about it (few other performance indicators are less reliable), but after months of relentlessly critical press coverage, Starmer will be grateful for a spot of respite. I thought that the meeting yesterday was a spectacular success both on the defence and security issues that President Trump and our prime minister were discussing but also on the enthusiasm President Trump showed for a deeper trading relationship.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/28/keir-starmer-donald-trump-kemi-badenoch-uk-politics-live	2025-02-28T01:49:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6536a516c3053353997f79a2f9eadd014807f664/759_293_6719_4032/master/6719.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=414dd813a7351c654a59ba7a575e9721
‘Tea with a side of flattery’: what US papers say about Starmer’s meeting with Trump	The get-together between the UK prime minister and US president barely made a splash across the Atlantic A quick scan of the UK newspaper front pages and you would be forgiven for thinking it was the diplomatic moment of the century, but a glance at the media on the other side of the Atlantic suggests Keir Starmer and Donald Trump’s get-together barely made a splash. Instead, much of the scant coverage portrayed the prime minister as a messenger, bringing an invite for something much more glamorous than a former lawyer from Oxted: the royal red carpet.	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/feb/28/what-us-papers-say-starmer-trump-meeting-uk-prime-minister-us-president	2025-02-28T00:46:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d14637a0649acaf088a5ceec6a74c545e114a3de/261_0_5506_3304/master/5506.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c7346aaa8c97a1c0b797bb35d403330
Zelenskyy expected to sign minerals deal with US during Trump talks – Europe live	Key details of agreement yet to be made public but US president has resisted agreeing to provide security guarantees If you want to catch up on the key developments from last night’s meeting between Trump and Starmer, our global affairs correspondent Andrew Roth has this helpful summary for you. Keir Starmer’s meeting with Donald Trump this week comes at a crucial moment for the war in Ukraine and the future of the Nato alliance. Europe is looking for leaders who can engage Trump on the future of the continent as the US leader appears more inclined to demand tribute from his allies and cosy up to Vladimir Putin. Can the -special relationship- between the US and the UK save the day? Or has the era of transatlantic cooperation ended in the era of -America first-? Starmer has already established a friendly rapport with Trump and comes bearing promises to raise defense spending and negotiate on trade, but can that overcome Trump’s impulse to abandon Europe and strike a deal with Russia to end the war as quickly as possible?	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/28/volodymyr-zelenskyy-donald-trump-us-minerals-deal-russia-ukraine-live-news	2025-02-28T00:15:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0aced75232507ee480b215c2d092c4001591fe3/0_149_4418_2651/master/4418.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d4f67004122736f48a426912ad508d5f

Donald Trump’s body language uncovered: ‘If you’re the silverback, you stand proud’	The recent ‘hand jiu-jitsu’ with Keir Starmer is just the latest awkward exchange between the US president and world leaders As Keir Starmer handed Donald Trump his unprecedented invitation from King Charles – a second state visit – he grasped the US president chummily by the shoulder, more than once. Starmer was skating a tricky line, between matey familiarity and patronising reassurance, which must have been tutored, as he’s not a tactile man. Trump’s body language looked completely untaught, because nobody could teach this.

DoorDash to repay $16.75m in pocketed tips to New York delivery workers	Delivery app claimed that 100% of tips went to ‘dashers’ but instead used them to subsidize workers’ base salary The delivery platform DoorDash is paying $16.75m to settle an investigation conducted by New York authorities that charged the company with using tips from customers to subsidize workers’ base pay. Between May 2017 and September 2019, DoorDash used a guaranteed pay model to show delivery workers how much they would make before accepting a delivery. The investigation by the New York attorney general, Letitia James, found that under this model DoorDash used tips from customers to offset the base pay it guaranteed to workers rather than giving them the full tips.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/27/doordash-new-york-tips-delivery-workers	2025-02-27T12:43:05-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56dd33817a32077680a80ebffa3c98cad776b8a9/0_145_4358_2615/master/4358.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1c572f8f1fe0691828faac9137310cb4

Australia news live: former ADF chief warns nuclear power plants could be war targets; Greens unveil arts policy	Ukraine war shows nuclear plants a priority target during conflict, experts say. Follow today’s news live Australian nuclear reactors could become a target of war if the federal coalition was to go ahead with plans to build them, AAP reports. The Australian Security Leaders Climate Group, a group of former defence leaders, has warned that the plan to build seven small nuclear reactors across five states on the sites of coal-fired stations could leave Australia vulnerable to missile warfare and sabotage. Every nuclear power facility is a potential dirty bomb because rupture of containment facilities can cause devastating damage. With the proposed power stations all located within a 100 kilometres of the coast, they are a clear and accessible target. Australia would be no different.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/feb/28/australia-news-live-creative-australia-adrian-collette-greens-election-cost-of-living-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-ntwnfb	2025-02-27T12:04:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a65acb146c5bce284a8d2a28fffcacb8eaf98cc/0_220_7233_4340/master/7233.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c65f94af6697ffdc8d8d2a896ce5851c

California’s beautiful dream of a bullet train whisking passengers from Los Angeles to San Francisco in less than three hours has been more than 16 years in the making, approved by voters but dogged by so many delays, broken deadlines and cost overruns that it has only just reached the initial stages of laying down track.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/27/trump-california-high-speed-rail	2025-02-27T08:00:30-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e734dffd84ea9cb5add60740f163e3bcfb6f99c/0_354_5298_3178/master/5298.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=48adaafe17eb6a6952dd10ed3a38e949

Trump used the first full cabinet meeting of his second term to emphasize his administration’s focus on drastically reducing the size of the federal government, and signed an executive order expanding the power of Elon Musk’s Doge -agency-. Trump may be pursuing a mineral rights deal with Vladimir Putin and Russia as well as with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Ukraine, a top Senate Democrat has warned. Transgender service members will be separated from the US military unless they receive an exemption, according to a Pentagon memo filed in court on Wednesday. UK prime minister Keir Starmer is due to visit the White House to discuss Trump’s efforts to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine directly with Russia. Diplomats from Russia and the US will meet in Istanbul on Thursday to discuss the operation of their respective embassies in Moscow and Washington.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/feb/27/donald-trump-cuts-elon-musk-keir-starmer-ukraine-latest-updates	2025-02-27T01:43:47-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9742d6248b419e6deb179597360536400c1834b/0_231_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=29f0d4e96850ca7c03dbab74ffdc411e
Trump says US will make Europe provide security guarantees to Ukraine ahead of Starmer meeting – UK politics live	Starmer said he wants Trump to agree that, in the event of a peace settlement in Ukraine, US will offer security guarantees that make it durable Good morning. Keir Starmer is in Washington where later today he will have his first meeting with President Trump since the inauguration. With Trump aligning with Moscow even more explicitly than he did during his first administration, and threatening to wind down the Nato guarantees that have underpinned the security of western Europe since the second world war, the stakes could not be higher. Starmer, despite leading a party whose activists mostly loathe Trump and everything he represents, has managed to establish a warm relationship with the president and today will give some clues as to what extent he can sustain that, and protect the UK from the tariff warfare that Trump is threatening to unleash on the EU. But Starmer is one of three European leaders in Washington this week (Emmanuel Macron was there on Monday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy is there tomorrow) and today’s meeting is also part of a wider story about the fracturing of the US/Europe alliance. It is definitely in trouble; but what is not yet clear is whether after four years of Trump it will still be functioning effectively. Starmer spoke to reporters on his flight to the US yesterday. Pippa Crerar, the Guardian’s political editor, was on the plane and, as she reports, Starmer said he wants Trump to agree that, in the event of a peace settlement in Ukraine, the US will offer security guarantees that will make it durable. He has already said that Britain would contribute troops to a European so-called -tripwire- peace-keeping force, there to defend Ukraine and deter Russia. But European soldiers would need US air and logistical support to be effective, and Starmer is looking for assurances on this topic. I’m not going to make security guarantees beyond very much. We’re going to have Europe do that.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/27/keir-starmer-donald-trump-white-house-ukraine-uk-politics-live-news	2025-02-27T01:32:49-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9afac33b0bc37a566d1bb18e5f06d497272eb4e/0_0_7986_4794/master/7986.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5fd10bd2c1efdfeef47e91e256566424

Immigration and wealth advisers have said the proposed initiative is unlikely to trigger a major inflow of wealthy global investors seeking US citizenship because of concerns over higher taxes, Reuters reports. I do not believe that the current POTUS offer will have a big impact, as getting a green card in the US if you meet certain criteria, is not difficult. Paying $5 million for a golden visa and getting taxed on your global income defeats the purpose.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/feb/26/donald-trump-mike-johnson-republicans-democrats-spending-bill-elon-musk-doge-us-politics-news-live	2025-02-26T18:49:02-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a3ab29d4f9c03b91e9f47711b52e0cef7e6520e/82_0_5147_3088/master/5147.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f57f80b5d580131582f75b9c67e97050

US climate research agency braces for ‘efficiency’ cuts: ‘They will gut the work’	Workers at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fear crackdown will have global fallout The Trump administration has set its sights on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the US’s pre-eminent climate research agency, with significant cuts and a political crackdown on climate science. As Trump takes aim at the agency, the impact is likely to be felt across the US and around the world. Noaa provides essential resources to the public and has helped make the US a scientific leader internationally. Operating 18 satellites and 15 research and survey ships, the agency’s scientists, engineers and policy experts issue forecasts relied on by aviation, agriculture and fishing industries; ocean floor mapping depended upon for shipping; advises on species protection, and increasingly precise and accurate modeling on what to expect as climate crisis unfolds.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/26/us-climate-research-agency-noaa-cuts	2025-02-26T04:00:35-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb9b307e6dc7e94e87dda3a40a6911535bdc837a/0_130_3900_2340/master/3900.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c64677d527c79d9f8d68ce4f8e15457d

David Lammy says key projects in Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan to be protected as aid spending slashed – UK politics live	The foreign secretary described the decision to cut development aid to fund defence as ‘extremely difficult’ Good morning. At Westminster MPs are still absorbing the implications of Keir Starmer’s decision to slash the aid budget to fund an increase in defence spending. Pippa Crerar and Kiran Stacey have all the details in their overnight story. John Healey, the defence secretary, has been giving interviews this morning and he has faced a lot of questions about whether this announcement was entirely about pleasing Donald Trump. -No, it’s not,- he told Sky News. Healey pointed out that raising defence spending by 2.5% of GDP was a Labour manifesto commitment. (That’s true, but the manifesto did not say it would happen by 2027 – or that aid spending would be cut to fund it.) But Healey did not try to pretend that the timing of the announcement was unrelated to the fact that Starmer has his first meeting with Trump since the inauguration in the White House tomorrow. -President Trump, over the last two weeks, has been very direct in his challenge,- Healey said. This is unfortunate. Lammy self evidently not been able to protect the foreign office budget since only weeks ago urged the US not to cut its aid budget saying it would be a big strategic mistake. By cutting to 0.3% of GDP, the UK, once an aid superpower, joins Italy in the G7 in being one of the least generous of industrialised countries. Fear of Reform, and Trump, drives No 10’s and Treasury choices. To make this [higher defence spending] commitment, and stick within our fiscal rules, we have had to make the extremely difficult decision to lower our spending on international development. As the prime minister said, we do not pretend any of this is easy. This is a hard choice that no government – let alone a Labour government – makes lightly. I am proud of our record on international development. It helps address global challenges from health to migration, contributes to prosperity, and supports the world’s most vulnerable people. It grows both our soft power and our geopolitical clout, while improving lives. For all of those reasons, this government remains committed to reverting spending on overseas aid to 0.7% of gross national income when the fiscal conditions allow. But we are a government of pragmatists not ideologues – and we have had to balance the compassion of our internationalism with the necessity of our national security.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/26/david-lammy-john-healey-defence-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-pmqs-uk-politics-live-news-updates	2025-02-26T01:43:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9939ea8186417797ea2424fc2d22e4faa538800/127_90_2298_1378/master/2298.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6f8cc176bd6c6c7d55ff4232f2fea3b0

Wednesday briefing: Why Keir Starmer cut foreign aid to pay for defence – and who loses out	In today’s newsletter: The prime minister announced a significant increase in defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, funded entirely by a cut in the aid budget Good morning. On Tuesday, Keir Starmer confirmed that the government will increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, with plans to raise it further to 3% during the next parliament. The announcement marks the biggest increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war, but the even bigger surprise came with the announcement that the additional funding would come directly from the overseas aid budget, which will fall from 0.5% to 0.3% of GDP – a cut of around £6bn. Ukraine | Donald Trump has said that Volodymyr Zelenskyy is likely to visit the White House on Friday to sign a rare earth minerals deal worth $500bn to pay for US military aid. Gaza | Israel is seeking to extend the first stage of the ceasefire agreement in the war with Hamas in Gaza and is prepared to resume fighting if there is no progress in crucial talks this week, according to reports. Health | Wes Streeting will axe thousands of jobs at NHS England after his ousting of its chair and chief executive in what health service staff fear is a power grab. The health secretary’s plan follows Amanda Pritchard’s shock announcement on Monday that she was stepping down as the organisation’s chief executive next month. She will be replaced, for the foreseeable future, by Sir Jim Mackey. Education | British universities have been warned to -stress-test- all assessments after new research revealed -almost all- undergraduates are using generative artificial intelligence in their studies. A survey of 1,000 students – both domestic and international – found there had been an -explosive increase- in the use of genAI in the past 12 months. 88% said they used tools such as ChatGPT for their assessments, up from 53% last year. BBC | The BBC has admitted that it -fell short and failed people- by not dealing with -bullying and misogynistic- behaviour by its former Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood. A major external inquiry found it -missed opportunities- that could have led to action. The inquiry was triggered by a 2022 Guardian-BBC News joint investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct and predatory behaviour by the DJ.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/26/first-edition-keir-starmer-defence-spending	2025-02-25T22:44:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c77b18fb45d845cd5fad233dbb42d30a6196bce5/0_137_5830_3498/master/5830.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b1284a555883bdd905773a05d76eb2bf

Tim Westwood inquiry report: what new allegations against him have emerged?	The document contains a series of previously unpublished claims, including 22 from members of the public The independent inquiry into what the BBC knew about the former Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood’s conduct has been published almost three years after a joint investigation by the Guardian and BBC News. The investigation told the stories of a number of women who accused the 67-year-old of sexual misconduct and predatory behaviour. -Hounded- a 17-year-old Black woman with phone calls and texts. Invited a girl who was 15 or 16 back to his home following an under-16 night, after she had added him on Blackberry to get information about the event. Contacted a woman who had shared her business card, and appeared agitated when she did not want to meet late at night. -Hurled- a can of drink at a woman who was serving in a club. A former BBC staff member told the corporation their son had witnessed Westwood propositioning a 15-year-old girl in a night club in around 2007. The BBC reported the complaint to the Metropolitan police, who took no action. A BBC employee said in 2022 that a guest on Radio 1 had described potential sexual assault by Westwood between 2004 and 2007. They said they had reported it to a more senior employee, but White found no evidence the complaint had been documented. Westwood’s lawyers said he was never spoken to about the incident. A student told the review about Westwood referring to her breasts during a 1Xtra DriveTime show in 2010, calling her her -cuddly- and miming grabbing her breasts, which his lawyers say he strongly denies. A Sun journalist contacted Radio 1 in November 2012 saying they had been given tipoffs about Westwood and -inappropriate relations with young girls-. A senior figure flagged allegations made about Westwood on Twitter to HR and the corporate investigations team, which decided that no action would be taken without further evidence. White concluded that senior BBC did not think Westwood had had sexual contact with 15-year-old girls, but that the issue -ought to have been formally raised with him- and the online allegations should have been examined further. -Many- BBC employees -perceived there to be a close relationship between the controllers and Tim Westwood-. Witnesses felt they were unable to complain because of the -feeling that … that senior management were likely to side with presenters-. Westwood made repeated comments about guests and staff members’ bodies, particularly about women’s breasts. Until Westwood was removed from the 1Xtra DriveTime show in 2012, -the approach appears to have been to raise issues informally … and, when the situation did not improve, to move BBC staff working on the 1Xtra DriveTime show to other programmes-.	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/feb/25/tim-westwood-inquiry-report-what-new-allegations-against-him-have-emerged	2025-02-25T11:41:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2f68fa13a789ef1e109396baf0f195baa1d5695/0_0_4250_2551/master/4250.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=645d08ddf560b4bd2b4cf1828a3bf50f
House Republicans to vote on spending deal that could slash Medicaid funding	Budget central to Trump’s agenda might get stalled before 14 March deadline as lawmakers warn of nearly $1tn in cuts House Republicans are planning to vote on Tuesday on a spending blueprint central to Donald Trump’s agenda, but the package faces potential derailment over nearly $1tn in Medicaid cuts that could fracture their slim majority.

Starmer can only hope aid grab-raid to lift defence budget wins Trump’s favour	PM’s Washington trip clear impetus for abrupt news of budget switch to meet defence commitment by 2027 Before Keir Starmer’s meeting with Donald Trump on Thursday, the prime minister thought it necessary to offer the president a gift. Britain’s defence spending will increase by 0.17 percentage points to 2.5% of GDP by April 2027, he told MPs in a hastily arranged Commons statement. The money, he added, would be taken directly from the overseas aid budget, whose level will be cut by nearly half to 0.3%. The last measure is a remarkable turn for a Labour government. Uncomfortably, it comes at a time when Donald Trump wants to shut down perhaps the entire $40bn US aid budget – and at a stroke eliminates a signature commitment from the Blair-Brown years. It was back in 2004, when Tony Blair was prime minister, that Labour first committed to increasing aid spending to 0.7% of GDP.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/25/starmer-can-only-hope-aid-grab-raid-to-lift-defence-budget-wins-trumps-favour	2025-02-25T11:27:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4247e195c8c053e7715f4662ab06674ab669f603/0_124_5872_3524/master/5872.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2653de9e05276f944c5a2d208472c11e

Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has been working in lockstep with the UK in a way the two countries have failed to since Brexit, and the aim was for the two leaders of Europe’s major military powers to use their visits this week to operate as a pincer movement pressing Trump to question Putin’s trustworthiness and more broadly to accept that America’s future still lay as a partner with Europe.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/25/starmer-must-pick-a-way-through-trumps-chaos-to-find-some-coherence	2025-02-25T06:26:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa8d86eca319c7378da909865e4e63df5b9adb00/0_524_3433_2060/master/3433.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=829ee95a2b0f18acad62daf20f3818ce

Early poems about Merlin portray him as environmentalist, say scholars	Re-examination of Welsh poems dating back to 10th century show figure as prophet concerned by human interactions with nature He is probably most often thought of today as a wizard, a shape-shifter or a mentor to the young King Arthur.

Musk says failure to respond to achievements email will result in sacking – US politics live	US office for personal management, which manages federal workforce, says that responding to Musk is not mandatory Hello and welcome to our rolling US politics coverage: The fallout from Musk’s demand for government workers to justify their work in a bullet-point list continues. Donald Trump said Vladimir Putin would accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential deal to end the three-year war. Trump was speaking alongside French president Emmanuel Macron at the White House as the leaders sought to smooth over a transatlantic rift to achieve peace. The Trump-Macron meeting came as the US voted against a United Nations resolution condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, siding with countries such as North Korea, Belarus and Sudan over European allies. Trump said the US and Ukraine are -very close- to coming to terms on a rare earth minerals agreement, in comments made during a visit from French president Emmanuel Macron amid European concerns over the US position on Ukraine. A federal judge on Monday denied a request by the Associated Press to immediately restore full access to presidential events for the news agency’s journalists, but said the issue required more exploration before ruling. The Trump administration barred the outlet earlier this month for continuing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico in its coverage after the president renamed it the -Gulf of America-. A federal judge has blocked the government downsizing team Doge from accessing sensitive data maintained by the US education department and the US office of personnel management. US district judge Deborah Boardman in Greenbelt, Maryland issued the temporary restraining order at the behest of a coalition of labour unions. A federal judge has extended protections for trans women in prison. The judge, who blocked the Federal Bureau of Prisons from carrying out Donald Trump’s executive order that would have transferred three incarcerated trans women into men’s facilities earlier this month, has extended protections for nine additional women. A federal judge blocked immigration agents from conducting enforcement operations in houses of worship for some religious groups, the Associated Press reported. US district judge Theodore Chang found that the Trump administration policy could violate their religious freedom and should be blocked while a lawsuit challenging it plays out.

First Thing: Macron warns Trump against ‘surrender’ in Ukraine	US and French presidents disagree over aid and efforts to secure a lasting peace in Ukraine. Plus, are airships the future again? Good morning. The meeting was cordial, at times even warm, but the fracture lines in the transatlantic partnership were clear. Here’s what Macron said: -This peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine. It must not mean a ceasefire without guarantees. This peace must allow for Ukrainian sovereignty and allow Ukraine to negotiate with other stakeholders.- Here’s what Trump said: -I believe that Emmanuel agrees with me on many of the most important issues. … Europe must take a central role in ensuring the long-term security of Ukraine.- Trump also said a US-Ukraine minerals deal was -very close-. How are unions challenging Musk’s moves? Over the weekend, a coalition of groups opposed to the mass layoffs asked a court to prevent reprisals against employees who fail to reply by the deadline set at midnight on Monday.

As the home affairs commentator Danny Shaw explains in a helpful social media summary, it is a -huge and unwieldy- bill, tackling various Labour law and order priorities, as well as a raft of ones that the last Conservative government was planning to legislate for before the election got in the way. Most of what is in the bill has already been well trailed. As Peter Walker reports, overnight the Home Office has been highlighting the provisions that will allow the police to search properties for stolen phones or other electronically geotagged items without a warrant. I think the Runcorn constituents deserve better, and we wanted to see a new MP in place as swiftly as possible. We look forward to Runcorn constituents getting the representation that they deserve from a newly elected Labour MP. I think everything that’s happened is unacceptable here.

Russia-Ukraine war live: Macron says ceasefire could come in ‘weeks’ as US sides with Russia at UN	French president says he told Trump deal should be ‘substantial for Ukraine’; UN security council backs US resolution that fails to mention Russia as aggressor Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. French president Emmanuel Macron has said a truce -could be done in the weeks to come-, shortly after meeting Donald Trump at the White House where he told the US president a deal should not mean the -surrender- of Ukraine. Donald Trump said Vladimir Putin would accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential deal to end the three-year war. Speaking before bilateral talks at the White House, French president Emmanuel Macron said Europe was prepared to provide security guarantees to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire including peacekeepers, although they would not be sent to the frontline. Trump said he saw no objection to European troops being sent to Ukraine to serve as peacemakers, adding that he had raised the idea with Putin. Trump described a potential minerals deal with Ukraine as -very close- and said he might meet Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy soon to seal the agreement. Trump added that he would also be meeting Putin at some point. Zelenskyy last week rejected US demands for $500bn in mineral wealth from Ukraine to repay Washington for wartime aid, contending that the US had supplied nowhere near that sum so far and offered no specific security guarantees in the agreement. More than a dozen world leaders gathered in Kyiv on Monday to mark the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion. A coordinated Europe-led show of solidarity took an overnight train for a summit with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, including the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb. The coordinated Europe-led show of solidarity on Monday came after a torrid week, in which Trump blamed Ukraine for starting the war against Russia, described Zelenskyy as a -dictator without elections-, and made it clear Europe would have to enforce and pay for any future peace settlement. There was strong collective pushback against the US president’s upside down version of recent history and a consensus that Ukraine had to take part in negotiations over its future. Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow will cease its military actions only if the outcome is -satisfactory- to Russia. He said that many more countries had become -realistic- in their position on Ukraine, and that the recent meeting in Riyadh raised the hope of having normal dialogue between Russia and the US. EU foreign ministers have discussed sending billions of military aid to Ukraine, ahead of a summit dedicated to European defence next week. At a meeting in Brussels on Monday a handful of countries proposed military aid for Ukraine in 2025 ranging from €20bn to €40bn, according to several diplomatic sources. The EU is spending more money on Russian fossil fuels than on financial aid to Ukraine, according to a new report. The EU bought €21.9bn (£18.1bn) of Russian oil and gas in the third year of the war, an amount equalling one-sixth greater than the €18.7bn the EU allocated to Ukraine in financial aid in 2024. Downing Street said Trump has changed the global conversation around Ukraine -for the better-, as the UK imposed further sanctions on Russia in an effort to force Putin to make concessions. Keir Starmer’s spokesperson did not comment on Trump’s false claims that Volodymyr Zelenskyy was a dictator. Starmer will hold talks with Trump in Washington on Thursday.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/25/ukraine-russia-trump-putin-zelenskyy-macron-ceasefire-latest-news-updates-live	2025-02-24T23:28:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e030638fd5ed9275565878dc1dd6963293d77f1f/0_186_5708_3426/master/5708.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=df01dda261fd32e366b7d3c48381c04d

It’s a time-honoured tradition: the minister arriving to speak to a conference hall full of people who absolutely hate him, and getting roundly pilloried as he sticks to the government line. Today, it might be the environment secretary Steve Reed’s turn. His adversaries: a large number of implacably angry farmers. Whether or not they bring pitchforks, the attendees who listen to his speech at the National Farmers’ Union conference are up in arms because of the government’s refusal to back down over its changes to inheritance tax breaks for farmers. And while Reed is coming with policy changes that he says will be to the benefit of British farmers, like a five-year extension of the seasonal farm workers’ scheme, they are unlikely to be enough to earn him a warm welcome. Ukraine | Donald Trump has said the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, would accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential deal to end the three-year war.

From Creative Australia to Sydney writers’ festival, the direct threat facing the arts is coming from within | Louise Adler	In this adapted extract from What’s the Big Idea? Louise Adler looks at the failure of Australian cultural leaders shying from risk and artistic vision – and letting the tail wag the dog All around the world, a succession of arts organisations across all sectors have come under pressure from artists – surely their first and most important stakeholders – to -take a stand- on a range of topical issues from the climate crisis to Israel’s war on Gaza. If artists engage with the issues of the day, what is the appropriate response of the boards and managers of arts organisations? On Monday we saw the resignation of Kathy Shand, chair of the Sydney writers’ festival. Obviously individual board members, like donors, have every right to decide the values of an organisation do not align with their own.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/25/whats-the-big-idea-extract-louise-adler-creative-australia	2025-02-24T18:41:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf8f99a92d97b9d7e18c6de9e8f61c06d3f9aa20/0_295_4416_2652/master/4416.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=caf56a024a5a220d120d6318a1b69b06

Revealed: how members of House of Lords benefit from commercial interests	Months-long Guardian investigation exposes weaknesses in code of conduct that could trigger calls for greater reform A Guardian investigation into the House of Lords raises questions over the accountability of parliament’s second chamber, with revelations about how a string of peers are benefiting from commercial interests. One in 10 members have been hired to give political or policy advice, according to their own declarations, and others do paid work for companies that could conflict with their role as legislators. The findings expose weaknesses in the Lords code of conduct and raise questions about whether the rules on lobbying and paid employment should be tightened in line with restrictions signed up to by MPs. Nearly 100 members of the Lords are paid to give political or policy advice by commercial firms. A Labour peer offered access to ministers during discussions to sponsor an event in parliament. A former minister has earned millions of pounds since entering the Lords by working for 30 companies. Multiple peers are being paid by foreign governments including repressive regimes. More than £1 in every £14 donated to political parties since 2001 came from those who have sat as peers in the last parliament.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/24/revealed-how-house-lords-benefit-from-commercial-interests	2025-02-24T06:15:01-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f9944a58952b583d8856dd388e55d95d21be1ca/1_0_4999_3000/master/4999.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1bbd05d121c88bdad15aad978d4d6679

Elon Musk’s demand that federal workers document what they do provokes chaos	Trump’s appointed leadership in agencies respond in starkly different ways while Pentagon official calls order ‘silliest thing in 40 years’ Elon Musk has poured fuel on to the fire raging across the US government over his ultimatum that federal workers document what they do at their jobs or face dismissal – by attacking a Pentagon official who had criticized the scheme as -the silliest thing I’ve seen in 40 years-. The billionaire businessman, who has been authorised by Donald Trump to slash the federal bureaucracy as head of the so-called -department of government efficiency- (Doge), stoked the flames in a post on his social media platform X late on Sunday night.

German election shows how far green wave has receded in Europe	Result is further evidence that political conversation around the climate crisis has shifted In the final days of an election campaign dominated by migration, the likely new chancellor of Europe’s biggest polluter sought to assure voters that its economy ministry would not be occupied by NGOs. Instead, conservative lead candidate Friedrich Merz posted on social media that it would be led by -someone who understands that economic policy is more than being a representative for heat pumps-. Climate action barely featured on the campaign trail before Germany’s federal elections on Sunday – except when right-leaning parties used it to swipe at the Greens. Merz’s jab was at the tamer end of attacks aimed at the Green party candidate, Robert Habeck, the economy and climate minister who pushed through an unpopular law to promote clean heating, but is a sign of how far the political conversation around climate action has shifted.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/24/german-election-shows-how-far-green-wave-has-receded-in-europe	2025-02-24T05:12:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6d87f75e78baadba7ff5696815c6bf373972647/0_90_6713_4026/master/6713.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=57cdf47e6ec8d7172269a18dfaf5e30a

Confusion at US agencies over whether to comply with Elon Musk email demanding workers justify their jobs – US politics live	Government agencies give conflicting advice after email from Elon Musk demanding employees list accomplishments from past week Hello and welcome to our US politics rolling coverage. Elon Musk’s email demanding all 2.3 million government workers justify their work has caused confusion with several administration officials telling workers not to reply to the missive. French President Emmanuel Macron will meet with Donald Trump in Washington on Monday, saying he will present -proposals for action- to counter the -Russian threat- in Europe and ensure peace in Ukraine. Conservative podcaster Dan Bongino has been appointed as FBI deputy director. Bongino, a former Secret Service agent and NYPD officer turned conservative radio host, puts a second Trump ally at the top of the agency. Trump announced the appointment on Sunday night in a post on his Truth Social platform, praising Bongino as -a man of incredible love and passion for our country-. The Trump administration on Sunday said it was placing all but a handful of USAid personnel around the world on paid administrative leave and eliminating about 2,000 of those positions in the US, according to a notice sent to agency workers and posted online. More than 150,000 people from Canada have signed a parliamentary petition calling for their country to strip Elon Musk’s Canadian citizenship because of the tech billionaire’s alliance with Donald Trump, who has spent his second US presidency repeatedly threatening to conquer its independent neighbor to the north and turn it into its 51st state.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/feb/24/elon-musk-email-donald-trump-us-government-latest-live-politics-news	2025-02-24T03:40:46-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76b7451ede5e4397f736a948dc0c70d1f46180b1/901_1192_4840_2904/master/4840.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=abc2012271a28a3f2a7048c03bece380

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, hailed -three years of resistance … three years of absolute heroism of Ukrainians,- as foreign leaders arrived in Kyiv to mark the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion. What’s the latest war news? Russia launched its biggest ever drone attack on Ukraine, using 267 drones and killing at least four people. What did Zelenskyy say about US demands? He claimed the Trump administration was asking Ukraine to pay back $2 for every $1 of military aid the US provides going forward. What do we know about the death toll after three years of war? Zelenskyy said in December that 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed, with 370,000 injured. US officials estimated last October that 600,000 Russian troops had been killed or wounded. In November, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights verified 12,162 civilians killed, including 659 children, though the total is likely much higher.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/24/first-thing-zelenskyy-hails-three-years-of-resistance-on-anniversary-of-russian-invasion-ukraine	2025-02-24T03:34:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbbac5474a87878d48d7c4ec968399db7acad947/0_241_5887_3533/master/5887.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1c9a6166b6d756e341c9b0c822c8d64d

Home Office says it will tighten rules to keep ‘Kremlin-linked elites’ out of UK as Starmer speaks to European leaders – UK politics live	Keir Starmer to join European leaders on call to Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss Ukraine war Good morning. At least this week we’re not going to have to put up with all the usual guff about the special relationship. UK politics this week will be dominated by Keir Starmer’s meeting with Donald Trump in the White House on Thursday, which was described on the Westminster Hour last night as -probably is one of the most consequential meetings of a British prime minister and president that we have had since the second world war- by Sir Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador to Washington. For the last 30 years at least, whenever a PM has met a new US president for the first time, commentary has inevitably focused on what it said about the state of the -special relationship-. Despite making the British sound insecure and needy, as a media narrative it always worked because it was simple and appealed to patriotic notions of British exceptionalism. But last week it became clear that the -special relationship- that seems to matter most to Trump is the one he has with Vladimir Putin. There will still be huge interest in the outcome of the Starmer/Trump meeting. But the parameters have now shifted, and No 10 will probably be happy with a relationship that is positive, functioning, and not entirely disastrous for Ukraine. Under the new measures, the government will expand the criteria for exclusion to cover Kremlin-linked elites. This will ensure that, while Russia remains an acute national security threat, elites linked to the Russian state can be prevented from entering the UK. Those who could be barred from the UK include anyone who provides significant support to the Russian state and/or those who owe their significant status or wealth to the Russian state and/or those who enjoy access to the highest levels of the Russian state.

Monday briefing: Merz will be Germany’s chancellor – but extremists are waiting in the wings	In today’s newsletter: The far-right AfD may have come second, but at 20% they have been held off by the performance of mainstream parties, with the CDU leader Friedrich Merz on course to be the new chancellor Good morning. Germany’s elections always matter far beyond the country’s borders – but yesterday’s vote could be the most important in a generation. After decades as the stable linchpin of European liberal democracy, Germany has found itself sucked into the same crises that are erupting all over the continent – over its economy, attitudes to immigration and the war in Ukraine. And after the shocking interventions of JD Vance and Elon Musk in favour of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, the election became a symbol of a wider struggle for ideological supremacy – and posed a serious question over whether the centre can hold across the continent. Ukraine | Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he is not willing to cave in to intense pressure from the Trump administration to sign a $500bn minerals deal – adding that that he was ready to quit as president if it meant -peace for Ukraine- or membership of Nato. Catholicism | Pope Francis, who is battling pneumonia and a complex lung infection, remains in a critical condition, the Vatican has said. Archbishop Rino Fisichella, a senior Vatican official, told participants at a mass in St Peter’s Basilica on Sunday morning they should make their prayers for Francis -stronger and more intense-. Afghanistan | The Taliban have arrested a British couple in their 70s for -teaching mothers parenting with children-. Peter Reynolds, 79, and his wife, Barbie, 75, have been running projects in schools in Afghanistan for 18 years. Farming | Hospitals, schools and prisons are to be urged to buy more British food, as part of a government push to heal a rift with farmers over changes to inheritance tax. The environment secretary, Steve Reed, will set a target of sourcing at least half of public sector food from farms with the highest welfare standards, which should benefit British producers. Green economy | The net zero sector is growing three times faster than the overall UK economy, analysis has found, providing high-wage jobs across the country while cutting climate-heating emissions and increasing energy security. 22,000 net zero businesses generated £83bn in gross value added last year.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/24/monday-briefing-merz-will-be-germanys-chancellor-but-extremists-are-waiting-in-the-wings	2025-02-23T23:10:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ce1c53e13ac5f40618a7bb1aa6e45fc62fb2719/0_4_1652_991/master/1652.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1aa0b8ecc6af299c9f5a7e249d4bf89b

Ukraine war live: Zelenskyy hails ‘three years of resistance’ on anniversary of Russian invasion	Ukraine president pays tribute to ‘absolute heroism’ of Ukrainians as EU leaders arrive in Kyiv Welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine, on the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed -Three years of resistance- and the -absolute heroism- of Ukranians this morning. In a post on X he wrote: Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he would be willing to resign in exchange for peace or Nato membership, telling reporters he doesn’t plan to stay in power for decades. -But we won’t let Putin stay in power over Ukrainian territories either,- he said Sunday. He made his remarks just hours after Russia launched its biggest ever aerial attack on Ukraine, using 267 drones, killing at least four people across the country. Kyiv echoed with the booms of anti-aircraft fire as crews spent the night trying to shoot the drones down. Zelenskyy also said he would not bow to pressure from Washington to hand over $500bn worth of Ukraine’s minerals, adding: -I’m not signing something that 10 generations of Ukrainians are going to pay later.- Around $350bn worth of Ukraine’s critical resources are in areas captured by Russia, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, told reporters. Zelenskyy also revealed the Trump administration was asking Ukraine to pay back $2 for every $1 of military aid the US provides Ukraine going forward – an interest rate of 100%. The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, will separately meet Trump early this week and have agreed to show -united leadership in support of Ukraine-. EU leaders will meet on 6 March for a special summit -to take decisions- on Ukraine and European defence, Costa said, as pressure mounts on European nations to boost defence spending. Meanwhile, US and Russian officials are planning to meet again at some point in the next two weeks, Russian state news agency RIA reported over the weekend, citing the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov. Russian government spokesperson Dmitry Peskov supported comments made by Trump about Zelenskyy – such as calling the Ukrainian leader a dictator – as -understandable- after Zelenskyy made -inappropriate remarks- about Trump. Zelenskyy had accused Trump of being -trapped- in a Russian -disinformation bubble.- Despite Zelenskyy’s growing frustration with the Trump administration, he repeated his hopes in keeping the US allied with Ukraine, and to be included in any peace talks. -We would really like it as a priority for the US to first talk to us, then to Russia.- He added, -it is not possible to decide anything about Ukraine without us.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/24/ukraine-war-live-zelenskyy-hails-three-years-of-resistance-on-anniversary-of-russian-invasion	2025-02-23T22:26:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/052512656caf71b6d9711aa38a07ccf35d731dad/0_187_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fe093dfea55ffcd905e103621afbdeb2

German election live: Merz says priority is to make Europe independent from US on defence as coalition talks to begin	Donald Trump has made it clear he is ‘fairly indifferent to Europe’s fate’, says CDU leader who plans to form a coalition by Easter Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the German election results. CDU leader Friedrich Merz has said his -absolute priority- will be to strengthen Europe so as to achieve independence from the US in defence matters as he prepares to embark on coalition negotiations that are expected to last until Easter. The Greens, the SPD’s coalition partner, slumped by three percentage points to 11.6%. The Left has surged to 8.8% and the liberal FDP – which triggered the early election by collapsing Olaf Scholz’s coalition – along with the far-left Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance failed to meet the 5% threshold required top get into parliament. The results mean Merz could form a so-called -grand coalition- with the SPD, without needing to find a third party. That would mean a future government would be more stable and less fractious than for example Scholz’s. The Social Democratic party was left reeling on the back of a historically low vote share, with outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz, admitting it was a -bitter result-. He said he would not be involved in any coalition talks with the CDU/CSU, with other SPD leaders expected to lead negotiations. Merz hailed -a historic election evening,- and acknowledged the responsibility and the scale of the task ahead. He said he planned to form a coalition by Easter and told party faithful that -the world out there is not waiting for us and for lengthy negotiations.- Alice Weidel, co-leader of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) called the result -historic- for her party, having doubled the number of votes from 2021. Weidel said her party remained open to coalition talks with other parties, and said excluding the AfD was the equivalent to -voter fraud-. The AfD swept all five former East German states: Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony and Thuringia. It won well over 30% of the vote in each state and as much as 38.6% in Thuringia – that’s where the AfD made history in September as the first far-right party to win a state election since the second world war. Christian Lindner, the leader of the liberal FDP whose falling out with Scholz triggered the collapse of his coalition government and paved the way for early elections, resigned after his party failed to reach the 5% threshold to re-enter parliament. In a post on X, he said would retire from active politics and said he hoped the election would bring a -new start for Germany-.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/24/german-election-live-results-updates-2025-cdu-afd-widel	2025-02-23T21:08:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c059e777504ba41196add95b7e3146a3451e933/0_6_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42fc97d5f91fbbcd3e0eb456f0081c42

Will Germany’s new government restore its role as a bold leader of the EU?	Friedrich Merz can rebuild European relationships and be a driving force on defence spending, but faces Trump’s upending of postwar certainties Germany has long been seen as the EU’s -indispensable nation- – the biggest, richest and most consequential power. But in recent years Berlin has widely been regarded as missing in action in the EU, hobbled by internecine feuding in a coalition government that has caused flip-flops and delayed decisions. Olaf Scholz has a cool relationship with Emmanuel Macron, slowing down the fabled Franco-German motor that powers the EU.

The EU bought €21.9bn (£18.1bn) of Russian oil and gas in the third year of the war, according to estimates from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea), despite the efforts under way to kick the continent’s addiction to the fuels that fund Vladimir Putin’s war chest.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/24/eu-spends-more-russian-oil-gas-than-financial-aid-ukraine-report	2025-02-23T21:00:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba71e4851d7b4088edce5bacd6007ed58f59c7d7/0_90_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cfa31373d79fb2ebafb120498708755d

Coalition nuclear plan hides a 2bn tonne ‘carbon bomb’ that puts net zero by 2050 out of reach, new analysis shows	Climate Change Authority chair Matt Kean says Dutton’s energy proposal is equivalent to adding ‘two Beetaloo basins’ worth of emissions to atmosphere Peter Dutton’s nuclear energy policy would add huge amounts of extra climate pollution to the atmosphere and make it -virtually impossible- for Australia to reach net zero by 2050, according to new analysis by a government agency.

Literary gold … or betrayal of trust? Joan Didion journal opens ethical minefield	Soon we can all read the late author’s private notes about her therapy. But should we? In 1998, the late journalist Joan Didion wrote a scathing essay about the posthumous publication of True at First Light, a travel journal and fictional memoir by Ernest Hemingway, 38 years after the author killed himself. -This is a man to whom words mattered. He worked at them, he understood them, he got inside them,- Didion wrote. -His wish to be survived by only the words he determined fit for publication would have seemed clear enough.- Just over a year later, in December 1999, Didion began writing her own journal about her sessions with a psychiatrist. She addressed these notes – detailing her struggles with alcoholism, anxiety, guilt and depression, a sometimes fraught relationship with her adopted daughter Quintana and reflections on her childhood and legacy – to her husband, John Gregory Dunne.	https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/feb/23/literary-gold-or-betrayal-of-trust-joan-didion-journal-opens-ethical-minefield	2025-02-23T01:00:30-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12785d80570bfd3b6b586bdb24330bc6a9576dbe/0_913_2672_1603/master/2672.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d62a2d29cab4409e20c18ca5e26e1160

‘Trump and Musk are gaslighting’: anti-apartheid artist on how US president and his billionaire ally are attacking South Africa	Ahead of a career retrospective, Sue Williamson tells how the US pair are dragging her country ‘through the mud’ For more than 50 years, Sue Williamson’s art has been shining a light on South Africa’s problems – first to campaign against the apartheid state, and then to question how far the country has progressed in reconciliation and remembrance.

School breakfast clubs in England ‘will be used to justify keeping the two-child benefits cap’	As the education secretary announces the first primary schools to offer free breakfasts, Labour MPs question the commitment to fighting poverty The government is trumpeting its policy of introducing free breakfast clubs into all primary schools in England as key to its efforts to cut child poverty, as ministers appear to have ruled out meeting the estimated cost of £3bn a year to end the two-child cap on benefits. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, announced the first 750 schools that will become -early adopters- of breakfast clubs, saying that 67,000 of the 180,000 pupils set to benefit come from the most dis­advantaged areas of England.	https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/feb/23/school-breakfast-clubs-in-england-will-be-used-to-justify-keeping-the-two-child-benefits-cap	2025-02-22T23:00:30-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee0021539e72500be69afff004d2280368fb5899/0_314_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3dae6c10a5ddb4544435878a2170b140

How UK and EU could find more money for defence without spooking the markets	There is political agreement that Britain and Europe need to increase military spending. But in straitened times, how can it be done? Can Britain increase defence spending without cuts elsewhere?Rachel Reeves is constrained by fiscal rules that govern the extent of the UK’s debts and the annual spending deficit by the end of the parliament. Following lower than expected tax receipts and higher borrowing costs in the current financial year, it looks likely that the chancellor will need to make budget cuts when she makes her next financial statement on 26 March. Last week she said a rise in defence spending would mean making -difficult decisions across the board-. Reeves fears a backlash from financial markets in response to higher, unfunded spending, pushing the cost of borrowing up in a repeat of the Liz Truss mini-budget debacle. Most analysts believe a rise in borrowing is expected by international lenders.	https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/feb/23/how-uk-and-eu-could-find-more-money-for-defence-without-spooking-the-markets	2025-02-22T22:00:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc442bfa49dc954ec094290bf375be3e9fa379b7/0_155_4677_2807/master/4677.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8ebee58ab96bc64483ef26fcbf5857e0

Coalition to match ‘dollar for dollar’ Labor’s plan to make GP visits cheaper in $8.5bn Medicare boost	Less than half of Australians were always bulk billed when they saw a GP in 2023-24, government data says The Coalition says it will match -dollar for dollar- Labor’s landmark $8.5bn proposal to dramatically increase Medicare bulk-billing rates for GP visits, pledging to meet Anthony Albanese’s commitment to make nearly all doctors’ appointments free. Doctor’s groups have welcomed Labor’s pledge to fund 18m extra bulk-billed GP visits annually, but have warned some patients will still miss out because government rebates are sometimes still too low to cover the cost of all appointments. The health minister, Mark Butler, says nine out of 10 GP visits will be covered by 2030 under Labor’s plan, and has accused the Coalition of -cooking the books- on bulk-billing statistics during their time in office.

More than 10,000 First Nations people killed in Australia’s frontier wars, final massacre map shows	‘Horrendous’ eight-year long project has ended with final fact check, leaving a legacy ‘nobody can argue’ with, says researcher The final findings of the -horrendous- eight-year long -massacre map-, tracing the violent history of the Australian colonial frontier have been released. The Colonial Frontier Massacres Digital Map Project, spearheaded by the late emerita professor of history at the University of Newcastle, Dr Lyndall Ryan, officially concluded in 2022. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email At least 10,657 people were killed in at least 438 colonial frontier massacres. 10,374 of them were Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people killed by colonists. Only 160 of those killed were non-Indigenous colonists. There were 13 massacres of colonists by Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people. The most intense period of massacres was from the late 1830s into 1840s, with a pivotal point being the Myall Creek massacre in 1838 – the first time any perpetrators had been punished. After the Myall Creek convictions, the government could no longer involve the military and new -police- forces were created, which set a pattern for the rest of the conflict. About half of all massacres of Aboriginal people were carried out by police and other government agents. Many others were perpetrated by settlers acting with tacit approval of the state. Some perpetrators were involved in many massacres.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/23/more-than-10000-first-nations-people-killed-in-australias-frontier-wars-final-massacre-map-shows-ntwnfb	2025-02-22T16:52:25-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7db9294df616e96913084c0a8ff7397bdf1685da/0_282_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2bfb9fc3c42c5eaa5ae4381bb5be4518

‘It’s blackmail’: Ukrainians react to Trump demand for $500bn share of minerals	Ukraine’s lithium deposits are among biggest in Europe and the US is looking for ‘payback’ for previous military assistance Drawing in the snow with his finger, Mykola Hrechukha sketched out how Ukraine’s new lithium mine might look. It would have a deep central shaft, with a series of side tunnels, he said. -The lithium is good everywhere. The biggest concentration is at a depth of 200-500 metres,- he said. -We should be able to extract 4,300 tonnes a day. The potential is terrific.- For now, though, there is little sign of activity. The deposit is buried under a large sloping field, used in communist times to grow beetroot and wheat. The mine’s proposed entrance is in an abandoned former-Soviet village, Liodiane, today a scruffy grove of acacia and maple trees. The only inhabitant is a security guard, who lives on the 150-hectare site in an ancient Gaz-53 truck. Wild boar and even a wolf sometimes wander past.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/22/its-blackmail-ukrainians-react-to-trump-demand-for-500bn-share-of-minerals	2025-02-22T04:08:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78d2c92e5a567fbba98bc1ae347b2e9b99a966c9/490_0_4510_2707/master/4510.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=12c71548a756c9673c50c857578bfe85

Americans sharply divided over Trump’s embrace of Putin	While US allies are alarmed at changing loyalties, new poll finds starkly partisan reaction to president’s Ukraine policy Donald Trump’s shocking and mendacious attack this week on the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as a -dictator- while cozying up to the Russian president and indicating that traditional US security support for Europe is waning may have alarmed US allies abroad but has prompted a more starkly divided response among Americans at home. Reflecting the country’s deeply partisan attitude to the new president and his -America first- foreign policy doctrine, polling suggests that Republicans are much more likely to oppose additional help for war-torn Ukraine. A Pew Research Center survey earlier this month found that 47% of Republicans but just 14% of Democrats thought the US was providing too much support to Ukraine – views that have changed dramatically since the war began three years ago, when just 7% of all American adults (9% of Republicans and 5% of Democrats) said the US was providing too much support to Ukraine.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/22/trump-putin-friendship	2025-02-22T00:01:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8a63bd83cb96794242c15180a31c68d1505673c/0_480_7176_4304/master/7176.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=929f49e6c2af508ddf182fce7b30f468

Middle East crisis live: Gaza hostage-prisoner exchange set to go ahead	Hamas says six captives expected to be freed from Gaza on Saturday in swap for about 600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, after return of wrong body risked derailing ceasefire Welcome to our live coverage of the Middle East crisis. It’s just after 8.30am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv – here’s the latest news. Israel prepared on Saturday to receive six more hostages from Gaza in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, after accusations over the return of a misidentified body this week threatened to derail a fragile truce. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, vowed revenge for what he described as a -cruel and malicious violation- of the ceasefire agreement after authorities determined that a body released by Hamas on Thursday was not Shiri Bibas. The body was determined to be of an unidentified woman from Gaza. The Bibas family accused Netanyahu of failing to protect their loved ones during Hamas’s 2023 attack and of failing to bring them home. -There is no forgiveness for abandoning them on October 7, and no forgiveness for abandoning them in captivity,- said Ofri Bibas, the sister-in-law of Shiri Bibas, in a statement. Netanyahu said he has ordered the Israeli military to carry out an intensive operation against what he called -centres of terrorism- in the West Bank. He also said on social media that he had ordered Shin Bet and police to increase -preventative- measures against attacks on Israeli cities. It followed a series of explosions on three parked buses in Bat Yam, a city outside Tel Aviv, on Thursday night. Authorities said they were a suspected terrorist attack. No injuries were reported. More than half a million children have been left without education across Gaza and the West Bank, according to the International Rescue Committee. The NGO warned that vital aid for children in the region was being scuppered by increasing violence. Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman held a meeting of Egyptian and Jordanian leaders described as -an informal brotherly gathering- by the state-run Saudi Press Agency. It came ahead of an Arab League summit likely to discuss the Gaza Strip after the US president, Donald Trump, proposed it -take over- the territory and permanently resettle its Palestinian residents, a plan Arab countries have universally rejected. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald will boycott St Patrick’s Day events in the US over Gaza. She and Northern Ireland’s first minister, Michelle O’Neill, said they would not attend the celebrations after Trump’s call to exile Palestinians from the territory.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/22/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-hamas-new-gaza-hostage-prisoner-exchange	2025-02-21T22:40:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1b7d6bb8cf37ae714b8079ac16a93de35a4769c/0_210_3173_1904/master/3173.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b836f14a874494485f41a197b82c5e2c

Polling consistently shows the US president is deeply unpopular with British voters, a majority of whom think ministers should now prioritise building bridges with the EU over the US.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/21/uk-party-leaders-tightrope-trump-voters	2025-02-21T09:39:39-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bb6ace3d70de125cc229590dcbcb8f3e76bbb0a/0_0_3045_1827/master/3045.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4da7cc156bbda276818de1e6fb571c2e

Starmer to tell Trump that UK’s Chagos deal will avoid tensions with China	PM to claim if US rejects Mauritius’s claim to own the islands, Beijing will be drawn into the regional dispute Keir Starmer is to urge Donald Trump to recognise that a US rejection of Mauritius’s legal claim to own the Chagos Islands including the strategic US military base at Diego Garcia may stoke tensions similar to those in the South China Sea. Starmer is due to meet Trump next Friday mainly to discuss the future of Ukraine, but also a UK plan for Gaza’s reconstruction under international protection with no need for Palestinians to be required to quit the Gaza Strip. The paper is similar but not identical to proposals being discussed by Arab foreign ministers in Riyadh, which has a strong international component and would prevent Hamas ruling in Gaza.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/21/keir-starmer-to-tell-donald-trump-that-uks-chagos-deal-will-avoid-tensions-with-china	2025-02-21T09:29:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/156523eec2f23040517498bcd70e8465f7a15210/0_469_4650_2789/master/4650.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5e25a23c8ec128c6c0ff20172637a40f

Who is ‘working class’ and why does it matter in the arts?	Prominent figures in the arts say class is a key factor that determines who can make it in the creative industries In recent years, a string of academic reports have shown in stark terms just how elitist the arts have become over the last four decades. The proportion of working-class actors, musicians and writers has shrunk by half since the 1970s, according to one piece of research, while another study found fewer than one in 10 arts workers in the UK had working-class roots. Sutton Trust research released last year found the creative industries were dominated by people from the most affluent backgrounds, which it defined as those from -upper middle-class backgrounds-, while a Netflix report claimed working-class parents did not see film and TV as a viable career for their children.	https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/feb/21/who-is-working-class-and-why-does-it-matter-in-the-arts	2025-02-21T09:00:42-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/791345572439521046050e0490984ba262398845/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a3c51f2a38db29f61f160a17d90d258d

‘This could have all been avoided’: how Creative Australia allowed itself to be blind-sided over its Venice Biennale pick	High-profile artists and curators stunned by Creative Australia’s swift abandonment of Khaled Sabsabi, the art community, and the complex nature of art itself A week after Creative Australia controversially dumped artist Khaled Sabsabi as Australia’s representative for the 2026 Venice Biennale, Richard Bell still can’t understand the decision. The Kamilaroi, Kooma, Jiman and Gurang Gurang artist has a long history with the Venice Biennale and Australia’s peak arts funding body – in 2019, he crashed the prestigious showcase after being passed over to officially represent Australia.

‘He’s selling the city’: behind Eric Adams’s New York City administration	The mayor of America’s largest city is caught up in a swirl of indictments, immigrants, Rikers and Donald Trump This Valentine’s Day, a new political power couple said their vows on the plush white couches of Fox &amp; Friends in midtown Manhattan: Donald Trump’s border tsar, Tom Homan, and the New York City mayor, Eric Adams. The pair appeared on the conservative TV show to discuss an agreement they had reached the day before. Their deal reversed longstanding New York City policy by letting federal immigration agents back onto Rikers Island, the city’s jail complex that largely holds people who have been charged but not yet convicted of crimes. The surprise agreement came as the newly installed leaders of Trump’s Department of Justice were making an extraordinary push to dismiss criminal corruption charges that the agency had been pursuing against Adams.

Plus, Germans share their concerns about the far right’s rise before this weekend’s election Good morning. Shiri Bibas is not among the four bodies returned by Hamas to Israel during Thursday’s hostage handover, Israel’s military has said, calling it a -violation of utmost severity- of the already fragile ceasefire agreement. What impact could this have? It risks upending the precarious truce. Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would -ensure Hamas pays the full price- for the ceasefire violation. Have the bodies of hostages been released before? No, Thursday’s release was the first time Hamas has returned the remains of dead hostages. What did the unions state in their lawsuit?

Keir Starmer urged to ramp up defence spending – UK politics live	This is ‘probably one of the most alarming times for Britain’s defence since the second world war’, says Lib Dem leader Ed Davey as he calls for more spending Hello and welcome to our rolling coverage of UK politics. The Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey has said the government must swiftly ramp up defence spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP). I’ve never known a time like this, it is probably one of the most alarming times for Britain’s defence and security since the second world war, with our closest ally changing their position. So we have to debate it, it is going to be difficult. I don’t think there’s an easy solution, but we have put some ideas on the table. One idea we have put is to increase the digital services taxes, a tax on about 20 multinational companies with turnovers of over £500m and we would raise it from the current 2% to 10%. Foreign secretary David Lammy is in South Africa for the second day of the G20 foreign ministers’ meeting.

Peter Dutton says Labor is fast-tracking citizenship so that migrants can vote. Here’s what we know	The opposition leader picked up on News Corp claims that Tony Burke was conducting ‘industrial-scale’ ceremonies. Labor denies it has anything to do with the election This week Peter Dutton has claimed Labor wants to -expressly push- new Australians through citizenship ceremonies ahead of the federal election – allegations the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, has strongly denied, accusing critics of a -whinge-. In the same remarks, Dutton also again claimed the government wanted to -bring people in from a war zone-, referring to Gaza, and appeared to insinuate people from that region were among those being offered citizenship. Tony Burke is spending today and the rest of this week, as I understand it, conducting as many citizenship ceremonies as you can, and literally putting thousands of people through an express citizenship process so that they can vote in the election within a few weeks, which I think is quite remarkable. And I just question whether there has been any slackening of the process, whether there has been any compromise on the security checks, and whether it’s in our country’s best interests for people to receive citizenship before the proper security checks have been undertaken, or people have had – within the home affairs department – the time to be able to conduct the searches that we would expect to be conducted.- What would you like to happen to be assured that the processes are being followed?- There needs to be transparency. If the government’s giving a nod and the wink to a particular part of society – they’re obsessed with the Green vote and they’re worried about losing seats, without being political about it – but let’s be frank about the motivation. Why would you bring people in from a war zone without the requisite checks, on a tourist visa, without precedent? Why would you do that and knowing that it’s territory controlled by a listed terrorist organisation? Why would you expressly push people through the process to receive citizenship in advance of an election which is pending?-	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/21/peter-dutton-says-labor-is-fast-tracking-citizenship-so-that-migrants-can-vote-heres-what-we-know-ntwnfb	2025-02-20T22:19:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ffbb702b6b2ce00338b2a69a40d20ad058925bc/0_255_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7c012b7638859b17dfd74c8e6d871767

Starmer tells Zelenskyy it was ‘perfectly reasonable’ to suspend elections during war – UK politics live	Downing Street says the two leaders spoke overnight, after Donald Trump accused the Ukrainian president of being a ‘dictator’ Shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel told viewers of Sky News this morning that she could not comment on the -motivation- of Donald Trump in criticising Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but said that Trump was -wrong-. Ask what she made of the comments, Patel said: First of all, that’s wrong. President Zelenskyy is not a dictator. Let’s just put some context of this. For three years – the third anniversary of the conflict is on Monday – for three years he has led his nation in terms of this conflict, standing up to Putin, Putin’s aggression, and the appalling conduct that we’ve seen. [Zelenskyy] is fighting for sovereignty and the freedom of his country. And this is a significant conflict in our neighbourhood, effectively on European soil, and this is the most brutal conflict that we’ve seen in Europe since, clearly, the second world war. So here’s a man that’s fighting for sovereignty, freedom, and actually standing up for the rule of law, and many of the values that we all hold very dearly. I think I said at the weekend too that there is a lot of chatter, there’s a lot of noise. There are no clear solutions right now. And I think, you know, I say this not just as a member of the Conservative frontbench, but actually as a British politician, having led the support for Ukraine, this is why we must really be quite strong all over again in our support for greater defence and military spending and capability. I think we need to take the heat down from what has become a very heated conversation in public over recent days. That’s what the prime minister has been doing, meeting with European leaders, speaking to President Zelenskyy. Next week, he’ll travel to the US to meet with President Trump. The truth is that if we want a solution to what is happening in Ukraine –and we absolutely do, because it’s in British interests to do so, and it’s the right thing to do – then we know in our country from the experience of dealing with very difficult matters on our own shores, that the only way that you reach a solution is to bring all parties around the table, to take the heat down, to have cool heads, and to bring people together for a negotiated solution. We’ve got our own view as the UK. And our view is that the US matters, Ukraine must be involved in negotiations about Ukraine’s own future, and that Europe matters as well. And we need to make sure with all parties around the table that our alliance doesn’t fracture. We’re absolutely committed to Nato. We have to hold that coalition together. We have got a real threat here in Vladimir Putin. We have got to work together with our allies in order to make sure that we don’t just win the war and win the peace in Ukraine, but we also make sure that we don’t see the like of this happening again. The prime minister has made his own view clear. He spoke to president Zelenskyy in the last few days and made clear that he understands, first of all, that he is an elected leader, and we consider him in the United Kingdom to be a legitimate leader. We do not consider president Zelenskyy to be a dictator. He was elected by the people of Ukraine. And the reason that there haven’t been elections is because of Russian aggression, and that is something that is out with Ukrainian control. We stand with Ukraine, and our belief in that, our support for Ukraine is unshakable.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/20/uk-politics-latest-news-starmer-zelenskyy-ukraine-labour-tories	2025-02-20T01:00:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69ce4ace94c2fa70737c156af976fd0ba299a3ec/0_360_8192_4915/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=73e5769b8303bb07bf9189fc3305acac

Middle East crisis live: Hamas to return bodies of four Israeli hostages, including two children	Bodies of Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir, who Hamas says were killed in an Israeli airstrike, as well as Oded Lifshitz, 83, to be handed over Hello, we are restarting our live coverage of the Middle East. Hamas is set to return the bodies of four Israeli hostages on Thursday, including a mother and her two children who have long been feared dead and had come to embody the nation’s agony following the 7 October 2023 attack. Hamas has said it is ready to release all its remaining hostages in a single exchange if the ceasefire agreement with Israel moves forward to a second phase next month. A senior Hamas official, Taher al-Nunu, told Agence France-Presse -We have informed the mediators that Hamas is ready to release all hostages in one batch during the second phase of the agreement, rather than in stages, as in the current first phase.- The offer came as the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, signalled his readiness to talk about a second phase of the Gaza ceasefire after an extended delay, by appointing one of his closest advisers, Ron Dermer, a US-born cabinet minister and former ambassador to Washington, to lead the Israeli delegation to the talks. Dermer replaces the heads of the Mossad and the Shin Bet security service, who have led the negotiations until now and have frequently been at odds with Netanyahu over his reluctance to move forward with the ceasefire. Arab leaders will gather in Saudi Arabia on Friday to counter President Donald Trump’s plan for US control of Gaza and the expulsion of its inhabitants, diplomatic and government sources said. The plan stirred rare unity among Arab states which roundly rejected the idea, but they could still disagree over who will govern the Palestinian territory and who will pay for reconstruction. US secretary of state Marco Rubio met on Wednesday with the leader of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, after talks in Israel and in Saudi Arabia. The UAE has been key in mediating between Israel and Gaza. Wednesday’s meeting included discussions on artificial intelligence, the Gaza Strip, Syria, Lebanon and the Red Sea, which had been the site of attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels until the Gaza ceasefire a state department spokesperson said.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/20/israel-gaza-war-hostages-shiri-bibas-ariel-kfir-oded-lifshitz	2025-02-19T23:09:48-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73891f9f79f4910a304405824a81b664c130c455/763_0_7500_4500/master/7500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=205bcf3d6b56c0d6f052cec764a1a489

Thursday briefing: The real reasons that Volodymyr Zelenskyy can’t face a new election yet	In today’s newsletter: Zelenskyy described Trump’s claims as -disinformation- – only for the US president to double down. But his claims have no plausible basis in fact Good morning. Donald Trump’s view of Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un: -The smartest one gets to the top-. Donald Trump’s view of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who won Ukraine’s presidency in a landslide, enjoys continued popular support, and had to postpone new elections because his country was, as you will remember, invaded: he’s a dictator. Zelenskyy earned that astonishing designation yesterday by rejecting Trump’s claims that he is very unpopular, that Ukraine brought the invasion on itself, and that to be considered a legitimate leader he must hold new elections even under the threat of Russian attack. At a press conference in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said: -Unfortunately, President Trump, with all due respect for him as the leader of a nation that we respect greatly … is trapped in this disinformation bubble-. And he added: -I would like to have more truth with the Trump team.- Bills | The companies behind Great Britain’s gas pipes and power lines have pocketed a windfall of nearly £4bn from household bills during the energy and cost crisis, according to a report. The analysis, by Citizens Advice, argued that energy network owners were able to make the -excess profits- over the past four years after the industry regulator misjudged their costs. Brazil | British journalist Charlotte Alice Peet, 32, has been missing in Brazil for 11 days, a foreign correspondents’ association in the country has said, urging authorities to step up their search efforts. Peet has worked as a freelance journalist for outlets such as the Independent, Times, Telegraph and Al Jazeera. Immigration and asylum | Plans to prevent refugees who arrive in the UK on a small boat, lorry or via other -irregular- means from becoming a British citizen are facing their first legal challenge. The case is being brought by a 21-year-old Afghan refugee who arrived in the UK aged 14, after fleeing the Taliban and being smuggled to Britain in the back of a lorry. Sellafield | The UK nuclear industry regulator has taken Sellafield, the world’s largest store of plutonium, out of special measures for its physical security – but said concerns remained over its cybersecurity. In 2023, the Guardian revealed a string of safety concerns at the site – from issues with alarm systems to problems staffing safety roles at its toxic ponds – as well as cybersecurity failings.

Trump signs executive order targeting ‘benefits for illegal aliens’	US president issues order aimed at preventing taxpayer dollars supporting illegal immigration and another designed to get rid of regulations Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at ending federal benefits for people in the country illegally, his latest in a blizzard of moves to crack down on immigration.

All eyes on far-right AfD in German election rocked by violence and US interference	Extremists tipped for second place after shifting debate to immigration and crime and winning endorsements from Musk and Vance In the tumultuous German election campaign, which has been rocked by jaw-dropping US interference, a spate of violent attacks and rare fears for the country’s political stability, all eyes have been locked on the party most likely to finish second.
