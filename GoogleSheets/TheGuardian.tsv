Cautious Zelenskyy keeps cards close to his chest as Ukraine ceasefire proposed	Ukrainian president would not be drawn on details of proposed deal and also steered clear of criticising Trump at press briefing As journalists filtered out of the presidential administration in central Kyiv on Wednesday afternoon after a 30-minute press conference with president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the general consensus was that he had not said anything that would immediately make for a dramatic headline. That, it seems, was the point. Eager to show the White House that Ukraine is onboard for negotiations and not an obstacle to Donald Trump’s desire to bring peace, Zelenskyy seems to be trying to erase the memories of the nightmare meeting in the White House two weeks ago.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/12/cautious-zelenskyy-keeps-cards-close-to-his-chest-as-ukraine-ceasefire-proposed	2025-03-12T09:28:03-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d5e2652e86f673370550c6a402570400468ed3b/0_288_7626_4576/master/7626.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40c2739e3d91bcb7d3d747833d562be0

Rodrigo Duterte’s arrest could be telling blow in the Philippines’ dynastic feud	Former president was surrendered to The Hague amid a row between his family and that of the current president Few expected things to move so quickly. Supporters of the Philippines’ former president Rodrigo Duterte barely had time to protest before he was jetted off to The Hague to face charges of crimes against humanity in relation to his country’s so-called -war on drugs-. According to activists, this bloody crackdown has seen as many as 30,000 people killed since 2016. The charges brought against the former leader are the culmination of years of work by activists, lawyers and victims, who documented abuses committed under his government, often at great personal risk. But Duterte arguably would not have been surrendered to The Hague if it weren’t for his family’s dramatic feud with that of Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the current president.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/12/rodrigo-dutertes-arrest-could-be-telling-blow-in-the-philippines-dynastic-feud	2025-03-12T09:04:04-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90deae29fe3edb782e35b15446bbe2cf4dcb3c3c/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ced7bd8d36b0c070320eebf3d7978e6c

Sydney writers’ festival 2025: tallying authors’ views on Israel-Gaza ‘tokenistic and unfortunate’, organisers say	After the shock resignation of the festival’s chair, the Sydney writers’ festival unveils its starry 2025 program in ‘an incredibly polarised environment’ Over the past two years, programming a writers’ festival has become one of the most politically fraught undertakings in the Australian cultural sphere. Both Sydney and Melbourne writers’ festivals have seen board members resign over programming decisions, while Adelaide and Perth have fended off calls for the de-platforming of speakers on both sides of the Israel-Gaza conflict. Literary events are traditionally lauded for their -restraint, reason and tolerance in the face of opposing views- – but writers’ festivals are now issuing safety tips and employing security as they navigate -the frontier between social media’s echo chambers of outrage and the traditional public square’s conventions-, the University of Melbourne journalism academic Denis Muller observed in the Conversation last year, after the resignation of the Melbourne writers’ festival’s deputy chair, Leslie Reti.

The dogged fence-mending may yet unravel as multiple hurdles remain, principally the outstanding question of Ukraine’s security guarantees, but for the first time, in the words of Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, the ball is in Russia’s court.

Canada professor convicted in absentia gets renewed attention from right over 1980 Paris attack	Hassan Diab fears shifting political winds in Canada could lead to extradition fight after Musk shares post about him Until recently, Hassan Diab’s life in Ottawa had begun to settle back into a quiet suburban routine: spending his days teaching sociology part time at Carleton University, taking his two youngest children to the park to play football, or going for an afternoon swim. It had been well over a year since he was convicted in absentia for carrying out a deadly bomb attack on a Paris synagogue in 1980, and the media attention had largely quieted down.

Minister rejects claim that planning reforms designed to penalise farmers – UK politics live	Housing minister defends reforms in planning bill ahead of publication saying they are not aimed at farmers Good morning. The government’s planning and infrastructure bill is being published later today, and in an article for the Times Angela Rayner, the deputy PM and housing secretary, claims it will be -a major step forward in getting Britain building again-. The measures in the legislation have already been well publicised and Rayner sums them up like this. A new road for Norwich was set to make life easier for 44,000 homeowners, speeding up journeys to East Anglia’s biggest hospital and creating 33,000 new jobs. But it was delayed by spurious legal challenges for two years until the case was dismissed as having no logical basis. This government gave it the green light last week. The many organisations that must be consulted in the planning process are also putting up unnecessary obstacles. A row over balls hit from a cricket club has delayed 139 new flats in Bradford. The wait for a development consent order increased by 65 per cent between 2012 and 2021. It now takes around four years to get a decision on major infrastructure. We have been supportive of many of the Government’s changes to planning policy, but giving councils more power to reduce the value of land is a step too far, especially in the context of such a challenging outlook for farmers and the inheritance tax fiasco. This is not about people blocking development, it’s about the state paying the market price for land. We need more houses and more economic development, but not at the cost of basic principles. We are obviously and very clearly not setting out to target agricultural land. The land use framework we’re consulting on currently will ensure that prime agricultural land is protected, and food security is protected. I see this power being used in particular, to much greater effect – and that’s where I want to see it come forward – specifically in urban areas, on previously developed brownfield land where regeneration projects with a significant public interest can be unlocked more easily.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/11/angela-rayner-planning-reform-farmers-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live	2025-03-11T02:41:11-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8a38d1b73f4893a5302601fa0b83a1031369f41/0_67_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f35ecbaefa67bf2ea99c99743e16456c

Lib Dems urge Starmer to visit Canada to back incoming PM Mark Carney in his stand against Trump – UK politics live	Ed Davey’s comments come after the PM angered Canadians by refusing to answer questions on Trump’s stance on Canada Good morning.

But the Trump/Ukraine crisis overshadows everything. Last night Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, was elected leader of the Liberal party in Canada, which means he will become prime minister. Canadian election results don’t over take centre stage in UK politics, but Carney was elected promising fierce opposition to President Trump’s talk of annexing Canada and in London Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, is urging Starmer to fly to Ottawa this week -to stand in solidarity with the country’s new prime minister in response to Trump’s threats against Canada-. In a statement Davey said: It’s vital for both British and Canadian security that we stand strong together. With global instability rising, it’s never been more important to show a united front with our Commonwealth friends – and to stand together against Trump senselessly turning the screws on his allies, whether that’s Canada, the UK or Europe. Responding to the trade war along the North American border, our Prime Minister must stand in solidarity against Trump’s bullying and visit Ottawa in a joint show of strength. Starmer must be clear that Trump’s threats against Commonwealth nations’ sovereignty are unacceptable. Trump allies will be vigilant for any coded message Charles sends, following the warm reception he gave Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Sandringham shortly after the Ukrainian was ambushed by the president and JD Vance in the Oval Office.

She ran the household errands, made sure he remained active and protected him from illnesses.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/09/gene-hackman-final-days	2025-03-09T05:00:03-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5c5b09380da802c06326371cd4136f3e591b9f3/0_154_2464_1479/master/2464.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=159930f32302550d31ee2e69104f511e

Ukraine war live: Zelenskyy says Ukraine ‘fully committed’ to talks ahead of US meeting in Saudi Arabia	Ukrainian president backs negotiations despite Trump’s comments while calling for more sanctions on Russia after deadly missile attack Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine is -fully committed- to having a constructive dialogue with US representatives in Saudi Arabia next week, even as Donald Trump said he found it -easier- to deal with Russia than with Ukraine in efforts to end the war. -Realistic proposals are on the table. The key is to move quickly and effectively,- the Ukrainian president said on X ahead of his trip to Saudi Arabia next week. Three people were killed and seven others injured in a drone attack early on Saturday in the city of Bogodukhiv, the military head of the eastern Kharkiv region, Oleg Synegubov, said. Russia fired two missiles and 145 drones at Bogodukhiv, Ukraine’s air force said. The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said on Saturday that appeasement towards Russia was leading to more tragedy in Ukraine. -This is what happens when someone appeases barbarians,- Tusk wrote on X. -More bombs, more aggression, more victims. Another tragic night in Ukraine.- The Russian defence ministry announced the recapture of Viktorovka, Nikolayevka and Staraya Sorochina in its Kursk region. According to DeepState, an online military tracker linked to the Ukrainian army, the Russian move followed a -breach- in Ukrainian defence lines near the town of Sudzha, which is under Kyiv’s control. An army source interviewed by Ukrainska Pravda newspaper said that the Ukrainian soldiers were trying to -stabilise the situation- but the Russian troops had -completely cut off the supply lines-. Moscow’s defence ministry on Saturday said its air defence systems had destroyed 31 Ukrainian drones over the previous night. A Ukrainian drone attack also targeted Russia’s Kirishi oil refinery and falling debris caused damage to a reservoir, the governor of the north-western Leningrad region, Aleksandr Drozdenko, said. A civilian was injured by a drone attack in Belgorod district near the Ukraine border, the local governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, wrote on Telegram.

Covid, five years on: UK ‘still not ready to protect the population’	Scientific triumphs were made in the battle against the pandemic, but the memories and lessons are already in danger of being lost On 9 March 2020, Martin Landray was studying the likely impact of Covid-19 as it started to sweep Britain. What was needed, he realised, was a method for pinpointing cheap, effective drugs that might limit the impact of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that was filling UK hospitals with ­dangerously ill patients. Within 10 days, Landray – working with Oxford University colleague Peter Horby – had set up Recovery, a drug-testing programme that involved thousands of doctors and nurses working with tens of ­thousands of Covid-19 patients in UK hospitals.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/09/covid-five-years-on-uk-still-not-ready-to-protect-the-population	2025-03-08T22:00:44-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/362748b882f56f3de141f115fc20f2052b747926/0_97_6013_3609/master/6013.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6a9f33ec35cbedc7263a2164145e2cc5

That approach is likely to be a non-starter for most Democrats who have long insisted that defense and non-defense spending move in the same direction.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/house-republicans-spending-bill	2025-03-08T11:30:56-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d529e9bad160210347c7d518d2d71a4827045f6d/0_73_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ec85f36fe7eff4474ac39485e05cd726

Ukraine war live: 11 killed in Donetsk as Russia steps up attacks after Trump defends Putin	High-rise apartment blocks in centre of Dobropillia town hit in attack a day after US suspended intelligence sharing with Kyiv Welcome to our live coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. Here’s a snapshot of the latest to bring you up to speed. At least 11 people were killed and 30 wounded in Russian strikes on eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region late on Friday, the country’s emergency service said on Saturday, raising the earlier death toll of four. Russia carried out huge ballistic missile and drone strikes across Ukraine a day after the US stopped sharing intelligence with Kyiv which had previously given advance warnings of attacks. The strikes came early on Friday as a Ukrainian delegation prepared to meet with US counterparts in Saudi Arabia next week for talks about a possible end to the war, report Luke Harding and Dan Sabbagh. In a post on Truth Social, Donald Trump appeared to criticise Russia’s latest bombardment. The US president posted: -Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely ‘pounding’ Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED.- Separately, Trump said after the strikes that Vladimir Putin was -doing what anybody would do-. -I think he wants to get it [the war] stopped and settled and I think he’s hitting them harder than he’s been hitting them and I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now,- he told reporters in the White House. Trump also said he found it -easier- to deal with Russia than with Ukraine in efforts to end the war and that he trusted Putin, the Russian president. -I believe him,- Trump said. -I’m finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine and they don’t have the cards. It may be easier dealing with Russia.- Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded to Russia’s strikes by calling for a truce covering air and sea. -The first steps to establishing real peace should be forcing the sole source of this war, Russia, to stop such attacks,- the Ukrainian president said on Telegram. Moscow has rejected the idea of a temporary truce, which has also been proposed by Britain and France. US aerospace company Maxar Technologies disabled Ukraine’s access to its satellite images after a request from the Trump administration. Maxar said it had contracts with the US government and dozens of allied and partner nations and -each customer makes their own decisions on how they use and share that data-. Zelenskyy’s approval rating in Ukraine has risen by 10 percentage points since his White House spat with Trump, a survey by a leading Ukrainian pollster showed on Friday. The poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology – conducted from 14 February to 4 March – found 67% of respondents trusted Zelenskyy in March, up from 57% a month earlier. Iran’s foreign ministry denied accusations by Emmanuel Macron that Tehran had supplied equipment to Russia for use in the Ukraine war, calling the French president’s remarks -baseless and false-.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/mar/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-putin-trump-zelenskyy-donetsk-latest-news-updates	2025-03-07T23:24:21-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95c56436f78f6dc030eeff0bf69145ba3fa1ebc6/0_232_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d9980de2f7c5171d35c786b7e6d5c522

The spymaster, the ringleader and the ‘minions’: who’s who of the spy ring trial	The group was led by a fugitive in Moscow who gave orders to a Bulgarian in Great Yarmouth, the court heard A hierarchical network of individuals constituted a Russian-directed spy ring, the Old Bailey heard during a three-month espionage trial. Directed from Moscow by a fugitive, it was led by a Bulgarian based in Great Yarmouth who, largely through a friend and deputy, directed the operations of the others. Here are those named in court.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/mar/07/spy-ring-trial-whos-who-spymaster-ringleader-minions	2025-03-07T06:47:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d69334e035c724e531bd786a7043ee72c8eb1598/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=454c1e106fad405fb0639c8fd6a51b5b
‘The dumbest thing I’ve ever done’: spy trial’s tales of scheming, bluster and a love triangle	Trial of three ‘minions’ in spy ring for Russia heard of chaotic errors, tangled relationships, a cancer lie and a red button It began with a simple request, though it was written by one of the world’s most wanted men. -We’d be interested in a Bulgarian guy working for Bellingcat: Christo Grozev,- the author wrote at 7.46pm on 14 December 2020. Another message followed on Telegram: -Can we look into this guy or would it raise too many questions?- And so a spy ring of Bulgarians based in Britain but working for Russia began to form. The author was Jan Marsalek, a fugitive businessman accused of involvement in a €1.9bn fraud on the German payments company Wirecard – and an agent for Russia. Earlier that year he had fled to Moscow, and now he had time on his hands. The message’s recipient was Orlin Roussev, 47, an IT specialist and private investigator who had been based in the UK for several years – and somebody Marsalek appeared to know well.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/07/spy-trial-scheming-bluster-tangled-relationships	2025-03-07T06:46:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3bbd920883c55d3ed7b988811234f4669f7a5cc/0_386_1686_1011/master/1686.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4b934d01c2f8c8fc8d0f827356a66af3

More than a million salmon dumped after ‘unprecedented’ mass mortality at Tasmanian fish farms	Bob Brown Foundation’s drone footage appears to show farm workers pumping live salmon into a tub carrying dead fish and then sealing it At least 1 million salmon died at Tasmanian fish farms and were dumped at landfill sites and rendering plants in February in what authorities and the industry described as an -unprecedented- mass death triggered by a bacterium outbreak. The revelation that waste facilities in Tasmania’s south received more than 5,500 tonnes of dead salmon last month – equivalent to about 1.07 million full-grown Atlantic salmon, or 8% of total annual production in the state – followed weeks of reports of fatty chunks of fish washing up on beaches in the Huon Valley and on Bruny Island.

China vows action over ‘arbitrary’ tariffs as Trump pauses measures against Canada and Mexico – US politics live	Foreign minister calls measures ‘two-faced acts’ Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the coming hours. We start with news that the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said China will continue to retaliate against the United States’ -arbitrary tariffs- despite pausing similar action against Canada and Mexico. Trump told his cabinet secretaries that they are in charge of hiring and firings at their agencies, not Elon Musk. The House has voted to censure Democratic congressman Al Green for disrupting Trump’s address to this week’s joint session of Congress. The motion was approved with 224 votes in favor and 198 opposed, with 10 Democrats in support. In an escalation of his pressure campaign, Trump said the US will not fight for Nato allies who don’t spend enough on their own defense. US district judge Beryl Howell ruled on Thursday that Donald Trump’s firing of a Democratic member of the National Labor Relations Board was illegal and ordered that she be reinstated to her post. Axios reports that the state department is hunting for evidence that foreign students who express support for Palestinians under Israeli occupation while studying in the US are -pro-Hamas-, and can have their visas revoked, based on an AI review of their social media accounts. Trump thanked a reporter for the partisan outlet Breitbart for asking him a friendly question in the Oval Office, which teed him up to attack Democrats. The White House excluded non-partisan reporters from Reuters and the Associated Press to make room for Breitbart and One America News, two pro-Trump outlets. Trump signed an executive order on Thursday evening to establish a -strategic bitcoin reserve-, a day before meeting with executives from the cryptocurrency industry at the White House. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who reportedly endured a profanity-laced tirade from Trump, was asked about his foreign minister’s comment that dealing with the US was now -a psychodrama-. -How would you characterize it?- a reporter asked. -Thursday-, Trudeau replied.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/mar/07/donald-trump-tariffs-china-canada-mexico-us-politics-live-news	2025-03-07T02:57:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0de3ed9765049cf579b50c80481a6572917893d2/0_251_5719_3432/master/5719.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a32b249129293bd6db6db0d5df94fec9

His company – the producer of most of the world’s most advanced semiconductors – would boost its existing $65bn US presence by a whopping $100bn. For TSMC the deal meant they would avoid massive tariffs Trump had flagged for the global chip industry.

And discovered that a change in the US administration, and USAid funding cuts, means there is a growing fear of prison breaks A few weeks ago, Michael Safi travelled to north-east Syria, an area controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. Here, suspected foreign fighters for Islamic State – including those from Britain – have for years been imprisoned without charge and with no idea of when they would be released. Few prisoners in the camp say they are IS members. Michael and fellow journalist, Will Christou, spoke to a former British surgeon from Leicester who told a surprising story of being ‘tricked’ into crossing into Syria from Turkey. They also met an Australian prisoner, who admitted to being an IS member, and whose family for years did not know his whereabouts.	https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/mar/07/inside-the-islamic-state-prisons-the-west-is-trying-to-forget-podcast	2025-03-06T19:00:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5db91da0e1ae59a151f1403ae387bb12d777e1a4/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=31c5d93a0e37f651a593d93fd0f18fc8

In the months after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, clearing the way for Alabama to ban virtually all abortions, Alabama attorney general Steve Marshall repeatedly suggested that abortion rights activists who help people go out of state for abortions could be charged as participants in an illegal conspiracy. The Yellowhammer Fund, an abortion fund that helped people pay for the procedure, and the West Alabama Women’s Center, a former abortion clinic that pivoted to providing services like miscarriage management, joined with other abortion rights advocates to sue Marshall over his comments.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/05/alabama-court-hearing-abortion	2025-03-05T03:00:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dea029afeebd9d9beb743179befb1a8c9adc884/0_179_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d18df9255f0a2fda5fade74b04ce1aed
IRS workforce ‘could halve’ after Trump hails cuts to federal staffing in marathon Congress speech – US politics live	Federal agencies have until 13 March to formulate staff reduction plans as allies and critics react to Trump’s marathon Congress speech Welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of US politics and the Donald Trump administration. I’m Tom Ambrose. We start with news that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is considering reducing its workforce by as much as 50%, according to reports. The agency has already laid off about 7,000 of its 90,000 employees since Donald Trump came to power. Donald Trump on Tuesday declared that his administration was -just getting started- as Democratic lawmakers protested with placards that read -lies- and -false- during his a marathon address to Congress The president’s speech was littered with false claims he has previously been corrected on but continues to repeat – here are some of those -facts- checked He doubled down on his expansionist rhetoric, saying the administration was in the process of -reclaiming the Panama canal- and repeating his threat to take control of Greenland: -One way or the other, we’re going to get it-. The president has also recently stated that the US will -own- the Gaza Strip The dollar has fallen to the lowest level since November, after Trump said his new tariffs will cause -a little disturbance- in his Congress speech Responding to Trump’s speech, Sen Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said that Ronald Reagan -must be rolling in his grave- after last week’s Oval Office spat with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Trump -cozying up to dictators like Vladimir Putin-, and asserted that Trump would have -lost- the cold war Democratic Rep Al Green of Texas was ejected for an outburst during Trump’s speech. He later told the media -It’s worth it to let people know that there are some of us who are going to stand up against this president- The Trump administration has listed over 300 federal buildings for sale.

Minister says welfare budget ‘unsustainable’ amid reports Reeves has earmarked billions in cuts – UK politics live	Justice secretary said there is a ‘moral case’ for getting people into work when asked about the chancellor’s reported plans Good morning. Three weeks today Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, will present her spring statement. Originally this was not meant to involve budget-scale changes for plans to tax or spending (Reeves says she is only going to have one proper budget a year, in the autumn, to ensure stability), but changes to the country’s economic situation mean this statement is going to be more consequential than originally intended and this morning the BBC is running a story that looks like classic Treasury pitch rolling. The markets don’t like surprises and, while exact details of budget announcements are kept secret until the chancellor speaks to MPs, the Treasury invests a lot of effort in ensuring that people have a rough idea of what’s coming. According to a report by the BBC’s economics editor Faisal Islam, Reeves is going to announce cuts, worth several billions pounds, particularly affecting welfare. He says: The Treasury will put the proposed cuts to the government’s official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), on Wednesday amid expectations the chancellor’s financial buffer has been wiped out. Sources said -the world has changed- since Rachel Reeves’s Budget last October, when the OBR indicated she had £9.9bn available to spend against her self-imposed borrowing rules. Clearly the world has changed a lot since the autumn Budget. People are watching that change happen before their eyes. The Office for Budget Responsibility will reflect that changing world in its forecasts later this month and a changing world will be a core feature of the chancellor’s response later this month. This is the Labour party. The clue is in the name. We believe in work. We know that there are many people who are currently receiving state support for being out of work who want to be in work. We know that we have too many of our young people currently out of work, not in education, employment or training. It is right that a Labour government strains every sinew to make sure that the support is available to prevent people from leaving the labour market or, if they have left the labour market, to help them get back. We’ve seen a huge rise in that welfare budget. We know that there are millions of people who are out of work in our country who want to be in work. It is absolutely morally the right thing to do to support people, to make sure either they don’t leave the labour market, or if they have, they’re supported to get back into it.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/05/rachel-reeves-welfare-budget-spring-statement-pmqs-labour-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-news-uk-politics-live	2025-03-05T01:23:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ebe1389c6c5f4b6686a58a386eddef45b65dc9b/0_97_4127_2477/master/4127.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=890ae1635d150bf8d4ffe531dfe49d93

Wednesday briefing: The view from ​Russia as ​Trump upends the world order	In today’s newsletter: Pjotr Sauer explains Russia’s response to the new Trump administration following a fraught week in global relations Good morning. In his address to Congress last night, Donald Trump recited a letter from Volodymyr Zelenskyy offering to return to the negotiating table – and warmly welcomed the tone of discussions his administration has held with Russia. -We’ve received strong signals that they are ready for peace,- he said. -Wouldn’t that be beautiful?- That was not the first sign of Trump’s faith in Vladimir Putin’s promises – but it served to underline what is surely the most radical US foreign policy shift in a generation. Whether parroting Kremlin talking points on Zelenskyy’s democratic credentials, making false claims that Ukraine started the war or cutting off vital military aid to Kyiv, the US president has created a dynamic that would have scarcely been believable six months ago. Killed women count | Nearly one in 10 of all women who died at the hands of men in the UK over the past 15 years were mothers killed by their sons, a report reveals. The statistics have led to calls for the government to take specific action to tackle matricide. Tariffs | Justin Trudeau has claimed the aim of a -dumb- trade war launched by Donald Trump is to usher in the -complete collapse- of the Canadian economy and make it easier for the US to annex Canada. Leading stock market indices fell sharply, with the US benchmark S&amp;P 500 losing all its post-election gains, as the US slapped 25% taxes on Canadian and Mexican goods and hiked tariffs on China.

More than 170 mothers killed by their sons in 15 years in UK, report reveals	Number is nearly one in 10 of all women killed by men, leading to calls for government action to tackle matricide Nearly one in 10 of all women who died at the hands of men in the UK over the past 15 years were mothers killed by their sons, a report reveals. Data analysing the deaths of 2,000 women killed by men since 2009 has given an unprecedented insight into the hidden scourge of matricide, with more than 170 mothers killed by their sons. 61% of women were killed by a current or former partner, 9% of women were killed by their sons, 6% by other family members, 15% by other men they knew and 10% by someone they did not know. Of the 213 women killed by a close family member, 80% were mothers killed by sons. Nearly half of women were stabbed, 27% strangled and 17% hit with a blunt instrument. In 16% of cases, a man used kicking, hitting or stamping as the weapon. In almost a quarter of cases, more than one form of violence was used. Overkill – the use of excessive, gratuitous violence beyond that necessary to cause the victim’s death – happened in 59% of femicides. Leicestershire had the highest rate of femicide over the period, followed by Merseyside, the West Midlands, Greater Manchester and London. Killed women involved in prostitution were younger and less likely to have been born in the UK. Children witnessed at least 163 femicides, while 37 women were killed alongside 53 children, most commonly by their father.

‘A real injustice’: mothers killed by their children is still a hidden issue in UK	Research shows that mothers are seen as a ‘safe space’ for their offspring – nearly all of them sons – to use violence The thought of mothers being abused or killed by their own children – the people they have carried, cared for and nurtured since birth – is something of an underexamined and almost taboo issue in Britain. There is a slowly growing body of research into why children under 18 use violent behaviour towards their parents. There is an even smaller body of research showing why adults – nearly all of them sons – do the same.

Social media firms criticise ‘irrational’ exemption of YouTube from Australia’s under-16s ban	Meta, TikTok and Snapchat release statements in campaign protesting Labor’s handling of contested legislation Meta, TikTok and Snapchat have criticised the Albanese government’s handling of the social media ban for under-16s, launching a campaign against what they have labelled an -irrational- and -shortsighted- decision to exempt YouTube from the contested legislation. The three tech platforms made submissions to a government consultation process on the ban – rushed through parliament at the end of 2024 with little inquiry – calling for a re-evaluation of Labor’s approach and demanding YouTube be subject to the same restrictions they will be.

Plus, the date by which the majority of adults globally will be overweight Good morning. The Trump administration has halted all US military aid to Ukraine, blocking the delivery of ammunition, vehicles, and other equipment as it pressures Kyiv to agree to a peace deal. What has the vice-president, JD Vance, said? That the US having financial interest in Ukraine is the best way to guarantee the country’s security. The comments come amid the minerals deal Washington wants Kyiv to sign. How do Americans feel about Ukraine? 52% of Americans said they -personally support- Ukraine, while only 4% of back Russia, a poll last week found. 44% said they do not support either. A separate poll conducted after the confrontation found that 49% said Trump and JD Vance had a stronger argument over the value of diplomacy with Russia. The 2Way poll also found that 62% thought Zelenskyy’s remarks at the White House were offensive – and 55% said Ukraine needed to negotiate and end the war. What about Mexico? The country’s president is expected to announce her response on Tuesday morning.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/04/first-thing-us-suspends-military-aid-ukraine-trump-zelenskyy-row	2025-03-04T03:30:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3deb44ed65c4f8071763ada2b533faf110d35d29/0_0_5770_3462/master/5770.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ebf716713b25c5dabdd4c5f9b66004b4

Trump to address Congress as policy decisions divide nation – US politics live	President expected to ask for more money for immigration crackdown as Democrats invite fired federal workers to speech Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. My name is Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news over the next few hours. We start with news that president Donald Trump will stand before a joint session of Congress today to give an accounting of his turbulent first weeks in office as a divided nation struggles to keep pace. The Trump administration has suspended delivery of all US military aid to Ukraine, blocking billions in crucial shipments as the White House piles pressure on Ukraine to sue for peace with Vladimir Putin. The decision affects deliveries of ammunition, vehicles, and other equipment including shipments agreed to when Joe Biden was president. It comes after a dramatic blow-up in the White House on Friday during which Donald Trump told Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he was -gambling with- a third world war. The Ukrainian president was told to come back -when he is ready for peace-. US vice-president JD Vance said that the best way to protect Ukraine from another Russian invasion is to guarantee the US has a financial interest in Ukraine’s future. -If you want real security guarantees, if you want to actually ensure that Vladimir Putin does not invade Ukraine again, the very best security guarantee is to give Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine,- Vance said in the interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity which aired Monday night. China and Canada unveiled retaliatory measures against the US after Donald Trump imposed his sweeping tariffs plan at midnight US time, despite warnings it could spark an escalating trade war. US tariffs have come into force of 25% against goods from Canada and Mexico, the US’s two biggest trading partners, and 20% tariffs against China – doubling the levy on China from last month. The duties will affect more than $918bn-worth (£722bn) of US imports from Canada and Mexico. The US health department told employees on Monday they could apply for early retirement over the next 10 days and should respond to a request for information on their accomplishments of the past week, according to emails seen by Reuters. Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, who oversees the so-called -department of government efficiency-, are spearheading an unprecedented effort to shrink the federal bureaucracy, including through job cuts. The US Senate has confirmed Linda McMahon as the nation’s next education secretary, entrusting the former wrestling executive with a department marked for dismantling by Donald Trump. The 76-year-old billionaire businesswoman and longtime Trump ally was approved 51-45, reflecting deep divisions over her qualifications and the administration’s education agenda. McMahon, who previously led the small business administration during Trump’s first term, now faces the paradoxical task of running an agency while simultaneously working toward its potential elimination. Two alleged leaders of a criminal organization suspected of smuggling 20,000 people without permanent legal residency into the US from Guatemala have been arrested in Los Angeles, federal prosecutors said on Monday. Eduardo Domingo Renoj-Matul, known as -Turko-, and his lieutenant, Cristobal Mejia-Chaj, were taken into custody Friday and have pleaded not guilty to multiple charges related to smuggling migrants across the border over five years, the US attorney’s office said. A federal judge ordered the men, who themselves are in the country illegally, jailed without bond until their trial in April.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/mar/04/donald-trump-congress-speech-ukraine-tariffs-democrats-federal-workers-us-politics-live-news	2025-03-04T02:52:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e385535968c59d843c6994afe48c3642d3edc59d/0_163_6000_3601/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c05084401e49dc4339b3c339fc4c6819

Starmer won’t be derailed from Ukraine plan, Rayner says, amid claims Trump’s aid decision ‘humiliated’ PM – UK politics live	Few hours after Starmer’s statement to Commons on Monday, White House suspended all military aid to Ukraine Good morning. Yesterday Keir Starmer had a comfortable two hours in the Commons during which MPs from all sides praised him, lavishly and sincerely, for the leadership he has shown on Ukraine, trying to hold the US and Europe together, while mobilising European efforts to build up support for Ukraine. There were probably only two moments when Starmer lashed out; first at Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, whom he accused of fawning over Vladimir Putin; and then at Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminser, whom he accused of being a keyboard warrior (in response to a question from a Labour MP who was even more critical). The attack on Flynn came about half an hour after Flynn asked a perfectly reasonable question. Unfortunately, it has been reported this afternoon that President Trump is set to meet American aides to discuss withdrawing military aid to Ukraine. Are those reports something that the prime minister recognises, and, if so, what impact will that have on the timetable to which he and President Macron are currently working? I have not seen reports of the United States withdrawing support for Ukraine, and, as I understand it, that is not its position.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/04/keir-starmer-ukraine-plan-donald-trump-aid-labour-conservative-uk-politics-latest-news	2025-03-04T01:12:34-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2baf10edcd01a6346a3265d1a3647d31816d139e/0_259_7775_4665/master/7775.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=76b42ddc4272d30109c864d899ad9c19

Tuesday briefing: Where Gaza’s fragile ceasefire stands – and what it will take to move it forward	In today’s newsletter: With talks stalled, aid blocked and a truce in question, can the path to peace get back on track? Good morning. The first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza expired over the weekend – and now, the only thing stopping the resumption of Israel’s assault on the territory is the will of Benjamin Netanyahu. That is the bleak reality for the hostages still alive in Gaza, and the Palestinian civilians there who were subjected to a new aid embargo on Sunday. Last night, the Israeli government was reported to be planning to ratchet the blockade up further – with a programme of measures referred to as the -hell plan-. When the ceasefire was agreed in January, the theory was that the first phase would provide space for negotiations over a more durable truce. But those talks simply have not happened. Israel is pushing for the release of more hostages in an extension to the first phase – a step that Hamas, fearing the loss of its only source of leverage, refuses to countenance. Both sides are now making preparations for the resumption of violence.

Bog standard? Study seeks most effective toilet training methods	UCL team is inviting parents to share their experiences, as age at which children in west acquire the skill rises Storybooks about potties, underpants featuring superheroes, rewards for doing a wee: toilet training is a rite of passage for any child.

Ministers plan major changes to Send education in England	White paper being prepared as councils hope for relief from huge deficits in special educational needs budgets Labour is preparing major changes to special educational needs provision in English schools, as individual councils raise the alarm over debts running into hundreds of millions of pounds that have pushed many to the brink of bankruptcy. A Guardian analysis has found the vast majority of English upper-tier councils have accumulated often eye-watering special educational needs spending deficits. At least 12 have forecast accumulated deficits of more than £100m, running as high as £312m, when the debts have to be settled in a year’s time. Some councils have raised concerns about profiteering amid frustration over huge fees from private specialist schools, which can charge between £50,000 and £100,000 per place, typically two to three times the cost of state provision. Tensions between headteachers and councils over attempts by the latter to shift millions of pounds from local school budgets to ease high needs deficits. Some schools have said such moves would force them to sack Send support staff.

Guardian Essential poll: RBA rate cut too little too late for many as Albanese’s rating dips again	As the official start of the election campaign nears, almost one in two Australians don’t know who they will vote for or might change their mind More than half of Australians believe last month’s cash rate cut was too little too late and a sign the Labor government’s economic plan is not working, but voters think Anthony Albanese is better placed than Peter Dutton to deliver cost-of-living relief and higher wages and safeguard Medicare. Voters have again marked down Albanese, with his net approval rating dipping to minus eight in the latest Guardian Essential poll. But Australians believe his party would be better – or at least no worse – than the Coalition on some key issues.

Tories fight abolition of hereditary peers as Labour’s Lords reforms stall	Keir Starmer’s plan to replace upper house was scaled back to scrapping hereditaries – but even that is proving difficult Abolishing hereditary peers was supposed to be the easy part of House of Lords reform for Labour, which grandly set out plans three years ago to replace the second chamber altogether. But on Monday Conservative peers will make an effort to clog up the legislation as it goes through parliament, suggesting delays to allow abolished hereditaries more time to find a job, allowing some of them to stay, or even converting them to become life peers. As a detailed scrutiny of the bill gets under way, 116 amendments have been put forward, which are likely to be debated individually. Some propose progressive changes such as cutting numbers of peers, introducing attendance requirements and getting rid of bishops from the house, but many are aimed at watering down the abolition of hereditaries.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/03/abolition-hereditary-peers-labour-lords-reform	2025-03-03T04:00:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bb62dabf7e54e75f6a36aebb5b82b4e3787ba87/1_0_4999_3000/master/4999.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=888ca7da988529f7624ab90f1ad39413

Peter Mandelson criticised after saying Ukraine should give ‘unequivocal backing’ to Trump’s plan – UK politics live	Defence minister Luke Pollard tries to distance the government from the US ambassador’s comments to the media Good morning. Domestic politics has not gone away, but it is all being eclipsed at the moment by the Ukraine crisis, and the efforts Keir Starmer is leading to develop a Europe-led peace plan and – crucially – to keep the US and Europe at least broadly aligned. The stakes are enormous. Labour is very proud of the role the Attlee government played in creating Nato, but now its future as a funtioning alliance is in doubt. In his press conference yesterday Starmer said he did not accept the US is now an -unreliable ally-. But many Europeans who watched President Trump and JD Vance bully and belittle President Zelenskyy on camera in the Oval Office on Friday will have come to a different conclusion. Starmer is expected to make a statement to MPs about his visit to the White House, and yesterday’s summit in London, and that should start after 3.30pm. We need a very radical reset. The reset has to consist of the US and Ukraine getting back on the same page. And President Zelenskyy giving his unequivocal backing to the initiative that President Trump is taking to end the war and to bring a just and lasting peace to Ukraine. And the Europeans too need to back the calls for a ceasefire. And by the way, I think that Ukraine should be the first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow. The UK ambassador to Washington isn’t meant to communicate his own opinion, he is meant to communicate the UK government opinion. Lammy and Starmer need to grip this. What is Mandelson up to? You cannot square what the Prime Minister said this morning with this. What is the Government’s actual position? Our man in DC should be securing US protection for our brave Ukrainian allies, not telling President Zelensky what to do. No. It’s certainly right that Ukrainians want peace. I think of all the people on our continent that want peace, the Ukrainians want it the most. But we’re still in discussions, diplomatic engagement with our European, US and Ukrainian friends as to the shape of that deal. That’s not government policy and you wouldn’t expect me to commentate on every ups and downs in negotiations.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/03/peter-mandelson-ukraine-donald-trump-volodymyr-zelenskyy-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live	2025-03-03T01:12:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72e7098aa494ad66591abd150135b84a45ca41db/0_199_7599_4559/master/7599.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4fd849e23e71bb7de435a6bf864240b9

Monday briefing: UK and Europe pick up the pieces after White House car crash	In today’s newsletter: After Friday’s clash meeting in the Oval Office between Trump and Zelenskyy, Keir Starmer and his European allies will try to broker the peace Ukraine desperately needs Good morning. After the shocking treatment he received at the White House on Friday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy was on friendlier turf yesterday – but whether a bear hug from Keir Starmer and an audience with King Charles will ultimately prove consequential for the war in Ukraine is still anyone’s guess. The Ukrainian president was in the UK to attend a European summit, convened by Starmer, to take steps towards new proposals that might be able to find support in Kyiv and Washington alike. And while there were some signs of European unity, the White House and its surrogates were still suggesting that Zelenskyy was guilty of some sort of insult to the United States that might be enough to make a durable peace impossible. Last night, Zelenskyy refused to say whether he believed he had been ambushed – but said that he was ready to talk to Trump again.

Amid brutal foreign wars and democracy under siege, the Oscars were silent on Trump	No one uttered the US president’s name, and speeches bore few references to Gaza or Ukraine, focusing on the LA fires The 97th Academy Awards had one of the longest run times for the annual show in recent history, yet the least mentions of the current political climate – with not a single person uttering the name -Donald Trump-. While few people watch awards shows – least of all the Oscars – for political discussion, comments on world events have long been an expected part of the broadcasts. Trump himself has even weighed in on a show – at least once while it aired: last year, while campaigning for re-election, he posted on Truth Social and asked rhetorically whether there was ever a -worse host- than Jimmy Kimmel at the 2024 Oscars and criticized his opening monologue.

‘Trump doesn’t understand who the aggressor is’: fatigue and anger in Odesa	Russian attacks on Ukrainian city that was initially spared worst have increased since Washington-Moscow detente Olena Palash heard a loud buzzing above her flat in the Ukrainian port of Odesa. It was 11pm. First one drone, and another, then more. Soon afterwards, one of the Shaheeds crashed into the children’s clinic where she works. An explosion shredded the building’s facade. The metal covering of a car park was remade into a spaghetti-like jumble. Another drone smashed into a nearby kindergarten. The attack on 18 February knocked out a substation and plunged some of the city into darkness. Four people were injured, including a 10-year-old girl, and 80,000 were left without heat.

Revealed: New Orleans touted public safety street closures for years but didn’t implement them	A Guardian analysis shows that vehicles were allowed to approach Bourbon Street despite safety plans in years leading up to deadly attack Local government officials in New Orleans, which endured an intentional, deadly truck ramming attack on its most famous street during New Year’s Day celebrations, have not shut down vehicular cross traffic on that street during major events nearly 90 times – evidently failing to fully enact public safety plans that they touted ahead of the gatherings, a Guardian investigation has confirmed. In many cases, cars and other vehicles were allowed to cross the street for the entire period that the city’s press releases said they would be forbidden from doing so. And during all but a handful of days, officials failed to place any physical barriers that would prevent motorists intending to attack crowds there from turning in either direction on to Bourbon Street, a one-way thoroughfare, leaving pedestrians vulnerable to terrorists for many years.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/02/new-orleans-public-safety-measures	2025-03-02T05:00:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69176fc58661a34123b7e128d00572f9aebb575f/0_18_1137_682/master/1137.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a7b52c03ff97e472666d89c8614f829f

The last week of meetings between Trump, Macron, Starmer and finally Zelenskyy always felt like crawling across a minefield. Some might agonise about whether Zelenskyy could have played things differently. It’s the wrong question. The point is that we can’t carry on being so dependent on every meeting at the White House.

For the top brass there were individual villas; for the lower ranks, a choice of six hotels, while the foot soldiers were relegated to a camping site surrounded by palm trees and lush greenery.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/01/communist-tito-yugoslav-adriatic-luxury-beach-resort	2025-03-01T07:00:43-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5379ded8f8b80c844dcd89b2fe14d33442df3c3f/49_27_735_441/master/735.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c35c403b2cd0e8a0e8146677de00176c
Plane crashes have people freaked out – but here’s what US data for 2025 shows	This year’s 16 fatal accidents fall below average rate of 20 per month, yet recent crashes were US’s deadliest in a decade People across the US are worried about flight safety after several high-profile plane crashes this year, including a commercial crash in Washington DC that killed 67 people. Google searches for -is flying safe- have jumped in recent weeks. But the numbers suggest 2025 has actually been a relatively safe year to fly – at least in terms of the overall number of accidents. January and February typically have about 20 fatal aviation accidents per month, according to numbers from the National Transportation Safety Board. By contrast, this January, there were only 10 fatal aviation accidents, and in February there were six. The data covers all US civil aviation, from large commercial planes to private jets.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/01/plane-crash-safety-data	2025-03-01T07:00:43-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e68d39213cf854ad1afaa3a345589c3bc91b7eca/0_0_3402_2042/master/3402.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b6f50497b606f1ab3b703192b2382106

Ageing nuclear plant in Florida at risk from climate crisis, advocates warn	Regulators extended the life of two of the oldest US reactors in Miami. Millions of people in the area are now vulnerable A decision by regulators to extend the life of two of the oldest reactors in the US decades beyond their original permits has elevated the risk of a nuclear disaster in heavily populated south Florida, environmental groups are warning. The Miami Waterkeeper says the ageing Turkey Point facility in south Miami-Dade county, which was built in 1967 and generates power for a metropolitan area covering about 3 million people, is especially vulnerable to flooding and excessive heat from the climate emergency, in part because of its low-lying position and coastal exposure to a major hurricane.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/01/nuclear-power-plants-miami-florida	2025-03-01T06:00:43-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eae5876a73085e00fe6a76f728f54c1dd191dbd3/0_237_4688_2814/master/4688.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cc4394d0f7590b8820c9a16de11262a9

Live: European leaders rally behind Zelenskyy after stunning Trump clash – updates	European leaders voice support for Ukrainian leader as US support for Kyiv hangs in the balance following disastrous meeting Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine, hours after an unprecedented showdown between US president Donald Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. European leaders have voiced their solidarity with Ukraine in the wake of the disastrous summit, in which Trump said the Ukrainian leader was not -ready for peace- and accused him of -gambling with world war three-. European leaders have rallied behind Zelenskyy after the unprecedented exchange. The heads of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the European Council, Antonio Costa, were among the leaders who assured Zelenskyy of Europe’s support. -Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader,- said the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas. German chancellor Olaf Scholz said: -Ukraine can rely on Germany – and on Europe.- French president Emmanuel Macron said: -Russia is the aggressor and Ukraine is the aggressed people.- A spokesperson for UK prime minister Keir Starmer said: -He retains his unwavering support for Ukraine.- Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán stood out in Europe for thanking Trump for having -stood bravely for peace-. Moscow, meanwhile, reacted with glee to the Trump-Zelenskyy clash, with former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev – now deputy head of Russia’s security council – saying on Telegram: -A brutal dressing down in the Oval Office.- In an interview with Fox news, Zelenskyy expressed regret that the Trump meeting became acrimonious but insisted their relationship could be salvaged. The Ukrainian leader defended himself, but also acknowledged the dispute was -not good for both sides-. Asked if he felt he owed the US president an apology, as many of Trump’s Republican allies have demanded, Zelenskyy did not directly answer, saying instead: -I think that we have to be very open and very honest. And I’m not sure that we did something bad.- US secretary of state Marco Rubio called on Zelenskyy to apologise after the disastrous exchange, while questioning whether the Ukrainian leader really wanted a peace deal. Zelenskyy should -apologise for turning this thing into the fiasco for him that it became-, Rubio told CNN. -There was no need for him to go in there and become antagonistic.- The Trump administration is considering ending all ongoing shipments of military aid to Ukraine after the Oval Office meeting, according to a report. The decision, if taken, would apply to billions of dollars of radars, vehicles, ammunition and missiles awaiting shipment to Ukraine through the presidential drawdown authority, the Washington Post reports, citing a senior US official. US Democratic lawmakers came to Zelenskyy’s defence, condemning Trump and Vance’s -shameful- and -disgraceful- treatment of the Ukrainian leader. But Trump’s Republican colleagues described the Oval Office exchange as evidence that the president was -putting America first-. US senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, who was once among the most outspoken advocates for supporting the Ukraine war effort, called on Zelenskyy to resign. A Russian drone strike on a medical facility and other targets in Kharkiv late on Friday injured at least five people, according to local officials. Regional governor Oleh Syniehubov said eight drones hit civilian areas in three central districts of Ukraine’s second largest city. More than 50 people were evacuated from the medical facility and emergency crews were bringing a fire triggered by the strike under control, he said. Dozens of buildings were damaged.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/mar/01/live-european-leaders-rally-behind-zelenskyy-after-trump-vance-clash-updates	2025-02-28T22:53:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/762c41c53d0bef46ae2f32744fbe359f74be911e/0_206_7451_4473/master/7451.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=55082309b73a0b76e0c6bb09d8cdf42a

Gunshots and a surge of panic: footage shows last moments of boy, 12, killed in the West Bank	Two children a week are killed in the West Bank. Two cameras recorded the circumstances of one such death The last time Nassar al-Hammouni talked to his son, Ayman, it was by telephone and the 12-year-old was overflowing with plans for the coming weekend, and for the rest of his life. He had joined a local football team and planned to register at a karate club that weekend. When he grew up, he told Nassar, he was going to become a doctor, or better still an engineer to help his father in the construction job that took him away from their home in Hebron every week. None of that – the football, the karate or his imagined future career – will happen now. Last Friday, two days after the call to his father, Ayman was killed, shot by Israeli fire, video footage seen by the Guardian suggests.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/01/footage-shows-last-moments-boy-12-killed-in-west-bank	2025-02-28T21:00:29-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be4cd3e63a8d4a045624574ea5a7198477afabff/0_82_665_399/master/665.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bcf395f4496782a22e1075f8e4d9e90a

Sex 20 times a week? New study identifies four types of romantic lover	Australian research is ‘first to empirically show that we don’t all love the same’, lead author says New research has identified four types of romantic lover, including one that has sex up to 20 times a week. The research, published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences, categorised lovers as mild romantic, moderate romantic, intense romantic, and libidinous romantic. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Mild: About one in five – 20.02% – fell into this cluster, characterised by -the lowest intensity, lowest obsessive thinking, lowest commitment, and lowest frequency of sex-. This group also had the lowest proportion of people who thought their partner was -definitely- in love with them – just 25.31% – and the lowest proportion having sex, at 82.72%. Moderate: About four in 10 – 40.91% – landed in this category, which Bode described as -fairly stock-standard- – or in the words of the journal article, -entirely unremarkable-. Those in this category were more likely to be male, and less likely to have children. This group had -relatively low intensity, relatively low obsessive thinking, relatively high commitment, and relatively moderate frequency of sex-. Intense: This category described about one in three – 29.42% – of survey respondents, who Bode described as -crazy in-love- types. They were characterised by -the highest intensity, highest obsessive thinking, highest commitment, and relatively high frequency of sex-. About six in 10 people in this group were female. Libidinous: About one in 10 – 9.64% – were libidinous romantic lovers, who had sex an average of 10 times a week and up to 20 times. They were characterised as -relatively high intensity, relatively high obsessive thinking, relatively high commitment, and exceptionally high frequency of sex-.

Second US company recalls pet food as bird flu spreads to cats through tainted meat	Cats in two states tested positive after eating raw food from Wild Coast Raw, which issued voluntary recall As the bird flu outbreak continues gaining force in the US, a second company selling raw pet food issued a voluntary recall after cats from two different households in Oregon contracted H5N1 from the tainted meat earlier this month. Two more cats in different households in Washington state have tested positive for bird flu after eating the same brand of raw pet food nearly two weeks after the recall, officials announced on Wednesday. One cat was euthanized, while the other remains under veterinary care.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/cats-bird-flu	2025-02-28T04:00:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4d1af90c526fbbf252584ab9f6781a3d4520ef1/0_167_5004_3002/master/5004.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fc5ae8725e70759fe97219498138b06e

Labor unions cheer court ruling that blocked Trump’s mass firings – US politics live	Lawyers for the unions hail ruling as ‘important initial victory’ An official at the Health and Human Services agency (HHS) has criticised Robert F Kennedy’s failure to address a measles outbreak in Texas which has led to the first recorded measles death in the US since 2015. Speaking to NBC News anonymously, the official told the news network Kennedy has done nothing about the outbreak, observing: -It’s almost like he’s still in campaign-mode rather than realizing he’s head of a large agency and workforce.- The Trump administration has fired hundreds of workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the US’s pre-eminent climate research agency. The Trump administration has taken down the online application form for several popular student debt repayment plans, causing confusion among borrowers and likely creating complications for millions of Americans with outstanding loans. The US justice department has released additional files related to the late disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Starmer’s Trump meeting ‘spectacular success’, says Streeting, as Tories dismiss president’s backing for Chagos deal – UK politics live	Health secretary hails talks over defence, security and trade as Badenoch says her party will continue to oppose Chagos deal Good morning. Keir Starmer is back in the UK and, in the unlikely event that he goes into a newsagent’s this morning, he will find that his meeting with President Trump in the White House has secured him perhaps the most favourable press coverage he has had since the general election. Gloria De Piero, the broadcaster and former Labour MP, has the headlines laid out here. Of course, the success of a government should never be judged by what the national newspapers are saying about it (few other performance indicators are less reliable), but after months of relentlessly critical press coverage, Starmer will be grateful for a spot of respite. I thought that the meeting yesterday was a spectacular success both on the defence and security issues that President Trump and our prime minister were discussing but also on the enthusiasm President Trump showed for a deeper trading relationship.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/28/keir-starmer-donald-trump-kemi-badenoch-uk-politics-live	2025-02-28T01:49:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6536a516c3053353997f79a2f9eadd014807f664/759_293_6719_4032/master/6719.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=414dd813a7351c654a59ba7a575e9721

Zelenskyy expected to sign minerals deal with US during Trump talks – Europe live	Key details of agreement yet to be made public but US president has resisted agreeing to provide security guarantees If you want to catch up on the key developments from last night’s meeting between Trump and Starmer, our global affairs correspondent Andrew Roth has this helpful summary for you. Keir Starmer’s meeting with Donald Trump this week comes at a crucial moment for the war in Ukraine and the future of the Nato alliance. Europe is looking for leaders who can engage Trump on the future of the continent as the US leader appears more inclined to demand tribute from his allies and cosy up to Vladimir Putin. Can the -special relationship- between the US and the UK save the day? Or has the era of transatlantic cooperation ended in the era of -America first-? Starmer has already established a friendly rapport with Trump and comes bearing promises to raise defense spending and negotiate on trade, but can that overcome Trump’s impulse to abandon Europe and strike a deal with Russia to end the war as quickly as possible?	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/28/volodymyr-zelenskyy-donald-trump-us-minerals-deal-russia-ukraine-live-news	2025-02-28T00:15:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0aced75232507ee480b215c2d092c4001591fe3/0_149_4418_2651/master/4418.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d4f67004122736f48a426912ad508d5f

Millions of immigrants to be surveilled under Trump, largest US immigration contractor says	Geo Group, an Ice partner, is moving at ‘unprecedented speed’ to build out its monitoring, executive chair says The Geo Group, the largest single private contractor to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), said it is building out its surveillance business to be able to monitor hundreds of thousands or millions more immigrants than it already does. The Geo Group, a private prison corporation and parent company of BI Inc, has contracted with Ice for nearly 20 years to manage the agency’s electronic monitoring program. It currently tracks approximately 186,000 immigrants using devices such as ankle monitors, smart watches and a facial recognition app, according to public Ice data.

The remarks were made during the company’s fourth quarter earnings call on Thursday morning.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/27/migrant-surveillance-trump	2025-02-27T12:44:13-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45314a196ef7e276f0578f19fdd6c3f161c91442/0_166_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=508184060a2e146e723c9c0ec4190350

DoorDash to repay $16.75m in pocketed tips to New York delivery workers	Delivery app claimed that 100% of tips went to ‘dashers’ but instead used them to subsidize workers’ base salary The delivery platform DoorDash is paying $16.75m to settle an investigation conducted by New York authorities that charged the company with using tips from customers to subsidize workers’ base pay. Between May 2017 and September 2019, DoorDash used a guaranteed pay model to show delivery workers how much they would make before accepting a delivery.

Australia news live: former ADF chief warns nuclear power plants could be war targets; Greens unveil arts policy	Ukraine war shows nuclear plants a priority target during conflict, experts say. Follow today’s news live Australian nuclear reactors could become a target of war if the federal coalition was to go ahead with plans to build them, AAP reports. The Australian Security Leaders Climate Group, a group of former defence leaders, has warned that the plan to build seven small nuclear reactors across five states on the sites of coal-fired stations could leave Australia vulnerable to missile warfare and sabotage. Every nuclear power facility is a potential dirty bomb because rupture of containment facilities can cause devastating damage. With the proposed power stations all located within a 100 kilometres of the coast, they are a clear and accessible target. Australia would be no different.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/feb/28/australia-news-live-creative-australia-adrian-collette-greens-election-cost-of-living-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-ntwnfb	2025-02-27T12:04:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a65acb146c5bce284a8d2a28fffcacb8eaf98cc/0_220_7233_4340/master/7233.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c65f94af6697ffdc8d8d2a896ce5851c

Trump and California don’t see eye to eye, but critique of high-speed train has many on board	Dream of going from LA to San Francisco in three hours is past deadline, over budget, and after 16 years, incomplete Californians know their state is a punching bag for Donald Trump’s administration, a -paradise lost- that the president intends to wrest back from the -radical left lunatics-. But when Trump took aim at the state’s much-delayed high-speed rail project earlier this month, saying it was -the worst managed project- he’d ever seen, some of those leftwingers – and more moderate voters – found themselves in the unusual position of conceding he might have a point. California’s beautiful dream of a bullet train whisking passengers from Los Angeles to San Francisco in less than three hours has been more than 16 years in the making, approved by voters but dogged by so many delays, broken deadlines and cost overruns that it has only just reached the initial stages of laying down track.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/27/trump-california-high-speed-rail	2025-02-27T08:00:30-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e734dffd84ea9cb5add60740f163e3bcfb6f99c/0_354_5298_3178/master/5298.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=48adaafe17eb6a6952dd10ed3a38e949

Republicans terrified of crossing Trump due to physical threats, Democrat says	Eric Swalwell says threats to them and their families are stopping GOP officials from criticizing president Republicans on Capitol Hill are shying away from criticizing Donald Trump’s policies over fears for their physical safety and that of their families, a Democratic member of Congress has said. Eric Swalwell, a Democratic representative from California, said his Republican colleagues were -terrified- of crossing Trump not only because of the negative impact on their political careers, but also from anxiety that it might provoke physical threats that could cause personal upheaval and require them to hire round-the-clock security as protection.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/27/republicans-trump-threats	2025-02-27T03:00:44-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c9dc22ea5c69b9cefd75b93a8e761fc7621a6e0/0_113_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dcef60766cf43311dbf5616273648347

Supreme court backs Trump over holding back $1.5bn in USAid cash – US politics live	Stay of lower court ruling comes as Trump administration said it is eliminating $60bn worth of US assistance around the world The US supreme court has backed the Trump administration in an action over payments due by the US Agency for International Development (USAid), with chief justice John Roberts issuing an -administrative stay- that means the $1.5bn worth of payments can still be delayed. Donald Trump had ordered the payments to be stopped, but a federal judge had set a deadline for the agencies to release funds for work already carried out. Roberts responded to an emergency appeal by the administration by allowing the payments freeze to continue. Thousands of US Agency for International Development (USAid) workers who have been fired or placed on leave as part of the Trump administration’s dismantling of the agency are being given a brief window Thursday and Friday to clear out their workspaces. The Trump administration said it is eliminating more than 90% of USAid contracts and $60bn in overall US assistance around the world. The supreme court hasbriefly paused a lower court’s ruling ordering the administration to pay for $1.5bn of work already carried out. Trump used the first full cabinet meeting of his second term to emphasize his administration’s focus on drastically reducing the size of the federal government, and signed an executive order expanding the power of Elon Musk’s Doge -agency-. Trump may be pursuing a mineral rights deal with Vladimir Putin and Russia as well as with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Ukraine, a top Senate Democrat has warned.

Trump says US will make Europe provide security guarantees to Ukraine ahead of Starmer meeting – UK politics live	Starmer said he wants Trump to agree that, in the event of a peace settlement in Ukraine, US will offer security guarantees that make it durable Good morning. Keir Starmer is in Washington where later today he will have his first meeting with President Trump since the inauguration. With Trump aligning with Moscow even more explicitly than he did during his first administration, and threatening to wind down the Nato guarantees that have underpinned the security of western Europe since the second world war, the stakes could not be higher. Starmer, despite leading a party whose activists mostly loathe Trump and everything he represents, has managed to establish a warm relationship with the president and today will give some clues as to what extent he can sustain that, and protect the UK from the tariff warfare that Trump is threatening to unleash on the EU. But Starmer is one of three European leaders in Washington this week (Emmanuel Macron was there on Monday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy is there tomorrow) and today’s meeting is also part of a wider story about the fracturing of the US/Europe alliance. It is definitely in trouble; but what is not yet clear is whether after four years of Trump it will still be functioning effectively. Starmer spoke to reporters on his flight to the US yesterday. Pippa Crerar, the Guardian’s political editor, was on the plane and, as she reports, Starmer said he wants Trump to agree that, in the event of a peace settlement in Ukraine, the US will offer security guarantees that will make it durable. He has already said that Britain would contribute troops to a European so-called -tripwire- peace-keeping force, there to defend Ukraine and deter Russia. But European soldiers would need US air and logistical support to be effective, and Starmer is looking for assurances on this topic. I’m not going to make security guarantees beyond very much. We’re going to have Europe do that.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/27/keir-starmer-donald-trump-white-house-ukraine-uk-politics-live-news	2025-02-27T01:32:49-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9afac33b0bc37a566d1bb18e5f06d497272eb4e/0_0_7986_4794/master/7986.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5fd10bd2c1efdfeef47e91e256566424

Trump executive order targets payments and travel after reporters barred from cabinet meeting – as it happened	This blog is now closed. You can read our latest story here There has been reaction to Trump’s proposal for a -gold card- for wealthy foreigners (post 11.14am) which would give them the right to live and work in the US as well as a route to citizenship in exchange for a $5million fee. Immigration and wealth advisers have said the proposed initiative is unlikely to trigger a major inflow of wealthy global investors seeking US citizenship because of concerns over higher taxes, Reuters reports. I do not believe that the current POTUS offer will have a big impact, as getting a green card in the US if you meet certain criteria, is not difficult. Paying $5 million for a golden visa and getting taxed on your global income defeats the purpose.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/feb/26/donald-trump-mike-johnson-republicans-democrats-spending-bill-elon-musk-doge-us-politics-news-live	2025-02-26T18:49:02-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a3ab29d4f9c03b91e9f47711b52e0cef7e6520e/82_0_5147_3088/master/5147.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f57f80b5d580131582f75b9c67e97050
