Anti-Maduro campaign ‘stronger than ever’ after Venezuelan election, says Machado	Opposition leader María Corina Machado said exile of key figure Edmundo González ‘changes absolutely nothing’ The Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has insisted the campaign to end Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian rule is -stronger than ever-, but the banishing of one of its key figures to Spain has thrown many supporters off balance. Edmundo González, who the US and other countries have recognised as the winner of Venezuela’s 28 July presidential election, flew into exile on Sunday after several weeks holed up in the Dutch ambassador’s residence in Caracas. An arrest warrant, seemingly designed to force the retired diplomat to flee, had been issued a week earlier.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/anti-maduro-campaign-venezuela-machado-gonzales	2024-09-09T12:05:59-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70e1a5aa20424514ffe943b55e6b84d6ee79ef41/0_0_5173_3105/master/5173.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c604ed0bd9ddb2e98da46d9cab5dd12

Weather tracker: Francine looking likely to be next Atlantic hurricane	An area of low pressure in the Gulf of Mexico is moving landward, and is expected to bring intense rainfall Francine could soon be the next to be ticked off the list of Atlantic hurricane storm names this week. On Friday, a broad area of low pressure emerged in the Gulf of Mexico, designated as Invest 91L. An -invest- – a shorthand for -investigative area- – refers to a region of atmospheric disturbance, characterised by low pressure and thunderstorms, and is closely monitored for its potential to evolve into a tropical cyclone. Invest 91L is anticipated to encounter more favourable environmental conditions as it progresses northward over the coming days, meandering along the eastern coasts of Mexico and Texas. The National Hurricane Center has now labelled this as a potential tropical cyclone, and it is expected to reach hurricane status before reaching the Gulf coast of the US. It advises that hurricane and storm surge watches will probably be issued on Monday for coastal parts of Texas and Louisiana, with the impacts expected to be felt from Tuesday night.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/weather-tracker-francine-likely-atlantic-hurricane	2024-09-09T01:29:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24cc1827e84491c0c221ac628bc03071cdb1fd63/0_52_3168_1900/master/3168.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1a9b1687edb0a93e205a820382e25175

How China and a tariffs row cast a shadow over the US’s booming solar power	The source of new renewable energy is also a battleground over China’s cheap exports of panels that has split US firms The Biden administration touts solar energy as one of its big success stories, a booming new industry that is curbing the effects of the climate crisis and creating high-paying jobs across the country. But the more complicated truth is that the United States is mired in a long-running trade war with China, which is flooding the market with artificially cheap solar panels that carry an uncomfortably large carbon footprint and threaten to obliterate the domestic industry. The price of solar panels has plummeted 50% over the past year, largely, industry insiders say, because of deliberate Chinese overproduction of key components and a game of international cat-and-mouse over trade rules often likened to a game of -whack-a-mole-. As different sets of rules get established, Chinese companies have proved adept at moving their manufacturing plants to other countries, in south-east Asia, and shifting strategies to work around US tariffs and other deterrent measures.	https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/sep/10/solar-power-china-tariffs	2024-09-10T03:00:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2334c6c770c557478badec40d334f664cccd724b/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ee31afdb45a6e242cbf72220f2826a1a

Many burnt-out buildings showed signs of fierce fighting, the upper floors now peppered with bullet holes and broken windows. Water and electricity infrastructure was severely damaged, and it is not clear when these services will be restored.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/10/jenin-west-bank-normality-idf-israel-deadly-raids	2024-09-09T21:00:38-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5248d890eb52522c284331a36c4bce089aea6e93/0_550_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=230386181c3f9f91148258fa49a29798

Plus, inside the global organ trade Good morning. At 9pm EST tonight, on a debate stage in Philadelphia, weeks of rigorous preparation and breathless analysis will be road-tested with reality, as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump go head-to-head in their first presidential debate. What do the polls say?
