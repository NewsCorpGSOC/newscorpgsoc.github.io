The market is pricing in an 84% chance of a 25 basis-point rate cut when the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) meets mid-next month, although those odds will rise or fall based on the December quarterly consumer price index.

Middle East crisis live: Netanyahu planning to meet Trump next week as US president repeats aim to move Palestinians from Gaza	Israeli prime minister could visit White House as soon as next week, making him the first foreign leader to meet Trump since his inauguration Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the latest events in the Middle East. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is planning to meet US President Donald Trump in Washington as early as next week, according to reports, as hundreds of thousands of Palestinian people made their way back into northern Gaza on Monday. US secretary of state Marco Rubio held a call with Jordan’s King Abdullah on Monday, two days after a suggestion by Donald Trump that Jordan and Egypt should take more Palestinians from Gaza. -The Secretary and King Abdullah discussed implementation of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, the release of hostages, and creating a pathway for security and stability in the region,- the state department said in a statement. Trump’s weekend remarks were not mentioned. Lebanese officials say firing by Israeli troops has killed two people and injured 17 in the second day of deadly protests in southern Lebanon. Residents displaced by the 14-month war between Israel and Hezbollah on Monday again attempted to return to villages where Israeli troops remain. On Sunday, 24 people were killed and more than 130 injured when Israeli troops fired at protesters. Israel said on Monday that it had arrested two Israelis suspected of spying for Iran, including one accused of handing the country classified information obtained during his military service. Tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem were set to lose education, healthcare and other services provided by UN agency Unrwa as an Israeli ban on the organisation takes effect on Thursday. Eight of the 26 hostages yet to be released under the first phase of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas are dead, Israel has confirmed. A Hamas delegation has arrived in Cairo to discuss the implementation of the Gaza ceasefire deal, the group said in a statement. The EU’s foreign ministers have agreed to a -roadmap- to ease current sanctions on Syria, a move welcomed by the country’s government.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/28/israel-gaza-netanyahu-trump-hamas-palestinians-middle-east-latest-live-news	2025-01-27T23:33:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64dff35b74022795939d2f256cd5875dbb0fbc4e/0_62_3360_2016/master/3360.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9c64645370c6e3fa95d70b4b52f99896
Tuesday briefing: How an unknown Chinese startup wiped $593bn from the value of an AI giant	In today’s newsletter: the US had a huge head start on artificial intelligence – but now a low-cost rival from Hangzhou has turned the industry on its head Good morning. Since the emergence of ChatGPT, OpenAI’s groundbreaking artificial intelligence tool, American companies have appeared to have a huge head start in the development of the most significant technology of its generation. But now a small Chinese rival has emerged that appears to match what OpenAI and the other US giants can do at a much lower cost, and without the same hunger for computing power that has made the chip manufacturer Nvidia the most valuable company in the world. The result was a stunning collapse in the value of Big Tech stocks yesterday – and a $593bn fall in the value of Nvidia, the biggest in the US stock market’s history. Gaza ceasefire | Tens of thousands of Palestinians flooded back into northern Gaza on Monday after Israel opened military checkpoints that had divided the strip for more than a year, ending a forced exile from homes and loved ones that many feared could become permanent. UK security | Hindu nationalism, misogyny and the -manosphere- have been identified as breeding grounds for extremism in a leaked government report commissioned after last summer’s riots. The -rapid analytical sprint- also dismissed claims of -two-tier policing- as a -rightwing extremist narrative-. Auschwitz | Elderly former inmates of Auschwitz gathered for perhaps the final time on the 80th anniversary of the concentration camp’s liberation. In remarks at the event, four survivors warned world leaders against the danger of rising antisemitism. Roman Abramovich | An offshore scheme appears to have helped companies owned by the billionaire Roman Abramovich avoid duties potentially amounting to tens of millions of dollars. Abramovich’s lawyers denied he had knowledge of or was personally responsible for any alleged tax evasion. Local government | Bristol city council could become the first local authority in England to collect black rubbish bins only once every four weeks.

How Australia’s ‘unfair’ dental system – and the way $1.3bn is spent – is driving inequality and leaving millions of people behind	Half of all government spending on dental care goes to private insurance rebates – meaning those without often skip treatment until things get worse Patients bear the brunt of dentist fees. But of the $1.3bn the federal government spends on the nation’s teeth, more than half goes to subsidising the uptake of private health insurance. The inequality of Australia’s dental care system can be seen in the numbers, says Peter Breadon, the health program director at the Grattan Institute.

That is not a question limited to California, or to the United States: the insurance industry has rated the climate crisis as the biggest threat to its future four years in a row, a very concrete riposte to those politicians who continue to question the reality of global heating. It is impossible to know whether a specific weather event like storm Éowyn in the UK has been caused by climate change – but we know that they, and the damage they leave in their wake, are only going to get more frequent. Israel-Gaza war | Donald Trump’s proposal that large numbers of Palestinians should leave Gaza to -just clean out- the whole strip has been rejected by US allies in the region. Trump’s intervention came as a deal was reached to allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza and release a civilian hostage who Israel said should have been freed already. Heathrow | Rachel Reeves has given her heaviest hint yet that she will back a third runway at Heathrow airport, arguing that she is willing to make difficult decisions while pursuing economic growth. Campaigners have warned that the move would be a severe setback for the UK’s climate commitments. Southport attack | Prevent’s assessment of the danger posed by Axel Rudakubana followed policy at the time, an official review will find – but it will criticise the scheme for rejecting extra help to tackle his interest in violence. The review of the way three referrals were handled before Rudakubana committed an atrocity in Southport is due to be published this week.

The US and the EU said in the run-up to the election that it could not be free or fair because independent media are banned and all leading opposition figures have been jailed or forced to flee abroad.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/27/monday-briefing-will-the-climate-crisis-kill-off-disaster-insurance	2025-01-26T22:51:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03add73c9b2af5547f821b444886c401681ebea9/0_431_7914_4749/master/7914.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=15f15fd168fde2e4ce4975bea0ff8a4a

Workers who were considered to be on the frontline during the pandemic have seen no change to their working hours or shift patterns in recent years, according to research by Timewise, a social enterprise that helps businesses with flexible working policies.

Middle East live: Palestinians start to return to homes in north Gaza after Israeli hostage deal reached	Israel said it would stop blocking Palestinians from travelling north after agreement reached with Hamas on release of Israeli civilian Arbel Yehoud Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Middle East. Displaced Palestinians are expected to begin returning to their homes in northern Gaza on Monday, two days later than scheduled, after an agreement was reached between Israel and Hamas to release a civilian Israeli hostage. Israeli forces opened fire on people trying to return to their homes, killing at least 22 people, including a Lebanese soldier and six women, and injuring 124 amid a dispute with Lebanon over a ceasefire agreement. Israel said it would not allow civilians to return to southern Lebanon, and accused the Lebanese army of violating key commitments under the ceasefire deal. Videos showed tense face-offs between Israeli soldiers and tanks and Lebanese crowds waving banners and chanting slogans. The White House said late on Sunday that Israel and Lebanon had agreed to extend the deadline for Israeli troops to depart southern Lebanon until 18 February. Israeli prime minister Netanyahu said on Friday that the Lebanese state had not yet -fully enforced- a deal to secure the south, meant to ensure that Hezbollah withdrew beyond the Litani River. -To ‘clean’ Gaza immediately after the war would in fact be a continuation of the war, through the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people,- said Hassan Jabareen, the director of Palestinian rights group Adalah. Omer Shatz, a lecturer in international law at Sciences Po Paris and international criminal court (ICC) counsel, said Trump’s comments were a -call for ethnic cleansing- that echoed calls from extremist Israeli politicians and public figures dating to the start of the war. The US president had said Palestinians could move to countries including Jordan, which already hosts more than 2.7 million Palestinian refugees, and Egypt. -I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing at a different location where they can maybe live in peace for a change,- Trump told reporters on Air Force One. -You’re talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing and say: ‘You know, it’s over.’-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/27/middle-east-live-israel-palestinians-gaza-return-hostage-deal	2025-01-26T21:23:57-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9717d811a094a62121d4330ae7a7ffcf25495566/0_0_8064_4838/master/8064.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=216157cdf94d97c5b4ef80914283038b

Australia news live: Minns condemns vandalism of NSW police monument; Victorians brace for searing heat	Police launch investigation over defacement of wall of remembrance in the Domain. Follow today’s news live Peter Dutton says Holocaust education an important mission In his statement for International Holocaust Day, Peter Dutton, the opposition leader, drew parallels between current anti-semitism and the Holocaust. The weight of history will be especially felt by survivors and their families this International Holocaust Remembrance Day with 2025 marking the 80th Anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau. In the magnitude of anti-Semitism which is plaguing Western democracies today – including Australia – many citizens who have read about the history and horrors of the Holocaust have, for the first time, grasped how that catastrophe eventuated. They have seen, with their own eyes, a type of hate that, if left unchecked, unleashes greater evils. Educating Australians about atrocities of the Holocaust and the October 7 attacks is an important mission that deserves support. By gaining awareness of the persecution and atrocities committed against Jews, Australians will have a better understanding of why there is no place for antisemitism in our community. It was a pitiless and unrelenting act of cruelty that was long in the planning, cold in its calculation, and carried out on a scale that falls across the decades like a terrible shadow. The devastation felt when witnessing the horror, destruction and brutality inflicted by Hamas on October 7 is reminiscent of the dark and painful stories of the past. For the Australian Jewish community, those are the stories of their families. We embraced the Jewish community then, and we embrace you now. Tragically, we are not yet free of antisemitism. It stands in vile opposition to all we are as a nation and all that we have built - together - over generations. We will not tolerate it in any form. It has no place in our nation, and we will combat it with the full force of our laws and with total commitment from every level of government.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/jan/27/australia-news-live-chris-minns-police-victoria-melbourne-heatwave-antisemitism-holocaust-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-election-campaign	2025-01-26T12:36:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4df95bbd39d6732418f9ce4664dad230b74cdf77/612_45_2959_1775/master/2959.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=de858cb9e0b9306e309c79e90c8d7e4a

The framing of the shrew: California students photograph mammal never caught on film	Three young scientists set traps to capture and film species of special concern in move that can help conserve the shrew In a 7,000ft-high marshy spot in the cold, rugged eastern Sierra mountains, two groups of mammals scurried around at night. One was going about their normal nocturnal routine of hunting worms. The other was hoping for a glimpse of an elusive creature: the Mount Lyell shrew, the only known California mammal never photographed alive. The three young student scientists faced a tight timeline. They baited 150 pitfall traps – small cups dug into the earth to catch wandering creatures – with cat food and mealworms and monitored them across a 600ft area, checking each trap every two hours for any signs of their goal. They slept no more than two hours at a time. Shrews have such a fast metabolism that they die in traps quickly, one of the reasons this species had never been photographed or studied live.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/26/mount-lyell-shrew-california-photograph	2025-01-26T09:43:13-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/290d1f56a6b048b829ce818933cd13f74e098059/0_731_2914_1749/master/2914.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5890e19466a34d400bc20d7cb73033f1

Nearly two-thirds of Britons say very rich have too much influence on politics	Opinium survey of 2,000 adults found concern about the impact of growing wealth inequality in the UK Growing wealth inequality is increasing the risk of societal ­collapse, according to a new Fairness Foundation report that shows nearly two-thirds of Britons are concerned about the political influence of very rich people. People losing faith with democracy, economic shocks and environmental breakdowns are some of the potential triggers for a decline or collapse in social cohesion, the thinktank said. One warning sign of democracy being undermined is a lack of public trust in institutions, so it commissioned a survey of 2,000 adults by Opinium, which found 63% believe the very rich have too much influence on UK politics, ­compared to 40% for businesses and ­religious organisations, and 38% for ­international organisations, such as the EU and UN.	https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2025/jan/25/nearly-two-thirds-of-britons-say-very-rich-have-too-much-influence-on-politics	2025-01-25T08:23:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b190b7c4d605519a4c9b9425f9cd47b9c9ae251/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25b46cf185d4a9de713cdd02e94c9dcf

Inquest exposes poor leadership, insufficient testing at aged care home that saw 19 Covid deaths in 2020	Deadly wave of Covid that hit Sydney’s Newmarch House made more severe by organisational failings, coroner says Some of the 19 deaths during a 2020 Covid-19 outbreak at a NSW aged-care home could have been avoided had proper testing for the virus been implemented, a coronial inquest has found. Poor leadership, insufficient communication and staff shortages were highlighted in coroner Derek Lee’s review of the deaths from a wave of the virus that swept through Sydney’s Newmarch House. If universal testing of staff had been performed once the outbreak had begun, and timelier reporting of results had allowed for cases of Covid-19 to be identified more readily, it would likely have reduced the extent and severity of the outbreak; Frontline management at Newmarch House did not clearly understand the chain of command and did not get effective support from Anglicare senior executives. -Consequently, Anglicare did not demonstrate adequate leadership and governance during the course of the outbreak-, Lee said; There was a lack of clarity at Newmarch House as to who, if anyone, bore ultimate responsibility for clinical decision-making; Anglicare did not give residents’ families enough specific information about their loved one, and in some cases it was inaccurate or understated the seriousness of what was occurring; During the initial stages of the outbreak there was a -significant deficiency- in the number of staff available which -meant that infection control and the care provided to residents was gravely jeopardised-.

‘A hugely significant sighting’: red goshawk photographed for first time in central Australia	Bird snapped by Newhaven wildlife sanctuary ecologist is likely a juvenile on risky 1,500km journey away from parents, expert says Recent wet weather in the arid plains of central Australia prompted the wildlife ecologist and bird enthusiast Dr Tim Henderson to stop last week at a small lake to see if any waterbirds had shown up.

Nato chief urges ‘step up’ in support for Ukraine	Vladimir Putin victory would lead to bloc’s members spending ‘trillions’ more on defence, says Mark Rutte The head of the Nato military alliance has called for a -step up- in support for Ukraine, to put Kyiv in the strongest position to achieve a sustainable peace deal with Russia. Speaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mark Rutte warned against scaling back support for Ukraine, saying it was essential to -change the trajectory of the war-.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/23/nato-chief-ukraine-russia-vladimir-putin-mark-rutte	2025-01-23T01:38:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81099f73797bb4dc3eb6f0a04caafbade4eabf43/0_208_5120_3074/master/5120.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=14c56f2ccd3368bfc9fd762890dfe441
UK will not accept EU offer to join pan-European customs union ‘at present time’, minister says – UK politics live	Housing minister shoots down idea floated by Maroš Šefčovič designed to help reset UK-EU discussions Good morning. The government is obsessed with finding any levers it can that might promote growth. At Davos yesterday Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, was asked if growth was even more important than promoting net zero, and she replied: -Well if [growth is] the number one mission it’s obviously the most important thing.- Today the government is announcing potentially significant plans that could limit the scope of judicial review applications to hold back growth. Pippa Crerar, Kiran Stacey and Sandra Laville have the details here. Economists argue that an obvious move to promote growth would be to have close trade links with the EU. But the government has ruled out rejoining the single market or the custom union (let alone rejoining the EU proper – which is still largely a taboo proposal in most parts of UK politics). And today a minister has ruled out an EU proposal for the UK to join, not the customs union, but a customs union with the EU. Šefčovič referred to the idea of the UK joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM). These are common rules that allow parts, ingredients and materials for manufacturing supply chains to be sourced from across dozens of countries in Europe and North Africa to be used in tariff-free trade. We’re not seeking to participate in that particular arrangement. I think in general the government’s been very clear … we do want a closer relationship with our European partners, both in trading terms, but also, importantly … in terms of security and defense cooperation, where we need to work far more closely. So absolutely, yes, we do want a closer relationship.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/23/keir-starmer-eu-sadiq-khan-latest-live-politics-news	2025-01-23T01:28:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9bddca2b2830e514cc80df9cdacbccd2233cb74/0_98_5552_3331/master/5552.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9267462122b06c19f2bbf9085fa48f19
Trump suggests it was a mistake for Biden not to pardon himself – US politics live	US president says his predecessor gave ‘everybody pardons’ but says it is a ‘sad thing’ he didn’t give himself one Donald Trump has described attacks on police officers at the US Capitol on January 6 2021 as -very minor incidents- as he sought to defend his decision to pardon the insurrectionists. The US president hinted that those who put him through -four years of hell- via criminal prosecutions should themselves be investigated, adding ominously that his predecessor, Joe Biden, made a mistake by not pardoning himself. Most of the people were absolutely innocent. OK. But forgetting all about that, these people have served, horribly, a long time. It would be very, very cumbersome to go and look – you know how many people we’re talking about? 1,500 people.- This guy went around giving everybody pardons. And you know, the funny thing, maybe the sad thing, is he didn’t give himself a pardon. And if you look at it, it all had to do with him.- Joe Biden has very bad advisers. Somebody advised Joe Biden to give pardons to everybody but him.- Donald Trump has described attacks on police officers at the US Capitol on January 6 2021 as -very minor incidents- as he sought to defend his decision to pardon the insurrectionists. Those pardoned include more than 250 people who were convicted of assault charges, some having attacked police with makeshift weapons such as flagpoles, a hockey stick and a crutch. Trump also used the prime-time Fox News interview to discuss his barrage of executive orders, dismiss security concerns over Chinese-owned app TikTok (-Is it that important for China to be spying on young people, on young kids watching crazy videos?-) and discuss the possibility of cutting off federal funds to so-called -sanctuary cities- that shield undocumented immigrants from federal detention requests. On Thursday, Trump will speak remotely at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, delivering his first major speech to global business and political leaders. He is due to give a speech and engage in a dialogue at 11am US Eastern Time (4pm GMT), according to the meeting schedule. It is not clear what he will discuss. The new US presidential envoy for special missions has pushed back against Nato chief, Mark Rutte’s talk at the World Economic Forum about Ukraine joining Nato, pointing out many members of the alliance aren’t paying their -fair share- already. Richard Grenell, appointed by Trump in December, said it is -pretty shocking- that so many foreign ministers in Europe, and so many US politicians, did not try to stop the Russia-Ukraine war, and criticised Biden’s handling of the situation.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/23/donald-trump-pardons-january-6-us-president-joe-biden-jd-vance-republicans-live-news	2025-01-23T00:42:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5fcf45c541301d81dc486432ff09d991a9e5b5f/196_30_1282_769/master/1282.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=db34cd3853a8542998b1b626bcb60c4f

Thursday briefing: With a new wave of violence, the West Bank is on edge	In today’s newsletter: As Israeli security forces launch an operation in the city of Jenin and violence by settlers escalates, Emma Graham-Harrison explains what happens next Good morning. A few days after a ceasefire brought at least temporary relief to Gaza, violence erupted in the occupied West Bank. On Tuesday, the Israeli military launched what was described as an extensive raid in the city of Jenin, a day after Israeli settlers attacked Palestinians, setting vehicles and property ablaze in a violent rampage that left at least one person dead. Two Israeli were arrested even though dozens of armed settlers were involved in the rioting. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, condemned the attacks, but it is evident that extremist settlers feel emboldened by government policies and ministers who back their agenda.

Rain and dangerous winds offer comfort and concern to fire-ravaged California	‘Critical fire conditions’ expected across region while much-needed rain raises fear of toxic ash runoff Parched southern California was forecast to face more dangerous winds on Wednesday but could get some needed rain this weekend, easing fears for another round of deadly wildfires while raising the possibility of challenges like toxic ash runoff.

Lengthy legal fight lands blow on Sun’s publisher but shows even princes have to settle	Duke of Sussex and Tom Watson hail ‘monumental victory’ after securing agreement with News Group Newspapers For Prince Harry it was a -monumental victory-; for publishers of the Sun it was an outcome -in the interest of all parties-. Regardless of either side’s take in the war of words which played out on Wednesday, it is clear that the settlement reached between Prince Harry and the Murdoch-owned News Group Newspapers (NGN) is a significant moment in the history of the British media. By late morning an apology from NGN – agreed by both parties as part of an historic settlement deal in a longrunning legal dispute between the Duke of Sussex and the Sun’s publisher – was read out in court. It was, as the veteran hacks of Fleet Street might say, a marmalade-dropper of a moment.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/22/lengthy-legal-fight-lands-blow-on-sun-publisher-but-shows-even-princes-have-to-settle	2025-01-22T09:13:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9140a7fff7aabfae3b85fdf2d5bc8229dcb2e89/0_262_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=aebcf1e792e17f2a1a2d76fb95c753a4

KemiKaze’s best PMQs so far leaves Starmer entirely unruffled | John Crace	The Tory leader managed to devote all six questions to one subject, even if it was one she didn’t know much about Who would have guessed? Kemi Badenoch may be a slow learner – a painfully slow learner – but she is at least a learner. This may be not much, but it is a lifeline. Possibly. Whether it comes too late is another matter. The latest ConservativeHome poll of party members shows Kemi tumbling down the popularity rankings. Immediately after the election she was well ahead of the rest of the shadow cabinet. Now she’s down to seventh. Even halfwits like Robert Jenrick, Laura Trott and Chris Philp are ahead of her. Imagine that. Most people would want to give up at that point. It seems the more you see of Kemi, the less there is of her to like.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/22/kemikazes-best-pmqs-by-far-leaves-starmer-entirely-unruffled	2025-01-22T08:39:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8eedb318994bacc9cb101acb7c84fa9b353db1a/1328_548_5662_3399/master/5662.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=441bc204b28fc788e0a3182919da8afd

The ban led to the protest being changed to a static rally, but the Met claimed people broke through police lines in a coordinated effort to breach the conditions.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/21/law-experts-demand-inquiry-into-met-policing-of-pro-palestine-protest	2025-01-21T11:03:29-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fd2c106ab9b4fb93fa746c0a58908b722e263cf/347_469_3654_2192/master/3654.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=61e2234eff40e2bfe83d2d218347fc93
Did Elon Musk give a Nazi or Roman salute, and what’s the difference?	The Roman salute, which one historian argues was invented in the 19th century, was adopted by Benito Mussolini The back-to-back gestures were swift and enthusiastic, and they elicited huge cheers from the crowd.

This is what Philp told Times Radio. I think it’s just important the inquiry looks at all of this, gets to the truth both about what happened beforehand, but critically also the government’s response afterwards, and what they knew when and whether they should have put more information into the public domain. It appears they withheld information about the perpetrator, potentially, on CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] advice.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/21/keir-starmer-southport-attack-labour-uk-politics-latest-news-updates	2025-01-21T00:21:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9154b4f97662079de3231fec085aa206026cab2a/2694_724_2768_1661/master/2768.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b5b3c0a3308fa68cb973870899b753f9

Trump inauguration live: president pardons January 6 rioters and exits Paris climate agreement in slew of executive orders	On his first day on office the US president sought to undo much of Joe Biden’s legacy, also vowing to ‘unleash’ oil and gas drilling and revoking birthright citizenship Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Donald Trump’s inauguration and first day in office. Immediately after his swearing-in ceremony on Monday the new US president set into motion a slew of executive orders seeking to make good on his campaign promises and undo the legacy of his predecessor Joe Biden, including the pardoning of January 6 defendant and a crackdown on immigration to the US. Trump pardoned about 1,500 January 6 defendants facing prosecution for their role in the 2021 storming of the US capitol. Among those pardoned is Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the Proud Boys, who was sentenced to 22 years in prison on seditious conspiracy charges. Trump also commuted the sentence of Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the Oath Keepers militia, who had been sentenced to 18 years in prison on sedition charges. He also signed an executive order seeking to revoke birthright citizenship – automatic citizenship for people born in the US – for the children of undocumented immigrants. Birthright citizenship is protected by the 14th amendment and the order will almost certainly be challenged in court. One order declared a -national emergency- at the southern border, paving the way to send US troops to the area and another that designated drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. He signed an executive order to, for a second time, withdraw the US from the Paris climate accords. He also declared a national energy emergency as part of a barrage of pro-fossil fuel actions and efforts to -unleash- already booming US energy production. Another order will remove the US from the World Health Organization (WHO). -World Health ripped us off, everybody rips off the United States. It’s not going to happen any more,- Trump said at the signing. The withdrawal of the US would dramatically cut funding from the global public health organization. He issued an executive order requiring federal agencies revoke the use of -gender- and -gender identity- and instead use a binary definition of -sex- in implementing policy – including in issuing passports, a move that LGBTQ+ rights groups have vowed to challenge in court. Another order reclassified thousands of federal employees as political hires, making it much easier for them to be fired. Key aides to Trump have called for mass government firings. Project 2025 made attacks on the deep or administrative state a core part of Trump’s second term. One order renamed the 617,800 sq mile Gulf of Mexico and Alaska’s 20,000ft Denali. The Gulf of Mexico will be renamed the Gulf of America, and Denali, the highest mountain in North America, will revert to Mount McKinley, which it was called before Barack Obama changed the name in 2015. The order will have no bearing on what names are used internationally. Trump also signed an executive order temporarily delaying the enforcement of a federal ban on TikTok for at least 75 days. -I guess I have a warm spot for TikTok that I didn’t have originally,- Trump said at the White House.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/21/donald-trump-inauguration-presidency-executive-orders-pardons-day-two-live-blog	2025-01-20T21:06:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cda7d9b277d8c23917d91e7d6e219ba656aa0705/0_34_4637_2783/master/4637.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c586e722261b4b85725e5119914c76b6

Not many, it was true, and those who appeared were armed only with Kalashnikov rifles and some rudimentary body armour, but they were there. In Khan Younis, a handful of pickup trucks with gunmen aboard drove through cheering crowds of young men. Dozens of uniformed fighters with Hamas headbands were visible when the three Israeli hostages were handed over in Gaza City.

Freezing rain dampens mood in Washington ahead of Trump’s inauguration – photo essay	Photographer Jordan Gale documents preparations for 60th presidential inauguration, showing a US poised and polarised between hope and fear Washington is a city on edge. Concrete barriers, unscalable steel fencing and security checkpoints dot the map. In a climate of simmering political violence, and after a divisive election campaign in which he survived two assassination attempts, Donald Trump is returning to an anxious capital where more than nine in 10 voters broke for his opponent, Kamala Harris. A city of tradition and ritual will seek to accommodate the most unconventional of presidents, bringing thousands of Trump’s supporters into direct contact with the residents who feel a sense of foreboding and dread. Trump will take the oath of office under the magnificent dome of the Capitol Rotunda on Monday due to forecasts of intense cold weather, upending months of meticulous planning for a massive outdoor event with crowds sprawling down the National Mall. The swearing-in was last moved indoors in 1985, when Ronald Reagan began his second term. The rotunda was one of the areas breached during the 6 January 2021 insurrection by supporters of Trump trying to block the certification of his 2020 defeat to Joe Biden.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/cold-washington-trump-inauguration-in-pictures	2025-01-20T05:03:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9928208a042f5de7f3ed7ba0563d3a00841f7ab5/0_372_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d80232f594721b29215a210e05e7f7ee

Has South Korea just witnessed its own January 6 moment?	Protesters who stormed a Seoul court at the weekend may not have worn animal skins, but the similarities are striking They arrived intent on causing mayhem. The political figurehead they supported had, they said, been the victim of a grave injustice at the hands of the establishment. The ringleaders had soon broken through security cordons, armed with fire extinguishers, steel pipes and police shields, smashing windows and gaining entry to a government building, leaving destruction worth an estimated £400,000 in their wake. The scene of the riot was not the US Capitol building on 6 January 2021, and the mobs attempting to overturn the rule of law had swapped animal skins and bald eagle masks for hooded down jackets and face masks. But the similarities between Maga ideologues’ attempts to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election, and the far-right protesters who stormed the Seoul Western district court building this weekend in support of the impeached South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, are hard to ignore.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/20/has-south-korea-just-witnessed-its-own-january-6-moment	2025-01-20T04:42:41-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2a6e7cce0737b6f9e49c28e95f364b84edfb5b1/0_398_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=011161c3ec07022572ec05c53efd8714

Alaska to resume ‘barbaric’ shooting of bears and wolves from helicopters	Renewed program would allow hunters to eliminate up to 80% of the animals on 20,000 acres of state land Alaska is set to resume the aerial gunning of bears and wolves as a population control measure aimed at boosting caribou and moose herd numbers, even as the state’s own evaluation of the practice cast doubt on its effectiveness. The renewed program would allow hunters to eliminate up to 80% of the animals on 20,000 acres of state land. Environmental groups opposed to what they label a -barbaric- practice of shooting wildlife from helicopters is more about sport than scientific practice in part because hunters want caribou populations to increase because they are trophy animals.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/alaska-aerial-gunning-bears-wolves	2025-01-20T04:00:01-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b54e773f36d682e29ee03ac6542d2ae3a33cb44d/109_715_2142_1285/master/2142.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1c0d86a4fb6dd411a622a0875b80e6b8

CNN defamation case foreshadows Trump media crackdown, experts say	Contractor Zachary Young wins damages over Afghanistan story in trial notable for prosecution’s aggressive stance A combative defamation trial in Florida, involving CNN and a former US security contractor in Afghanistan, is providing a roadmap for a crackdown on media independence during the second Trump administration, experts believe. The case was already unusual because CNN chose to defend itself and risk millions in damages, while other media giants such as ABC News and the Washington Post have opted to back down in the face of threats of persecution from the incoming president. Ultimately, after 18 hours of deliberation, the jury found that CNN defamed the contractor and awarded Zachary Young $4m in lost business and $1m in personal damages.	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jan/20/cnn-defamation-trial	2025-01-20T03:00:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b773cd83540a325b05e2522361377a6ab8a21d11/0_48_3754_2253/master/3754.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=080bd0d5a48c0a1e998188ba7afd6d02
US will want Chagos Islands deal reversed, Trump’s ex-national security adviser suggests – UK politics live	Westminster is preparing for Donald Trump’s second term ahead of the US president’s inauguration in Washington Good morning. Donald Trump becomes president of the United States for the second time today and in Westminster, as across the rest of the word, supporters are giddy with excitement, while opponents feel this is a moment for epoch-defining dread. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader and Britain’s leading Trump evangelist, has got so carried away that he has told an interviewer he thinks there is a 20/25% chance that he could be prime minister by the time Trump leaves office (January 2029). It’s not impossible; but few other people would put his chances as high as one in four. Most people in Labour politics, privately at least, regard Trump with horror, but the government has to work with him and Keir Starmer, who has invested a lot of effort in trying to establish a decent personal relationship with the new president, has issued a statement sending Trump his -warmest congratulations- on his inauguration. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, was on the Today programme this morning and, when asked if he he had changed his mind about Trump since the days when he used to denounce him in the strongest possible terms, he said his approach to foreign policy was grounded in -progressive realism-, taking the world as it is. He went on to praise the Trump he met when he and Starmer had dinner with him in New York in September last year. The Donald Trump I met … had incredible grace, generosity, very keen to be a good host, very funny, very, very, very friendly, very warm, I have to say, about the UK, our royal family, Scotland, his relationship with Scotland, his mother. That was the Donald Trump I found. There was a survey this week – 70% of the world welcomed Donald Trump coming to power, 70% of the world, much of that worried about authoritarian actors, actually quite like the fact that Donald Trump keeps them guessing. I think surrendering the Chagos Islands, or putting the Chagos Islands in a situation where they can easily be coerced, by the Chinese Communist Party for example, I hope it’s a position that we see reversed here by Donald Trump, and by the UK government. The Pentagon, the State Department and the White House under the last administration pored through this deal. There was an interagency process, [they] said it was a good deal. It’s right and proper that the new administration is able to consider it. But having gone through the deal in detail, it’s the right deal to keep the global community safe, and I emphasize the importance of that military base and those assets on Diego Garcia that we’ve been working together with with the United States now for all of my lifetime.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/20/us-chagos-islands-deal-david-lammy-uk-politics-live-news-updates	2025-01-20T01:35:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a4433649573bce788cf9c32bd2b31c3554b67db/423_483_5895_3537/master/5895.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ba4684d22839eb21aa9a5cad6a952472

South Australia proposes law for bigger garages to stop street parking being ‘overrun’ with SUVs	Plan sparks debate about use of urban space, housing costs and investment in public transport amid climate crisis South Australia is proposing laws that will force developers to build bigger garages in new homes, in an effort to stop cars too big for standard off-street parking from crowding suburban streets. Under the plan, which is still in the consultation process, residential car park sizes will have to be half a metre wider and 60cm longer to accommodate big cars and dual-cab utes. The size of a single car park, under the proposed changes, would be 3.5m wide and 6m long.

Ninety Palestinians released by Israel as Gaza ceasefire enters second day – live	Palestinian detainees greeted with joy in West Bank after earlier release of three Israeli hostages on Sunday Hello and welcome to our live coverage of major developments in the Israel-Gaza war after a long-awaited ceasefire in Gaza came into effect on Sunday. In the hours since, hostage and prisoner exchanges have been carried out on both sides. Ninety Palestinian prisoners were released early on Monday as part of the ceasefire deal. Those freed from Israeli prisons included 69 women and 21 teenage boys from the West Bank and Jerusalem, according to Hamas. The prisoners, most of whom were freed from Ofer prison in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, were welcomed by thousands of people celebrating. It followed the release of three Israeli women held hostage by Hamas in tunnels beneath Gaza, ending a protracted ordeal that began with their violent abduction by Hamas on 7 October 2023. Among those released was joint British national Emily Damari, 28, who was freed alongside Romi Gonen, 24 and Doron Steinbrecher, 31. The women have been reunited with their mothers after being handed over by International Committee for the Red Cross. The three are in a -stable condition- and will be monitored for a few days, according to a news conference at Sheba Medical Center in Tel Aviv. A member of the hospital staff, Professor Itai Pessach, said: -I’m happy to report that they are in stable condition. That allows us and them to focus on what is the most important thing for now – reuniting with the families.- As the fighting ceased, hundreds of aid trucks queued to enter Gaza to deliver supplies to its 2.3 million residents, 90% of whom have been displaced by the conflict, many multiple times. The World Health Organization says it is ready to pour much-needed aid into Gaza during the Israel-Hamas truce, but that it would need -systematic access- across the territory to do so. Much of the Gaza Strip’s health infrastructure has been destroyed by the more than year-long war. The first phase of the truce took effect after a three-hour delay during which Israeli warplanes and artillery pounded the Gaza Strip. The last-minute blitz killed 13 people, Palestinian health authorities said. Israel claimed it had struck terrorists although Al Jazeera reported that at least two missiles hit a family travelling on a donkey cart as they tried to return home. Thousands of displaced Palestinians have started to return home, many to destroyed buildings and homes in ruins. There is no detailed plan in place to govern Gaza after the war, much less rebuild it. Nine in 10 homes have been destroyed as well as schools, hospitals, shops, mosques and cemeteries. Under the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which is to last 42 days, the militant group has agreed to release 33 hostages including children, women (including female soldiers) and men aged over 50, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli jails. In the second phase, the remaining living hostages are due to be sent back and a corresponding ratio of Palestinian prisoners will be freed, and Israel will completely withdraw from the territory. The specifics are subject to further negotiations, which are due to start 16 days into the first phase. The third phase will address the exchange of bodies of deceased hostages and Hamas members, and a reconstruction plan for Gaza will be launched. Arrangements for future governance of the strip remain hazy.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/20/israel-gaza-ceasefire-live-blog-updates-hostages-palestinian-detainees-released	2025-01-19T21:27:29-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e198aaf878d9a84788c00737a1f113e58142c15c/0_0_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5fad60e65bf5ad363352bf7980fe0284

Also receiving pardons were a top Virginia lawmaker and advocates for immigrant rights, criminal justice reform and gun violence prevention. Congressional leaders had pushed for Biden to pardon Garvey, with supporters arguing that Garvey’s conviction was politically motivated and an effort to silence the increasingly popular leader who spoke of racial pride. After Garvey was convicted, he was deported to Jamaica, where he was born.

Who banned TikTok? Politicians toss culpability like a football	Claiming a threat from a ‘foreign adversary’, the US has yet to prove China shared propaganda or collected US user data The United States of America deleted TikTok early on the morning of 19 January. A government formed -by the people, for the people-, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, has made scant evidence available to those people as to why. As those in power at the 11th hour realize how unpopular such a paternalistic move might be, each is doing their best to lay blame with the others. Why did the US ban an app used and beloved by some 170 million Americans? For fear of China’s propaganda and data collection. It’s a far-reaching, unprecedented move. The text of the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, passed in April and signed by Joe Biden, reads: -This bill prohibits distributing, maintaining, or providing internet hosting services for a foreign adversary controlled application (eg, TikTok).- Both a federal appeals court and the US supreme court have affirmed that rationale as sufficient.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/19/tiktok-ban-culpability	2025-01-19T06:00:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ad177ca3552e3e3900ce789545ac74332ffd578/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d732af4b390fef33c89ad2b89733777a

‘This is about witnesses speaking their truth’: Prince Harry gets his day in court against Murdoch’s newspapers	The Duke of Sussex and the former Labour deputy leader Tom Watson are the last two claimants still suing An extraordinary personal legal battle which has been years in preparation is to pit one of the most famous members of the British royal family against the world’s best-known media baron this week. On Tuesday Prince Harry’s lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper group, owners of the Sun and the now defunct News of the World, will officially begin at the High Court in London. Fifth in line to the throne, King Charles’s younger son lives in self-imposed exile in California, but is due to appear in court in person once the case gets fully under way next month. The Duke of Sussex, 40, is suing News Group Newspapers (NGN), over claims that journalists on his popular titles worked unlawfully with private investigators, delving into his private life, between 1996 and 2011. He sees himself as the last man standing in a struggle to get the newspapers to take legal responsibility for the crimes he and others have alleged. Another surviving case brought by Lord Watson, the former Labour deputy leader, will be heard alongside the Prince’s.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/19/this-is-about-witnesses-speaking-their-truth-prince-harry-gets-his-day-in-court-against-murdochs-newspapers	2025-01-19T04:00:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/310121fdb5ba29dac6a9525243a53a35ba7868e3/0_231_6930_4157/master/6930.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3815485c515fa2b6ae10e2914cb9abe2

Donald Trump, a convicted criminal described as a fascist by some who worked for him, will placed his hand on a Bible and and again be sworn in as president of the United States. The 45th and 47th president will then deliver an inaugural address that sets out his agenda for the next four years. His speech eight years ago became synonymous with the phrase -American carnage-. This time he may promise a new -golden age- of America.

‘Animals can feel good and evil’: film puts new perspective on Ukraine war	Collection of seven shorts due out in 2025 tells story of conflict from perspective of animals The occupying Russian soldiers paid little attention to the elderly woman shuffling through the farmland surrounding the villages outside Kyiv, taking her goat to pasture. But she was focused closely on them. After locating their positions, she headed back home with the goat, and later called her grandson, a soldier in the Ukrainian army, to give the coordinates. The story is one of seven episodes, based on real events from the first year of Russia’s full-scale invasion but lightly fictionalised, that make up a feature film about the war in Ukraine, due out later this year. All seven of the shorts have one thing in common: they tell the story of the conflict from the perspective of animals.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/19/animals-can-feel-good-and-evil-film-puts-new-perspective-on-ukraine-war	2025-01-19T00:00:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02ab8134f621d8d5ac387f2b118ba00b41ba7a55/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=52e84069efb205d4ba2a07eb88f161a4

A pandemic, the war in Ukraine and a trade war with China have caused ripples through the global economy that are still being felt midway through the decade. Beijing will be watching closely.

Frankenstein inspired by suicide of Mary Shelley’s half-sister, book reveals	New collection of author’s diary entries provides tragic insight Frankenstein’s monster, as horror fans know, did not really spark into life with a bolt of lightning, but was born inside the mind of Mary Shelley during a dreary holiday on a ­mountainside above Geneva. The inspiration came as volcanic ash clouds unexpectedly blocked out the sun that summer of 1816 and she and her friends, including the ­infamous, -bad boy- poets Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley, ­competed to tell scary stories. But a new collection of the young author’s personal diary entries, out in March, provides strong evidence that, although the stay in the Alps set the grim mood of her novel, her imagination was ignited by something ­personal and much closer to home.	https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/19/frankenstein-inspired-by-suicide-of-mary-shelley-half-sister-fanny-imlay-book-reveals	2025-01-18T22:00:49-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d46104c1c19661d008087a3342872c982ce4521b/0_274_2747_1649/master/2747.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ec3651043c859062bfd14495c3d1ae17

Israel-Gaza war live: Israeli forces reportedly withdrawing from parts of Rafah ahead of ceasefire	Reports say Israeli troops start moving from southern Gaza city to Philadelphi corridor on border with Egypt before truce set to begin at 8.30am local time Welcome to our live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war. It’s 7.22am in Tel Aviv and Gaza City and we are under 90 minutes away from the ceasefire and hostage release agreement between Israel and Hamas being scheduled to come into effect at 8.30am local time (6.30am GMT) on Sunday. Here’s a recap of the latest news. Israeli forces have started withdrawing from areas in Gaza’s Rafah to the Philadelphi corridor along the border between Egypt and Gaza, Reuters has cited pro-Hamas media as reporting early on Sunday. Benjamin Netanyahu said the first stage of the deal was temporary, adding: -If we must return to fighting, we will do that in new, forceful ways.- The prime minister added that both Donald Trump and Joe Biden back Israel’s -right to resume fighting if the second stage is fruitless-. Netanyahu also said Israel would not go ahead with the ceasefire deal until it received a list of the 33 hostages kidnapped by Hamas in the deal’s first phase. -Israel will not tolerate violations of the agreement. The sole responsibility lies with Hamas.- Hamas said on Saturday that the mechanism of the release of Israeli hostages it held in Gaza would depend on the number of detained Palestinians Israel would free. Hamas also said Israel had -failed to achieve its aggressive goals- in Gaza. Under the ceasefire agreement, the three-stage truce starts with an initial six-week phase when hostages held by the militant group will be exchanged for Palestinians detained in jails across Israel. Israeli forces have killed at least 46,899 Palestinians and injured 110,725 since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in an update on Saturday. It said 23 Palestinians were killed and 83 were injured over the past 24 hours. Yemen’s Houthis claimed an attack on a US aircraft carrier on Sunday and warned of -consequences- for any retaliation during the coming Gaza ceasefire. The Israeli military said it intercepted two missiles fired from Yemen on Saturday. The military activated air raid sirens in Jerusalem and in parts of central and southern Israel ahead of the interceptions.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/19/israel-gaza-ceasefire-live-news-updates	2025-01-18T21:22:46-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/225cf25bf2144ee5963867d1674c0945cbdba435/0_84_7500_4500/master/7500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c529f7eff3834b80bdd2e84d0ffb78ca

Uncharted territory for the WHO if Trump withdraws US membership	WHO is ‘critical in protecting US business interests’, says CEO of firm that may see lean years if Trump carries out vow The World Health Organization (WHO) could see lean years ahead if the US withdraws membership under the new Trump administration. Such a withdrawal, promised on the first day of Donald Trump’s new administration, would in effect cut the multilateral agency’s funding by one-fifth. The severe cut would be uncharted territory for the WHO, potentially curtailing public health works globally, pressuring the organization to attract private funding, and providing an opening for other countries to influence the organization. Other countries are not expected to make up the funding loss.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/18/world-health-organization-trump	2025-01-18T05:00:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b3e2fd716e247a17ca38a30d3342bf8d5fa54bb/0_141_6000_3599/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=89d57bad42dd263b9c7dc2fdd60ac3e3

The discoveries come shortly after the establishment of a joint command with Delaware following the latter state’s detection of H5N1 in two other poultry operations. Although the deadly bird flu has circulated in North America since 2022, the past few months have been especially brutal for the poultry industry. More than 20 million egg-laying hens died in the fall, the worst rates since the outbreak began, and egg prices have risen as a result.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/18/bird-flu-poultry-delaware-maryland	2025-01-18T03:00:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/995865c771e8300d85d42acccf17054071140cf5/0_98_5388_3232/master/5388.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0bf8786951ad3d4bd45743e8ebc86b9f

Middle East crisis live: Israel says 737 prisoners to initially be freed after cabinet approves Gaza ceasefire	Israeli justice ministry says the Palestinian prisoners and detainees will be released as part of truce’s first phase, under which Hamas is to free 33 hostages Welcome to our live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war. It’s approaching 8am in in Tel Aviv and Gaza City – here’s a snapshot of the latest news. Israel’s cabinet approved a deal with Palestinian militant group Hamas for a ceasefire and release of hostages in the Gaza Strip, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said on Saturday, a day ahead of the agreement’s scheduled start. Lead US negotiator Brett McGurk said after the Israeli cabinet approval that the plan was moving forward on track. The White House expected the ceasefire to start on Sunday morning, with three female hostages to be released to Israel on Sunday afternoon through the Red Cross. Under the deal, the three-stage ceasefire starts with an initial six-week phase when hostages held by Hamas will be exchanged for prisoners detained by Israel. Thirty-three of the 98 remaining Israeli hostages, including women, children, and men over 50, were due to be freed in this phase. Israel will release all Palestinian women and children under 19 in Israeli jails by the end of the first phase. The ceasefire deal was bitterly opposed by some hardliners in the Israeli cabinet, with media reports saying 24 ministers in Netanyahu’s coalition government voted in favour of the deal while eight opposed it. National security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir threatened to resign if it was approved but said he would not bring down the government. His fellow hardliner Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, also threatened to quit the government if it did not go back to war to defeat Hamas after the first six-week phase of the ceasefire. The Israeli high court is still scheduled to hear petitions against elements of the ceasefire deal but it is widely expected not to intervene. Negotiators from Egypt, Qatar, the US and Israel had agreed on -all necessary arrangements to implement- the Gaza ceasefire deal, Egyptian media reported. During Friday’s talks, which reportedly ended -on a positive note-, negotiators agreed to form a joint operations room in Cairo to -ensure effective coordination- and compliance with the truce terms, it said. Under the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which is to last 42 days and take effect from Sunday, Hamas has agreed to release 33 hostages including children, women – including female soldiers – and those aged over 50. In exchange, Israel will release 50 Palestinian prisoners for every female Israeli soldier released by Hamas, and 30 for other female hostages. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said French-Israeli citizens Ofer Kalderon and Ohad Yahalomi were in the first group of hostages to be freed by Hamas. Israel’s justice ministry released a list of 95 Palestinians held in Israeli prisoners to be freed in the first exchange, including 25 male prisoners, all under the age of 21, and 70 female prisoners. One of the most well-known individuals on the list is Palestinian parliament member and feminist lawmaker Khalida Jarrar. At least 115 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the ceasefire deal was announced on Wednesday, the Palestinian health ministry said on Friday, while medics said another five were killed in an Israeli airstrike early on Saturday in the Mawasi area west of Khan Younis. Gaza’s health ministry said at least 46,876 people have been killed and 110,642 injured in more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/18/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-says-737-prisoners-to-initially-be-freed-after-cabinet-approves-gaza-ceasefire	2025-01-17T22:04:58-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/895eeb20d77aefa7e1b2c6d5957825e3e99c5cc6/0_265_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=82e1a7c1951c9292243a41301921bbd9

Supreme court to release opinions as TikTok decision looms – live	US supreme court to release opinions at 10am ET as a challenge to a law that will ban TikTok on Sunday awaits a decision Good morning, US politics blog readers. The supreme court has announced it will release opinions at 10am ET today, as a challenge to a law that will ban TikTok on Sunday unless its China-based owner sells its US business awaits the justices’ decision. As usual, the court did not say how many opinions will be released or on which cases, and thus we will just have to wait an hour or so to find out. Should they decide the TikTok case, we do have some hints on how the justices may rule – in oral arguments last week, they seemed inclined to uphold the law. Meanwhile, we are in the final days of Joe Biden’s administration, and the Democratic president is making some last-minute moves ahead of Donald Trump’s arrival on Monday. This morning, he announced clemency for about 2,500 people convicted of non-violent drug offenses, as well as 15 more prescription drugs that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for. Biden still could have more executive actions planned before he leaves office, including preemptive pardons to Trump’s enemies. We’ll let you know if he announces anything else today. If the TikTok ban is allowed to stand, the Biden administration does not plan to enforce it, NBC News reports. Kristi Noem, the South Dakota governor who Trump picked for homeland security chief, has her Senate confirmation hearing at 9am today. Israel’s cabinet just approved the Gaza ceasefire deal.

Yes, to 27 – and is expected to continue doing so. 38 people are still missing. How close are we to containment now? The Palisades fire is still only 22% contained after burning more than 23,700 acres, while the Eaton fire is at 55% after torching some 14,100 acres. But this is expected to improve in coming days.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/17/first-thing-israeli-security-cabinet-meets-gaza-ceasefire-deal-vote	2025-01-17T03:56:53-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95007ee6f143cf97cd1ec53b772b578e2b22422a/0_271_4100_2462/master/4100.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=027f81fb6cf9c6222f4fb5d34201de68

Trump v Bannon, Musk v Farage: who hates who in Magaland	The feuds and rivalries within the US president-elect’s Maga ecosystem – including some British sympathisers The task of deconstructing the internal manoeuvrings of the leadership of the Soviet Union was once regarded as little short of a science such was the paucity of information. Today, the court of Donald Trump is perhaps no less enigmatic – but for quite different reasons. Trumpologists trying to keep up with the machinations of the Make America Great Again (Maga) movement and its sympathisers in Britain are faced with a torrent of information via social media posts and podcast rants. Sworn enemies today can easily be the closest of conspirators tomorrow. Steve Bannon has let it be known that he intends to bring down fellow Trump acolyte Elon Musk in time for inauguration day (with days to go).

‘Everyone thought it would cause gridlock’: the highway that Seoul turned into a stream	Cheonggyecheon stream in the South Korean capital has become an attraction – and helps with flood management, fighting air pollution and cooling the city On a crisp December morning, office workers and tourists stroll along a tree-lined stream in central Seoul, pausing on stepping stones that cross its flowing waters. It’s difficult to imagine that just over 20 years ago, this was a vast elevated highway carrying 168,000 cars daily through the heart of South Korea’s capital. Cheonggyecheon, a stream that runs for about 3.5 miles (nearly 6km) through Seoul, was one of the earliest experiments in an increasing trend in cities globally: turning spaces where there was once car or rail infrastructure into spaces for pedestrians and cyclists. It’s a powerful example of the way that these spaces can become loved and popular, along with projects such as the High Line in New York, where an old railway track has been turned into a raised park, or the city moat in Utrecht, where a multi-lane road (nicknamed the -motorway from nothing to nowhere-) was converted back into a canal, in part of a huge continuing push to allow pedestrians and cyclists to dominate the city’s centre.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/17/seoul-cheonggyecheon-motorway-turned-into-a-stream	2025-01-16T22:00:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc1f4407598278f21fb2bb022431678444304ed6/0_216_6480_3888/master/6480.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7621aeec72978d8563d9dbdc053a2ea9

Gaza ceasefire-hostage deal reached, Israel PM’s office says – live	Benjamin Netanyahu’s office says in statement that security cabinet will meet on Friday following earlier delays in talks to release hostages in return for ceasefire Welcome to our live coverage of the Middle East crisis. Here’s a snapshot of the latest news. Senior US officials insisted the hard-won ceasefire would go into effect on Sunday as planned despite the unexpected delay. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he was -very confident- that the ceasefire would go forward and he -fully expects that implementation will begin, as we said, on Sunday-. He confirmed that there had been a -loose end- between the sides in the complex negotiations. US representatives are still believed to be actively involved with talks in Doha on the final details needed to get the deal over the line. A vote is now expected to take place on Friday morning, Israeli media reported. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s hardline national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, announced on Thursday evening that he would quit the government if it ratifies the ceasefire deal, calling it -irresponsible- and -reckless-. Ben-Gvir’s departure would not bring down Netanyahu’s government. Opposition leader Yair Lapid pledged his support for Netanyahu, saying that the deal was -more important than any disagreement we’ve ever had.- Fighting has continued in Gaza despite expectations of a ceasefire, with at least 80 Palestinians killed and hundreds more injured by Israeli airstrikes since the ceasefire announcement, according to the civil defence agency. The Israeli military said that it had conducted strikes on -approximately 50 terror targets- across Gaza since late Wednesday. A civil defence spokesperson said its teams had recovered the bodies of five children after a strike on the northern city of Jabalia. More than 46,788 Palestinians have been killed and a further 110,453 wounded by Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, according to the latest figures by the territory’s health ministry on Thursday. They include 81 killed and 188 injured in the past 24 hours. Among them was Fatin Shaqoura-Salha, the chief of nursing staff at Al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat, ActionAid said. The ceasefire agreement, announced on Wednesday, was due to come into effect on Sunday. In the first phase, to last 42 days, Hamas agreed to release 33 hostages and in exchange, Israel would release 50 Palestinian prisoners for every female Israeli soldier released by Hamas, and 30 for other hostages. Palestinians displaced from their homes would be allowed to move freely around Gaza, wounded people would be vacuated for treatment abroad, and aid to the territory should increase to 600 trucks a day. A second phase would include Israel completely withdrawing from Gaza. The leader of Yemen’s Houthis, Abdul-Malik Badr al-Din al-Houthi, said the Iran-aligned group would suspend their attacks on Red Sea targets but continue if Israel backtracks on the ceasefire. The Houthi attacks have damaged as many as 30 ships and caused a diversion of commercial shipping to South Africa and the Cape of Good Hope. Reprisals by the US, Israel and the UK have damaged key Yemen ports and led to multiple deaths. Arab states are urging Israel and the incoming Trump administration to allow the Palestinian Authority (PA), in conjunction with the UN Palestinian relief agency Unrwa, to oversee Gaza’s recovery.

Fair to say that Kemi Badenoch’s time as leader of the Tory party has not got off to the best of starts. Hopeless at prime minister’s questions and seemingly already out of ideas, many in the party are already looking around for possible successors. Even Robert Jenrick. Things really are that desperate. Even so, 10 weeks in feels a little premature for a relaunch. If that’s what it was. Hard to know really as no one was much the wiser after Kemi had finished what had been billed as an -important- speech at the Institute of Directors in central London.

Trump nominees for treasury, interior secretary and EPA chief to face senators – live	Four more of Donald Trump’s nominees have confirmation hearings today after senators have grilled Pam Bondi and Pete Hegseth this week Good morning, US politics blog readers. Four more of Donald Trump’s nominees will have their confirmation hearings today, after senators over the past two days questioned Pam Bondi, his pick for attorney general, and Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary nominee, among others. Today, hearings are scheduled for Scott Turner, who has been nominated to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development; Lee Zeldin, Trump’s pick as Environmental Protection Agency administrator; interior secretary nominee Doug Burgum; and treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent. Expect lots of questions from Democrats to Bessent regarding his views on Trump’s vows to impose tariffs on a host of countries, friend and foe alike. We can also expect Burgum to face scrutiny about his views on expanding oil and gas drilling on public lands, a Trump campaign pledge. Here’s what else is going on today: Joe Biden is continuing his presidential farewell, with a ceremony for defense department staff at 2pm. He delivered a goodbye address to the nation yesterday evening. The House of Representatives will vote on the Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act, another Republican-authored bill aimed at undocumented immigrants. This one is targeted at migrants convicted of domestic violence, sexual abuse and related crimes. The Gaza ceasefire deal requires approval by Israel’s cabinet, but a last-minute dispute is holding that up.

‘A flood of disinformation’: rumors and lies abound amid ongoing LA wildfires	Disasters have long led to misinformation as people grasp for control, but the consequences can be life and death The Hollywood sign was not on fire. Firefighters weren’t using women’s purses to put out fires. A fish is not responsible for the blazes. The Los Angeles fire department didn’t see big budget cuts. The fires were not started deliberately as some kind of mass plot related to high-speed rail or the 2028 Olympics. Firefighting efforts did not include spraying a mood stabilizer into the air to put locals into a trance. Diversity measures are not to blame. Fires are still burning in Los Angeles, and with them has come a near-constant stream of rumors, half-truths, conspiracy theories and outright lies. Natural disasters have long led to the spread of misinformation as people try to make sense of destruction and grasp for control when the world around them is destroyed. In the aftermath of the disaster, a lot is still unknown: what caused it, what could have prevented it, who could be to blame.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/16/disinformation-los-angeles-wildfires	2025-01-16T06:00:19-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45fbcc8e41481899fb95029ead029aed6d456d9b/0_371_7451_4473/master/7451.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=44c6ffe223b8652560b594544504a018
Melbourne woman’s fight to keep NDIS support raises legal questions about agency’s ‘troubling’ processes	Tribunal decision for 54-year-old Veronica Stephan-Miller suggests onus of proof should be on NDIA, not recipient, before revoking benefits A tribunal has questioned whether it is lawful for the National Disability Insurance Agency to require that participants provide renewed evidence of their eligibility before revoking their access, describing the approach as -troubling-.

Syrians in Germany ask to be allowed to visit home and keep protected status	Refugee organisations say many want to ‘go and have a look’ after fall of Assad regime but fear losing asylum rights Syrians in Germany have called on the government to allow them to travel to their home country for short visits without risking their protection status, as questions mount over how the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime will affect the millions of Syrians who live in Europe. More than a month after a lightning advance by rebels toppled the Assad family’s 54-year rule, the residency status of many Syrians across Europe remains in limbo. A dozen or so countries across the bloc responded to the regime’s ousting by suspending the processing of asylum application from Syrians, with Austria going one step further to say it was preparing a -repatriation and deportation- programme.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/16/syrians-germany-ask-allowed-visit-home-keep-protected-status	2025-01-16T05:27:57-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aa8641110e24911ca5d5e690ea70450e8bba8ed/0_272_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a350b1143eba3ed84096b836860f7352

Russia-Ukraine war live: Keir Starmer in Kyiv to sign ‘100-year deal’	UK prime minister in Ukrainian capital to sign security and trade pact in first official visit Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. The UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, has arrived in Kyiv to sign a security and trade pact with Ukraine, in a public show of support for Volodymyr Zelenskyy before the much anticipated return of Donald Trump to the White House on Monday. The Ukrainian military said on Thursday that its forces had captured more than two dozen troops in the western Russian region of Kursk, where Russian troops have been trying to eject Ukrainian forces for the past five months. -Ukrainian paratroopers together with adjacent units captured 27 enemy servicemen in the Kursk region,- a military statement said, adding that the Russian troops had surrendered. Ukraine downed 34 out of 55 drones launched by Russia across 11 of the country’s regions in an overnight attack, the Ukrainian air force said, with a further 18 failing to reach their targets.

The mayor of the southern city of Kherson said there were power cuts as a result of the barrage. After the attack, Zelenskyy called on the west to use around US$250bn of unallocated frozen Russian assets to buy Kyiv weapons.

Israeli strikes on Gaza reported after Sunday ceasefire deal with Hamas announced – live	Medics in Palestinian territory say more than 30 killed in strikes late on Wednesday; Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu says ‘final details’ of deal still being worked on ahead of security cabinet meeting Israel continued strikes on Gaza hours after a ceasefire and hostage release deal was announced, residents and authorities in the Palestinian territory said, as mediators sought to quell fighting ahead of the truce’s start on Sunday. Israel’s military made no immediate comment and there were no reports of Hamas attacks on Israel after the ceasefire announcement. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, thanked US president-elect Donald Trump and President Joe Biden for their -assistance- in advancing the ceasefire and hostages release deal. In a series of posts on X, Netanyahu’s office said he spoke this evening with Trump and thanked him -for helping Israel bring an end to the suffering of dozens of hostages and their families.- Netanyahu then spoke with Biden and thanked him for his assistance in advancing the hostages deal. Israel’s security cabinet will meet at 11am local time (9am GMT) on Thursday to approve the deal, local media reported. The Israeli government will vote on the deal on Thursday, with a majority of ministers expected to approve the deal, a government official told Reuters. Both Biden and Trump were quick to claim credit. Biden opened his final address to the nation by referencing the deal. -This plan was developed and negotiated by my team and will be largely implemented by the incoming administration,- he said. Trump said the -epic- agreement could have only happened as a result of his -historic- election victory. The UN rights chief, Volker Türk, welcomed news of a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, saying it held he promise of -huge relief after so much unbearable pain and misery-. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, has issued a statement calling the news of a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal -long overdue- and urging a -huge surge- in humanitarian aid to the Palestinian territory. -After months of devastating bloodshed and countless lives lost, this is the long-overdue news that the Israeli and Palestinian people have desperately been waiting for,- he said. The Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal, which is set to be begin on Sunday and will last 42 days, will see the exchange of hostages detained by Hamas and Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons. Other aspects of the deal include the return of Palestinians, who have been forcibly displaced by Israeli forces, to their homes across the Gaza Strip. The deal will also see the facilitation of travel of people wounded by Israeli attacks and sick people in order to receive treatment, as well as the positioning of Israeli forces across the Gaza border.

Days, weeks, months and years of nothingness lie ahead. Now Conservatives are starting to have the same thoughts about Kemi Badenoch. At first they believed she was an exciting breath of fresh air.

Bondi voiced support for Trump’s baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election, and you can expect Democratic senators to demand answers about whether she would bring election denialism into the justice department, if confirmed. Meanwhile, it appears that Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News host who Trump nominated to serve as his defense secretary, won over a key Republican senator in his tense confirmation hearing yesterday. Iowa’s Joni Ernst has announced that she will support Hegseth, after expressing hesitation over comments he had made opposing women serving in combat roles. Hegseth has been dogged by a sexual assault allegation and reports of excessive drinking and financial mismanagement, but Ernst’s endorsement is seen as a major step to winning over other Republicans wary of installing him at the Pentagon. Joe Biden will deliver his farewell address to the nation from the Oval Office at 8pm. Inflation, the politically damaging economic trend Trump vowed to reverse, came in slightly higher than expected in December, according to just-released consumer price data from the labor department. Dangerous winds are expected to strike fire-ravaged parts of Southern California again, threatening new blazes.

Treasury minister warns of ‘tough decisions’ on spending amid high borrowing costs - UK politics live	Chief secretary to the treasury Darren Jones says there will be a spring statement on 26 March Good morning. Keir Starmer faces PMQs today. As he prepares, two issues seem very likely to come up. First, the economy. There is some modest good news this morning, and Rachel Reeves easily fought off a Tory attempted hit job on her in the Commons yesterday, but the underlying fundamentals are still pretty grim. Here are the key developments this morning. UK inflation unexpectedly fell in December, handing some breathing space to the chancellor, figures out this morning showed. The consumer prices index eased to 2.5%, below a reading of 2.6% in November, meaning prices rose at a slower rate. Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government would have to take -tough decisions- to meet its fiscal rules. The rise in government borrowing costs means further spending cuts are likely if the government is to meet its fiscal rules and Jones acknowledged that as he gave interviews this morning. He told BBC Breakfast: People at home know you can’t just keep borrowing every month to pay the bills. And where we do borrow to invest in the country’s infrastructure, the debt has to be falling as a size of the economy over the next five years. Jones said the government will not water down its plans to extend workers’ rights in the employment rights bill. In an interview on the Today programme Jones was asked about an interview on Monday where Rupert Soames, the CBI president, said the proposed changes could lead to firms laying off workers. Asked if the government would rethink the plans, Jones said: -No is the short answer.- He said giving workers more protection would be good for the economy. Jones has rejected claims the Siddiq affair raises questions about Starmer’s judgment. In an interview with Times Radio, the Treasury minister said: I don’t think there’s a question about the prime minister’s judgment. The independent process has been followed. It concluded, and Tulip took the decision to step down from government. Siddiq has been urged to -seek forgiveness from the people of Bangladesh-. As Sky News reports, responding to Siddiq’s resignation, a spokesperson for a Prof Muhammad Yunus, the interim leader of Bangladesh, said the former minister -may not have entirely understood the source of the money and property that she was enjoying in London-. The spokesperson added: She knows now and should seek forgiveness from the people of Bangladesh … We remain committed to accountability and justice and will be working with partners around the world to return the stolen funds to the people of Bangladesh.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/15/pmqs-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-labour-conservatives-uk-politics-live	2025-01-15T01:17:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/218761a797e8d612a7b7ba694728411a2a52a1d1/321_200_4792_2877/master/4792.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e1df1cd5cb5b85eaa9d27e8fa8835e5a

Wednesday briefing: What a Gaza ceasefire might look like	In today’s newsletter: With reports of a breakthrough in ceasefire negotiations, a look at what the detail includes – and what its obstacles are Good morning. After months of false starts, Israel and Hamas are close to agreeing a ceasefire that would involve the release of hostages and a major influx of aid into Gaza. Last night, both sides appeared to have accepted the outlines of a deal, with Reuters reporting that once Israel delivers maps showing how its forces will withdraw from Gaza, Hamas will give its response. -It’s closer than it’s ever been before,- US secretary of state Antony Blinken said yesterday. -But, right now, as we sit here, we await final word from Hamas on its acceptance, and until we get that word, we’ll remain on the brink.- Economy | UK inflation unexpectedly fell in December, handing some breathing space to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, after a week of turbulence in financial markets. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the consumer prices index eased to 2.5%, below a reading of 2.6% in November. UK politics | Tulip Siddiq has resigned as a Treasury minister after accepting the furore over her close ties to her aunt, the ousted prime minister of Bangladesh now accused of corruption, had become a distraction. An investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing but said a lack of records meant that it was not possible -to obtain comprehensive comfort- over properties linked to Sheikh Hasina. South Korea | South Korea’s impeached president, Yoon Suk Yeol, has been arrested and is being questioned over his ill-fated declaration of martial law last month, anti-corruption investigators said on Wednesday, bringing to an end an early-morning standoff outside his official residence in Seoul. Health | Doctors are proposing a -radical overhaul- of how obesity is diagnosed worldwide amid concerns that a reliance on body mass index may be causing millions of people to be misdiagnosed. Relying only on BMI is -ineffective- because it is not a direct measure of fat and does not provide information about a person’s health, a report by the Lancet commission said. Comedy | The comedian and actor Tony Slattery has died aged 65 after a heart attack, his partner has announced. Slattery was known for his improvisations on the popular comedy show Whose Line Is It Anyway?, as well as his appearances on Just a Minute and Have I Got News for You.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/15/wednesday-briefing-isarel-gaza-war-ceasefire-archie-bland	2025-01-14T23:03:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1627f899253e4020df6f1b16046b67d7feeaafd2/0_308_5374_3225/master/5374.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=459dac651bf30ab766d3e76076259429

With less discretionary money to spend, it is going to be a challenge for many families to pay for education, including school fees and voluntary contributions, which have all increased in the past year.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/jan/15/australia-news-live-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-election-campaign-nbn-education-school-cost	2025-01-14T11:37:21-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e4e764b4080820d369e854a11c3f97d5affb58c/0_0_8042_4824/master/8042.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2816d1ac0601f22ef6b796cf010841ff

More than half a million ‘TikTok refugees’ flock to China’s RedNote as ban looms	RedNote, also known as Xiaohongshu, rockets to top of US app stores, along with ByteDance’s Lemon8 New users have piled in to Chinese social media app RedNote just days before a proposed US ban on the popular social media app TikTok, as the lesser-known company rushes to capitalize on the sudden influx while walking a delicate line of moderating English-language content. In a live chat dubbed -TikTok Refugees- on RedNote on Monday, more than 50,000 US and Chinese users joined the room. Veteran Chinese users, with some sense of bewilderment, welcomed their American counterparts and swapped notes with them on topics such as food and youth unemployment. Occasionally, however, the Americans veered into riskier territory.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/14/tiktok-ban-rednote-app	2025-01-14T11:30:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c9ac3c25d0e8ab755c86c147ca9a6bccc31ce24/0_230_6888_4133/master/6888.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9ce6f951f3cafc3074e95398580b9423
Minnesota Democrats stage boycott over ‘abuse of power’ by Republicans	Democrats outraged as Republicans seek to take advantage of temporary majority before special house election Democrats in the Minnesota house of representatives refused to show up to start a legislative session on Tuesday in an unprecedented move designed to boycott attempts by Republicans to take advantage of a temporary majority in the chamber. The House came out of the November election tied 67-67, and top leaders from both parties started to work out a power-sharing agreement that presumed a tie. But a judge late last month declared that a newly elected Democrat did not live in his heavily Democratic district.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/14/minnesota-democrats-boycott	2025-01-14T11:26:45-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acff7fdccc728e153ff9df1fa4d6c0e3789c4627/0_111_3340_2004/master/3340.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6a28003376d0052bab34850c30ef99b9
Canada’s provincial leaders in disarray over response to Trump tariff threats	Responses range from conciliation to retaliation, including cutting off electricity and halting the purchase of US liquor Canada’s provincial premiers are sharply divided on how to prepare for US trade tariffs, less than a week before Donald Trump takes office with a threat to dramatically reshape the relationship between the two countries. Canadian officials have sought to defuse the crisis with personal appeals to the president-elect, multimillion-dollar advertising sprees and targeted threats, but the country remains gripped by uncertainty over how Trump’s tariffs might take effect. On Monday, Bloomberg reported that the incoming US administration is weighing hiking tariffs by 2%-5% a month to avoid spiking inflation.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/14/canada-trump-tariffs	2025-01-14T11:16:39-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c166bb3a857fabe71fe5e9b63541adb4b4638c9/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=98ffe31825a685a09f63f776b09edce1

Stride’s Hamlet gag saves Reeves from slings and arrows of economic fortune | John Crace	Instead of evaluating chancellor’s performance, her shadow apes rightwing press and calls for her sacking You can only conclude that Conservative MPs are just too trusting for their own good. Either that or they are catatonically dim. The rest of us know enough to not always believe what we read on the front page of the rightwing papers, but Tory MPs seem to take everything at face value. If it’s in the paper, it must be true. It’s almost touching. Tuesday’s front pages of the Mail and the Telegraph insisted Rachel Reeves’s time was up. Going to China while the international bond markets crept upwards was the last straw. The chancellor should resign. What’s more, the prime minister had expressed his -full confidence- in Reeves, which could only mean that he was about to sack her. Let’s just say that Monday had been a slow news day in Westminster and some hacks had decided to make mischief.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/14/strides-hamlet-gag-saves-reeves-from-slings-and-arrows-of-economic-fortune	2025-01-14T10:19:59-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71e7fcb812b69e1059045495c89bfd1ee8b9b59d/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7724509257eb96ec7be49811824d3860
