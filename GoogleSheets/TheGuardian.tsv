News live: Chalmers reveals $149bn cut to national debt under Labor; Australia overtakes Russia in Asia influence rankings	Treasurer Jim Chalmers says gross debt at the end of 2023-24 was $907bn. Follow the day’s news live Australia has jumped one place in the Lowy Institute’s annual Asia Power Index, largely due to Russia going backwards as a result of its war in Ukraine. The think tank ranks 27 countries and territories to rank their relative power in Asia. It is based on 131 indicators across eight broad themes: military capability, defence networks, economic capability, economic relationships, diplomatic influence, cultural influence, resilience and future resources. For the first time, experts surveyed for the Asia Power Index judged that China is better able to deploy rapidly and for a sustained period in the event of an interstate conflict in Asia. This increase in ranking, Australia’s second since the inception of the Asia Power Index (it surpassed South Korea in 2020), is more a function of Russia’s decline since 2018 than Australia’s rise.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/sep/23/australia-news-live-politics-debt-cut-chalmers-labor-russia-asia-influence-rankings-weather-fire	2024-09-22T14:39:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9be0b449e50bd54383c8fae1b66c8bae947617da/0_261_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ab73cfe2ac895605d6b4028ae2991d40

Labour delegates long to celebrate, but ministers can’t quite feel the joy | John Crace	The party should be toasting its landslide, but instead a state of near-paralysis seems to have set in We may need to have a rethink. Over the last few days it seemed to have become apparent that Keir Starmer wasn’t very good at the politics of being a politician. Taking the free suits and glasses. Being slow to realise this could make him look hypocritical. Sitting back while different factions within the Labour party elite kick lumps out of one another. Making a mess of the winter fuel allowance. Unsure whether he was making cuts or means-testing benefits. Unable to move on from days of bad media. Generally looking a tad on the dim side. Now not so much. Come the start of Labour’s party conference in Liverpool, Keir was a man on a mission. Willing to learn from his mistakes. Ready to do whatever needed to be done. And what needed to be done was … nothing. It’s usual for the prime minister to make himself available for TV interviews on the Sunday politics shows during conference.

France’s new government under pressure as opponents threaten no-confidence vote	Critics of new cabinet, finalised by Michel Barnier on Saturday night, said it was ‘same-old, same-old’ Mounting threats of a parliamentary motion of no-confidence have put Michel Barnier’s new government under considerable duress before it has even had a chance to start work, as street protesters continued to voice their anger over the French prime minister’s new administration.

CBeebies at the Baftas? Awards aim to revive magic of kids’ TV	Categories will boost visibility of shows in a new, fractured media landscape Children’s television was once a thriving, fantastical realm, peopled by Wombles, Tweenies and Danger Mouse – not to mention a car called Brum, an engine called Ivor and a dog called Roobarb – and British-made shows were available every day on the major terrestrial channels. Since then, the magic has largely retreated to the margins of broadcasting. But the embattled landscape is to receive a high-profile boost from Bafta, the Observer has learned. After prolonged campaigning from influential figures such as the former PlaySchool presenter Floella Benjamin, the children’s maths whiz Johnny Ball, the Dr Who writer Russell T Davies and Anne Wood, a veteran creator of worldwide hits such as Teletubbies, Bafta is to recognise the inventive work that is still entertaining Britain’s children. The British Academy has created three high-profile awards to sit alongside the trophies it hands out to adult television shows. The new categories will go some way to replace Bafta’s abandoned children’s TV awards event.	https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/sep/22/cbeebies-at-the-baftas-awards-aim-to-revive-magic-of-kids-tv	2024-09-22T04:00:07-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3a1b4dca0b74438d2f5f65fa3353b2513226eb6/0_222_2413_1447/master/2413.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ea6eeb2d7add6e5fa287c8772cc1aef2

‘Affordable’ shared-ownership homes cost residents more than half their wages	Many people now feel trapped despite major provider’s guidance that mortgage, rent and service charges should not exceed 40% of take-home pay Residents who bought shared-ownership properties promoted as -affordable homes- say they now feel trapped because they have to spend more than half of their net salaries on mortgage repayments, rent and service charges. Campaigners say residents have become the victims of financial abuse after buying properties promoted as a step on the property ladder, only to be told of dramatic increases in service charges. Some residents face annual charges of more than £5,000 a year.	https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/sep/22/affordable-shared-ownership-homes-cost-residents-more-than-half-their-wages	2024-09-22T02:00:06-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d8243652f8d0b818d9721dfedd2db7df3f3f56b/0_0_3448_2069/master/3448.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=54c2335f446bfad57c955e4cc1a594e3
Middle East crisis live: Overnight barrage of Hezbollah rockets launched into Israel, IDF says	Hezbollah launches widespread attacks across northern Israel on Sunday, with some landing near the city of Haifa The United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, has warned of an -imminent catastrophe- in the Middle East. -With the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is no military solution that will make either side safer,- she wrote in a brief statement on X. Hospitals in northern Israel have been instructed to transfer their operations to facilities with extra protection from rocket and missile fire, the health ministry said on Sunday. Rambam hospital in Haifa will transfer patients to its underground, secure facility, the ministry said. Meanwhile, the military’s Home Front Command said schools and other educational institutions and activities would not be permitted in the north until at least Monday at 6pm local time. The death toll from an Israeli airstrike that targeted Hezbollah military commanders in Beirut’s southern suburbs has risen to 45, Lebanon’s health ministry said on Sunday, updating an earlier toll of 37 from the Friday attack. News broadcaster Al Jazeera said on Sunday morning that Israeli forces raided its bureau in the West Bank’s Ramallah city with a military order to close it for 45 days. The Qatar-based channel aired live footage of the Israeli troops entered the channel’s office and handed over a closure order to one of the Al Jazeera TV staff. Al Jazeera’s West Bank bureau chief, Walid al-Omari, reported that Israeli troops brought a truck to confiscate documents, devices and office property. In a statement, the Palestinian Journalists’ Syndicate condemned the raid, saying -this arbitrary military decision is considered a new violation against journalistic and media works-. The US state department has urged Americans in Lebanon to leave the country while commercial options remain available. -At this time, commercial flights are available, but at reduced capacity. If the security situation worsens, commercial options to depart may become unavailable,- it added. The death toll from an Israeli strike on Saturday on a school-turned-shelter in Gaza city included -13 children and six women-, one of whom was pregnant, said civil defence agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal. The Gaza health ministry said at least 22 had died as a result of the strike.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/22/middle-east-crisis-live-hezbollah-israel-lebanon-gaza-latest-news-updates	2024-09-22T00:33:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c403d90a501ce31eaaddfff817af74e2d65a796/0_273_5756_3454/master/5756.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=89e1d754fd1746a17d07c3fe1acdc14c
Starmer says he wants to give ‘hope’ he can deliver ‘massively different and better country’ – Labour conference live	Labour conference opens as PM sees approval ratings plunge amid warnings on economy and controversy over freebies and Sue Gray Good morning. The last time Labour held a conference after a summer general election was in 2017. The party lost, but because Jeremy Corbyn did much better than expected, conference ended up feeling like a victory party. This time Keir Starmer won a landslide. But early messaging from the government has focused on the dire economic inheritance, and the need for tough decisions in the budget, Starmer’s approval ratings have plunged, and the past week has been dominated by controversy caused by unforced errors (freebies, and feuding about Sue Gray). It is too early to assess the mood of Labour, holding its conference in Liverpool as a party of government for the first time in 15 years, but no one is describing it as pure celebratory. In an interview with the Observer ahead of the conference, Starmer said he would protect public services from further austerity. I was running a public service when the coalition government went down the austerity route. It did a huge amount of damage to our public services and we are still feeling the damage even now. So we are not going down the road of austerity. We’ve got to deal with the problems we’ve inherited, that’s what we are doing. What we’ll set out at conference is the why. What do you get for this? The hope, the changed Britain. This would be a massively different and better country, real sunny uplands stuff. But to get there we have to do the tough thing to start with.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/22/keir-starmer-angela-rayner-labour-party-conference-latest-live-news	2024-09-22T00:25:24-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/117611b8ecba27af4689f5a2dfb0ed4e3ab64887/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f29b156511465c431e7bdea4455079cc

Putin regime will collapse without warning, says freed gulag dissident	Vladimir Kara-Murza and his wife, Evgenia, speak of his time in a Siberian jail and why the truth about Russia will come out The last time I met Evgenia Kara-Murza, it was a grim day in early March. The timing couldn’t have been worse. As we spoke, Alexei Navalny’s coffin was being lowered into the frozen ground in a Moscow cemetery. Meanwhile Evgenia’s husband, Vladimir Kara-Murza, was still incarcerated in a Siberian prison cell almost identical to the one in the Arctic Circle in which Navalny had been found dead, presumed murdered. The parallels were eerie. Because Vladimir, a journalist turned political activist, was not just also loathed and feared by the Kremlin and imprisoned on spurious charges, he’d also been poisoned – twice – targeted by the same FSB (Federal Security Service) unit that had poisoned Navalny.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/22/putin-regime-will-collapse-without-warning-says-freed-gulag-dissident	2024-09-21T21:00:01-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c688a92461a3dc19bb5834a13f2786e10c9b0a0/0_121_4390_2634/master/4390.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25ce6077a2687a5945ca8346dcba1736

Supreme court’s Chevron decision adds ambiguity to cannabis law: ‘It’s a mess’	Decision that weakened power of government regulatory agencies sows confusion to already chaotic cannabis law A recent supreme court decision that weakened the power of US government regulatory agencies such as the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has added additional confusion to America’s already chaotic cannabis law. This month, a federal court was able to overrule the DEA on what qualifies as legal hemp, in part because of a supreme court decision that nullified the Chevron doctrine, which once directed courts to defer to the expertise of federal agencies. But now the reverse will apply and courts may have the final say over even highly technical regulations.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/21/supreme-court-chevron-decision-cannabis-law	2024-09-21T06:00:41-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e37b3578ab54531ef95a6bad0060f4ab83a83f9/0_76_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2e995cdf1df4c354fb547e54f5c4ff4c

Louisiana Catholic church turns to federal court to attack law aiding abuse victims	‘If anyone could undo … the will of Louisiana … the Catholic church can and will,’ says survivor whose case is targeted Months after Louisiana’s supreme court upheld the constitutionality of a state law that let child molestation victims sue for long-ago abuse, despite arguments to the contrary by a Roman Catholic diocese, another church organization is asking the federal government to strike the statute down. Behind the request in question are the Dominican Sisters of Peace and a law firm that boasts about having represented Catholic institutions in Louisiana courts for more than a century. Another of the law firm’s clients in question, the archdiocese of New Orleans, is offering clergy molestation victims less than 10% of what they are requesting in a bankruptcy settlement, in part by arguing the so-called -lookback window- law doesn’t apply to more than 600 abuse claims.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/21/louisiana-catholic-church-sexual-abuse-victims-lawsuit-window	2024-09-21T04:00:40-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b10508b3d29cfbe71539145307b47f70a62a5c1/0_4_5100_3059/master/5100.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=66079d038e0df2add9eaa1180aef93c8

‘Stop doing dumb stuff,’ economist warns as housing affordability in Australia slips	Saul Eslake says decades of ‘bad policies’ have inflated demand as report finds about 20% of households effectively ‘locked out’ of the market Housing affordability has deteriorated over the past year to reach its worst level since records began in 1995. First home buyers now rely on wealthy families or high-income jobs to enter the market, according to the latest housing affordability report from PropTrack. Driven by high mortgage rates and increasing home prices, affordability further deteriorated this financial year to the point where a median-income household earning about $112,000 could afford just 14% of homes sold – the smallest share since records began. This share has declined from 43% in just three years.

Israel conducted dozens of strikes across southern Lebanon on Thursday night, hours after Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, threatened retribution and -punishment- for the unprecedented attacks that blew up pagers and walkie-talkies bought by the group. What has Israel said about the explosions? It has not commented but announced, just hours before Tuesday’s pager attacks, that it was broadening its war aims to return Israelis who had been evacuated from the north. Does X still use the tags? No, it now uses a -community notes- peer review feature and has weakened its approach to content moderation under Elon Musk’s ownership. What limitations are there to the study?

Trump bemoans lack of support from Jewish voters as claims of ally’s antisemitism emerge – US politics live	Republican candidate claims Israel would cease to exist if Harris wins as explosive allegations emerge that North Carolina’s Mark Robinson referred to himself as a ‘black Nazi’ Good morning and welcome to our blog covering US politics in the run-up to the presidential election following another tumultuous evening where Donald Trump bemoaned a lack of support from Jewish voters just hours after allegations emerged that a Republican ally had referred to himself as a -black Nazi- on a pornography website. Trump failed to mention the claims in a CNN report against Mark Robinson, North Carolina’s Republican gubernatorial nominee, during a speech on Thursday at the Israeli-American Council national summit in Washington. If I don’t win this election - and the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that if that happens because if 40%, I mean, 60% of the people are voting for the enemy - Israel, in my opinion, will cease to exist within two years. Harris sat down with Oprah Winfrey on Thursday for a -virtual rally- that included a wide-ranging sit-down interview, during which Harris attacked Trump’s stance on reproductive rights and pledged to sign a border security bill thwarted by Senate Republicans. On Friday, the vice-president will be attending campaign events in the swing states of Georgia and Wisconsin. In the evening, Trump will be in another swing state – Arizona –at a town hall event. He will appear alongside Monica Crowley, a commentator and former assistant secretary for public affairs, and Chad Wolf, who was an acting secretary for public affairs in his administration.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/20/donald-trump-mark-robinson-kamala-harris-us-politics-live	2024-09-20T02:01:02-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a04f253d5d56aefddd2bf3f7c511c0e1eea0f29/0_0_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ed93d3c379ddb391fd81ac9f92bdfe24

Russia-Ukraine war live: Italy calls for ‘fair peace’ and says defence of Ukraine must not lead to world war	Italian foreign minister announces new weapons for Ukraine but warns of risks as conflict escalates Italy is about to send another Samp-T anti-missile system to Ukraine, foreign minister Antonio Tajani said on Thursday, underlining the need, however, to avoid entering war with Russia. -We are sending a new Samp-T (anti-missile system) to protect hospitals, schools, universities … for this country that was attacked by Russia,- Tajani told Radio 24. Ukraine’s offensive into the Russian border region of Kursk diverted about 40,000 Russian troops away from the frontline, Zelenskyy said on Thursday. Kyiv launched its Kursk offensive on 6 August in a bid to pull Moscow’s forces away from eastern Ukraine, where the Russian army has captured a string of villages in recent months. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had captured the village of Heorhiivka, east of the city of Kurakhove, in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. The General Staff of Ukraine’s military, in an afternoon report, referred to the village as one of several engulfed by fighting. Popular Ukrainian military blog DeepState said the village was in Russian hands. In his nightly video address, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine’s forces had -managed to diminish the occupiers’ assault potential in Donetsk region,- though the situation remained difficult in areas subjected to the heaviest attacks, near Kurakhove and another key Russian target, the city of Pokrovsk. Russian forces hit a geriatric care home in the Ukrainian city of Sumy and targeted its energy sector in a new wave of airstrikes on Thursday, killing at least one civilian, Ukrainian officials said. During a daytime strike on the northern city, a Russian guided bomb hit a five-storey building, regional and military officials said. One person was killed and 12 wounded, the interior ministry said. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said rescue teams were checking to see whether people were trapped under rubble. Images from the site shared alongside the ministry’s post showed elderly patients evacuated from the damaged building lying on the ground on carpets and blankets. The UN human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine said attacks on the power grid probably violated humanitarian law while the International Energy Agency said in a report that Ukraine’s electricity supply shortfall in the critical winter months could reach about a third of expected peak demand. Moscow has repeatedly attacked the Sumy region, which borders Russia’s Kursk region, the site of a major Ukrainian incursion in which Kyiv says it seized over 100 settlements. Zelenskyy will meet Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House next week in what is likely to be his last such visit before US elections that could upend Washington’s policy on Kyiv. Zelenskyy is expected to share a -victory plan- with the US leaders to end the war with Russia during the visit on 26 September – as Kyiv frets that a second Donald Trump presidency could loosen US commitment to Ukraine. In a separate announcement, Zelenskyy said he would also meet Trump. Ramzan Kadyrov, the powerful leader of Russia’s Chechen Republic, accused Elon Musk on Thursday of disabling a Tesla Cybertruck that he claimed to have received from the billionaire last month. Kadyrov, who has ruled Chechnya with an iron fist for over 17 years, shared a video in August of him driving around in the electric vehicle with what appeared to be a machine gun mounted on its roof. Kadyrov said he received the vehicle from Musk, a claim that the Tesla owner called a lie on his social media platform, X. -Now, recently, Musk remotely disabled the Cybertruck,- said Kadyrov in a post on his Telegram account. It was not possible to independently verify Kadyrov’s claims.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/20/russia-ukraine-war-live-italy-calls-for-fair-peace-and-says-defence-of-ukraine-must-not-lead-to-world-war	2024-09-20T00:25:50-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e5709aa65502db4119e2c6389e7c40edfd97c7d/0_282_4357_2614/master/4357.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f2daaa170459707c37ceebfe6c779f89

How Lebanon’s pagers and walkie-talkies became deadly weapons – podcast	On Tuesday, dozens of people were killed when electronic pagers blew up. The next day walkie-talkies exploded. What was the goal of the attacks? William Christou reports On Tuesday, William Christou, a journalist reporting from Beirut for the Guardian, began hearing about simultaneous explosions across the city. Then videos began to emerge of small blasts in shops, cars and people’s homes. The death toll began to rise. Then came the extraordinary reason: electronic pagers, used by members of Hezbollah to communicate, had blown up, wounding their owners and whoever was nearby.

Minister rejects claim that Sue Gray showed ‘stunning arrogance’ accepting higher salary than Keir Starmer – UK politics live	Jonathan Reynolds, business secretary, suggests Starmer himself did not decide pay for his chief of staff Good morning. Yesterday the BBC broke the story that Sue Gray, Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, is paid £170,000 a year, which is about £3,000 a year more than the PM himself. It is not a typical BBC story (more on that later), and it would be a classic prosecution exhibit for anyone arguing that political journalists are too obsessed with insider processology. There is also a strong argument that ministers and officials at the very top of politics are paid relatively little anyway if you take into account the skill set required, the hours worked, and what they might earn in the public sector. Yes, as Chris Mason, the BBC’s political editor has argued in a blog about the story, this is more than just a slice of Whitehall trivia. That is because the story suggests serious feuding is happening within the Labour adviser machine in government. A story like this would not have ended up on the BBC without someone quite important briefing viciously against Gray, and the revelation has angered other special advisers who claim that Gray is to blame for them being offered measly salaries, at least compared to what their Tory predecessors were on, or what they were earning when they were paid by the Labour party. Clearly this an important job. There’s a process that sets these paybands. It will reflect previous experience … It is a long-established way of establishing within certain pay bands renumeration relating to the job that you do. That’s what have been followed in this case. I think it’s important people understand that the pay bands for any official, any adviser, are not set by politicians. There’s an official process that does that. I don’t, for instance, get to set the pay for my own advisers who work directly for me. So, there’s a process, we don’t have political input into that. There’s a process that sets these things. It is widely recognised. It’s long-standing. It hasn’t changed and that is how pay bands are set for any adviser.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/19/keir-starmer-sue-gray-labour-conservatives-uk-politics-latest-news	2024-09-19T01:28:18-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/380afd90a9a83ed36590529875a9e93c282afb62/1089_88_2515_1509/master/2515.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c44735e3b4f82b3daf5afea6366aca07

Campaigners call for unlimited ‘climate card’ UK rail pass	Research says flat-fee train travel would bring economic and health benefits as well as simplifying ticket fares Renationalising the railways does not go far enough – Labour should spur a rail renaissance by allowing people around the UK unlimited train travel for a flat fee, campaigners have said.

Israel’s double-punch humiliation of Hezbollah is a dance on the edge of an abyss	Tactical daring keeps Netanyahu on the front foot but risks lurch into full-blown war The detonation of walkie-talkies around Lebanon a day after scores of pagers used by Hezbollah officials blew up is a one-two punch that drives home the extent of Israel’s penetration of its Shia foe’s defences across its northern border. It represents utter humiliation for Hezbollah that its security can be so effortlessly breached twice, and be shown incapable of protecting its own people.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/18/israels-double-punch-humiliation-of-hezbollah-is-a-dance-on-the-edge-of-an-abyss	2024-09-18T12:14:59-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19c11a43cbe48f3c60cc0c872b97ff6ed565d845/0_246_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fb7d48661c0637c6eccc1d542cbe49ff

Pager and walkie-talkie attacks on Hezbollah were audacious and carefully planned	Israel is widely believed to be behind the operations – but who made the devices, and how did they explode? It may be years before the full story is told of how coordinated explosions of thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah was orchestrated. But, even without Israel publicly admitting responsibility, it is clear that the attack must have been carefully planned – however uncertain its consequences. Experts generally believe a small mount of stable explosive was carefully implanted into each sabotaged device. Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University, says: -There wouldn’t need to be much explosive, as proximity to a human body means it would cause injury even if it was a few grams.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/18/pager-and-walkie-talkie-attacks-on-hezbollah-were-audacious-and-carefully-planned	2024-09-18T11:52:10-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2e1a8de1b639c5b17d9e481f5bc6d13099a8365/0_145_3193_1916/master/3193.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a823171ba2028713f4af42c94e51273e

He spoke about immigration and crime, despite research showing immigrants don’t commit more crimes than those born in the US.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/18/first-thing-israel-planted-explosives-thousands-hezbollah-pagers-reports	2024-09-18T04:01:35-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2eeb7bc1d1884e249730d9a0e30cfeb30a8c28f9/0_0_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a8f098e06d7492240d8d1d6c6446c649

‘Only consequential presidents get shot at,’ Trump tells event – US politics live	Running for president is ‘a dangerous business,’ Republican nominee says at a town hall event in Michigan, following Sunday’s apparent assassination bid Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the run-up to the US presidential election. The fallout from Sunday’s apparent assassination attempt on Republican nominee Donald Trump is continuing. Last night the former president made his first public appearance since the incident, which occurred while he was playing golf in Florida. On Tuesday, Kamala Harris was interviewed by a panel of three National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) members, during which the vice-president talked about the anti-immigrant sentiment toward Haitians in Springfield, Ohio; Israel’s war in Gaza; domestic economic issues; gun violence; and reproductive rights. The conversation was one of the few interviews Harris has done since becoming the Democratic nominee. JD Vance defended his comments about Haitian immigrants eating pets during a Tuesday rally, saying that -the media has a responsibility to factcheck- stories – not him. The rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, came two days after the Ohio senator told CNN host Dana Bash it was OK -to create stories- to draw attention to issues his constituents care about, regarding inflammatory and unfounded claims that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, had eaten residents’ pets. The FBI and the US Postal Inspection Service on Tuesday were investigating the origin of suspicious packages that have been sent to or received by elections officials in more than 15 states, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or that any of the packages contained hazardous material. The latest packages were sent to elections officials in Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York and Rhode Island. Donald Trump is planning to appear with Polish President Andrzej Duda in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Sunday, according to two sources familiar with the plan, reports Reuters. The dual appearance is not yet finalised, said one of the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss plans that are still private. But if the dual appearance goes forward, it would mark a rare instance of a foreign leader appearing alongside a US presidential candidate on the campaign trail. A false claim circulating on social media that Kamala Harris was involved in an alleged hit-and-run in San Francisco in 2011 is the work of a covert Russian disinformation operation, according to new research by Microsoft. The Russian group responsible, which Microsoft dubs Storm-1516, is described as a Kremlin-aligned troll farm. America Pac, one of the largest and the most ambitious of the groups supporting Donald Trump’s campaign, is replacing its voter turnout operations in the crucial battleground states of Arizona and Nevada, according to two people familiar with the matter. The political action committee, backed by billionaire Elon Musk, has ended its contract with the September Group and will hire a new company to knock on doors with fewer than 50 days left until the election.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/18/donald-trump-kamala-harris-us-election-politics-latest-news-updates	2024-09-18T02:03:27-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa80c278b632acb1816609d504bf778c97919e60/0_95_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=26e2bd39dd2f56efe24576831d594723

‘Un-British, un-Christian, unconscionable’: Major condemns Tories’ Rwanda policy – UK politics live	Former PM, in rare interview, says he has not decided who to back for Tory leadership but urges party not to lurch to the right Good morning. Judged by the amount of time he spent as prime minister, John Major was one of the most successful Conservative prime ministers of the post-war period. Only Margaret Thatcher and Harold Macmillan outlasted him in No 10. But he has not been aligned with mainstream thinking in his party since he resigned after losing the election in 1997, and in an interview being broadcast tonight he has unleashed a fresh attack on the policies of the party he used to lead. While his views are not 100% surprising to anyone who has been listening to him in recent years, they are a stark reminder of how much the political landscape has shifted in the last 30 years. The interview, with Amol Rajan from the BBC, is being broadcast tonight. Here are the key lines. Major strongly condemned the Rwanda deportation plan proposed by the last government (and defended by all four candidates still in the Tory leadership contest). He said: I thought it was un-Conservative, un-British, if one dare say in a secular society, un-Christian, and unconscionable and I thought that this is really not the way to treat people. We used to transport people, nearly three hundred years ago, from our country. Felons, who at least have had a trial, and been found guilty of something, albeit that the trial might have been cursory. I don’t think transportation, for that is what it is, is a policy suitable for the 21st century. Major implied the last government deserved to lose the election. He said he did not give many interviews before the election because -there’s not been a great deal I could say, I would wish to say, in favour of what the previous government were doing.- And, talking about the election result, he said: There’s a time of when democracy needs a change in government. I could see that in 1997, we had been in government for 18 years and it was perfectly true to say, that we were tired and that we were running out of fresh people to make ministers and reinject the government with vigour. And of course the same thing applies [with the recent election results], although it was only 14 years. He said it would be a mistake for the party to shift further to the right. He said: The only party that can legitimately appeal to the centre right is the Conservative party. And that is what we have to do, we have to decide where our natural support really lies and appeal to them. People may have made a misjudgement about the last election. We lost five votes to Reform UK and people are jumping up and down, and some, rather reckless people are saying, well we must merge with them. Well, that will be fatal. We lost 50 to the Liberals, and we lost a huge amount to Labour. We lost the vote on the left, more than on the right. And we have to focus on that centre right position, and we’re not an ideological party, I do think traditionally we have been a commonsense party.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/18/john-major-condemns-tory-rwanda-policy-uk-politics-live	2024-09-18T01:26:06-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14051633d367ac9dfdce80aca1ba58020ae7b53e/5_85_1874_1125/master/1874.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a85125222e1ecad824f579f3ea6fb02c

A number of senior cabinet ministers have come out this week, banging the drum for the government’s climate policies and reminding the public and the media that the climate crisis and its effects are at the top of their agenda. Labour | Keir Starmer has declared more free tickets and gifts than other major party leaders in recent times, with his total now topping £100,000 after recent support for his lifestyle from Labour donor Waheed Alli. Middle East | Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate against Israel after pagers used by its members exploded across Lebanon simultaneously, killing at least nine people and wounding almost 3,000. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. The apparent sabotage attack followed months of targeted assassinations by Israel against senior Hezbollah leaders. Music | Sean -Diddy- Combs has been charged with sex trafficking and racketeering, according to a federal indictment unsealed Tuesday. Combs had been arrested late Monday in Manhattan, roughly six months after federal authorities conducting a sex trafficking investigation raided his luxurious homes in Los Angeles and Miami. NHS | A fifth of GPs are using artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT to help with tasks such as writing letters for their patients after appointments, according to a survey. Aid | UK aid spending will fall to its lowest level since 2007 unless the government takes urgent remedial action in the autumn budget, a group of more than 100 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the aid and humanitarian sector jointly warned on Wednesday.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/18/first-edition-labour-environment-policy	2024-09-17T22:38:43-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f6a0bbbfcc15a7eac079a574b6231b2642e23be/0_595_7503_4505/master/7503.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40f44b97d67b6860cd7958bdf19b3232

Exodus from workforce costs UK ‘£16bn a year’ in lost tax receipts	Institute for Employment Studies says UK has 800,000 fewer people in work or looking for work since before Covid The UK has suffered the biggest contraction in its workforce since the 1980s, costing the public finances at least £16bn a year in lost tax receipts, according to a study. Hundreds of thousands of people have quit the labour market since the pandemic and never returned, undermining the strength of the economy and leaving the government out of pocket, according to the Institute for Employment Studies. The UK is one of the only countries in the developed world to have seen employment fall post-pandemic: slipping from having the eighth-highest employment rate in the world to 15th. The reduction can be blamed on fewer people entering work in recent years rather than more people leaving it, with 90% of the growth in -economic inactivity- due to more people off work for at least four years or who have never worked at all. The solution to the crisis could include reforming employment support to guarantee help for those who need it; ending the ‘compliance culture’ in jobcentres; and creating new Labour Market Partnerships to meet local priorities and join up delivery.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/18/exodus-uk-workforce-costs-16bn-a-year-lost-tax-receipts-covid	2024-09-17T16:01:44-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a5a542c66bc45389512443687c6ae43dc79c97f/320_118_5440_3264/master/5440.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ba4c56afb972f295684ddadfc3e32c3e

Exploding pager attack in Lebanon is another blow for US peace hopes	Violent blow against Hezbollah leaves the militia vengeful and vulnerable – and again dashes Washington’s diplomacy For American diplomacy in the Middle East, the extraordinary attack in Lebanon that simultaneously detonated hundreds of pagers used by Hezbollah members could not have come at a less auspicious moment – and may still spark an escalation that the US had been seeking desperately to avoid. A day before the coordinated sabotage, Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to Joe Biden, was in Israel urging Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior Israeli officials against an escalation in Lebanon. The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, and the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, had also warned that time was running out to find a negotiated settlement between Israel and Hezbollah.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/17/exploding-pager-attack-in-lebanon-is-another-blow-for-us-peace-hopes	2024-09-17T14:56:22-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cafadc8a406d60457efe9fd82e1760024475ede3/0_329_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2f88aeba4a67a7e45765092f71b49be4
Harris calls Ohio bomb threats ‘crying shame’ in talk with Black journalists	National Association of Black Journalists panel also addresses Gaza and economic opportunity for Black men On Tuesday, Kamala Harris was interviewed by a panel of three National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) members, during which the vice-president talked about the anti-immigrant sentiment toward Haitians in Springfield, Ohio; Israel’s war in Gaza; domestic economic issues; gun violence; and reproductive rights. The conversation was one of the few interviews Harris has done since becoming the Democratic nominee, and it served as an opportunity for her to reaffirm policies. When asked about -where [she] sees the line in terms of aggression and defense- in regards to the war, she said that she supported the Biden administration’s one-time pause on the delivery of 2,000lb bombs to Israel as -leverage- that they -have had and used-, but that achieving a deal was the real means to ending the war.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/17/harris-nabj-panel-ohio-bomb-threats-gaza-economy	2024-09-17T14:43:47-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01b82f86956c38a06c4597eb297f4a30e0a22b78/0_235_3524_2114/master/3524.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6b977fbb2105594c0a95555d56f4d4e5
Arizona elections error could affect eligibility of nearly 100,000 voters	Voter registration issue splits politicians in the swing state as they enter legal battle over best solution Arizona’s top elections official said on Tuesday that a newly identified error in the state’s voter registration process needs to be swiftly resolved, as early ballots are set to go out to some voters as soon as this week. Election staff in the Maricopa county recorder’s office identified an issue last week, which concerns voters with old driver’s licenses who may never have provided documentary proof of citizenship but were coded as having provided it and therefore were able to vote full ballots. The state has a bifurcated system in which voters who do not provide documentary proof of citizenship cannot vote in local or state elections, only federal ones.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/17/arizona-elections-error-eligibility-impact	2024-09-17T14:40:19-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8144fc86be3a739983ee120f794615be186985d2/0_237_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c32dc46e6e1af111d1752080413dfde8

Hezbollah pager explosions, if caused by the Mossad, would be a big escalation	The detonation of thousands of devices, with a death toll of at least nine, could provoke war between Israel and the Lebanese group It may not have been acknowledged by Israel but the extraordinary, coordinated attack on Hezbollah, blowing up thousands of pagers used by members of the Lebanese group, is almost certainly a Mossad operation. The Israeli intelligence service been engaged in the assassinations of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders for decades but, if its involvement is confirmed, this represent a significant escalation. Reports continue to come in but, with at least nine dead and about 3,000 wounded in dozens, if not hundreds, of coordinated explosions the episode demonstrates a ruthless – if indiscriminate – desire to target Hezbollah. The group had been using pagers as an alternative to mobile phones, which can be tracked and used to pinpoint deadly missile strikes on its commanders.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/17/hezbollah-pager-explosions-if-caused-by-the-mossad-would-be-a-big-escalation	2024-09-17T11:18:37-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c6afc870e91e44dfef890aa57f275714e56ced3/0_183_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c2702e757b43900d6a19edeb920f89ec

Donald Trump recounts events of shooting attempt – US politics live	Former president says Secret Service responded quickly to shots and evacuated him from golf course as investigations begin into how suspect got so close Here is how the former president Donald Trump recounted the events of the weekend while speaking on social media on Monday. He told listeners: I was playing golf with some of my friends, it was on a Sunday morning and very peaceful, very beautiful weather, everything was beautiful, it’s a nice place to be. And all of a sudden we heard shots being fired in the air, and I guess probably four or five, and it sounded like bullets. But what do I know about that? But Secret Service knew immediately it was bullets, and they grabbed me. Everybody just, we got into the carts, and we moved along pretty, pretty good. I was with an agent, and the agent did a fantastic job. There was no question that we were off that course. I would have loved to have sank that last putt, but we decided, let’s get out of here. The suspect in the second apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump in as many months was charged in federal court on Monday morning with two gun-related crimes, as urgent investigations began into how he was able to get so close to the former US president Cellphone records showed Ryan Wesley Routh camped out near the golf course for about 12 hours, with food, before being confronted by a Secret Service agent. Ronald Rowe Jr, the US Secret Service acting director, said Routh did not fire any shots Trump added to the already tense atmosphere around the US election campaign by making highly inflammatory remarks, explicitly blaming Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for inciting the attack and calling them -the enemy within- Biden told reporters on Monday that he did not yet have a full report of the Sunday incident at Trump’s Florida golf course, and was thankful Trump was -OK-. He said: -There is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country Florida governor Ron DeSantis said the state was launching its own investigation	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/17/donald-trump-shooting-assassination-attempt-kamala-harris-us-politics-news-latest-updates	2024-09-17T02:06:41-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b83fde7fbbf829bbeb9bfba30d9d2966a96073b/0_269_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b885227304982af61474a8868a589a26

Minister struggles to defend Keir Starmer over his record of accepting freebies – UK politics live	Angela Eagle, border security minister, says prime minister has to answer why he has accepted £76,000 worth of gifts since 2019 election Good morning. The Conservative party may not have provided a great government for Britain, but it was the source of a never-ending supply of scandals, which gave journalists something to write about and provided some confirmation-bias entertainment to people who like that sort of thing. Labour was elected promising a much more ethical approach to government and on the scandal front, so far there has been little to report. At the weekend the Sunday Times gave us -frockgate- (not their term) – the revelation that gifts of clothing to Keir Starmer’s wife had not originally been disclosed in the register of members’ interest. But Starmer said that this was an oversight, that came to light precisely because his staff were double-checking what the rules said, and it has emerged overnight that the Conservative party’s attempt to get the parliamentary commissioner for standards to investigate has failed, because he has said no. So is this all over? Not quite, while Starmer has been broadly successful in refuting claims that he tried to evade parliament’s disclosure rules, he probably has not won over the jury in the court of public opinion on the question of whether he should have accepted so many freebies in the first place.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/17/keir-starmer-gifts-labour-conservatives-lib-dems-uk-politics-news-latest-updates	2024-09-17T01:32:56-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75bc75262fa0ce9d926c191238d1080ad92cbe33/276_566_5724_3434/master/5724.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=62160b53cd19947f136440077862ae81

Middle East crisis live: Netanyahu expands Gaza war aims; Blinken heads to Egypt	War aims now include returning residents to areas in northern Israel that were evacuated after attacks by Hezbollah in Lebanon; US secretary of state heads to Cairo, his 10th visit to region since war began Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza. Israel has expanded its stated goals of the war to include enabling residents to return to communities in northern Israel that have been evacuated due to attacks by Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar has said the Palestinian militant group had the resources to sustain its fight against Israel, with support from Iran-backed regional allies. In a letter to the group’s Yemeni allies, the Houthis, he said -we have prepared ourselves to fight a long war of attrition … our combined efforts with you- and with groups in Lebanon and Iraq -will break this enemy and inflict defeat on it-. Palestinian officials say Israeli airstrikes killed 16 people in the Gaza Strip on Monday, including five women and four children. A strike flattened a home in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing at least 10 people there, according to officials at the Awda hospital, which received the bodies. Another strike on a home in Gaza City killed six people, according to the civil defence first responders. UN secretary general António Guterres has said that -nothing justifies- the collective punishment of the Palestinian people. -We all condemn the terror attacks made by Hamas, as well as the taking of the hostages, that is an absolute violation of international humanitarian law,- he said, before adding -the truth is that nothing justifies the collective punishment of the Palestinian people, and that is what we are witnessing in a dramatic way in Gaza-. Osama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official, told Agence France-Presse that new generations of fighters have been recruited since the 7 October attacks. Polio vaccination coverage in Gaza has reached 90%, the head of the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency said on Monday, adding that the next step was to ensure hundreds of thousands of children got a second dose at the end of the month. The campaign, which began on 1 September, aims to vaccinate 640,000 children in Gaza under 10 years of age against polio. Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to New York on 24 September, the first day of the high-level general debate by world leaders at the annual UN general assembly, his office has said. It said the Israeli prime minister is scheduled to stay until 28 September in the US, which he had visited in July for official talks and a congressional address.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/17/middle-east-crisis-live-netanyahu-expands-gaza-war-aims-blinken-heads-to-egypt	2024-09-17T00:22:45-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/414d38afdea14fc0feb1d75fad6c3ab59ebd8279/0_240_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=511d3d8d119b5ef6a8ab74c24590ff0b

‘Putin, here I am’: man accused of targeting Trump had ‘delusional ideas’ about helping Ukraine	Ryan Wesley Routh spoke to the Guardian in April 2022 when he arrived in Kyiv with a plan to ‘stand with Ukrainians’ In April 2022, a little over a month after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a stream of middle-aged European and American volunteers were passing through Poland on their way into Ukraine. There was the retired attorney delivering sweets to Ukrainian orphanages; the Irish former French Foreign Legion soldier carrying luggage for refugees, and the Englishman who moved from France to help evacuate pets. One American in his 60s was transporting dead frozen chicks from Poland to a zoo in western Ukraine. They called themselves the -silent army- and the -get-off-the-couch-crew-. Ryan Wesley Routh was like them, but less subtle: he was standing in the frenzied station at Przemyśl draped in a US flag. He had thin, blondish hair and a zealous gleam in his eyes, and said he had arrived at the station at 7.30am having travelled for four days – from Hawaii, to Los Angeles, to Krakow, to Przemyśl.

Cooper defends Labour examining Italy’s migrant policies – UK politics live	Home secretary says Starmer’s visit part of ‘pursuing Britain’s interests’ but says Albania-style scheme not an option ‘at the moment’ Good morning. Rishi Sunak had a good relationship with Giorgia Meloni, the leader of a far-right party who became PM in Italy around the same time he did in the UK, and he took a very close interest in what her government is doing to stop irregular migration into her country by back. Keir Starmer has abandoned Sunak’s Rwanda scheme, but not everything has changed in Whitehall and today he is in Italy for talks with Meloni and to see if he can learn anything that might help Labour reduce small boat crossings. In a press release about the trip, Downing Street said: As part of the visit Keir Starmer will discuss with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni her country’s success in tackling irregular migration. Italy has seen a 60 per cent drop in irregular migration by sea over the past year thanks to tough enforcement and international cooperation. Well, we’ve always worked with other democratically elected countries, including those led by political parties that we’re not aligned with. The last Labour government did that. Other governments have done that. That’s just always been the case. It’s part of making sure that we are pursuing Britain’s interests, working internationally with other governments. The areas that I think are important in terms of working with Italy are particularly around tackling organised immigration crime, the smuggler and the trafficking gangs. Italy has been doing this, they have made some significant progress on doing this. The Italian arrangement with Albania is not yet up and running, and we will be interested to see how that develops. We’ve always said we would look at what works. It is a very different kind of programme from the Rwanda one. The Rwanda scheme was run for two and a half years by the Conservatives. They spent £700m on sending four volunteers to Rwanda. That is not a workable programme. It’s not in place at the moment, so no. As we’ve always said, we will look at anything that works. But no, that’s not the scheme that we’re looking at at the moment. What we’re looking at at the moment is developing new Europol taskforces.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/16/keir-starmer-giorgia-meloni-immigration-uk-politics-live	2024-09-16T01:01:46-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9e83f99cf4d41590d19d7deed96ed24aa668320/0_223_6667_4000/master/6667.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a586fb4aac8a3cfa7bf437296953d123

Ex-police chief named head of UK’s border security command	Martin Hewitt’s appointment to tackle small boat crossings comes as PM heads to Italy to learn about its immigration policies The appointment of a former police chief to head the new border security command shows ministers are making serious attempts to stop unofficial Channel crossings rather than the -gimmicks- of the last government, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has said.

Israel-Gaza war: new generations being recruited as conflict continues, senior Hamas official says	Osama Hamdan rejects claim by Israeli defence minister that Hamas ‘no longer exists’ as a military formation Welcome to our live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war and the wider Middle East crisis. I’m Tom Ambrose. A senior Hamas official has told Agence France-Presse that new generations of fighters have been recruited since the 7 October attacks, less than a week after Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant told journalists that Hamas, -no longer exists- as a military formation in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed publicly on Tuesday that three Israeli hostages were mistakenly killed in a strike that also took the life of Hamas’ northern Gaza brigade chief, Ahmed Ghandour, in November. According to reports from Hebrew media, families of Sgt. Ron Sherman, Cpl. Nik Beizer, both 19, and civilian Elia Toledano, 28, who were abducted by Hamas on 7 October, were informed by IDF officials that their loved ones had tragically lost their lives as a result of IDF actions after a comprehensive inquiry. Israel is allegedly recruiting asylum seekers from Africa to take part in military operations in Gaza in exchange for residency rights, according to an investigation by Israel’s daily newspaper Haaretz. According to the report, based on testimonies of asylum seekers and defence officials, speaking off-the-record, Israel’s defence establishment is -offering African asylum seekers who contribute to the war effort in Gaza assistance in obtaining permanent status in Israel-. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to New York on 24 September, the first day of the high-level general debate by world leaders at the annual UN general assembly, his office said Sunday. It said Netanyahu is scheduled to stay until 28 September in the US, which he had visited in July for official talks and a congressional address. A sniper killed a UN worker on the roof of his home in the northern West Bank, the UN has said, as friends and family gathered in Turkey to bury a US-Turkish activist who had been killed by the Israeli military at a protest six days earlier and around 30km away. Sufyan Jaber Abed Jawwad, a sanitation worker with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, was the first Unrwa employee killed in the West Bank in more than a decade. Shot in the early hours of Thursday morning in el Far’a camp, he left behind a wife and five children.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/16/israel-gaza-war-hamas-houthis-netanyahu	2024-09-16T00:26:38-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23f965b9de097297600df38ccb42e1ab77cbbf26/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=701403f800d9a35119c4ddc52710f55a

The NSW Liberal leader, Mark Speakman, said on Sunday his party had -performed strongly- where it had fielded candidates – despite 16 council areas either having no Liberal candidates or fewer than they were meant to.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/sep/16/the-rise-of-the-libertarians-fringe-party-could-win-15-nsw-council-seats-after-liberals-bungle-ntwnfb	2024-09-15T08:00:02-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9b03cdd1d53b08877d694c440f49ed48832ca9a/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=64cabf3d8cfdbb13a6d2f4c79cd9ffcd

River Stour sculpture commemorates 16th century drowning that inspired Shakespeare	Figure of woman on her back underwater draws inspiration from Hamlet’s Ophelia and death of senior Tudor judge Almost 500 years ago, a wealthy and well-connected judge named Sir James Hales walked into the river Stour near Canterbury in order to take his own life. Hales had risen to favour under King Henry VIII, but had refused to convert to Catholicism under the repressive regime of his daughter Mary, and was imprisoned in the Tower of London. Battling with his mental health after his release in 1554, he drowned himself. But as suicide was a crime at the time, his widow was denied the right to inherit his property and so took the matter to law, in a case that became so famous in the 16th century that it inspired Shakespeare’s portrayal of the suicide by drowning of Hamlet’s Ophelia.	https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/sep/15/river-stour-sculpture-commemorates-16th-century-drowning-that-inspired-shakespeare	2024-09-15T07:45:04-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8f50514b9bd91dbcbd79e5aa0dfaf2a4346826a/0_158_7373_4426/master/7373.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=92af2a800c1f6335f6b616ef3c5d78b6

Saudi Arabia calls for more pressure on Iran as Houthi threat grows	Diplomat says ‘pinprick bombings’ by west insufficient to constrain supply of weapons to group in Yemen The claimed acquisition by Yemen’s Houthi rebels of hypersonic missiles capable of penetrating Israeli air defences threatens to further heighten Middle East tensions, as Saudi Arabia calls for more than -pinprick bombings- to constrain the supply of weapons to the group. Saudi Arabia, which supports the Yemen government opposing the Houthis, believes Iran has been arming the group, including with the weapons used in the attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Those attacks have led to a halving of the traffic on the Red Sea route, pushing up the costs of maritime transport and damaging the Egyptian economy through disruption to the Suez canal.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/15/saudi-arabia-iran-houthi-threat-yemen-israel-red-sea	2024-09-15T07:13:57-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b33177f72767bc6f9e40a11bc3c38cdcfb80c01/0_226_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5f31c7cb371923ac420085b9b4cba6c2

Yimby stands for -yes in my back yard- – a play on the traditional nimbys, who have been a dominant force in British politics where planning has been one of the thorniest battlefields.

Middle East crisis live: UN worker killed by Israeli sniper in West Bank; Israel reports missile from Yemen	Sufyan Jaber Abed Jawwad was the first Unrwa employee killed in the West Bank in more than a decade; missile hit unpopulated area, Israel military says Welcome back to our live coverage on the Israel-Gaza war and the wider Middle East crisis. I’m Tom Ambrose. The UN says a sniper killed one of its employees on the roof of his home in the northern West Bank. Sufyan Jaber Abed Jawwad, a sanitation worker with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, was the first Unrwa employee killed in the West Bank in more than a decade. Mourners gathered in the Aegean town of Didim, south-west Turkey, on Saturday for the funeral of a US-Turkish activist, who was shot dead while protesting Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. The killing last week of 26-year-old Aysenur Ezgi Eygi has sparked international condemnation and angered Turkey, further escalating tensions over the war in Gaza. A large crowd gathered during the prayers including Eygi’s family, members of president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Islamic-rooted AKP party, and activists advocating the Palestinian cause. Erdoğan has vowed to ensure -that Aysenur Ezgi’s death does not go unpunished-. The Israeli military has said it was likely Eygi was hit -unintentionally- by forces while they were responding to a -violent riot-, and said it is looking into the case. Israeli airstrikes hit central and southern Gaza overnight into Saturday, killing at least 14 people, Gaza’s civil defence agency said.-We have recovered the bodies of 11 martyrs, including four children and three women, after an Israeli airstrike hit the house of the Bustan family in eastern Gaza City,- agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told Agence France-Presse (AFP). The strike took place near the Shujaiya school in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, he said. The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the strike. Bassal said Israeli forces carried out similar strikes in some other parts of the territory overnight, killing at least 10 people. Five people were killed in northwestern Gaza City when an airstrike hit a group of people near Dar Al-Arqam school, he said. Three others were killed in a strike in the al-Mawasi area of the southern Khan Younis governorate, where tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge, Bassal added. At least 41,182 Palestinians have been killed and 95,280 others injured in Israel’s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October, Gaza’s health ministry said on Saturday. The toll includes 64 deaths in the previous 48 hours, according to the ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and militants in its count. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) disaster risk management teams, in cooperation with the Palestine Ministry of Social Development, distributed food parcels to 11,000 families in Gaza and North Gaza governantes, the humanitarian organisation shared on X. Richard Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) representative in Gaza and the West Bank, said in a statement on Saturday that he is -hopeful these pauses will hold- as the UN agency prepare for the next round of polio vaccinations in Gaza in four week’s time. About 559,000 children under the age of 10 have recovered from their first dose, the WHO said, as part of a campaign to inoculate children in Gaza. The second doses are expected to begin later this month as part of an effort in which the WHO said parties had already agreed to. A new attempt has begun to try to salvage an oil tanker burning in the Red Sea after attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, an EU naval mission said on Saturday. The EU’s Operation Aspides published images dated Saturday of its vessels escorting ships heading to the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/15/middle-east-crisis-live-un-worker-killed-by-israeli-sniper-in-west-bank-israel-reports-missile-from-yemen	2024-09-15T00:15:47-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45436a8677cd84d954db47f1a6f43c6c9e70a116/0_118_5088_3053/master/5088.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0f626ea192c4bcc5d3a0228da83d94bf

Financial leaders and party insiders warn Starmer: we need less gloom, more optimism	PM told his downbeat tone risks putting off investors and that his conference speech must temper realism with hope The government’s gloomy diagnosis of the state of Britain is imperilling the private investment needed to secure economic growth, City figures are warning, amid widespread calls for Keir Starmer to inject more optimism in his Labour conference speech later this month. The prime minister has spent his first months in power setting out the dire inheritance his party has been left by the outgoing Conservative government, most notably a £22bn black hole left in the public finances this year.

Military officers played a prominent role in the funeral because Cheptegei held the rank of sergeant in Uganda’s army, said military spokesperson Brig Felix Kulayigye, adding that she deserved a -gun salute that befits her rank-.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/14/thousands-attend-funeral-of-runner-rebecca-cheptegei-set-on-fire-by-partner	2024-09-14T11:43:22-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b439e76dd664d0242db3cf4ea995a50d0b7dbf0e/0_304_4581_2749/master/4581.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a2d34c6f70c41d65162f735a7127cebd

Nurseries in England say new rules have reduced care to ‘crowd control’	The first study into Tory shake-up of childcare shows staff are overwhelmed The first major study into the Conservatives’ controversial shake-up of childcare has revealed that nursery staff are often doing more -crowd control- than education, because of the increased number of children they are looking after. Since September last year, nurseries in England have been allowed to increase child-to-staff ratios, so one adult now looks after five two-year-olds rather than four. The change was intended to help deliver the party’s pledge of 15 hours’ free childcare a week from this month for working parents of children aged from nine months to three years.	https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/sep/14/nurseries-in-england-say-new-rules-have-reduced-care-to-crowd-control	2024-09-14T11:11:56-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b096a01c1ebad798f4ff3952cb48754167f8399/0_214_3700_2221/master/3700.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fcf3210014a70150a88ae9e3ed4e126f

Fury in Turkey as animal lovers and politicians attack ‘massacre law’ to deal with 4m stray dogs	A new bill forcing local authorities to remove homeless animals from city streets has led to a furious backlash Next to the network of the highways that crisscross Turkey, among the lush forests or mountain peaks that dot the country, large stray dogs are a common sight. Most are pale white Akbaş dogs or Kangal shepherds, with their distinctive dark muzzle, pale golden coat and large bodies designed to herd livestock, although on the streets of Istanbul they are more commonly found lazing outside coffee shops, rotund and docile from a lifetime of treats. In cities at least, the stray dogs are popular enough to be seen as part of the architecture. One particularly large and sleepy example that dozes outside an ice-cream shop on Istanbul’s main shopping street has become a local celebrity nicknamed -The Boulder-, complete with a string of rave reviews left by delighted tourists. The dog is marked as an Istanbul tourist attraction on Google Maps, which features a recommendation to avoid petting him.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/14/fury-in-turkey-animal-lovers-politicians-attack-massacre-law-to-deal-with-4m-stray-dogs	2024-09-14T08:00:31-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38d67fa50e9df4e5e2b4fbd01bb4644038009687/0_88_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=93ff0b0427e49fbd74a2657123d7d68e

His works make headlines when they sell, from the record-breaking moment his Irises went for £27m at Sotheby’s in 1987, right up to this month’s predicted hoopla in Hong Kong, where Christie’s are to auction his riverside scene, Moored Boats, painted two years earlier, for an estimated $30-50m – likely to set a record for works from his later, Parisian period. The Dutch artist’s dramatic renderings of simple things – plants, trees, furniture and faces – are international emblems of the way we value art. So much so that London’s National Gallery’s renowned 1888 sunflower painting was deliberately targeted last year by Just Stop Oil climate activists, who lobbed the contents of a soup tin at it.	https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/sep/14/vincent-van-gogh-national-gallery-show-dispel-tortured-genius-label	2024-09-14T06:00:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f696fe64aa50dfd8f4e48f4130f4c658220aafd3/0_74_2480_1487/master/2480.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=53a3b543e189a9482e2f3f9bcab49394

A day in Elon Musk’s mind: 145 tweets with election conspiracies and emojis	A controversial tweet may make it to the news, but reading every post from the world’s richest man shows how frenzied and extreme he really is It’s just after midnight mountain standard time in the US on 13 August when Elon Musk makes his first post of the day on X, the platform he bought for $44bn when it was known as Twitter. Musk has been tweeting for hours about his interview with Donald Trump, and he will continue into the night before taking a few hours’ break – presumably to sleep – and then logging back on to tweet dozens more times. Over the next 24 hours, Musk will post over 145 times about a range of obsessions, projects and grievances to his 195 million followers. He will share anti-immigrant content, election conspiracies and attacks against the media. He will exchange tweets with far-right politicians, conservative media influencers and sycophantic admirers. He will send a litany of one-word replies that say -yeah-, -interesting- or simply feature a cry-laughing emoji.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/14/elon-musk-tweets-trump-conspiracy	2024-09-14T00:30:20-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4cc96605ac8d669a0007d1274ea61ef93ee02d5/0_159_4554_2732/master/4554.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=db3abf10479f4204ce3a1f992508ec77
Russia-Ukraine war live: Nato chief says group could have done more to prevent war	Nato should have done more to arm Ukraine before the war, the alliance’s outgoing head Jens Stoltenberg said Nato could have done more to arm Ukraine to try to prevent Russia’s invasion in 2022, the outgoing head of the western military alliance said in an interview released on Saturday. -Now we provide military stuff to a war – then we could have provided military stuff to prevent the war,- Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg told German weekly newspaper FAS. Keir Starmer and Joe Biden have discussed letting Ukraine fire long-range, western-supplied missiles into Russia, while stopping short of any formal announcement. Vladimir Putin has threatened it would amount to Nato joining the war. The UK prime minister told reporters at the White House that he had a -wide-ranging discussion about strategy- with the US president but that it was not just a meeting about -a particular capability-. Biden dismissed Vladimir Putin’s sabre-rattling threats, saying he did not accept that Ukraine using Storm Shadows missiles against Russia proper would amount to Nato going to war with Moscow, reports Dan Sabbagh in Washington. -I do not think much about Vladimir Putin,- Biden said. Moscow’s ambassador to the UN told the security council on Friday that loosening the missile strike restrictions would mark an escalation to -direct war- between Moscow and Nato. Washington officials accused Putin of trying to scare Nato countries away from supporting Ukraine, reports Andrew Roth. In Europe, leaders played down Putin’s threats. The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said: -I would not attach excessive importance to the latest statements from President Putin. They rather show the difficult situation the Russians have on the front.- Zelenskiy said the Ukrainian incursion into Russia’s border region of Kursk had produced the desired result of slowing Moscow’s advance on another front in Ukraine’s east. The Ukrainian president said in Kyiv on Friday that Russia’s counterattack in Kursk produced no major successes – contradicting Vladimir Putin’s accounts of Russian advances on both fronts. Zelenskiy said Russia had about 40,000 troops on the Kursk front. -So far we have seen no serious [Russian] success.- Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday its troops had taken back 10 villages out of 100 that Kyiv had occupied. The battlefield reports of either side were not able to be independently verified. The Ukrainian general staff said on Friday that Russian forces had focused their assaults near the town of Kurakhove, about 33km (20 miles) south of the key logistics hub of Pokrovsk in Ukraine’s Donetsk region. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had captured Dolynivka, positioned between Pokrovsk and Kurakhove, the latest in a series of localities Moscow says it has seized. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said 49 Ukrainian prisoners of war had been returned from Russia, with Agence France-Presse witnessing the group being greeted at the border with Belarus. The Ukrainian president did not clarify whether it was part of an exchange with Russia, as is usually the case, but AFP journalists had earlier seen Russian prisoners of war being loaded on to a bus near the border. Romania started training its first group of Ukrainian F-16 pilots this week, the Nato country’s defence ministry said. The first four pilots had started their -theoretical training-, a ministry spokesperson told AFP, with practical training to follow -towards the end of the year-. Drone fragments fell on a municipal building in Kyiv’s Obolon district north of the city centre early on Saturday, said the mayor. Writing on Telegram, Vitali Klitschko said no fire broke out and emergency services were sent. He earlier said air defence units had been in action. A Reuters witness said explosions were heard. The head of Kyiv’s military administration, Serhiy Popko, urged people to remain in shelters as drones still posed a threat. The air raid alert was later lifted for the city but remained in effect for several regions of central Ukraine.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-nato-putin-zelenskiy	2024-09-14T00:15:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c90b934ace43b3316bbab25cf76ffc271c8d7cea/0_399_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3006091132510ef6b51eb7d30c3502fe

Israel’s prime target: the hunt for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar	Motivated pursuers using advanced technology and brute force have yet to pin down their cautious quarry. Would his death or capture stop the war? A group of Israel hostages were huddled in a tunnel in Gaza a few days after they had been dragged from their homes on 7 October, when the man who had plotted their abduction appeared out of the subterranean gloom. His hair and beard were grey and his dark-ringed eyes stared out from under thick black brows. It was a face familiar to them from a thousand broadcasts and newspaper stories: Yahya Sinwar. The Hamas leader in Gaza was the most feared man in Israel, even before he ordered the October raid in which 1,200 people – two-thirds of them civilians – were killed and 250 taken hostage.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/14/hunt-for-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-israel-prime-target	2024-09-13T21:00:16-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43f1a111810d2f9ce6986d5e0ca8e3d0c8bd0ded/0_138_6236_3743/master/6236.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f39091bea004e9d4eb90879ac8067b1e

US election live updates: Harris pushes for second debate with Trump: ‘We owe it to voters’	Harris campaign releases memo blasting Trump for ‘toxic positions’ he took during this week’s debate, saying he should respond to them Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump may have put the kibosh on another debate against Kamala Harris yesterday, but the vice-president isn’t letting the matter rest. Yesterday, Harris told a crowd in North Carolina that -I believe we owe it to the voters to have another debate-, and this morning, her campaign released a memo blasting Trump for the -toxic positions- he took during their encounter, and saying he should respond to them – implicitly in the form of another debate against the vice-president. The Harris campaign has said it would be happy to participate in such an event next month, but that would require Trump to reverse his position. Expect the former president to elaborate on the subject around 12pm ET, when he holds a press conference in Los Angeles. Here’s what else is going on today: Harris campaigns at 6.35pm ET in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, the swing state that some believe will be the most important in deciding the outcome of this election. Tim Walz, Harris’s running mate, is campaigning in the two other Great Lake swing states, Michigan and Wisconsin. Joe Biden welcomes the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, to the White House at 4.30pm, for his first visit since taking office in July.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/13/trump-harris-us-election	2024-09-13T06:10:45-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2ad08bfb384702048bcccf88ce005984d88f328/0_0_4917_2950/master/4917.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0be61d3a6e1a4ffca12fb6402feca151

First Thing: Putin warns Nato over Ukraine missiles	First Thing: Putin’s warning follows suggestions US may lift restrictions on Ukraine using long-range weapons. Plus, Bernardine Evaristo on the books of her life Good morning. Vladimir Putin has said that a western move to let Kyiv use long-range weapons against targets inside Russia would mean Nato would be -at war- with Moscow. How do the US and UK see things? Blinken and the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, say Russia is escalating the war by accepting weapons from Iran. -The escalator here is Putin. Putin has escalated with the shipment of missiles from Iran. We see a new axis of Russia, Iran and North Korea,- Lammy said. What’s the latest in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine? Russian troops have recaptured a swathe of villages in the Kursk region, dealing a significant blow to Ukraine’s military incursion into Russia. What do the UN’s aid figures say? In July, an average of 100 trucks entered each day, largely through the southern Kerem Shalom crossing. This number halved in August, while just 147 trucks have entered so far in September, although the UN added that there may be gaps in the reporting because of the dangers of staff monitoring aid entry at crossing points. How many aid workers have been killed in Israel’s offensive? An estimated 280 humanitarian workers, most employed by Unrwa, have been killed in Gaza, according to the UN’s office of humanitarian affairs.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/13/first-thing-putin-warns-lifting-ukraine-missile-restrictions-put-nato-at-war-with-russia	2024-09-13T02:58:17-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12650a2e2c1ed98298764871750cd41f74958188/0_254_3811_2287/master/3811.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c4c03338c59cd27bbfae5710ad6c48bd

Russia-Ukraine war live: Russian counter-offensive reported in Kursk	Moscow said it had defeated Ukrainian units in a number of villages but there was no independent confirmation or immediate comment from Ukraine Russian forces have begun a significant counter-offensive against Ukrainian troops in Russia’s Kursk region, according to pro-Moscow war bloggers and a senior Russian commander. Pro-Ukrainian observers also reported heavy fighting in part of the occupied area and the possible Russian recapture of villages. Ukraine’s air force said on Thursday it had shot down 44 out of 64 drones launched by Russia overnight. Russian forces also used five missiles, the air force added in a statement posted on the Telegram messaging app. The Institute for the Study of War said on Thursday morning that it would be -premature to draw conclusions- about the counterattacks at this stage. The thinktank reported: -Russian forces began counterattacks along the western edge of the Ukrainian salient in Kursk oblast and reportedly seized several settlements north-east and south of Korenevo on September 10 and 11.- The ISW continued: -The size, scale, and potential prospects of the September 11 Russian counterattacks in Kursk oblast are unclear and the situation remains fluid as of this report … Ukrainian forces reportedly began new attacks against the Russian counterattack west of Snagost and throughout the Ukrainian salient in Kursk oblast.- Maj Gen Apti Alaudinov, who commands Chechnya’s Akhmat special forces fighting in Kursk, said Russian troops had gone on the offensive and taken back control of about 10 settlements in Kursk. The UK’s foreign secretary, David Lammy, and his US counterpart Antony Blinken have returned to Poland after their visit to Ukraine. The pair took the overnight train from Kyiv and crossed into eastern Poland at 6.30am local time. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, gave his strongest hint yet that the White House is about to lift its restrictions on Ukraine using long-range weapons supplied by the west on key military targets inside Russia. A decision is understood to have already been made in private. Blinken and the British foreign secretary, David Lammy, met with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, in Kyiv on Wednesday. British government sources indicated that a decision had already been made to allow Ukraine to use Storm Shadow cruise missiles on targets inside Russia, although it is not expected to be publicly announced on Friday when Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, meets Joe Biden in Washington DC.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/12/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-counter-offensive-latest-news	2024-09-12T00:45:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b50bf117583c507368285b54be5163a749ce0333/289_0_1973_1184/master/1973.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=abfd9b8a2087c6dd64c9dcab0f10e7f0
Starmer to deliver damning verdict on how Tories left NHS and set out reform vision – UK politics live	The prime minister will deliver a speech this morning after Lord Darzi’s damning report on the NHS Good morning. Keir Starmer has been in office for just over two months, and for much of that time the government has focused on trying to explain to the public just how bad was the legacy the left by the Tories. There has been extensive focus on the economy, and on prisons. Today Starmer is focusing on the NHS. And, arguably, this is the most important issue at all. According to polling by More in Common, at the next election the single issue most likely to determine whether Labour has succeeded or not is whether NHS waiting lists have fallen. The state of the NHS isn’t an accident. The health service was hit by three big shocks. The 2010s saw the biggest slowdown in funding since it was founded in 1948. The next big shock was the top-down reorganisation of the NHS, which threw it into chaos for years. Then came the shock of the Covid pandemic, which hit the NHS harder than other similar countries – largely because of the other two shocks. People have every right to be angry. It’s not just because the NHS is so personal to all of us - it’s because some of these failings are life and death. Take the waiting times in A&amp;E. That’s not just a source of fear and anxiety - it’s leading to avoidable deaths. This government is working at pace to build a 10-year plan. Something so different from anything that has come before. Instead of the top-down approach of the past, this plan is going to have the fingerprints of NHS staff and patients all over it.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/12/keir-starmer-nhs-darzi-report-labour-tories-uk-politics	2024-09-12T00:44:44-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db6d795e2fe283253e125ebe262be8da0f3c8592/0_61_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=70c8d1657a063a83853383ff505f650a

Israel-Gaza war live: UN chief condemns ‘violations’ of humanitarian law after six Unrwa staff killed in Israeli airstrike	António Guterres calls Israeli strike on Gaza school sheltering displaced people ‘unacceptable’, after local authorities report 18 killed in attack Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war. UN chief António Guterres has condemned an Israeli airstrike on a central Gaza school being used as a shelter for displaced Palestinians that killed 18 people, according to the Hamas-run territory’s civil defence agency. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of Unrwa, has said that the staff who died in Wednesday’s attack had been providing support to families who had sought refuge in the school, and that at least 220 of his agency’s staff had been killed in Gaza since the start of the war. Elsewhere on Wednesday, a strike hit a home near the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, killing 11 people, including six brothers and sisters ranging from 21 months to 21 years old, according to the European hospital, which received the casualties. Hamas said on Wednesday that its negotiators had reiterated their readiness to implement an -immediate- ceasefire with Israel in Gaza based on a previous US proposal without new conditions from any party. The group said in a statement that their negotiation team, led by senior official Khalil al-Hayya, had met mediators in Doha to discuss the latest developments in Gaza. CIA director William Burns, who is also the chief US negotiator on Gaza, said on Saturday that a more detailed ceasefire proposal would be made in the next several days. The previous proposal put forward by president Joe Biden in June laid out a three-phase ceasefire in return for the release of Israeli hostages. However lingering issues, including control of the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow stretch of land on Gaza’s border with Egypt, remain. Joe Biden has described the Israel Defense Force’s fatal shooting of the Turkish American protester Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi as -totally unacceptable- in his first extensive comments on her death. In a statement on Wednesday, Biden said that Israel had -acknowledged responsibility- for Eygi’s death, but he stopped short of backing the demands put out by Eygi’s family and other human rights advocates for an independent inquiry into the fatal shooting of the American activist at a protest in the West Bank town of Beita last week.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/12/israel-gaza-war-unrwa-middle-east-hamas-latest-news	2024-09-11T23:17:46-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a381f3fc35c00b987cbc4cd429e55064e4822ac/0_164_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0baa61c40137efac4c38b79dea355f3b

Thursday briefing: How the long-awaited renters’ reform bill could transform housing as we know it	In today’s newsletter: Labour’s new plans aim to shut the door on unscrupulous landlords. But what will change for the millions of people renting? • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. In 2019, Theresa May’s Conservative party pledged to end no-fault evictions (that is, where landlords oust tenants without giving a reason), and introduced the first iteration of the renters’ reform bill. But pressure from lobbyists, interest groups and Tory backbenchers who were themselves landlords led to countless delays and the eventual watering down of the proposals. Charities and advocacy groups expressed concern about the sloth-like progress of the bill, but that did little to hurry the previous government. US election 2024 | Donald Trump’s campaign was in damage control mode on Wednesday amid widespread dismay among supporters over a presidential debate performance that saw Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, repeatedly goad him into going wildly off-message and missing apparent opportunities to tackle her on policy.

Harris, in a televised debate with Donald Trump on Tuesday night in Philadelphia, rebuffed the former president’s claim that she will end fracking -on day one- if elected by touting booming levels of drilling during her term as vice-president, in which US oil and gas production has hit record highs.

Harris was strongest at debate when talking about abortion while Trump relied on tired old lies	Harris spoke passionately about women’s personal experiences post-Roe, as Trump repeated his usual extreme rhetoric Throughout his 2024 campaign for president, Donald Trump has avoided giving straight, consistent or accurate answers to questions about abortion – and in his first debate appearance against Kamala Harris, Trump kept up that streak. Moderators introduced abortion, one of the biggest issues in the election, by asking about the most recent example of Trump’s incoherence on the topic: his position on a Florida ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights into the state’s constitution. Over the last few weeks, Trump initially suggested that he would vote in favor of the measure – which would restore abortion rights in a state that has banned the procedure past six weeks of pregnancy – before quickly backtracking amid outrage from his anti-abortion base.

Europe watches Harris-Trump debate for clues on direction US may take	Diplomats most struck by Republican’s refusal to say whether he wanted Ukraine to defeat Vladimir Putin The TV debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump was as keenly watched by European diplomats and politicians as US voters, eager to see who may be next in the White House and – crucially – the direction a vital ally may next take. One diplomat said they empathised when Harris adopted a series of poses that ranged from pity, bemusement and genuine curiosity about what craziness would emerge from Trump’s mouth next as she listened to his conspiracy-laden theories. However, the diplomat said they still did not underestimate Trump and the hold he had over one part of a divided America, adding: -Never write him off.-	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/11/harris-trump-debate-europe-diplomats-us-ukraine-putin	2024-09-11T04:49:00-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/218ce4917cc917b68492f3a6847a51ae91aada40/0_142_5740_3446/master/5740.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0e2605d7198adcbde795362c3b8c1791

Harris comes out swinging in presidential debate | First Thing	Kamala Harris kept Donald Trump on the defensive as he devolved into bizarre and false tangents about crowd sizes, abortion and immigration. Plus: how to get a better night’s sleep Good morning. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump faced off in a presidential debate in Philadelphia on Tuesday, with Harris landing a number of blows as Trump spouted bizarre falsehoods about abortion and immigration. What were the most memorable moments? After Harris wrapped one remark with a jab about Trump’s crowd sizes, Trump began to ramble – about immigrants eating people’s pets. -In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats,- said Trump. -They’re eating the pets of the people that live there.- ABC moderators interjected to say that the city manager of Springfield, Ohio, told the network there were no credible reports of specific claims of pets being harmed by individuals within the immigrant community. How did the moderators do? ABC’s moderators David Muir and Linsey Daviswere largely praised for factchecking Trump’s falsehoods and rerouting discussions back to the questions. When Trump falsely accused Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, of calling for abortion in the ninth month and -execution after birth-, Davis responded: -There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it’s born.- Another boost for Harris: After the debate concluded, superstar Taylor Swift endorsed Harris on Instagram, signing the post as -childless cat lady- in a jab at misogynistic comments made by the Republican vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/11/first-thing-kamla-harris-comes-out-swinging-in-presidential-debate-donald-trump	2024-09-11T03:12:58-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/084f25597fc1fa122c698721c495516ba33240c2/0_286_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=422b71d618418c4d2094199d10ff04af

Keir Starmer to face PMQs as latest figures show economy stalling over summer – UK politics live	Prime minister faces Rishi Sunak after figures show growth is flatlining Good morning. Keir Starmer faces PMQs later today. It is only his third as prime minister, but there is not much novelty factor left, perhaps because his non-performative, serious, ‘government of service’ focus has been evident for some years. This afternoon he is likely to face more questions about the decision to means-test the winter fuel payment. But growth figures out this morning are also important – not because they reflect badly on the government (Labour was not even in office at the start of July), but because they illustrate the size of the challenge it faces. Starmer and Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, say boosting growth is their top priority. But this morning’s figures show that, in July, there was no growth at all. It was the second month in a row where the economy flatlined. Larry Elliott has the details here.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/11/pmqs-keir-starmer-labour-rishi-sunak-conservatives-latest-uk-politics-live-updates	2024-09-11T00:57:41-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0590d7f31115ef151cf95443f0932d32471b24ba/0_109_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=46b71b86be2f5d042a82202cb2f622e4

Wednesday briefing: Trump takes the bait on night that could transform the presidential race	In today’s newsletter: His advisors wanted him to tie Harris to the Biden administration – but instead he lost his temper. Here are the key moments • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. If you had a sinking feeling on June 28 when you woke up to the news that Joe Biden had turned in an utterly incoherent debate performance, you will probably have a bit more appetite for your boiled egg this time. A few hours ago, the only scheduled debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris came to an end – and even Fox News said Harris won. Democrats’ moods can only have been improved by the news, a few minutes after it ended, that Taylor Swift had endorsed Harris, and signed her post -childless cat lady-. And CNN’s snap poll suggested that voters thought Harris won by a margin of 63% to 37% – nearly as big a margin as Trump achieved over Biden last time around. Key to Harris’ success was baiting her opponent into rants on marginal topics, instead of talking about the issues that voters are interested in. Winter fuel allowance | MPs have voted to remove the winter fuel allowance from all but the poorest pensioners in England and Wales. Just one Labour MP, Jon Trickett, voted for the opposition motion but 52 abstained – at the higher end of predictions.

Israel-Gaza war | Israeli airstrikes on al-Mawasi -humanitarian zone- in the Gaza Strip have killed at least 19 people and injured a further 60, according to witnesses and medical officials in the blockaded Palestinian territory. Port Talbot steelworks | The British steel industry is braced for 2,500 job cuts at the Port Talbot steelworks, with thousands more jobs at risk in the UK, as the government prepares a taxpayer-backed deal for the south Wales plant.

Trump reels off falsehoods on abortion and immigration in debate with Harris	Presidential candidates meet for first time in fiery face-off as moderators fact-check Trump’s statements Kamala Harris and Donald Trump sparred on Tuesday in a contentious presidential debate that repeatedly went off the rails, as Trump pursued bizarre and often falsehood-ridden tangents about crowd sizes, immigration policy and abortion access. The Philadelphia debate marked arguably the most significant opportunity for both Harris and Trump since Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race in July, and the event began cordially enough. Harris crossed over to Trump’s podium to shake his hand and introduce herself, an acknowledgement that the two presidential nominees had never met face to face before Tuesday night.

UK arms donated to Ukraine would cost £2.71bn to replace, says watchdog	Figure is largely in addition to £7.8bn committed since Russia’s invasion, says National Audit Office report Britain has donated arms and equipment to Ukraine that would cost £2.71bn to replace, largely in addition to the £7.8bn committed by prime ministers since Russia’s full-scale invasion, according to a National Audit Office report. The cost of replacing missiles, artillery and other munitions also significantly exceeds their £171.5m value on the government’s books, because the Ministry of Defence wants to replace the old weapons supplied at current prices.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/sep/11/uk-arms-donated-to-ukraine-would-cost-271bn-to-replace-says-watchdog	2024-09-10T16:00:54-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60dd72361bf2067e051bc32575332be8add50aee/0_116_8070_4842/master/8070.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0676454f96437ff6306d25d6895971b4
Trump-Harris debate live: presidential nominees to face off in high-stakes showdown	Harris and Trump expected to go on attack when debate kicks off at 9pm ET, as polls show one of tightest US election races ever Good evening, US politics blog readers, and thanks for joining us as we cover tonight’s debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, which we expect to be a milestone in what has already been a historically tumultuous presidential race. The two contenders are set to square off for 90 minutes at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, with ABC News hosting and their anchors, David Muir and Linsey Davis, moderating. The Democratic and Republican candidates are meeting as polls indicate a neck-in-neck race between them, particularly in the seven swing states expected to decide the winner. This will be Harris’s first debate against Trump since she became the Democratic standard bearer. Joe Biden and Trump faced off in June, but the president put in such a poor showing that it sparked a plunge in his poll numbers and a Democratic pressure campaign that contributed to his decision to end his bid for a second term. Though Harris has been vice-president since 2021, she has done only one formal interview since launching her presidential campaign, and polls have indicated that voters are looking to find out more about her plans, if elected. This debate could present her with the opportunity to do that – while, for Trump, he’ll be given the chance to make the case for his return to the White House. Will either candidate deliver a knockout blow to the other? Biden certainly received one when he encountered Trump just over two months ago, though he was far from the only candidate to emerge from a debate with their campaign hanging by a thread. Will Trump say something insensitive about Harris’s racial identity? Just days after she launched her campaign, the former president claimed that the vice-president was not really Black, sparking outrage. What will Harris say about her policies? She inherited a campaign from Biden, but has slowly deviated from some of his proposals. Look out for anything she has to say about US support to Israel, and her previous stances toward immigration – a subject Trump is sure to bring up.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/10/harris-trump-presidential-debate-updates	2024-09-10T15:44:31-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dee6de38a9282a6105cc4a04617a2016276d0d3e/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b35e7fbf64d30a0fe9ba02a62582d59b

‘We’ll get the blame’: tensions simmer within Labour over winter fuel cut	While Commons rebellion was small-scale, behind the scenes, anger over handling of the policy is said to run high In the end, the vote to cut the winter fuel allowance passed easily. Hundreds of loyalist Labour MPs tramped through the lobbies to back the government’s controversial plan. No 10 will hope the heat has gone out of the issue. But despite dodging a major rebellion, plenty in government were not taking much comfort from the result.

Family of Ethel Rosenberg say US document proves she was no Soviet spy	Sons whose mother was executed with her husband Julius in 1953 say newly released document proves innocence The family of Ethel Rosenberg, who was sent to the electric chair along with her husband, Julius, in 1953 after being convicted of spying for the Soviets at the height of the Red Scare, have called on Joe Biden to formally exonerate her after a newly released document appeared to show that the US government knew she was not a spy. The couple maintained their innocence until the end and the case of the Rosenbergs has long been seen as a possible miscarriage of justice. Though most historians see Julius Rosenberg as a real Soviet spy, questions about Ethel Rosenberg’s role have lingered and their sons, Robert and Michael Meeropol, have long campaigned in their family’s cause.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/10/ethel-rosenberg-soviet-spy-new-evidence	2024-09-10T11:54:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/feff2c823c1ff9388af862e2dd64f2f92fe7ff5f/0_384_2008_1204/master/2008.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03f0cda00c2c53121770d8bb94c1ba64

He was elected on a promise to lift sanctions and develop more balanced relations with the east and west, especially Europe. The bulk of his diplomatic appointments, including the retention of the former foreign minister Javad Zarif as an adviser, underscored that intention, and already a lively debate had started in Tehran about the extent to which Iran and Russia’s interests truly aligned.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/10/irans-missile-supply-to-moscow-may-reveal-true-scale-of-pezeshkians-powers	2024-09-10T11:03:09-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e737fb2721e6d34f90502b25159275cfd54e8db/0_43_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fc1690befccaf7bb5312d1b032d7e46d

Spanish judge shelves landmark case of Franco-era torture victim	Julio Pacheco says he will appeal against the ‘devastating’ decision to abandon the first such investigation in Spain Hopes of securing justice for people tortured under the four-decade Franco dictatorship in Spain have suffered a major setback after a judge in Madrid shelved a landmark investigation into a teenager tortured by police three months before the dictator’s death. Julio Pacheco was a 19-year-old student and anti-Franco activist when he was arrested in August 1975 on suspicion of involvement in the murder of a police officer.

Georgia governor Brian Kemp weighs options on state election board problem	Georgia’s election board has more drama than Kemp would like. Attorney general’s advice isn’t giving him an easy out As Georgia governor Brian Kemp’s wrestles with what to do with a seemingly wayward state board of elections that is drawing national criticism for last-hour changes to the state’s election practices borne of stop-the-steal election activism, the state attorney general declined to make his job any easier. Kemp asked Republican attorney general Chris Carr to render a legal opinion about the governor’s legal obligation to hold a hearing and potentially remove board members, in light of two ethics complaints filed against the board since a raucous hearing in July raised questions about the legality of the board’s actions. Three board members – Rick Jeffares, Dr Janice Johnston and Janelle King – have attempted to reopen investigation into the 2020 election, citing a finding of error in Fulton county and the continuation of lawsuits by election denialists.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/10/brian-kemp-chistopher-carr-georgia-state-election-board	2024-09-10T09:09:24-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/811998d02f0569c087d1e0426b9543c5aad18e7c/0_96_5601_3361/master/5601.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c8406d0add40145c5ea3ddc1762efc92

The jobless rate (which fell from 4.2% to 4.1%), the number of people in work, the level of vacancies and the days lost through strikes all convey important information about the state of the economy.	https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/sep/10/uk-wages-figures-state-pension-interest-rates-rachel-reeves	2024-09-10T00:19:41-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb749882a41c28aa74a5cc0101d16bf694cb9045/22_10_5708_3425/master/5708.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=36c8d0a1e0c23e9dfb058b08ff44d02f

On Sunday, the start of the working week, traffic choked the city centre for the first time in nearly two weeks after roads were repaired; street vendors sold peaches and the first of the season’s pomegranates as the city slowly came back to life. But in some places, sewage still flowed through streets dug up by military bulldozers. Many burnt-out buildings showed signs of fierce fighting, the upper floors now peppered with bullet holes and broken windows. Water and electricity infrastructure was severely damaged, and it is not clear when these services will be restored.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/10/jenin-west-bank-normality-idf-israel-deadly-raids	2024-09-09T21:00:38-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5248d890eb52522c284331a36c4bce089aea6e93/0_550_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=230386181c3f9f91148258fa49a29798

DoJ warns states over voter purges – as it happened	Pew report says 49% of voters would choose Harris, with the same number planning to vote for Trump; justice officials remind states about voting laws The statement of support for Kamala Harris by a group of retired top military officials comes a day before the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, and the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, will host a congressional gold medal ceremony honoring the 13 service members killed in the chaotic 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal. Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans have tried to blame Harris for the Afghanistan pullout, including in a report by House GOP lawmakers today. Our investigation reveals the Biden-Harris administration had the information and opportunity to take necessary steps to plan for the inevitable collapse of the Afghan government. At each step of the way, however, the administration picked optics over security. Without involving the Afghan government, he and his administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban that freed 5,000 Taliban fighters and allowed them to return to the battlefield. This chaotic approach severely hindered the Biden-Harris administration’s ability to execute the most orderly withdrawal possible and put our service members and our allies at risk.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/09/trump-harris-presidential-debate-election-latest-updates	2024-09-09T15:59:56-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b37b1f5c23d472eae975f0b6381b9599ea3ae4a7/0_104_4639_2783/master/4639.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=37a29180bf181d8f6a97df5c0f5510b0

Nygard has about 6.7 years left to serve and will be eligible for full parole after one-third of that.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/peter-nygard-sentenced-sexual-assault-canada	2024-09-09T09:00:17-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e965f522fbdfcfa2c966f89408b35e58ff300fcc/0_0_4524_2716/master/4524.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1f809f694e8e4d00b50fc484ade66f8a

Former head of Lebanese central bank in court on embezzlement charges	Protesters who lost savings in financial crisis demonstrated outside court as Riad Salameh pleaded not guilty The former head of Lebanon’s central bank, Riad Salameh, appeared in court on Monday for the first time since he was arrested last week on charges of embezzling up to $42m (£32m) of public funds. Monday’s hearing is the latest in the long saga of Salameh, once vaunted as a financial wizard who earned Lebanon its reputation as the -Switzerland of the Middle East- during his 30-year tenure. He has since fallen into disrepute and is suspected of engineering a country-wide Ponzi scheme that caused Lebanon’s 2019 financial meltdown and its five-year-long economic crisis.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/lebanon-central-bank-riad-salameh-embezzlement-charges	2024-09-09T07:19:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87f3d427bd91edc2619b228673e94d55dd93d03d/0_158_3405_2043/master/3405.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4b1659d1b1ba7ca48a2b0a0f2548093a

Middle East crisis: Israeli strikes on Syria kill at least 25 people, war monitor says – as it happened	Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the dead include civilians as well as soldiers and ‘Syrians working with pro-Iran groups’ The UN human rights chief has said that ending the war in Gaza is a priority and asked countries to act on what he called Israel’s -blatant disregard- for international law in the occupied Palestinian territories. -States must not – cannot – accept blatant disregard for international law, including binding decisions of the (UN) security council and orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), neither in this nor any other situation,- the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Turk, said in a speech at the opening of the UN human rights council in Geneva. The court considers that the violations by Israel of the prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force and of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination have a direct impact on the legality of the continued presence of Israel, as an occupying power, in the occupied Palestinian territory. The sustained abuse by Israel of its position as an occupying power, through annexation and an assertion of permanent control over the occupied Palestinian territory and continued frustration of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, violates fundamental principles of international law and renders Israel’s presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful. Forcible evictions, extensive house demolitions and restrictions on residence and movement. The transfer by Israel of settlers to the West Bank and East Jerusalem and maintenance of their presence. Its failure to prevent or to punish attacks by settlers. Restricting the access of the Palestinian population to water. Israel’s use of the natural resources in the occupied Palestinian territory. The extension of Israel’s law to the West Bank and East Jerusalem.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/09/middle-east-crisis-seven-killed-in-israeli-airstrike-on-iran-linked-military-site-in-syria-says-war-monitor	2024-09-09T07:01:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd28d950d57c091f8974d93ab34a4a7908bbbac9/0_460_7265_4359/master/7265.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=169e54cfaa6f5ef5fce0d1b5f067b3c6

Warm fronts to Y-fronts: Chinese city hit by underwear storm	Chongqing authorities say cloud seeding to break heatwave did not cause winds that sent laundry flying It was the talk of the town. After the authorities sought to break a long-running heatwave in Chongqing by using cloud-seeding missiles to artificially bring rain, the Chinese megacity was blasted by an unusual weather event – an underwear storm. Termed -the 9/2 Chongqing underwear crisis-, an unexpected windstorm on Monday brought gusts of up to 76mph (122km/h), scattering people’s laundry from balconies on the city’s high-rises. Douyin, China’s sister app to TikTok, was filled with videos of pants and bras flying through the skies, landing in the street and snagging on trees.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/chinese-city-underwear-storm-chongqing-heatwave-cloud-seeding	2024-09-09T05:26:20-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d0c1f2386a30b260847faa1b40e26b0b182fd7c/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7e6cc679a34a99710a86047fef87e020

Weather tracker: Francine looking likely to be next Atlantic hurricane	An area of low pressure in the Gulf of Mexico is moving landward, and is expected to bring intense rainfall Francine could soon be the next to be ticked off the list of Atlantic hurricane storm names this week. On Friday, a broad area of low pressure emerged in the Gulf of Mexico, designated as Invest 91L. An -invest- – a shorthand for -investigative area- – refers to a region of atmospheric disturbance, characterised by low pressure and thunderstorms, and is closely monitored for its potential to evolve into a tropical cyclone. Invest 91L is anticipated to encounter more favourable environmental conditions as it progresses northward over the coming days, meandering along the eastern coasts of Mexico and Texas. The National Hurricane Center has now labelled this as a potential tropical cyclone, and it is expected to reach hurricane status before reaching the Gulf coast of the US. It advises that hurricane and storm surge watches will probably be issued on Monday for coastal parts of Texas and Louisiana, with the impacts expected to be felt from Tuesday night.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/weather-tracker-francine-likely-atlantic-hurricane	2024-09-09T01:29:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24cc1827e84491c0c221ac628bc03071cdb1fd63/0_52_3168_1900/master/3168.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1a9b1687edb0a93e205a820382e25175
