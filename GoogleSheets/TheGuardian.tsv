Uncharted territory for the WHO if Trump withdraws US membership	WHO is ‘critical in protecting US business interests’, says CEO of firm that may see lean years if Trump carries out vow The World Health Organization (WHO) could see lean years ahead if the US withdraws membership under the new Trump administration. Such a withdrawal, promised on the first day of Donald Trump’s new administration, would in effect cut the multilateral agency’s funding by one-fifth. The severe cut would be uncharted territory for the WHO, potentially curtailing public health works globally, pressuring the organization to attract private funding, and providing an opening for other countries to influence the organization. Other countries are not expected to make up the funding loss.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/18/world-health-organization-trump	2025-01-18T05:00:27-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b3e2fd716e247a17ca38a30d3342bf8d5fa54bb/0_141_6000_3599/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=89d57bad42dd263b9c7dc2fdd60ac3e3

Home Office accused of ‘blocking’ people stuck in war zones from joining family in UK	FoI figures show Home Office apparently refusing to use biometrics waiver for people who have no way to submit them The UK government’s family reunification policy has been criticised by charities and MPs after new data revealed how Home Office bureaucracy was making it impossible for people stranded in war zones, such as Gaza and Sudan, to reunite with family members in the UK. Existing policy is supposed to allow those in need of resettlement the opportunity to join relatives in the UK. In order to apply for family reunion visas, applicants must submit biometrics – usually a fingerprint and a photograph – at appointments at a visa application centre (VAC) in their country of residence.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/18/home-office-accused-of-blocking-people-stuck-in-war-zones-from-joining-family-in-uk	2025-01-18T04:38:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87f3b8af33c594aa3359f183f0aeadad5d6a0ba3/0_44_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b33ba8c0a5f4c5423f5c1144e56fc5fb
‘You can’t be pro-billionaire and pro-working class’: Biden’s labor chief on return of Trump	Julie Su, acting labor secretary, fears many of Biden’s pro-worker policies will be undone by the new administration Even as Donald Trump says he will battle for America’s workers, the acting secretary of labor, Julie Su, is voicing fears that Trump will undo many of Joe Biden’s pro-worker policies, which include protecting workers from extreme heat and extending overtime pay to millions more workers. In an interview with the Guardian, Su said that Trump might fall far short on delivering for workers considering the first Trump administration’s many anti-worker policies and in light of his having Elon Musk and other billionaires advising him. -It’s one thing to say you’re pro-worker, and it’s quite another thing to do it,- Su said. -You can’t be pro-billionaire and pro-working class.

‘All hands on deck’: Bird flu in US poultry puts state cooperation to the test	Unusually late migration season means poultry operations may continue to see H5N1 outbreaks, officials say Maryland has detected bird flu among three different commercial poultry flocks in the past week, marking the state’s first outbreak in more than a year. The discoveries come shortly after the establishment of a joint command with Delaware following the latter state’s detection of H5N1 in two other poultry operations. Although the deadly bird flu has circulated in North America since 2022, the past few months have been especially brutal for the poultry industry. More than 20 million egg-laying hens died in the fall, the worst rates since the outbreak began, and egg prices have risen as a result.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/18/bird-flu-poultry-delaware-maryland	2025-01-18T03:00:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/995865c771e8300d85d42acccf17054071140cf5/0_98_5388_3232/master/5388.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0bf8786951ad3d4bd45743e8ebc86b9f

The soon-to-be foreign secretary held meetings with the Democrat and Republican campaigns – and found himself admiring the latter. The slickness and professionalism of Trump’s 2024 operation, with its sharp messaging making inroads with black and Hispanic voters, seemed a far cry from his shambolic 2016 campaign.

Middle East crisis live: Israel says 737 prisoners to initially be freed after cabinet approves Gaza ceasefire	Israeli justice ministry says the Palestinian prisoners and detainees will be released as part of truce’s first phase, under which Hamas is to free 33 hostages Welcome to our live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war. It’s approaching 8am in in Tel Aviv and Gaza City – here’s a snapshot of the latest news. Israel’s cabinet approved a deal with Palestinian militant group Hamas for a ceasefire and release of hostages in the Gaza Strip, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said on Saturday, a day ahead of the agreement’s scheduled start. Lead US negotiator Brett McGurk said after the Israeli cabinet approval that the plan was moving forward on track. The White House expected the ceasefire to start on Sunday morning, with three female hostages to be released to Israel on Sunday afternoon through the Red Cross. Under the deal, the three-stage ceasefire starts with an initial six-week phase when hostages held by Hamas will be exchanged for prisoners detained by Israel. Thirty-three of the 98 remaining Israeli hostages, including women, children, and men over 50, were due to be freed in this phase. Israel will release all Palestinian women and children under 19 in Israeli jails by the end of the first phase. The ceasefire deal was bitterly opposed by some hardliners in the Israeli cabinet, with media reports saying 24 ministers in Netanyahu’s coalition government voted in favour of the deal while eight opposed it. National security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir threatened to resign if it was approved but said he would not bring down the government. His fellow hardliner Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, also threatened to quit the government if it did not go back to war to defeat Hamas after the first six-week phase of the ceasefire. The Israeli high court is still scheduled to hear petitions against elements of the ceasefire deal but it is widely expected not to intervene. Negotiators from Egypt, Qatar, the US and Israel had agreed on -all necessary arrangements to implement- the Gaza ceasefire deal, Egyptian media reported. During Friday’s talks, which reportedly ended -on a positive note-, negotiators agreed to form a joint operations room in Cairo to -ensure effective coordination- and compliance with the truce terms, it said. Under the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which is to last 42 days and take effect from Sunday, Hamas has agreed to release 33 hostages including children, women – including female soldiers – and those aged over 50. In exchange, Israel will release 50 Palestinian prisoners for every female Israeli soldier released by Hamas, and 30 for other female hostages. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said French-Israeli citizens Ofer Kalderon and Ohad Yahalomi were in the first group of hostages to be freed by Hamas. Israel’s justice ministry released a list of 95 Palestinians held in Israeli prisoners to be freed in the first exchange, including 25 male prisoners, all under the age of 21, and 70 female prisoners. One of the most well-known individuals on the list is Palestinian parliament member and feminist lawmaker Khalida Jarrar. At least 115 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the ceasefire deal was announced on Wednesday, the Palestinian health ministry said on Friday, while medics said another five were killed in an Israeli airstrike early on Saturday in the Mawasi area west of Khan Younis. Gaza’s health ministry said at least 46,876 people have been killed and 110,642 injured in more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/18/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-says-737-prisoners-to-initially-be-freed-after-cabinet-approves-gaza-ceasefire	2025-01-17T22:04:58-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/895eeb20d77aefa7e1b2c6d5957825e3e99c5cc6/0_265_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=82e1a7c1951c9292243a41301921bbd9

A vote on final passage was scheduled for early next week, making it potentially one of the first pieces of legislation he signs as president.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/17/laken-riley-act-democrats-undocumented-immigrants	2025-01-17T11:49:40-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23826e5e3bb09d492a7b49dd425fa9a4fb607d32/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4e5bcfe79490040cb2e6af60c30964fb

How have the California wildfires affected Hollywood?	The ongoing devastation has impacted this year’s awards season, raising questions over the Oscars and Grammys The California wildfires have to date killed at least 25 people, destroyed or damaged more than 12,000 structures and put about 300,000 people on evacuation orders. It has also had a major impact on business, most notably that of Hollywood.

Supreme court to release opinions as TikTok decision looms – live	US supreme court to release opinions at 10am ET as a challenge to a law that will ban TikTok on Sunday awaits a decision Good morning, US politics blog readers. The supreme court has announced it will release opinions at 10am ET today, as a challenge to a law that will ban TikTok on Sunday unless its China-based owner sells its US business awaits the justices’ decision. As usual, the court did not say how many opinions will be released or on which cases, and thus we will just have to wait an hour or so to find out. Should they decide the TikTok case, we do have some hints on how the justices may rule – in oral arguments last week, they seemed inclined to uphold the law. Meanwhile, we are in the final days of Joe Biden’s administration, and the Democratic president is making some last-minute moves ahead of Donald Trump’s arrival on Monday. This morning, he announced clemency for about 2,500 people convicted of non-violent drug offenses, as well as 15 more prescription drugs that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for. Biden still could have more executive actions planned before he leaves office, including preemptive pardons to Trump’s enemies. We’ll let you know if he announces anything else today. If the TikTok ban is allowed to stand, the Biden administration does not plan to enforce it, NBC News reports. Kristi Noem, the South Dakota governor who Trump picked for homeland security chief, has her Senate confirmation hearing at 9am today. Israel’s cabinet just approved the Gaza ceasefire deal.

‘Everyone thought it would cause gridlock’: the highway that Seoul turned into a stream	Cheonggyecheon stream in the South Korean capital has become an attraction – and helps with flood management, fighting air pollution and cooling the city On a crisp December morning, office workers and tourists stroll along a tree-lined stream in central Seoul, pausing on stepping stones that cross its flowing waters. It’s difficult to imagine that just over 20 years ago, this was a vast elevated highway carrying 168,000 cars daily through the heart of South Korea’s capital. Cheonggyecheon, a stream that runs for about 3.5 miles (nearly 6km) through Seoul, was one of the earliest experiments in an increasing trend in cities globally: turning spaces where there was once car or rail infrastructure into spaces for pedestrians and cyclists. It’s a powerful example of the way that these spaces can become loved and popular, along with projects such as the High Line in New York, where an old railway track has been turned into a raised park, or the city moat in Utrecht, where a multi-lane road (nicknamed the -motorway from nothing to nowhere-) was converted back into a canal, in part of a huge continuing push to allow pedestrians and cyclists to dominate the city’s centre.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/17/seoul-cheonggyecheon-motorway-turned-into-a-stream	2025-01-16T22:00:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc1f4407598278f21fb2bb022431678444304ed6/0_216_6480_3888/master/6480.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7621aeec72978d8563d9dbdc053a2ea9

Punitive measures were imposed, diplomatic visits cancelled and Belgium even suggested the EU could do without the Alpine country. That was when the far-right party was only a junior coalition partner. This time, the FPÖ – nativist, anti-immigration and fiercely critical of the EU – is in the driving seat. Its leader, Herbert Kickl, is in pole position to be Austria’s next chancellor.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/17/austria-is-set-for-a-far-right-chancellor-for-the-eu-its-the-new-normal	2025-01-16T21:00:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e8cb4b407979395a893ebd7dbbcac3c5100715d/0_22_7771_4663/master/7771.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=448e25c64ee81b59853372f60ce6f85b

Gaza ceasefire-hostage deal reached, Israel PM’s office says – live	Benjamin Netanyahu’s office says in statement that security cabinet will meet on Friday following earlier delays in talks to release hostages in return for ceasefire Welcome to our live coverage of the Middle East crisis. Here’s a snapshot of the latest news. Senior US officials insisted the hard-won ceasefire would go into effect on Sunday as planned despite the unexpected delay. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he was -very confident- that the ceasefire would go forward and he -fully expects that implementation will begin, as we said, on Sunday-. He confirmed that there had been a -loose end- between the sides in the complex negotiations. US representatives are still believed to be actively involved with talks in Doha on the final details needed to get the deal over the line. A vote is now expected to take place on Friday morning, Israeli media reported. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s hardline national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, announced on Thursday evening that he would quit the government if it ratifies the ceasefire deal, calling it -irresponsible- and -reckless-. Ben-Gvir’s departure would not bring down Netanyahu’s government. Opposition leader Yair Lapid pledged his support for Netanyahu, saying that the deal was -more important than any disagreement we’ve ever had.- Fighting has continued in Gaza despite expectations of a ceasefire, with at least 80 Palestinians killed and hundreds more injured by Israeli airstrikes since the ceasefire announcement, according to the civil defence agency. The Israeli military said that it had conducted strikes on -approximately 50 terror targets- across Gaza since late Wednesday. A civil defence spokesperson said its teams had recovered the bodies of five children after a strike on the northern city of Jabalia. More than 46,788 Palestinians have been killed and a further 110,453 wounded by Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, according to the latest figures by the territory’s health ministry on Thursday. They include 81 killed and 188 injured in the past 24 hours. Among them was Fatin Shaqoura-Salha, the chief of nursing staff at Al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat, ActionAid said. The ceasefire agreement, announced on Wednesday, was due to come into effect on Sunday. In the first phase, to last 42 days, Hamas agreed to release 33 hostages and in exchange, Israel would release 50 Palestinian prisoners for every female Israeli soldier released by Hamas, and 30 for other hostages. Palestinians displaced from their homes would be allowed to move freely around Gaza, wounded people would be vacuated for treatment abroad, and aid to the territory should increase to 600 trucks a day. A second phase would include Israel completely withdrawing from Gaza. The leader of Yemen’s Houthis, Abdul-Malik Badr al-Din al-Houthi, said the Iran-aligned group would suspend their attacks on Red Sea targets but continue if Israel backtracks on the ceasefire. The Houthi attacks have damaged as many as 30 ships and caused a diversion of commercial shipping to South Africa and the Cape of Good Hope. Reprisals by the US, Israel and the UK have damaged key Yemen ports and led to multiple deaths. Arab states are urging Israel and the incoming Trump administration to allow the Palestinian Authority (PA), in conjunction with the UN Palestinian relief agency Unrwa, to oversee Gaza’s recovery. The future governance of Gaza is due to be discussed at the start of negotiations on the second stage of the deal 16 days after a ceasefire begins.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/17/israel-hamas-ceasefire-deal-gaza-live-blog-updates-netanyahu-hostages	2025-01-16T18:53:00-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91ac90403a4de17a5a6eb34b2044f4a159c48269/0_306_4590_2754/master/4590.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e262ed8740934321113eb600735870c6

‘Rort has gone on for too long’: RBA should ban all debit surcharges, Labor MPs say	Calls for central bank to reduce ‘unfair’ costs for consumers and stop businesses ‘being gouged’ Six Labor MPs are urging the Reserve Bank to ban all surcharges for every debit transaction and dramatically reduce merchant fees for businesses, asking the central bank to go further than the government’s pledge to stop surcharges only on card payments. Jerome Laxale, the member for Bennelong, called the extra fees people pay to use their own money a -rort-, and said the RBA needed to step up. He led a submission, with five Labor colleagues, to the RBA’s review of card payment surcharging, saying the system needed major updates beyond those the government had already committed to.

‘A flood of disinformation’: rumors and lies abound amid ongoing LA wildfires	Disasters have long led to misinformation as people grasp for control, but the consequences can be life and death The Hollywood sign was not on fire. Firefighters weren’t using women’s purses to put out fires. A fish is not responsible for the blazes. The Los Angeles fire department didn’t see big budget cuts. The fires were not started deliberately as some kind of mass plot related to high-speed rail or the 2028 Olympics. Firefighting efforts did not include spraying a mood stabilizer into the air to put locals into a trance. Diversity measures are not to blame. Fires are still burning in Los Angeles, and with them has come a near-constant stream of rumors, half-truths, conspiracy theories and outright lies. Natural disasters have long led to the spread of misinformation as people try to make sense of destruction and grasp for control when the world around them is destroyed. In the aftermath of the disaster, a lot is still unknown: what caused it, what could have prevented it, who could be to blame.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/16/disinformation-los-angeles-wildfires	2025-01-16T06:00:19-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45fbcc8e41481899fb95029ead029aed6d456d9b/0_371_7451_4473/master/7451.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=44c6ffe223b8652560b594544504a018
Melbourne woman’s fight to keep NDIS support raises legal questions about agency’s ‘troubling’ processes	Tribunal decision for 54-year-old Veronica Stephan-Miller suggests onus of proof should be on NDIA, not recipient, before revoking benefits A tribunal has questioned whether it is lawful for the National Disability Insurance Agency to require that participants provide renewed evidence of their eligibility before revoking their access, describing the approach as -troubling-. The Administrative Review Tribunal on Wednesday granted a 54-year-old Melbourne woman with disability, Veronica Stephan-Miller, the right to continue accessing the National Disability Insurance Scheme while she appealed against the agency’s decision last year to remove her from it.

NSW government asks private sector to take public hospital patients as hundreds of psychiatrists set to resign	Exclusive: Guardian Australia has seen an email from the director of Australia’s largest private mental health provider about the contract The NSW government is considering moving public psychiatry patients into private hospitals in preparation for the mass resignation of the state’s psychiatrists next week, but doctors warn the panicked response will not help the -droves of people with significant illness and crises-. At least 205 psychiatrists will resign on Tuesday after 16 months of negotiations over the workforce crisis, with the government not agreeing to the psychiatrist’s proposed solution – a special levy increasing their pay by 25%, similar to that which emergency doctors received in 2015.

Syrians in Germany ask to be allowed to visit home and keep protected status	Refugee organisations say many want to ‘go and have a look’ after fall of Assad regime but fear losing asylum rights Syrians in Germany have called on the government to allow them to travel to their home country for short visits without risking their protection status, as questions mount over how the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime will affect the millions of Syrians who live in Europe. More than a month after a lightning advance by rebels toppled the Assad family’s 54-year rule, the residency status of many Syrians across Europe remains in limbo. A dozen or so countries across the bloc responded to the regime’s ousting by suspending the processing of asylum application from Syrians, with Austria going one step further to say it was preparing a -repatriation and deportation- programme.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/16/syrians-germany-ask-allowed-visit-home-keep-protected-status	2025-01-16T05:27:57-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aa8641110e24911ca5d5e690ea70450e8bba8ed/0_272_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a350b1143eba3ed84096b836860f7352

Russia-Ukraine war live: Keir Starmer in Kyiv to sign ‘100-year deal’	UK prime minister in Ukrainian capital to sign security and trade pact in first official visit Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. The UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, has arrived in Kyiv to sign a security and trade pact with Ukraine, in a public show of support for Volodymyr Zelenskyy before the much anticipated return of Donald Trump to the White House on Monday. The Ukrainian military said on Thursday that its forces had captured more than two dozen troops in the western Russian region of Kursk, where Russian troops have been trying to eject Ukrainian forces for the past five months. -Ukrainian paratroopers together with adjacent units captured 27 enemy servicemen in the Kursk region,- a military statement said, adding that the Russian troops had surrendered. Ukraine downed 34 out of 55 drones launched by Russia across 11 of the country’s regions in an overnight attack, the Ukrainian air force said, with a further 18 failing to reach their targets. Russia launched missiles and drones at Ukrainian energy facilities on Wednesday, one day after Kyiv said it had carried out its largest aerial attack of the war on Russian army factories and energy hubs hundreds of kilometres from the frontline. The mayor of the southern city of Kherson said there were power cuts as a result of the barrage. After the attack, Zelenskyy called on the west to use around US$250bn of unallocated frozen Russian assets to buy Kyiv weapons.

The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, has issued a statement calling the news of a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal -long overdue- and urging a -huge surge- in humanitarian aid to the Palestinian territory. -After months of devastating bloodshed and countless lives lost, this is the long-overdue news that the Israeli and Palestinian people have desperately been waiting for,- he said. The Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal, which is set to be begin on Sunday and will last 42 days, will see the exchange of hostages detained by Hamas and Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons. Other aspects of the deal include the return of Palestinians, who have been forcibly displaced by Israeli forces, to their homes across the Gaza Strip. The deal will also see the facilitation of travel of people wounded by Israeli attacks and sick people in order to receive treatment, as well as the positioning of Israeli forces across the Gaza border. Biden confirmed that Americans will be part of the hostage release. -This deal will halt the fighting in Gaza, surge much needed-humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians, and reunite the hostages with their families after more than 15 months in captivity,- Biden said. Egypt is -preparing to bring in the largest possible amount of aid to the Gaza Strip,- according to state media reports.

Trump’s attorney general pick Pam Bondi to face senators as key Republican says she’ll back Hegseth for Pentagon – US politics live	Bondi faces confirmation hearings alongside nominees Kristi Noem, Marco Rubio and CIA pick John Ratcliffe; Joni Ernst signals support for Pentagon pick Good morning, US politics blog readers. A battery of Donald Trump’s nominees for cabinet are going before senators today, including South Dakota governor Kristi Noem to lead the homeland security department, senator Marco Rubio for secretary of state and former congressman and intelligence official John Ratcliffe as director of the CIA. But the marquee event of the day will be former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi’s confirmation hearing to lead the justice department, a role in which she could make good on Trump’s promises to retaliate against his political enemies. Bondi voiced support for Trump’s baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election, and you can expect Democratic senators to demand answers about whether she would bring election denialism into the justice department, if confirmed. Meanwhile, it appears that Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News host who Trump nominated to serve as his defense secretary, won over a key Republican senator in his tense confirmation hearing yesterday. Iowa’s Joni Ernst has announced that she will support Hegseth, after expressing hesitation over comments he had made opposing women serving in combat roles. Hegseth has been dogged by a sexual assault allegation and reports of excessive drinking and financial mismanagement, but Ernst’s endorsement is seen as a major step to winning over other Republicans wary of installing him at the Pentagon. Joe Biden will deliver his farewell address to the nation from the Oval Office at 8pm. Inflation, the politically damaging economic trend Trump vowed to reverse, came in slightly higher than expected in December, according to just-released consumer price data from the labor department. Dangerous winds are expected to strike fire-ravaged parts of Southern California again, threatening new blazes.

Treasury minister warns of ‘tough decisions’ on spending amid high borrowing costs - UK politics live	Chief secretary to the treasury Darren Jones says there will be a spring statement on 26 March Good morning. Keir Starmer faces PMQs today. As he prepares, two issues seem very likely to come up. First, the economy. There is some modest good news this morning, and Rachel Reeves easily fought off a Tory attempted hit job on her in the Commons yesterday, but the underlying fundamentals are still pretty grim. Here are the key developments this morning. UK inflation unexpectedly fell in December, handing some breathing space to the chancellor, figures out this morning showed. The consumer prices index eased to 2.5%, below a reading of 2.6% in November, meaning prices rose at a slower rate. Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government would have to take -tough decisions- to meet its fiscal rules. The rise in government borrowing costs means further spending cuts are likely if the government is to meet its fiscal rules and Jones acknowledged that as he gave interviews this morning. He told BBC Breakfast: People at home know you can’t just keep borrowing every month to pay the bills. And where we do borrow to invest in the country’s infrastructure, the debt has to be falling as a size of the economy over the next five years. Jones said the government will not water down its plans to extend workers’ rights in the employment rights bill. In an interview on the Today programme Jones was asked about an interview on Monday where Rupert Soames, the CBI president, said the proposed changes could lead to firms laying off workers. Asked if the government would rethink the plans, Jones said: -No is the short answer.- He said giving workers more protection would be good for the economy. Jones has rejected claims the Siddiq affair raises questions about Starmer’s judgment. In an interview with Times Radio, the Treasury minister said: I don’t think there’s a question about the prime minister’s judgment. The independent process has been followed. It concluded, and Tulip took the decision to step down from government. Siddiq has been urged to -seek forgiveness from the people of Bangladesh-. As Sky News reports, responding to Siddiq’s resignation, a spokesperson for a Prof Muhammad Yunus, the interim leader of Bangladesh, said the former minister -may not have entirely understood the source of the money and property that she was enjoying in London-. The spokesperson added: She knows now and should seek forgiveness from the people of Bangladesh … We remain committed to accountability and justice and will be working with partners around the world to return the stolen funds to the people of Bangladesh.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/15/pmqs-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-labour-conservatives-uk-politics-live	2025-01-15T01:17:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/218761a797e8d612a7b7ba694728411a2a52a1d1/321_200_4792_2877/master/4792.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e1df1cd5cb5b85eaa9d27e8fa8835e5a

Health | Doctors are proposing a -radical overhaul- of how obesity is diagnosed worldwide amid concerns that a reliance on body mass index may be causing millions of people to be misdiagnosed.

On Monday, Bloomberg reported that the incoming US administration is weighing hiking tariffs by 2%-5% a month to avoid spiking inflation.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/14/canada-trump-tariffs	2025-01-14T11:16:39-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c166bb3a857fabe71fe5e9b63541adb4b4638c9/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=98ffe31825a685a09f63f776b09edce1

Stride’s Hamlet gag saves Reeves from slings and arrows of economic fortune | John Crace	Instead of evaluating chancellor’s performance, her shadow apes rightwing press and calls for her sacking You can only conclude that Conservative MPs are just too trusting for their own good. Either that or they are catatonically dim. The rest of us know enough to not always believe what we read on the front page of the rightwing papers, but Tory MPs seem to take everything at face value. If it’s in the paper, it must be true. It’s almost touching. Tuesday’s front pages of the Mail and the Telegraph insisted Rachel Reeves’s time was up. Going to China while the international bond markets crept upwards was the last straw. The chancellor should resign. What’s more, the prime minister had expressed his -full confidence- in Reeves, which could only mean that he was about to sack her. Let’s just say that Monday had been a slow news day in Westminster and some hacks had decided to make mischief.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/14/strides-hamlet-gag-saves-reeves-from-slings-and-arrows-of-economic-fortune	2025-01-14T10:19:59-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71e7fcb812b69e1059045495c89bfd1ee8b9b59d/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7724509257eb96ec7be49811824d3860
Could Keir Starmer’s AI dream derail his own green energy promise?	As PM pins hopes on AI, what effect will building energy-hungry datacentres have on Labour’s clean power pledge? Keir Starmer this week launched a plan to bring a 20-fold increase in the amount of artificial intelligence (AI) computing power under public control by 2030. But the race to build more electricity hungry AI datacentres over the next five years appears to work against another government target: to plug in enough low-carbon electricity projects to create a clean power system by the same date.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/14/keir-starmer-ai-labour-green-energy-promise	2025-01-14T10:09:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8abfc6d733094f9c745a271b041f13c30f8947c0/0_54_1792_1075/master/1792.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0ae29537f164f0e33ce88dfbff0a149e

Thought UnitedHealthcare couldn’t get more awful? They’ve gone villain mode | Arwa Mahdawi	Killing people with paperwork instead of a gun doesn’t make you any less of a murderer At this very moment Luigi Mangione, who is accused of shooting UnitedHealthcare’s CEO last month, is sitting in a federal jail cell in Brooklyn. He’s got a barrage of court appearances scheduled and, once he has wound his way through the criminal justice system, he could be behind bars for the rest of his life. Which, of course, is as it should be. While there are a lot of reasons that many people find the 26-year-old alleged assassin sympathetic, you can’t just gun a CEO down outside a hotel in Manhattan and face no consequences for it. And Mangione, who is, by all accounts, an extremely smart guy with an Ivy League education, should really have known better. He should have known that if he wanted to murder someone – and get away with it – there were far more socially acceptable ways of doing so.

Special counsel says Trump would have been convicted over 2020 election | First Thing	Report says evidence ‘was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction’ had Trump not been re-elected. Plus, dangerous winds return to LA Good morning. Donald Trump would have been convicted of crimes over his failed attempt to cling to power in 2020 if he hadn’t won the presidential election in November: that’s the finding of Jack Smith, the special counsel who investigated him. Why didn’t the case go ahead? Smith acknowledged the justice department’s policy prohibiting the prosecution of a sitting president, a factor that ultimately led to the dropping of charges against Trump after his 2024 victory. The report also references a supreme court ruling expanding presidential immunity, which complicated the case, and Trump’s repeated legal attacks, which took up time and resources to fight. How did Trump respond? In a social media post, Trump called the special counsel a -lamebrain prosecutor-. What do we know about the terms of the potential deal? Reuters reports that negotiations are advanced over releasing 33 of 98 hostages still in Gaza in the first stage of the deal, citing an Israeli official. In return, Israel will free 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, according to the Palestinian source close to the talks, who said the first phase would last for 60 days. While negotiators meet, is the war still raging? Yes. Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 18 people overnight, including six women and four children, health officials said, and Gaza’s civil defence agency reported that a wave of Israeli airstrikes killed more than 50 people in the Palestinian territory’s main city on Monday.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/14/first-thing-special-counsel-jack-smith-trump-convicted-2020-election	2025-01-14T02:52:05-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90d54c23d0e29b77c4957032c2727c8e0c47e140/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fc8ffc19667653282a6a6812caafa9fc
LA fires live: Southern California braced for ‘extremely critical fire conditions’ as life threatening winds pick up pace	With fire weather expected to continue until at least Wednesday, officials have pre-deployed firefighters across surrounding counties Additional water tankers and scores of firefighters have arrived at the Los Angeles area ahead of fierce winds that were forecast to return and threaten the progress made so far on two massive infernos that have destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 24 people. Three wildfires are currently burning in Los Angeles county. They are: The Palisades fire, at 23,713 acres and 14% containment. The Eaton fire, at 14,117 acres and 33% containment. The Hurst fire, at 799 acres and 97% containment. At least 24 people have died, and relatives have begun identifying their loved ones as they return to their homes or are notified by local officials. The fires have destroyed more than 12,000 structures and may be the costliest disaster in US history, according to initial estimates of damage and economic losses exceeding $250bn from AccuWeather. With fire weather expected to continue in the Los Angeles area through Wednesday, state and city officials have pre-deployed firefighters across LA and surrounding counties. House speaker Mike Johnson said he believes there should be conditions on disaster aid to California, citing -state and local leaders [who] were derelict in their duties-. Donald Trump is in talks to visit Los Angeles to survey the damage wrought by wildfires over the past week, CNN reported. The visit could occur as early as next week, but no details have been finalized. Altadena residents have filed three lawsuits against Southern California Edison, alleging that the utility is responsible for the Eaton fire. The lawsuits cite evidence that the fire began under a transmission tower and reference the utility’s role in other wildfires. However, no official cause for the fire has yet been determined. California governor Gavin Newsom has called on the state’s legislature to approve $2.5bn in additional funding to aid -response and initial recovery efforts for Los Angeles-. To do so, the governor expanded the special legislative session he’d called for the state in November, designed to prepare for Donald Trump’s inauguration. The firefighting plane that was grounded after sustaining damage from a drone has been repaired and will return to firefighting duty Tuesday, pending FAA approval, said LA county fire chief Anthony Marrone.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/14/la-california-fires-los-angeles-live-wildfire-map-warning-evacuation-latest-news	2025-01-14T02:38:17-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27e1ea77b9bc95d4b07c39817e39422a6dd5eff8/0_388_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=56379e328f0c0881fac3c2b397bc428d
Man in Brazil wrongly charged for 62 crimes after police use flawed photo ID	Police relied on showing photo of Paulo Alberto da Silva Costa, wrongly jailed for years, to victims to identify him as an alleged perpetrator Paulo Alberto da Silva Costa was having a regular day at work as a doorman in Rio de Janeiro when he was arrested in 2020. It was only then that he learned he was a suspect in 62 crimes: almost all were thefts, but there were also two homicide charges. Costa spent three years behind bars before Brazil’s supreme court recognised that it had all been a mistake. There was one common element: every case relied solely on the fact that a witness or victim had been shown a photograph of Costa, and identified him as the alleged perpetrator.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/14/brazil-man-wrongly-charged-photo-identification	2025-01-14T02:00:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2c45bfaab30a46b1fe15064df1c557c4ecbad95/0_0_2999_1800/master/2999.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9beb40f8bbbf32797ede7c3c3bbbda54

Rachel Reeves told it would be ‘politically suicidal’ to impose further cuts as economy falters – UK politics live	John McDonnell says more cuts would be ‘a disaster for the country’ and steer voters towards Reform Good morning. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is back from her trip to China and, according to Politico, she will make a statement in the Commons. This will allow her to address the criticism she has been facing about the rise in government borrowing costs, and what this means for her spending plans. Reading some of the Tory papers this morning you would think she is on the point of being sacked. This is more partisan wishful-thinking than objective truth-telling, but Reeves is is definitely in some difficulty, because she promised growth and events are not going as planned. As Pippa Crerar and Jessica Elgot report, with the rise in borrowing costs putting the government at risk of breaking its fiscal rules, the Treasury is looking at potential cuts to balance the books. There is obviously a problem. There’s turbulence in the international markets, and we’ve just got to see those through. And the way you do that is – you don’t turn to cuts, certainly, because not only will that … be politically suicidal, that would undermine the political support upon which Labour got elected. There are two groups of people who make judgments on an incoming government. One is the international markets, the money markets, of course. But actually the most important people are the electorate and I think what has to happen here is the electorate have to be protected. You should tax the grotesque inequality that we have within our society – 16 million living in poverty, and yet at the same time,we’ve now created in our society 165 billionaires. And on the last calculation I saw, in the two years from 2020 to 2022, they made an additional £15onbn of wealth. I think you have to look at redistribution.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/14/keir-starmer-rachel-reeves-labour-kemi-badenoch-david-lammy-latest-politics-live-news	2025-01-14T01:24:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f1b704e3d0273aad54ab9f2035079aa98d888f8/0_88_3872_2323/master/3872.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5e635f2e576678347e80c699428d74c4

Israel-Gaza war live: Hopes rise for ceasefire and hostage release deal despite Israeli strikes in Gaza	Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip killed at least 18 people overnight as Israel and Hamas appeared to be coming closer to a ceasefire deal Welcome to our live coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. It is nearly 10.30am in Gaza City and Jerusalem. Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip killed at least 18 people overnight, including six women and four children, health officials said, as Israel and Hamas appeared to be coming closer to a ceasefire deal to end the 15-month war and release dozens of hostages. Gaza’s civil defence agency reported that a wave of Israeli airstrikes killed more than 50 people in the Palestinian territory’s main city on Monday. Agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said the strikes pounded Gaza City throughout the day, hitting -schools, homes and even gatherings of people-. -There is no room in hospitals to receive the wounded,- Bassal told AFP. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not immediately comment on the claims. The IDF said five soldiers had been killed in fighting in northern Gaza, bringing to nine the number of its troops killed since Saturday. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels meanwhile fired a missile at central Israel, setting off sirens and sending people fleeing to shelters without causing any casualties. Police said Tuesday several homes were damaged outside Jerusalem and released a photo of a missile casing that had crashed into a roof. An Israeli lawyer has filed submissions to the international criminal court (ICC) alleging incitement to genocide against Palestinians by eight Israeli officials, including President Isaac Herzog and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, said at least five people were killed in the bombing of the Salah al-Din school in Gaza City, which was housing displaced Palestinian people. At least 46,584 Palestinian people have been killed and 109,731 injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in its latest update. At least 19 Palestinians were killed in the last 24 hours, the ministry said.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/14/israel-gaza-war-live-ceasefire-hostage-deal-latest-live-news-updates	2025-01-14T00:24:58-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d95b7c250fb151469bc54715d1051828979f69c8/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1a394d1875c18250eba409fa6b607c18

Tuesday briefing: What Ukraine might gain from two North Korean captives	In today’s newsletter: Kyiv’s interrogation footage of captured North Korean soldiers leads to questions about what it might do with the soldiers – and what the PoWs might do for them Good morning. In a grinding war where significant changes at the front are hard to discern, a video released by Ukraine on Sunday is a rare point of focus: it featured two North Korean soldiers, answering questions from their Ukrainian captors, and weighing the circumstances of their presence in a conflict thousands of miles from home. The video is, perhaps, not militarily significant. But it is a unique insight into one of the more extraordinary aspects of a conflict that has drawn in actors from all over the world, and is a crucible in which every participant is learning how modern wars are fought.

[It is] unclear if North Korea will even claim the two captured soldiers as their own, given Moscow and Pyongyang’s refusal to officially admit that North Korean forces have been deployed to Russia. At the same time, Russia could claim them as their own and hand them over to North Korea after they are traded with Ukrainian PoWs.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/14/tuesday-briefing-what-ukraine-might-gain-from-its-north-korean-captives	2025-01-13T22:48:28-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25743ee3fc336db21bb5bff536ac2d46018d534e/519_516_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=12580eb72feec06e1129248d06681ecd

The president defended his record on Ukraine, Gaza and Afghanistan but foreign policy successes have been few On paper, few US presidents could boast the foreign policy bona fides of Joe Biden, a veteran statesman with nearly a half-century of experience before he even stepped into office. But as his term comes to an end, critics have said that the president will leave a legacy of cautious and underpowered diplomacy, as even allies have conceded that the administration is still grasping for a cornerstone foreign policy success.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/13/biden-us-foreign-policy-winning	2025-01-13T15:19:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbb34bdbee9e3fb7f91f66940534d9bd910ced1c/0_211_7345_4407/master/7345.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d7b82c51fd81d03694ea0adf357b2979

Where there’s fire, there’s smoke: Los Angeles blazes raise fears of ‘super toxic’ lung damage	Concerns that dangerous fine particle pollution can become embedded in bloodstream and lungs The Los Angeles wildfires have claimed the lives of at least 24 people and have burned more than 100,000 structures. While the focus is understandably on avoiding the flames, another immediate danger lurks across the county and beyond, one more difficult to escape: smoke. The most dangerous component of wildfire smoke is fine particle pollution, also known as PM2.5 or soot. These tiny particles, smaller than one 20th the width of a human hair, can, if inhaled, become embedded in the bloodstream and lungs. It is estimated that about one-third of all particulate matter pollution in the US now comes from wildfire smoke.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/13/los-angeles-wildfires-smoke-exposures	2025-01-13T14:16:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e11173d30a3a548e43b7610a6084197d35f19692/0_122_6443_3866/master/6443.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=40daa767f2bc6d83707a67daf5b8ce4b

JD Vance walks back Trump’s pledge to pardon January 6 protesters on day one – US politics live	Incoming vice-president says people who ‘committed violence’ shouldn’t be pardoned as surveys suggest blanket pardons would be unpopular with Americans Good morning, US politics blog readers. We’re one week out from Donald Trump’s inauguration as president, a day on which he has vowed to act like a dictator, and among the long list of things he has promised to do one his first day in office is pardon people convicted or accused of crimes over the January 6 insurrection. The few surveys done of the issue have indicated that a blanket pardon would be unpopular with Americans, and in an interview on Sunday, JD Vance seemed to walk back his boss’s pledge. -If you protested peacefully on January 6th … you should be pardoned-, the incoming vice-president told Fox News. -If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn’t be pardoned, and there’s a little bit of a gray area there, but we’re very much committed to seeing the equal administration of law.- For all the norms he has shattered, Trump would be far from the first American president to make big promises on the campaign trail then find reason not to keep them once he gets the job. We’ll find out what his supporters think of Vance’s comments as the day goes on. Confirmation hearings begin this week for Trump’s cabinet nominees, with the first scheduled for Tuesday. Some nominees, such as senator Marco Rubio to lead the state department, are expected to be approved with little tension. But others, think Pete Hegseth as defense secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr as secretary of health and human services and Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, will spark fights with Democrats. Joe Biden is looking to make the most of his final week as president, beginning with a speech today at 2pm ET from the state department about his foreign policy legacy. Los Angeles firefighters continue to combat blazes in and around the city, amid fears that another bout of gusty and hot weather could fuel more outbreaks.

‘Particularly dangerous’ wildfire weather returns to California and could linger for months, say experts	Forecasters say there won’t be winds as strong as last week’s record-setting gusts, but LA’s dry season will get worse When it comes to forecasting the conditions for catastrophic California wildfires, there are two main ingredients: fuels (think grasses, shrubs, trees – basically anything that’s available for fires to burn) and winds. When analyzing fuels, forecasters look mainly at the levels of drought, along with any recent rains that may help diminish the effect of longer-term drought. With winds, in southern California at least, it’s all about anticipating the Santa Anas – the fierce winds that blow offshore, from the deserts to the coast, bringing loads of dry air with them.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/13/california-wildfire-weather-conditions-forecast	2025-01-13T03:00:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83ce2e71dae054ed77a312a6fc6657edb6c39592/61_0_4881_2929/master/4881.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7852bfe309b81e20b047e966a9d3ef5a

Starmer claims AI could led to ‘golden age of public service reform’, even making services ‘feel more human’ – UK politics live	Government to publish AI opportunities action plan amid backdrop of economic difficulties in UK Good morning. Today the government wants to talk about AI (artificial intelligence). It is due to publish its AI opportunities action plan this morning, Keir Starmer is giving a speech on the topic, and Peter Kyle, the science secretary, is giving a statement to MPs later. The main elements have already been well trailed. Here is the Department for Science’s overnight news release, and here is a story by Robert Booth summing it all up. As usual, though, what the government wants to talk about and what it will end up being forced to talk about are not the same. The macro story that matters most in UK politics at the moment is the rise in UK government borrowing costs (largely driven by global economic developments, and the prospect of what Donald Trump will do when he becomes US president next week), and whether this will lead to fresh spending cuts in the spring. On the business live blog, Julia Kollewe says UK bond yields (borrowing costs) are marginally up again this morning.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/13/keir-starmer-labour-ai-yvette-cooper-tulip-siddiq-latest-politics-news-live	2025-01-13T01:23:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/840d45084eef6a8324b9d6fe2f3351625b814b0b/0_67_3214_1930/master/3214.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=daa6e8378b14630937da06728fc6946f

Tory police cuts are only part of the ongoing crisis affecting victims of crime	Austerity affected courts, prisons and public services while rates of poverty surged, creating the conditions for more crime The period in which clear-up rates for the most serious crimes collapsed coincided with big cuts to police budgets, and the subsequent fall in police officer numbers of about 20,000. The last Conservative government, responsible for the cuts after 2010 in the name of austerity, spent its time denying they would have any damaging effect on crime fighting in England and Wales. Then, in its final years, it started to reverse the cuts, and pretended -wokery- among law enforcement had diverted officers’ attention.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/13/slashed-police-budgets-crisis-uk-criminal-justice	2025-01-12T22:00:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49e1cf6e1349077f709d642e98f760cc3f56e535/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7facd143edaeaa2a98cd8e49018ecbda

Tories back Badenoch’s ‘risky’ call for grooming gangs inquiry	Keir Starmer accuses opposition leader of spending ‘a lot of time on social media over Christmas’ When Kemi Badenoch used prime minister’s questions this week to echo Elon Musk’s demands for a new inquiry into sexual grooming gangs, the MPs behind her were trying to interpret the intentions of their fledgling leader.

UK can be ‘AI sweet spot’: Starmer’s tech minister on regulation, Musk, and free speech	Technology secretary Peter Kyle has the task of making Britain a leading player in the AI revolution, but says economic growth will not come at the cost of online safety With the NHS still struggling, a prisons crisis still teetering and Britain’s borrowing costs soaring, there are few easy jobs going in Keir Starmer’s cabinet at present. But even in such difficult times, the task of convincing Silicon Valley’s finest to help make Britain a leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution – all while one leading tech boss uses the Labour government as a regular punching bag and others ostentatiously move closer to Donald Trump – is among the most challenging.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/11/uk-can-be-ai-sweet-spot-starmers-tech-minister-on-regulation-musk-and-free-speech	2025-01-11T10:59:39-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab50db8c2b0e3db9e611233289da0b93e765091/0_164_4927_2957/master/4927.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e05cc22b47952e3c1787001b90ac1cf0

Silicon Valley’s tycoons are bending the knee to Trump | Blake Montgomery	In 2017, Silicon Valley rebuked Trump’s travel ban. Today, it has reversed course and is bending over backwards with displays of deference to Trump On 28 January 2017, I rushed to the San Francisco international airport (SFO). Like elsewhere in the US that night, demonstrations were growing against a travel ban Donald Trump had issued against visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries. The night was chillier than normal, and I had not brought an adequate jacket. Luckily, the train to the airport was warm, full to the brim with jittery, talkative protesters. The airport itself was a rowdy scene: cabs and Ubers stalled as angry protesters blocked the roads, meters still running; demonstrators in hijabs prayed on their protest signs in baggage claim as others shouted at any arriving flyer coming for their luggage. Trump was the most outrageous man in America then, his election a shock to a wide swath of the world. After a few hours, whispers of a $150bn face floated through the crowd: Sergey Brin, creator and co-founder of Google, was there. At the time, he was the president of Google’s parent company Alphabet, which also owns YouTube. The effect was thrilling: one of the richest and most powerful men in the world was registering his discontent with Trump by bodily joining a protest against him. Brin, a native of Moscow who arrived in the US at the age of six, said he came to SFO that night -because I’m a refugee-. It was a personal rebuke of Trump, the consummate nativist.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/11/trump-silicon-valley	2025-01-11T05:00:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad0153854745673e2dce46a20cefa32880506b81/0_203_3071_1844/master/3071.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=95226bc01dd29236a9c07c20d61c0535

California fires live: progress made against some LA blazes but thickening smoke prompts ‘health emergency’	Palisades and Eaton fires start coming under control as fierce winds ease but forecasters predict another red flag warning for Monday Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the California wildfires that have devastated six neighborhoods of Los Angeles county, killed at least 11 people and damaged or destroyed more than 12,000 structures. Firefighters finally started gaining control over two major wildfires on the eastern and western flanks of Los Angeles on Friday as fierce winds that supercharged the fires for days eased. The Palisades fire, at 21,317 acres and 8% containment The Eaton fire, at 13,690 acres and 3% containment The Kenneth fire, at 1,052 acres and 50% containment The Hurst fire, at 771 acres and 37% containment The Lidia fire, at 395 acres and 98% containment The Archer fire, at 19 acres and 0% containment Six deaths have been confirmed in the Eaton fire and five in the Palisades. As family members have been alerted to the loss of their loved ones, six of the victims have been publicly identified. Law enforcement officials expect the death toll to rise once weather and fire conditions allow cadaver dogs and detectives into the burn zones. Conditions in the Los Angeles area were forecast to improve through the weekend, with sustained winds slowing to about 20mph (32km/h), gusting between 35-50mph, according to the National Weather Service, a respite from recent wind gusts of 80mph. -It’s not as gusty, so that should help firefighters,- NWS meteorologist Allison Santorelli said, adding that conditions were still critical with low humidity and dry vegetation. Forecasters predicted another red flag warning would be issued for Monday. Fire chief Kristin Crowley criticised city officials over water supply issues and budget cuts that she says hindered her department’s ability to fight the Palisades fire. The water supply has become a focal point, with California governor Gavin Newsom calling for an investigation into the shortage. Newsom has invited Donald Trump to visit the state and tour the the LA wildfires’ devastation. Trump visited the state six years ago in the wake of the Camp fire, the most destructive fire in California history, which hit the town of Paradise. The state of California issued a one-year moratorium preventing insurance companies from canceling or refusing to renew home policies in zip codes impacted by the Palisades and Eaton fires. Fire agencies are investigating whether Southern California Edison’s utility infrastructure sparked a brush fire that is still burning in a Los Angeles suburb, SCE said on Friday, adding no determination has been made. SCE, a unit of US utility Edison International, said in a filing to its regulators that a downed conductor was discovered at a tower associated with its Eagle Rock – Sylmar 220 kV circuit. -SCE does not know whether the damage observed occurred before or after the start of the fire,- it said.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/11/california-fires-la-fires-live-updates-latest-news	2025-01-10T23:16:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80c17a89ee8f6bb37c80659a71ead40b9cf18c8b/0_274_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bcc8f27f6817807d5c7e350012d223d7

Los Angeles officials expect the death toll from the wildfires in the county to continue to rise, as workers comb through incinerated neighborhoods with cadaver dogs. How big are the fires? The Palisades fire is 8,085 hectares and just 6% contained; Eaton is 5,540 hectares and not contained at all; Kenneth is 405 hectares and 35% contained; Hurst, 312 hectares and 37%; Lidia, 141 hectares and 60%.

Kenya court rules that criminalising attempted suicide is unconstitutional	The judgment has been welcomed as an important shift in perceptions by human rights and mental health groups A Kenyan judge has declared as unconstitutional sections of the country’s laws that criminalise attempted suicide. In a landmark ruling on Thursday, Judge Lawrence Mugambi of the country’s high court stated that section 226 of the penal code contradicts the constitution by punishing those with mental health issues over which they may have little or no control. While the constitution says in article 43 that a person has the right to the -highest attainable standard of health-, criminal law states that -any person who attempts to kill himself is guilty of a misdemeanour and is subject to imprisonment of up to two years, a fine, or both-, with the minimum age of prosecution for the offence set at eight years old.	https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jan/10/kenya-court-rules-that-criminalising-attempted-suicide-is-unconstitutional	2025-01-10T03:32:46-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f151e2de9768b827721edcfc8cbc805ae4abde5/0_0_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=30da1b56d6237d0798bcd1bfb92d5e2d

She said: We inherited an economy where it was hard to see who had confidence, both to invest, and particularly for consumers to be able to feel that they could spend, given the huge fluctuations that we’d seen, particularly after the Liz Truss/Kwasi Kwarteng mini-budget. The chancellor has been absolutely clear that we are not going back to those bad old days. We have had two interest rate cuts since she became chancellor, and we have worked very hard to restore economic credibility. We are not only confident that we’re on track, but the OECD is confident that we’re on track to become the fastest growing economy in Europe.

It’s the latest battle in the long war over whether to ban the tremendously popular social media app in the US – and will force the justices to weigh the importance of national security with the freedom of speech. TikTok and its parent company, Chinese-based ByteDance, asked the supreme court to review the case after a lower court ruled last month to uphold a law to ban the app in the US. That ban is scheduled to go into effect on 19 January, unless ByteDance sells TikTok’s assets to a non-Chinese company.

LA fires live updates: at least seven deaths as California wildfires rage and crews battle new fire	Palisades, Kenneth, Eaton fires remain uncontrolled as Los Angeles officials say ‘historic winds’ and extensive droughts have created the ‘perfect storm’ Hello, and welcome to our live coverage of the wildfires in California, where some of the worst blazes in the region’s history have ravaged homes and reduced entire neighbourhoods to ash. I’m Petra Stock. It’s approaching 8pm in Los Angeles and here is a recap of what you need to know. The Palisades fire, at 19,978 acres and 6% containment The Eaton fire, at 13,690 acres and 0% containment The Kenneth fire, at 960 acres and 0% containment The Hurst fire, at 671 acres and 10% containment The Lidia fire, at 348 acres and 60% containment Seven people have died, and more than 10,000 structures have burned, in the Palisades and Eaton fires. Five deaths have been confirmed in the Eaton fire and two in the Palisades. The Palisades fire, which had remained 0% contained since it broke out Tuesday, was 6% contained by 6pm Thursday. A new fire, now called the Kenneth fire, sparked around 3:34pm and quickly ballooned to 960 acres. President Joe Biden has announced that the federal government would pay for 100% of the firefighting needs for the next 180 days. Law enforcement officials are working to issue a curfew for affected burn zones in Los Angeles, in order to combat looting, though it is unclear when it will go into effect. Vice-president Kamala Harris canceled a trip to Singapore, Bahrain and Germany shortly after President Biden canceled a trip to Italy in order to more closely monitor the fires. The California prison system has now deployed nearly 800 incarcerated firefighters to fight the devastating blazes.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/10/la-fires-live-updates-california-los-angeles-wildfires-fire-map-latest-news	2025-01-09T19:36:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91a838607c4536aa6b71519444bdc53cae9d3f72/0_3_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=50d72be040640e281f7eb9279c77eb4b

He implemented a travel ban that caused chaos at airports, leaving families, students and scholars stranded. He also attempted to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program, which shields hundreds of thousands of people brought to the country as children from deportation and imposed a -zero-tolerance- at the US-Mexico border that led to the separation of thousands of families.

David Lammy says Trump’s rhetoric can be ‘destabilising’ but threat to invade Greenland won’t happen – UK politics live	Foreign secretary says Trump’s comments should be understood as reflection of his concerns about Arctic security Good morning. For the first time in six months, David Lammy, the foreign secretary, was put up by No 10 to do the morning broadcast interview round – ahead of a speech he is giving later. At PMQs yesterday, perhaps surprisingly, Keir Starmer was not asked about Donald Trump’s suggestion that he might invade Greenland, an autonomous territory that belongs to Denmark. The French and German governments have both condemned Trump’s comments. But, in an interview with the Today programme, Lammy was rather more diplomatic. Lammy said that, although Trump’s language could be -destabilising-, he did not always do what he threatened. Asked about Trump’s comments, Lammy said: I think that we know from Donald Trump’s first term that the intensity of his rhetoric, and the unpredictability sometimes of what he says, can be destabilising. He did it with Nato. But in fact, in practice, he sent more troops to Europe under his administration. He sent the first Javelins [anti-tank weapons] and weapons to Ukraine under his administration. Lammy said that Trump would not use military force to seize Greenland – despite suggesting he might. Asked if the UK should be following France and Germany in saying this would be unacceptable, Lammy replied: Let’s be serious … It’s not going to happen because no Nato allies have gone to war since the birth of Nato which Ernest Bevin, my great predecessor, was part of. Lammy said Trump’s comments should be understood as reflection of his concerns about Arctic security. He explained: Here, I suspect on Greenland, what he’s targeting is his concerns about Russia and China in the Arctic, his concerns about national economic security. He recognises, I’m sure, that in the end, Greenland today is a Kingdom of Denmark. There is a debate in Greenland about their own self determination. But behind it, I think, are his concerns about the Arctic. Of course, the US has troops and a base on Greenland. So it has got a stake in that Arctic region.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/09/uk-politics-labour-conservatives-david-lammy-trump-greenland-latest-updates	2025-01-09T01:13:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22c61051e995e1dc39b88c1bf75d8429f40446ab/98_492_4419_2652/master/4419.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=23e73b51fa9dbc1a4a372ae644056b11

UK weather: warnings remain in force across country as temperatures to fall as low as -20C	Snow, ice and fog yellow weather warnings remain in force across the UK as snow and sleet cause disruption to transport On Wednesday, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) extended its cold weather health alert for all of England until Sunday. Amber alerts have been extended and will now run until 12 January, meaning a rise in deaths is likely, the agency said. Dr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at the UKHSA, said: We are extending the duration of our cold health alert, since the Met Office are forecasting that the low temperatures we are seeing will continue further into this week, with snow and icy conditions likely to persist. This weather can have a serious impact on the health of some people, including those aged 65 and over and those with pre-existing health conditions, and it is therefore vital that we continue to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are most vulnerable.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2025/jan/09/uk-weather-warnings-snow-ice-sleet-temperatures-fall-transport	2025-01-09T00:40:17-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/108791f99685f0633a60fa0980490f310618e416/0_259_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2c93450e81ae58897127a8551b264b02

California fires live: Los Angeles fighting largest blaze in its history amid water and firefighting shortages	Palisades fire grows to more than 15,000 acres as Eaton and Hurst fires also gain in size; Biden directs DoD to deploy extra firefighters to tackle flames About 1.5 million residents are without power in southern California, with nearly a million of them in Los Angeles County, according to PowerOutage.us, as wildfires continue to rage across the region. The Palisades fire, which is the most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles’ history, has increased in size yet again – now encompassing 15,832 acres. At least two people were killed in the Eaton fire, north of Pasadena which has grown to 10,600 acres and has destroyed more than 100 structures. There have also been -a number of significant injuries-, fire officials said, and -tens of thousands of homes- are affected. About 32,500 residents were under evacuation orders, a drop from the more than 50,000 residents evacuated overnight. The Palisades fire, west of Los Angeles, has grown to 11,802 acres and destroyed more than 1,000 structures, making it the most destructive fire in the city’s history. About 37,000 residents are under evacuation orders. The Hurst fire, in the San Fernando Valley, is close to 500 acres after erupting on Tuesday night. More than 3,000 residents have been ordered to evacuate the area in Sylmar. All Los Angeles fire department air operations in the Palisades have resumed after being grounded due to extreme weather conditions. LAFD helicopters are back to dropping water and hundreds of firefighters continue to be on the scene to help respond to the Palisades fire and Hurst fire, said LA’s mayor, Karen Bass. More than 400,000 power customers were without power, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us. Another 440,000 customers could face similar shutoffs depending on weather conditions. Officials are urging residents across the region to conserve water so there is enough for firefighters to use. Demand was so high that three tanks emptied by Wednesday morning, causing some fire hydrants to dry out. California governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on Tuesday. President Joe Biden warned the recovery -is going to take time- as he attended a briefing with Newsom at a Santa Monica fire station. President-elect Donald Trump blamed Newsom’s environmental policies for the fires.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/08/california-los-angeles-fires-live-updates	2025-01-08T13:58:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea29802fba69f1cf43c2ff2d7beae28d6d1dff47/0_368_5561_3339/master/5561.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d9f68d22674127ce7c46e1ba3c13387b

Biden may preemptively pardon Liz Cheney, Anthony Fauci, after Trump’s threats of revenge – US politics live	Biden confirms he may still opt to protect Trump’s enemies from prosecution, while Trump scrambles to halt sentencing in criminal business fraud case Good morning, US politics blog readers. Joe Biden is in his final days in office, and still has a few pieces of unfinished business to deal with before he hands power to Donald Trump on 20 January. One of them is deciding whether to issue preemptive pardons to political enemies of the incoming president, such as former congresswoman Liz Cheney or Anthony Fauci, who spearheaded the fight against Covid-19 in Trump’s first term. In an interview with USA Today published today – a rare, final sit-down interview by a president who spent much of his term avoiding the press – Biden confirmed he may still opt to protect Trump’s enemies from prosecution, and signaled he would decide based on who the president-elect appoints to top roles in his administration. Meanwhile, Trump is scrambling to halt the sentencing in his criminal business fraud case that is scheduled to take place in a Manhattan court on Friday. Reuters reports that his attorneys have asked the US supreme court to intervene to pause the proceedings, though the New York judge presiding over the case has signaled he is unlikely to sentence the president-elect to jail time. We will let you if the nation’s highest court responds. Trump will this evening trek to Capitol Hill for a strategy meeting with the Republican senators tasked with enacting his administration’s priorities, ranging from mass deportations to extending tax cuts enacted during his first term. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the rightwing Georgia congresswoman, says she will introduce legislation to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the -Gulf of America-, as Trump proposed at a rambling press conference yesterday.

Trump’s appointments signal which Project 2025 goals he might advance first	Plans to stretch the law to favor Trump and drive out dissenting voices are expected to begin immediately Despite disavowing Project 2025 on the campaign trail and the people involved with creating it, Donald Trump has now tapped numerous people tied to the project for key roles in his administration as he prepares to advance some of its main goals. He acknowledged in December that he agreed with some parts of the project, but didn’t say which, claiming he didn’t read it and didn’t have any part in it. -They have some things that are very conservative and very good. They have other things that I don’t like,- he told Time magazine. He also said he thought it was -inappropriate- that the project was released ahead of the election and could have derailed his win because -they had some pretty ridiculous things in there-.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/08/trump-project-2025	2025-01-08T04:00:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cdb0cf8427e42572a0c5f648bbe90f9b508761f/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e88ec1b06a431f0e83a161e2b1761e9b
Republican v Republican: can Trump play peacemaker within his own party?	The president-elect’s intervention in Mike Johnson’s speakership win was a sign of his power over the party – but it was only the first test of many Donald Trump to the rescue. With Mike Johnson’s bid for re-election as speaker of the House of Representatives teetering, the US president-elect interrupted a golf game to talk by phone to two Republican holdouts. In short order the art of the deal prevailed: Johnson won on the first ballot.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/08/trump-johnson-musk-republican	2025-01-08T04:00:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbb24f4703ab6b0f794ef0c64283da33ada7ba39/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7ad1526e24a3a6be522c7476d5470c62

First Thing: More than 1,400 firefighters tackle ‘unprecedented’ California fires	Tens of thousands of people evacuated in southern California as winds whip blazes. Plus, the rise in ‘flaking’ out of social plans Good morning. California has deployed more than 1,400 firefighters in its attempts to quell the -unprecedented- wildfires that have ripped through the state’s south, said the California governor, Gavin Newsom. The fires, which have been fueled by a windstorm, have forced tens of thousands to evacuate their homes, including in affluent neighborhoods in Los Angeles. What are the Santa Ana winds? They’re common during the winter months in southern California, and have driven many of the state’s worst fires. They cause a drop in humidity, driving up fire risk, particularly as many areas already face drought.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/08/first-thing-more-than-1400-firefighters-deployed-to-tackle-unprecedented-california-fires	2025-01-08T03:20:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6604d61cfc10924c8032158011338a571d63ada/0_331_4788_2873/master/4788.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0e597fd8a451cc36aa88f1e1ad8f9ba0
Malawi sees influx of refugees from post-election violence in Mozambique	Marauding gangs and political unrest since October’s polls have driven thousands of Mozambicans across the border into Malawi, despite its drought, food and fuel shortages On a sunny Saturday afternoon, Manase Madia, 50, shows his Mozambican identity card. Once a sign of pride, he does not know what to believe in any more. Over the past few weeks he has seen houses being burned down, and shops and businesses looted, including his own. He now fears for his family, which has scattered in fear. At a community ground where officials are processing new arrivals before being transferred to a shelter, Madia is one of about 13,000 people who have crossed into Malawi in the past two months, seeking refuge from post-election violence in Mozambique. The arrival of the refugees, albeit in smaller numbers, is reminiscent for people here of the civil war when almost a million Mozambicans sought refuge in the neighbouring southern African nation in the 1980s and early 1990s.	https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jan/08/malawi-sees-influx-of-refugees-from-post-election-violence-in-mozambique	2025-01-08T03:02:59-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80d7b27e8a4d387686361b8e8cc8c41f73312040/422_0_1875_1125/master/1875.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1b523995f15bee171cf50963f7f2e5b4

Emilia Pérez, directed by Jacques Audiard, has been largely praised by international critics, though some noted it risked trivialising extremely sensitive issues.

Top Tory claims Elon Musk ‘may have saved humanity’ as Starmer attacks Badenoch over child safety – UK politics live	Prime minister says if Tories vote for amendment on children’s wellbeing bill, it will show ‘they are more interested in retweets than children’s safety’ as shadow business secretary praises Musk Good morning. Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch will be in the Commons today for the first PMQs of 2025 and the Tory calls for national inquiry into grooming gangs will continue to be near the top of the news agenda. That is because Badenoch is pushing for a vote on the children’s wellbeing and schools bill that would block the legislation and call on the government to set up an inquiry instead. The inquiry element is a procedural red herring because the Conservatives would have voted against the bill anyway. But, if the Speaker does allow a vote on the Tory reasoned amendment, Badenoch will be able to launch a social media campaign accusing Labour of voting against a grooming gang inquiry. The Conservatives are opposed to the bill primarily because it will restrict some of the freedoms enjoyed by academies. But the legislation also contains safeguarding measures that have widespread support, and Starmer has given an interview to the Daily Mirror saying that, if the Tories vote for their amendment, it will show they are more interested in retweets than children’s safety. He told the paper: I would implore any right-thinking Tory MP to vote for the bill because [the Conservative reasoned amendment] would kill the bill, this would kill the legislation. It would kill the provisions for a unique identifying number that will stop children falling through the cracks … No MP should be voting down children’s safeguarding measures. It’s shocking they are even thinking about this as a tactic. It’s the elevation of the desire for retweets over any real interest in the safeguarding of children. The @elonmusk purchase of X may have saved humanity. With X becoming a true freedom of speech platform, the common ground of public opinion is no longer determined by a left-leaning elite.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/08/conservatives-elon-musk-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-child-safety-pmqs-uk-politics-latest-updates	2025-01-08T01:41:29-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e40c507446dd3da2bfcb442b9e4d40b96ddd0146/0_246_7536_4522/master/7536.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6408a15555e5a791a04e82278b6fb357

A fresh weather warning is set to come into force as it is revealed that 300 properties have flooded across England since New Year’s Eve, reports the PA news agency. Dozens of people have been rescued by firefighters across Leicestershire since Monday, Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service said. Homeowners on Belton Road in Loughborough were stranded on the first floor of their semi-detached houses on Tuesday after rising water from the nearby Grand Union canal flooded the street. Patients have been urged to attend A&amp;E alone as NHS hospitals grapple with high demand amid rising flu cases. Several NHS trusts declared critical incidents due to -exceptionally high demands- in emergency departments. Hundreds of schools were closed across the UK on Tuesday, with road and rail links blocked. Manchester, Bristol and Liverpool John Lennon airports were forced to suspend flights because of the conditions. The RAC said Monday was the busiest day for breakdowns this winter.

Wednesday briefing: What Elon Musk’s focus on grooming gangs reveals about alt-right online discourse	In today’s newsletter: The owner of X, who previously said ‘civil war is inevitable’ in Britain, has stoked online unrest with incendiary comments about the UK Good morning. What is a news story in the UK? Whatever Elon Musk says it is. That is the conclusion you might draw, anyway, from the influence of the billionaire Trump adviser’s posts on X claiming that -a quarter-million little girls were – still are – being systematically raped by migrant gangs in Britain-, and demanding a new public inquiry into historic child sexual exploitation in Oldham, Rotherham, Rochdale and elsewhere. There is no reliable basis for the quarter-million figure. In any case, Prof Alexis Jay, the chair of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse in England and Wales that looked extensively at grooming gang scandals and published a series of recommendations in 2022, said yesterday that -we’ve had enough of inquiries, consultations and discussions-, and urged the government to instead implement more of her proposals. But the political energy is still around the idea of a new inquiry as some sort of panacea, and the Conservatives will try to force a vote on one in parliament today. Social media | Meta will get rid of factcheckers, -dramatically reduce the amount of censorship- and recommend more political content on Facebook and Instagram, founder Mark Zuckerberg has said. The suite of changes was met with dismay by critics, who described them as -a full bending of the knee to Trump-. British army | Afghans who were killed by members of the SAS in Afghanistan were described dismissively as having been -flat packed-, according to a former member of the elite force’s sister unit. The soldier, known only as N1799, was giving evidence to an inquiry into the deaths of 80 civilians in Helmand province. California | A fast-moving wildfire erupted in Los Angeles on Tuesday, quickly consuming nearly 3,000 acres and destroying homes in an affluent community along the Pacific Ocean. Amid a significant windstorm across much of southern California, a second unrelated blaze also forced evacuations in a different part of Los Angeles. France | Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of France’s far-right National Front party, who sent shock waves through the country when he made it to the second round of the presidential election in 2002, has died at 96. Drugs | Ketamine could be reclassified as a class A drug by the Home Office after illegal use reached record levels last year. Ministers are seeking -expert advice- on reclassification – it is currently a class B substance – after an estimated 299,000 people reported use of the drug in 2024.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/08/wednesday-briefing-what-elon-musks-focus-on-grooming-gangs-reveals-about-alt-right-online-discourse	2025-01-07T22:52:36-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e5573231a4bfc5fd11849cc4f48a2b5e07932c9/0_94_5665_3400/master/5665.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ac294ec52d863e7a55d44ee0a98d699f

Trump moves to block report on election interference and classified documents cases – US politics live	President-elect’s lawyers ask attorney general to stop release of outgoing special counsel Jack Smith’s report Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump may be less than two weeks away from returning to the White House, but his lawyers are keeping busy with motions to frustrate the final developments in his lingering criminal cases. Yesterday, they asked New York judge Juan Merchan to delay the president-elect’s sentencing on the 34 felony business fraud charges he was convicted of last year, but their motion was denied and the hearing is expected to take place on Friday. The case, brought by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, was the only one of Trump’s four criminal indictments to go to trial before his election victory in November. His prosecution in Georgia for allegedly meddling in the state’s election result four years ago has stalled, likely permanently, while special counsel Jack Smith dropped the charges he brought against Trump for allegedly hiding classified documents, and plotting to overturn the 2020 election. However, justice department regulations mandate that Smith release a report at the end of his investigations, which could bring to light damaging evidence about Trump’s actions. Late yesterday, the president-elect’s attorneys asked outgoing attorney general Merrick Garland to prevent the report’s completion. We’ll let you know if Garland makes his response known today. Donald Trump Jr is scheduled to arrive in Greenland today, the massive island that his father has talked about the United States buying from Denmark. We’ll see how that visit goes. Jimmy Carter will lie in state at the US Capitol today, with Kamala Harris laying a wreath on his casket and eulogizing him at 4.30pm ET.

Plus, Trudeau to resign as Canadian prime minister Good morning. Congress certified Donald Trump’s presidential election victory yesterday in an event heavy with symbolism, four years to the day since he incited a violent mob in attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat. What were November’s final results? Trump won the electoral college by 312 to 226, and the popular vote by a margin of about 2.5m. What did Harris say yesterday? -I do believe very strongly that America’s democracy is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it,- she told reporters. -Otherwise, it is very fragile, and it will not be able to withstand moments of crisis. And today, America’s democracy stood.- The president, Joe Biden, wrote an op-ed urging Americans not to forget the Capitol attack. What do we know about the quake’s ferocity? The US Geological Survey said the earthquake was centred in the Tibet region at a depth of about 10km (6 miles). It measured the tremor at a magnitude of 7.1, while China recorded it as 6.8.

Child abuse inquiry chair attacks ‘politicisation’ of issue and says new investigation would delay reforms – UK politics live	Prof Alexis Jay says ‘many people, sometimes in a very uninformed way, have waded into the argument’ over whether a further inquiry was needed Good morning. Keir Starmer is basking in praise from liberal, progressive Britain today for the way he hit back at calls for a new inquiry into child sexual abuse scandals, and the way they are being driven by inflammatory and false claims by Elon Musk and other rightwingers on X. But Tory Britain has yet to be persuaded, and the rightwing papers are promoting the Conservative party’s (very dubious) claim that Starmer was smearing anyone opposed to child rape as far-right. This morning Prof Alexis Jay stepped into this argument. As the main chair of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA), the eight-year, all-encompassing inquiry into child sexual abuse in Britain, she has as much authority on this subject as anyone. Today she clearly came out against calls from Musk, Reform UK, the Tories and others for a new national inquiry focusing specifically on rape or grooming gangs. No, I don’t agree with that, in the sense of requiring further and more detailed national inquiries into child sexual exploitation. We have learned quite a lot from those reviews that have already been undertaken. I think that the time has passed for more inquiries. We’ve had enough of inquiries, consultations and discussions, and especially for those victims and survivors who’ve had the courage to come forward … They clearly want action, and we have set out what action is required, and people should just get on with it, locally and nationally. I would not attribute that to everyone, but I’ve certainly been very unhappy about the politicisation of child sexual exploitation and child sexual abuse in the way that many people, sometimes in a very uninformed way, have waded into the argument.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/07/child-abuse-grooming-gangs-elon-musk-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live-updates	2025-01-07T01:14:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/981d9fd4f58f51b0473b6ae2ce0d6ada5159dc1e/0_301_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=85d64bd110195bb1473385fe74ccc762

Tuesday briefing: How Britain has coped with an Arctic blast	In today’s newsletter: Widespread flooding, snow and power outages have left thousands of households and travellers facing the aftermath of a cold snap – with more disruption to come Good morning. British winters have grown markedly milder over the past century: analysis has shown that the average UK winter has gotten 1C warmer and 15% wetter in the last century. Last February was the warmest in recorded history. There have been fewer and fewer snow days and the Met Office found that ground frost periods are three weeks shorter compared to the 1970s. Canada | Justin Trudeau has said he will step down as Canada’s prime minister. His resignation throws open the doors to a fierce political battle to be the country’s next leader, with polls showing the Liberals losing badly to the official opposition Conservatives. Child sexual exploitation | Keir Starmer has condemned Elon Musk’s increasingly erratic attacks on the government, suggesting that his -lies and misinformation- on grooming gangs were amplifying the -poison- of the far right. Ministers meanwhile promised to implement a key demand of a 2022 child sex abuse inquiry so that professionals who do not report claims of abuse will be sanctioned. US politics | The US Congress certified Donald Trump’s presidential election victory on Monday, in an event heavy with symbolism four years to the day since he incited a violent mob to disrupt a similar ceremony. Kamala Harris presided over a joint Senate and House of Representatives session to validate the result. Foster care | The UK is facing a fostering crisis where retiring carers are not being replaced by younger people, while the number of children entering care homes is rising, a charity has warned. The decline in foster carers is due to the impact of the pandemic, the costof living crisis, biological children staying at home for longer, spare rooms being used as home offices and changing family situations, Barnardo’s children’s charity said. Tibet | A magnitude 6.8 earthquake has struck near one of Tibet’s holiest cities, the China Earthquake Networks Centre has said, killing 53 people, injuring 62 and damaging buildings around Shigatse, according to state media.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/07/tuesday-briefing-how-britain-has-coped-with-an-arctic-blast	2025-01-06T22:34:35-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99894d56e5d340c61cd130ff0b7d0d2f538e2dea/0_366_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d3bb5fa4c5ed304567b96230e54ab9b7

Congress to certify Trump’s election win four years after insurrection – US politics live	Senate and House to convene in joint session to certify results four years after Trump’s supporters stormed Capitol Good morning, US politics blog readers. It is January 6, the legally designated day when the Senate and House of Representatives convene in a joint session to certify the results of the presidential election – in this case, Donald Trump’s victory two months ago. Today’s meeting comes four years after the then-president’s supporters stormed the Capitol after he addressed them outside the White House, a historic attack that Trump’s successor, Joe Biden, tried and ultimately failed to have him prosecuted over. There’s no sign that a repeat of those events will take place this year. Washington DC is socked in by a snowstorm that’s snarled roads across parts of the east coast and midwest, the Capitol is under heavy guard, and, unlike the Republicans who in 2021 tried to used procedural moves to block Biden from taking office, no congressional Democrats have signaled plans to object to Trump’s re-election during the session. The session is set to begin at 1pm ET, with Kamala Harris presiding in her role as president of the Senate. Once Trump’s victory is certified, it will clear the way for his inauguration two weeks from today, on 20 January. Trump on Sunday said he will support efforts by Republicans in Congress to pass one massive piece of legislation that will enact many of his campaign promises, including better fortifying the country’s borders and removing taxes on tips. There had been some debate among the GOP over whether to split those priorities up into separate bills, but with that decided (for now), expect Republicans to spend the next several months getting that legislation through Congress. Biden wrote on opinion piece for the Washington Post, in which he encouraged Americans not to forget the insurrection that took place four years ago today. Seven US states in the midwest and east coast have declared emergencies as a big winter storm blows through.

Convicted January 6 rioters anticipate Trump pardons four years after US Capitol attack | First Thing	‘We’re excited that we have our country back,’ one convicted man said. Plus, Adrien Brody wins Golden Globe for The Brutalist Good morning. Once back in power, Donald Trump has promised he will pardon people prosecuted over the assault on the Capitol four years ago today. Carried out by a mob of Trump’s supporters after he had addressed them outside the White House, the 6 January 2021 attack brought political violence into the halls of Congress and has been linked to nine deaths among police and rioters. How many have been charged? The justice department has charged more than 1,500 people, nearly 600 of whom have faced felony charges of assaulting or impeding law enforcement. How popular would the move be? For all the enthusiasm among Trump’s supporters, a December poll from Monmouth University found that 61% of respondents would disapprove of Trump pardoning people convicted of attacking the Capitol. What do we know about the attack? Jabber’s truck displayed an IS flag. A rifle he used in the shootout was bought privately from someone who did not know what he had planned. Officials said Jabbar – who wore body armor and a helmet – had fashioned a homemade device meant to suppress the noise of gunshots fired by the rifle. What do authorities believe about the motive? Indications suggest Jabbar fell into extremism after marital and financial woes.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/06/first-thing-convicted-january-6-rioters-anticipate-trump-pardon-us-capitol-attack	2025-01-06T02:46:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21466ef563ff78864d7783feecef3d3b336ce875/0_185_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ee0ba5980be86089357d585b859fe2ec

Firms that donated to Republican party avoided tariffs in Trump first term – study	President-elect has threatened to levy tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China, which can burden businesses With Donald Trump threatening to impose steep tariffs upon his return to office this month, US firms are bracing for impact. But an analysis of Trump’s last presidency identified one way to boost their chances of avoiding the levies: donating to the Republican party. While the initial stage of the president-elect’s tariff agenda is designed to hit America’s largest trading partners – Canada, Mexico and China – it is US firms that pick up the bill, paying duties imposed on the goods they buy from these markets. Such additional costs can prove devastating.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/06/trump-tariffs-republican-donations	2025-01-06T02:00:43-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/008731910b7066d93141ccba925061f5f888ca5d/0_273_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4447918e7479436fc771650f4f56aa07
Starmer expected to defend his record on rape gangs in Q&A after health reform speech – UK politics live updates	No 10 has previously said little about inflammatory claims from Elon Musk but issue likely to dominate questions today after major speech on NHS Good morning. Prime ministers like to focus on what they think is important and there are few issues more important in the UK than the state of the NHS. On his first proper day back at work after the Christmas holidays, Keir Starmer is giving a speech on this, and Andrew Gregory has previewed it here. I’ll be covering the speech, and reaction to it, in detail as the day goes on. The prime minister is expected to respond to [Musk’s claim that he was -complict in the rape of Britain-] on Monday as he holds a major press conference about his plans to cut NHS waiting lists. He is expected to say that he gave the -green light- to prosecuting paedophile gangs in Rochdale in 2013 and highlight the fact he introduced reforms to the way the Crown Prosecution Service handles child abuse cases. He also introduced a national network of specialist prosecutors to look into child abuse and sexual exploitation. The prime minister is also likely to issue a forthright defence of Phillips and the work she has done in tackling violence against women and girls. Both Labour and the Tories have said that Musk’s comments about Phillips are inaccurate.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/06/uk-politics-keir-starmer-nhs-reforms-grooming-gangs-live-updates	2025-01-06T01:20:24-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ae393f5f38e1c3309c50db504b7e49eb5bf8712/0_207_7240_4344/master/7240.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ae773775e7c949e11cdc684cb138c271
Middle East crisis live: Israel and Hamas wrangle over potential ceasefire and hostage deal	Disagreements over deal continue as Palestinian officials say more than 100 people died over the weekend due to Israeli bombardments Israel and Hamas are wrangling over the details of a potential deal to halt Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip and return hostages home, as Palestinian officials said intensified Israeli bombardments had killed more than 100 people over the weekend. A Hamas official said the group had approved a list of 34 Israeli hostages to be returned as part of a deal that could eventually lead to a ceasefire, Reuters reported. But Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office swiftly issued a statement on Sunday saying Hamas had not provided such a list. Israeli military airstrikes continued throughout the Gaza Strip on Sunday, with an airstrike killing five people in a house in the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza and another killing four in Jabalia in the territory’s north, Gaza health officials said. Later in the day, an airstrike hit a police station in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, killing five people, medics said. It was not immediately clear if all the people who were killed were police officers. At nightfall, medics said an Israeli airstrike had killed three people in Bureij camp in central Gaza, bringing Sunday’s death toll to 17. Two Palestinians, including a 17-year-old boy, were killed by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank on Sunday, according to the Palestinian Fatah party and the Palestinian health ministry. Palestinian media said Israeli forces opened fire on the home of a 37-year-old man in a town south of Jenin. The health ministry said the 17-year-old was killed in an Israeli raid in Askar camp in Nablus. The Israeli military said its forces killed an armed militant in the West Bank, confiscated weapons and dismantled an explosives manufacturing laboratory. Separately, it said it was looking into reports that a 17-year-old was killed. Social order in Gaza is likely to collapse further if Israel goes ahead with its threat this month to end all cooperation with the UN refugee agency for Palestinians (Unrwa), Louise Wateridge, its senior emergency officer, has warned. Gunmen opened fire on vehicles, including a passenger bus, on Monday near a village in the occupied West Bank, killing three people and injuring at least seven others, the Israeli military and emergency services said. -Paramedics have confirmed the deaths of three victims, including two women and a man,- emergency service provider Magen David Adom said, while the military reported that troops were -pursuing the terrorists- who carried out the attack near the village of Al-Funduq. Antony Blinken will meet his European counterparts Thursday in Rome on Syria, as the west looks to engage the new Islamist-led leadership. Blinken would -meet with European counterparts to advocate for a peaceful, inclusive, Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political transition-, a state department statement said as he visited Seoul on Monday. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike last year while inside the militant group’s war operations room, according to new details on Sunday disclosed by a senior Hezbollah security official, the Associated Press reports. -His eminence [Nasrallah] used to lead the battle and war from this location,- Wafiq Safa told a news conference on Sunday near the site where Nasrallah was killed. A series of Israeli airstrikes flattened several buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs on 27 September last year, killing Nasrallah.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/06/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-hamas-potential-ceasefire-hostage-deal	2025-01-06T00:35:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0052fde5a74082653f33e9a3d98220081e145a08/0_183_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e0c0dcb1664b6b87dc40d3ecfcf3284c

Ukraine waits for Trump the dealmaker to broker end of Putin’s war | Shaun Walker in Kyiv	The US president-elect’s policy on the conflict may prove decisive, but appeasing both sides will be a challenge A new year in Ukraine began in much the same way as the old one finished: with deadly Russian drone attacks across the country. In Kyiv, one person was killed and at least six others were injured in the first few hours of 2025. It is Ukraine’s third new year since Russia’s invasion. If 2023 began with hopes high that Ukrainian battlefield gains would push Russia back and lead to an outright victory, by the start of 2024 the Ukrainian army and population were already settled in for the long haul and had few illusions about a quick victory.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/04/ukraine-dealmaker-trump-putin-war-russia-zelenskyy	2025-01-04T08:29:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55c732ceca99894ff00b099c7f3d6427a9aac999/0_26_4418_2651/master/4418.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=78a1b857311b088c22bdd6b74798b492
