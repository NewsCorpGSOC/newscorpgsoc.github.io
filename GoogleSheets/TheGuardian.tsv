The cars eating Australia: should we be trying to reverse our attraction to SUVs and utes?	Australians are hooked on tax perks while road fatalities and emissions are surging and spending on petrol and insurance increasing It’s impossible not to have noticed it – cars have been getting bigger and bigger, and SUVs and four-door utes have become Australia’s new family car. Gone are the days of the Commodore or Corolla fighting it out as Australia’s most popular vehicle. We’re now well into the era of the Ranger, RAV4, HiLux and Outlander, as well as increasing flirtations with US-style pickup trucks, and it shows no sign of stopping. It happened gradually, despite the mounting evidence about some of the problems posed by these vehicles.

‘A cultural embarrassment’: anger as male sculptor commissioned for statue of suffragist	Planning application reignites row over statue on Edinburgh’s Royal Mile of Elsie Inglis, Scottish suffragist and maternal health pioneer Edinburgh’s Royal Mile and its surrounding streets are not short of monuments. In a 30-minute round trip, visitors can rub the nose of Greyfriars Bobby, spit on the Heart of Midlothian and touch David Hume’s toe, all thought to bring good luck. On the way, they might stop for a selfie with Wojtek the Bear, an honorary member of the Polish army who went on to live in Edinburgh Zoo, while the Scott Monument, built to honour Sir Walter, looms overhead. According to campaigners, though, there is something missing: women. There are no freestanding statues of women in the city centre, and only a handful in the surrounding area. So when a fundraiser was launched in 2017 to secure a Royal Mile statue for Elsie Inglis, Scottish suffragist and maternal health pioneer, it quickly gained momentum. But when plans were finally unveiled last month, a bitter row was reignited about the choice of a male sculptor and his vision for the statue.	https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/mar/16/anger-male-sculptor-commissioned-statue-suffragist-edinburgh-elsie-inglis	2025-03-16T01:00:13-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20960aa258ff9aa9329901cf89bf96940e9750ae/961_307_4369_2623/master/4369.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4ee2acb7ba9382b9673aeb23d85130f9

Now, electronic banking is seen as a potential threat to national security In 2018 a former deputy governor of Sweden’s central bank predicted that by 2025 the country would probably be cashless. Seven years on, that prediction has turned out to be pretty much true. Just one in 10 purchases are made with cash, and card is the most common form of payment, followed by the Swedish mobile payment system Swish, launched by six banks in 2012 and now ubiquitous. Other mobile phone payment services are also growing quickly.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/16/sweden-cash-digital-payments-electronic-banking-security	2025-03-15T23:00:10-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0efcf09814cebc45b820643ada16f095dd1c014e/0_0_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2f1ad8caf3888b74476b894fc6556c7a
Australia’s trade minister warns Trump tariff war could raise price of Big Mac in US	Don Farrell points out most Australian beef exported to US goes to fast food giant McDonald’s Donald Trump’s trade war could raise the price of American hamburgers, Australia’s trade minister has warned, amid fears that tariffs could be extended to beef and other agricultural products. The trade minister, Don Farrell, said most of Australia’s beef exported to the United States went to fast food giant McDonald’s, and any new tariffs on our goods would inevitably increase the price Americans pay for their cheeseburgers or Big Macs.

Demon-child movie wows China – and smashes global box office records	Virtually unknown in the west, Ne Zha 2 is the world’s highest-grossing animation at £1.6bn – outdoing Inside Out 2 – just weeks after its release Just a few years ago, the biggest star of the Chinese box office was a brave army commander. Last year it was a woman who rediscovers herself through boxing. But in 2025 the hero that has caught everyone’s attention – and broken international box office records – is an animated demon child. Ne Zha 2, a Chinese animation written and directed by Yang Yu, is a whirlwind of a film. The plot, inspired by Chinese mythology, follows the story of Ne Zha, a demon child raised by humans. He is on a quest to obtain a precious elixir to restore the physical state of his friend, the dragon prince Ao Bing, whose body has been destroyed by a lightning strike.	https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/16/ne-zha-2-animation-chinese-box-office-inside-out-2	2025-03-15T22:00:09-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37829e5687975170febd268826513ce2f79b0619/264_0_1430_858/master/1430.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=45ff2a011cd3cb8f1d29c2ebab7b1288

‘It’s controversial and polarising’: is Disney’s new Snow White a poisoned apple?	The studio’s latest remake may need more than a magic kiss to survive its entanglements with politics, sexism and CGI dwarf trouble Five years ago a $250m remake of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Walt Disney’s first full-length animated feature film, must have seemed like a fine idea to corporate executives, who were going all out on remaking the studio’s dated classics into contemporary live-action movies. But the film – its title trimmed to Disney’s Snow White, set to be released in cinemas this week – has turned into a massive headache for the studio. The press have barely been let near the remake’s stars, Rachel Zegler, who is of Colombian-Polish descent and plays Snow White, and Israeli actor Gal Gadot, playing the Evil Queen. And there are no dwarves.	https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/mar/15/disney-snow-white-dwarf-politics	2025-03-15T07:27:42-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8682cd82669a3bd3bb88c7812b88aabd26f2d485/116_21_1029_617/master/1029.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7851f653159ddefe05fe86adbdff834c

Fears for human rights as Peru passes ‘simply brutal’ anti-NGO law	Experts say legislation will prevent vulnerable people from accessing justice in latest government-backed crackdown Human rights groups in Peru have voiced alarm over a controversial anti-NGO law that prevents civil society organisations from taking legal action against the state for human rights abuses – a move that activists say will prevent the vulnerable from accessing justice.

Reeves defends welfare cuts plan after report that over half of cabinet ministers are unhappy – UK politics live	Chancellor says current welfare system ‘is not working for anyone’ after reports of unease within the Labour cabinet Good morning. Keir Starmer is likely to spend much of today preparing for the online summit of European leaders who might be part of the -coalition of the willing- prepared to help contribute to Ukraine’s defence in the event of a peace deal. But Russia’s response to the US/Ukraine ceasefire plan has not been promising, as Jakub Krupa on his Europe live blog, where he is covering all today’s developments in this story. Domestically, it is not much easier for the PM either. This morning we learned that the economy shrank in January. Julia Kollewe is covering all this in detail on the business live blog. During the cabinet meeting, ministers voiced their frustration that such difficult welfare cuts are coming so soon after the raid on the aid budget, according to the people. They said how difficult the cuts would be to sell to the Labour parliamentary party. One person said some ministers are on resignation watch, depending on the shape of the final package. A Labour lawmaker said Anneliese Dodds — who quit as development minister after the aid cut — won’t be the last to leave government as politicians are asked to stomach difficult cuts. A third person noted that Labour was planning a benefit cut that even George Osborne, the architect of the most recent phase of Conservative austerity, didn’t make. We will set out our plans for welfare reform, but it is absolutely clear that the current system is not working for anyone. It is not working for people who need support, it’s not working to get people into work so that more people can fulfil their potential, and it’s not working for the taxpayer when the bill for welfare is going up by billions of pounds in the next few years.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/14/rachel-reeves-welfare-disability-cuts-labour-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live-news	2025-03-14T02:23:08-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c6f8f0ab8b9a78185e85888c16cdb396646ffb2/0_0_1911_1147/master/1911.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cb5e24a64ff4a10ab1fa7499d8e4eb79

Schumer decision to vote for Republican funding bill a ‘huge slap in the face’, says AOC - US politics live	Senate working to avert partial government shutdown before midnight deadline Here’s a little more on the comments to reporters by congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. According to a post on X by Kadia Goba, political reporter at Semafor, Ocasio-Cortez said: There are members of Congress who have won Trump held districts in some of the most difficult territories in the United States; who walked the plank and took innumerable risks in order to defend the American people … just to see some Senate Democrats even consider acquiescing to Elon Musk. I think it is a huge slap in the face, and I think that there’s a wide sense of betrayal.- Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, said that he will vote to allow the deeply partisan Republican spending bill become law because a government shutdown would do more harm. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told reporters that Senator Chuck Schumer’s statement was -a huge slap in the face, and I think that there’s a wide sense of betrayal.- Stocks plunged again after Trump’s threat to impose a 200% tariff -on all wines, Champagnes, and alcoholic products- from European Union countries if the trading bloc makes good on its threat to retaliate for steel and aluminum tariffs announced by the US president by adding a 50% tariff on American products, including Kentucky bourbon. In a letter sent to the president of Columbia University and the co-chairs of its board of trustees on Thursday, the Trump administration’s antisemitism taskforce demanded nine specific changes to university policies and structures before negotiations over federal funding would begin. Columbia announced the same day it received the letter that it had complied with item one on the list of demands: expelling and suspending pro-Palestinian student protesters who occupied a campus building last year or took part in a Gaza Solidarity encampment. Representative Raúl Grijalva died after a long battle with cancer, his office announced on Thursday. His seat will remain vacant until at least September. In 1996 a federal judge found the legal provision now being used to target Mahmoud Khalil unconstitutional. She was Donald Trump’s sister.

How many ministers does it take to deliver a speech on efficiency savings? | John Crace	Keir Starmer says he loves civil servants so much he is abolishing NHS England to give them more time to do other things Call it Project Chainsaw. It usually takes a government a couple of years or so to blame the government for stopping it from achieving what it wants to do. Keir Starmer has got there in eight months. There again, most governments have a clear plan when they get into office, so maybe it takes them longer to notice. With a few honourable exceptions, Labour never had that vision – all their focus had been on winning the election – so maybe without the distraction of having a plan that was being blocked, it took them less time to blame the government for being the problem. Here things took a further turn to the meta. How many people does it take to deliver a speech on cutting the size of the state and making efficiency savings? There appears to be no upper limit. Because it felt as if we had been drip fed most of the speech over the previous four days. So much so that for much of its duration it felt as if you already knew it word for word. Ministers need to be careful what they ask for when they talk of making efficiencies.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/13/how-many-ministers-does-it-take-to-deliver-a-speech-on-efficiency-savings-nhs-england	2025-03-13T09:59:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be83907e174baff15664b236152a6dfe98aa6852/0_347_5237_3144/master/5237.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=de92b6752346159ae28e41260e64ea45

Ukrainian soldier praised for saving life of stabbing victim in Venice	Twenty minutes after arriving on holiday in Italian city, Yanis Tereshchenko drew on experience of war to intervene A Ukrainian soldier who insists on always carrying a first-aid kit – even while on holiday – has been praised for saving the life of a stabbing victim during a trip in Venice, Italy. Yanis Tereshchenko, a 32-year-old teacher who enlisted in the Ukrainian army’s third assault brigade immediately after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, was on his way to his hotel with his wife and his five-year-old son in the Rialto district when he witnessed an altercation between two young men.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/13/ukraine-soldier-saves-stabbing-victim-venice-yanis-tereshchenko	2025-03-13T05:14:12-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58d4bd33bdfa14c2b0c2e4fce319e3552e313ede/33_130_946_567/master/946.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fdd943b9782f0ed59621db4f3187565d
Woman who lived to age 117 had genes keeping her cells ‘younger’, study shows	Maria Branyas Morera, US-born supercentenarian who died in Spain last August, found to have microbiota of an infant The US-born woman who was the world’s oldest living person before she died in Spain last August at age 117 once attributed her longevity to -luck and good genetics-. And, evidently, Maria Branyas Morera was right. A study of Branyas’s microbiome and DNA that scientists began conducting before her death reportedly determined that the genes she inherited allowed her cells to essentially feel and behave as if they were 17 years younger than they actually were. And Branyas’s microbiota – which primarily refers to the bacteria in people’s guts that has a role in keeping them healthy – mirrored that of an infant, according to the research led by University of Barcelona genetics professor Manel Esteller, a leading expert on ageing.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/13/supercentenarian-aging-genes-study	2025-03-13T05:00:05-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/072fa12d28f70e557e52b4fb70010816b652d7c8/422_601_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8f43633cdc0bd491f55656ae77f4aa8a
Russia wary of proposed Ukraine ceasefire plan as US talks begin	Kremlin aide says proposed 30-day truce would only provide brief reprieve for Ukraine troops Russia has criticised a proposed US-Ukraine ceasefire, saying it would merely give Ukrainian forces a reprieve, as Donald Trump’s envoy, Steven Witkoff, arrived in Moscow for peace talks with the Kremlin. The Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said he had told the US national security adviser, Mike Waltz, that Moscow viewed the proposed 30-day ceasefire as -nothing more than a short reprieve for Ukrainian forces-.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/13/russia-wary-of-proposed-ukraine-ceasefire-plan-as-us-talks-begin	2025-03-13T04:59:41-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/516c29d0f3a1e4494de7c47ab1c61db639ee70d8/80_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a935c9d2524f6483e0f09966ab2ac3ac

Trump threatens further tariffs as EU, Canada retaliate for those already in place – US politics live	Trump said he would impose additional penalties if the EU follows through with its plan to enact counter tariffs on some US goods next month The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, is expected in the coming weeks to start a sweeping overhaul of the judge advocate general’s corps as part of an effort to make the US military less restricted by the laws of armed conflict, according to two people familiar with the matter. The changes are poised to have implications across the military, as Hegseth’s office considers changes to the interpretation of the US rules of engagement on the battlefield to the way that charges are brought under the military justice system. China on Thursday called for -dialogue- with Washington to resolve spiralling trade tensions that have seen the world’s two largest economies impose a slew of tariffs on each other’s imports. -China has always advocated that China and the United States should adopt a positive and cooperative attitude towards differences and controversies in economic and trade fields,- commerce ministry spokesperson He Yongqian told a weekly news conference. US secretary of state Marco Rubio has arrived in Canada for two days of talks with the top diplomats of the G7. Rubio will probably be hearing a litany of complaints about Trump’s decisions from countries in the G7 – notably host Canada, to which Trump has been most antagonistic with persistent talk of it becoming the 51st US state, additional tariffs and repeated insults against its leadership. Donald Trump has accused Ireland of stealing the US pharmaceutical industry and the tax revenue that should have been paid to the US treasury, in a blow to the Irish premier, Micheál Martin, who had hoped to emerge unscathed from a visit to the White House marking St Patrick’s Day. The US president showed grudging respect for Martin, alternately ribbing and complimenting him, while also launching several broadsides against the EU. Chuck Schumer, leader of the Senate’s Democratic minority, said that Democrats will not provide the necessary votes to adopt a partisan funding bill passed by House Republicans, which includes cuts to vital services and programmes. To avoid a shutdown on Friday, Schumer said, the Senate should pass a temporary measure and then negotiate a longer-term measure that can garner bipartisan support. Rather than take Schumer up on his offer to negotiate, Republicans quickly rolled out a social-media strategy to blame him for shutting down the government by not accepting the Republican effort to ram through the partisan funding bill. US district judge Tanya Chutkan granted a request by 14 state attorneys general for discovery in a suit against Elon Musk and his so-called -department of government efficiency- (Doge) service to uncover the -parameters of Doge’s and Musk’s authority-, and the identities of Doge personnel. The federal judge Beryl Howell has blocked an executive order that Donald Trump signed last week directing agencies to terminate contracts and no longer interact with Perkins Coie, a law firm that worked with Democrats during the 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns. The Trump administration quietly cleared all remaining migrants from the American military base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba this week. The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, defended the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the United States who took part in student protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza, by claiming, without evidence, that the Columbia graduate student was -a big supporter of Hamas-. As his administration moves to gut the Department of Education, Trump levied an attack on employees at federal agency, accusing them of being lazy.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/mar/13/donald-trump-tariffs-canada-eu-us-politics-latest-news-updates	2025-03-13T03:09:19-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dc6c92202b9cf2dc4ed22e97ef068360e0e0a6e/896_228_5464_3280/master/5464.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2e82d09643b4b0f63587caf2ca6a60a5

Keir Starmer to outline reforms of ‘overcautious, flabby state’ in civil service speech – UK politics live	PM will give a speech shortly, followed by a Q&amp;A with the media Good morning. All prime ministers, sooner or later, get frustrated when they realise that the central government machine isn’t as effective as they would like. They arrive thinking that if they tell their officials to do something, it will happen, and they find out that it’s not that simple. When talking about this, they normally combine their criticism of the system with comments about how the individual civil servants with whom they work personally are excellent. Keir Starmer has arrived at this stage more quickly than some of his predecessors and this week there have been a series of announcements about shaking up Whitehall. Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister, has said measures will be taken to ease out officials who are under-performing. On Tuesday Starmer told cabinet that the government should be taking more responsibility for decisions, and not outsourcing them to regulators. And today Starmer is going to say that the state has become -bigger, but weaker-. We need to go further and faster on security and renewal. In such uncertain times, people want a state that will take care of the big questions, not a bigger state that asks more from them. We need to be operating at maximum efficiency and strength. I believe in the power of the state. I’m not interested in ideological arguments about whether it should be bigger or smaller. I simply want it to work. I saw the state at its best in our response to the riots last summer. It was dynamic, strong and urgent. But for the most part, that’s not the state that most people will recognise. I heard from a family business owner in Wales that builds homes for first-time buyers. During the consultation delays and the lengthy planning application, the cost of resources went up. The regulations held him back for so long that he lost the site. Business unable to grow because of red tape. Families unable to buy because an overcautious flabby state got in the way. No person’s substantive time should be spent on a task where digital or AI can do it better, quicker and to the same high quality and standard.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/13/keir-starmer-speech-civil-service-ai-labour-benefit-cuts-conservatives-uk-politics-latest-news	2025-03-13T02:39:26-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fdf818ca250b7e9ae0fa630f6bbd772d755d79b/0_742_2527_1516/master/2527.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=14e093fa70cedc2214b2a4846f72d7ce

Ukraine war live: Russian operation in Kursk is in final stage, Kremlin claims, as US negotiators head to Moscow	Russian operation to expel Ukrainian forces in final stage, claims Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, following visit to region by President Vladimir Putin The news comes as US president Donald Trump said on Wednesday that negotiators were headed to Russia -right now- for talks on a possible ceasefire with Ukraine, after Kyiv agreed to a 30-day truce. Ukraine’s army commander-in-chief, Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, suggested his troops were pulling back to minimise losses in Kursk. -In the most difficult situation, my priority has been and remains saving the lives of Ukrainian soldiers. To this end, the units of the defence forces, if necessary, manoeuvre to more favourable positions,- Syrski posted online, in terms typically used to describe a withdrawal. Syrskyi said the Russian military was suffering huge personnel and equipment losses while trying to achieve -political gains- by attempting to oust Ukrainian troops. Sudzha is the largest settlement that Ukraine seized in Kursk, and the Ukraine-based Deep State open-source mapping project showed earlier on Wednesday that Kyiv was no longer in full control of it. -The enemy is using assault units of airborne troops and special operations forces to break through our defences, oust our troops out of the Kursk region and move fighting to the territory of Sumy and Kharkiv regions,- Syrskyi said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Kyiv was doing -as much as possible- to protect its soldiers. -The Russians are clearly trying to put maximum pressure on our troops, and our military command is doing what it has to do,- the Ukrainian president told a press conference in Kyiv. -We are preserving the lives of our soldiers as much as possible.- Donald Trump suggested he could target Russia financially as Ukraine’s president urged him to take strong steps if Moscow failed to support a 30-day ceasefire agreed between Ukrainian and US delegations meeting in Saudi Arabia. Washington, Kyiv and Europe are waiting for Moscow’s response to the proposal, and US envoys are expected to hold talks with Putin by the end of the week. The Kremlin has not publicly said whether or not it supports an immediate ceasefire. If Putin refuses, Trump said he could -do things financially that would be very bad for Russia-. Zelenskyy said he expected strong measures from the Washington if Russia rejected the ceasefire proposal. -I understand that we can count on strong steps. I don’t know the details yet but we are talking about sanctions [against Russia] and strengthening Ukraine.- The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Washington wanted Moscow’s agreement with no strings attached. -That’s what we want to know – if they’re prepared to do it unconditionally,- Rubio said on a plane heading to a G7 meeting in Canada. -If the response is yes, then we know we’ve made real progress, and there’s a real chance of peace. If their response is no, it would be highly unfortunate, and it’ll make their intentions clear.- The US threats came as the French defence minister, Sébastien Lecornu, told a press conference in Paris that a ceasefire announcement could come as soon as Thursday and that Europe would have to be prepared to help enforce it. Defence ministers from Europe’s five leading military powers – the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland and France – met in the French capital on Wednesday to discuss the formation of a -reassurance force- that would guarantee peace in Ukraine if a settlement was agreed. Lecornu said they were -hoping to see a ceasefire tomorrow- and that 15 countries were willing to contribute to a force of up to 30,000 personnel that would permanently secure Ukraine’s airports, ports and infrastructure.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/mar/13/ukraine-war-live-blog-updates-ceasefire-russia-trump-zelenskyy-putin-updates	2025-03-12T22:37:30-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b5f59b7c56cfe77110c0a5be4b7087a1dd3ee4/0_0_3127_1877/master/3127.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8644276188efc29bffabc48e89411a86

Decision not to classify Southport killer as a terrorist was right, says UK watchdog	Review concluded extending definition to cover extreme violence by ‘loners’ such as Axel Rudakubana is unhelpful The decision not to classify Axel Rudakubana as a terrorist following the Southport murders was right because it would be unhelpful to stretch the definition of terrorism to cover all extreme violence, the UK’s terror watchdog has concluded. Jonathan Hall KC wrote that the -legal definition of terrorism is already wide and should not be changed any further- in his post-Southport review of how extreme violence is legally classified.

Australia news live: Leonardo DiCaprio speaks up for WA forest; Wong warns Russia against ‘bullying behaviour’	Actor posts his opposition to a bauxite mine that he says threatens rare bettongs. Follow today’s news live Leonardo DiCaprio has drawn the world’s attention to the government’s decision to allow the mining company South32 to clear native forest in WA’s jarrah forests for bauxite mining. The actor claimed the operation at Boddington could threaten the critically endangered woylie (or brush-tailed bettong) and that the government was prioritising -mining development over environmental protection-. The mining company @south_32 is set to clear 9,600 acres of this old growth forest, which is home to threatened species like the Critically Endangered Woylie. This operation will destroy critical habitat for over 8,000 species, 80% of which are found nowhere else on Earth. While native forest logging was banned in Western Australia in 2024, clearance of native forests for mining is still allowed due to separate government policies that prioritize mining development over environmental protection. I don’t think Australians respond very well to that kind of bullying behaviour from anybody, and certainly not from Russia ... we would consider any request, and that is the sensible thing to do. We have an interest in the UN Charter not being undermined by a permanent member of the security council. These are rules which keep us all safe, and we have to continue to work to defend them. We continue to advocate, alongside so many others in the international community and in Europe for a just and enduring peace, a fair resolve for Ukraine.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/mar/13/australia-news-live-energy-prices-cost-of-living-tariffs-steel-aluminium-election-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-ntwnfb	2025-03-12T12:39:19-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ee0ae7b80e5e5e0a0390868602cb5715971cc6f/0_198_4090_2453/master/4090.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=949f791ac8c3d8834af2f2710e82d818

The fruit of flattery is tariffs, but Trump-wrangler Starmer stays circumspect | John Crace	Trying to find meaning in the meaningless, Labour finds itself in a trade war. At least Reform are still giving comic relief Well, that went well, didn’t it? Weeks of finding ever more ingenious ways to flatter the US president. Extolling the brilliance of Donald Trump being able to tie his own shoelaces. -That’s incredible, Mr President. No one has ever managed to do that so beautifully.- No chance for flattery has been passed up. It is now the sign of the highest IQ not to be able to speak in joined-up sentences. To change your mind at a moment’s notice. Yet at all times, Keir Starmer has remained a paragon of obsequiousness. Not a word out of place. And what do we get for it? The occasional hint of recognition from the Donald. Which we cling to. Attempting to find meaning in something essentially meaningless. Something that came with little thought. And now we also are landed with 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium. A reward for obeisance. That’s the thing with Trump. He gets angry if he’s disrespected but has nothing but contempt for those who humour him. He’s a complicated proposition.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/12/fruit-flattery-tariffs-trump-wrangler-starmer-circumspect	2025-03-12T10:26:30-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10b7e08564139c82244c1e17946907038d0b1f69/0_39_3027_1816/master/3027.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fbffa5151ec8f903165953e2ec082807

Cautious Zelenskyy keeps cards close to his chest as Ukraine ceasefire proposed	Ukrainian president would not be drawn on details of proposed deal and also steered clear of criticising Trump at press briefing As journalists filtered out of the presidential administration in central Kyiv on Wednesday afternoon after a 30-minute press conference with president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the general consensus was that he had not said anything that would immediately make for a dramatic headline. That, it seems, was the point.

Rodrigo Duterte’s arrest could be telling blow in the Philippines’ dynastic feud	Former president was surrendered to The Hague amid a row between his family and that of the current president Few expected things to move so quickly. Supporters of the Philippines’ former president Rodrigo Duterte barely had time to protest before he was jetted off to The Hague to face charges of crimes against humanity in relation to his country’s so-called -war on drugs-. According to activists, this bloody crackdown has seen as many as 30,000 people killed since 2016. The charges brought against the former leader are the culmination of years of work by activists, lawyers and victims, who documented abuses committed under his government, often at great personal risk. But Duterte arguably would not have been surrendered to The Hague if it weren’t for his family’s dramatic feud with that of Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the current president.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/12/rodrigo-dutertes-arrest-could-be-telling-blow-in-the-philippines-dynastic-feud	2025-03-12T09:04:04-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90deae29fe3edb782e35b15446bbe2cf4dcb3c3c/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ced7bd8d36b0c070320eebf3d7978e6c

Expert concerned as large rafts of invasive fire ants seen floating in flood waters after Cyclone Alfred	Kirsty McKenna filmed entire colonies clinging on to debris, ready to make nests on dry ground in Queensland and beyond Fire ants are forming rafts to survive and travel on flood waters caused by ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred in south-east Queensland as experts warn extreme weather events could sweep the highly invasive species into other parts of Australia. Footage captured in the Scenic Rim and northern Gold Coast in recent days shows red imported fire ants (Rifas) grouping together and floating on flood waters. Clumps of the ants can then be seen forming nests on previously uninfested land after waters receded.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/13/fire-ants-australia-qld-rafts-rafting-cyclone-alfred	2025-03-12T07:00:45-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e960a41e9740e096103512063d6c6c29d929445/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=39a4defd082c4777b19e6b9a1216d764

Sydney writers’ festival 2025: tallying authors’ views on Israel-Gaza ‘tokenistic and unfortunate’, organisers say	After the shock resignation of the festival’s chair, the Sydney writers’ festival unveils its starry 2025 program in ‘an incredibly polarised environment’ Over the past two years, programming a writers’ festival has become one of the most politically fraught undertakings in the Australian cultural sphere. Both Sydney and Melbourne writers’ festivals have seen board members resign over programming decisions, while Adelaide and Perth have fended off calls for the de-platforming of speakers on both sides of the Israel-Gaza conflict. Literary events are traditionally lauded for their -restraint, reason and tolerance in the face of opposing views- – but writers’ festivals are now issuing safety tips and employing security as they navigate -the frontier between social media’s echo chambers of outrage and the traditional public square’s conventions-, the University of Melbourne journalism academic Denis Muller observed in the Conversation last year, after the resignation of the Melbourne writers’ festival’s deputy chair, Leslie Reti.

The dogged fence-mending may yet unravel as multiple hurdles remain, principally the outstanding question of Ukraine’s security guarantees, but for the first time, in the words of Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, the ball is in Russia’s court. Putin, by instinct cautious, has preferred watching from the sidelines, suppressing his delight as Trump denounced Volodymyr Zelenskyy to his face in the White House and wreaked subsequent vengeance by stopping all military aid and then pulling some US intelligence.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/12/uk-france-repair-us-ukraine-ties-trump-zelenskyy-russia-putin	2025-03-12T04:53:37-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8caf163bac8ef5ddb23a373a230bf15583296700/474_145_4259_2555/master/4259.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=94c42303b1564d6a05d80ad445aa07f8

The service’s assistant commissioner, Nicole Hogan, has expressed concern about reports of children and young people playing on the severely eroded dunes: While the weather has now eased and it is encouraging to see communities return to normality and visit the beach, it is vital that I remind families that severe coastal erosion occurred on many beaches due to the storm surge and big waves which we experienced. There is currently an increased risk that the sand dunes will collapse and cause injury due to the severe erosion. While it may appear fun for children to play on them, it is not worth the risk	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/mar/12/australia-news-live-beach-erosion-election-labor-coalition-poll-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-ntwnfb	2025-03-11T12:47:34-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cdfbe6f2cf1588750684ce1901f5fe807b4fab1/0_48_5141_3086/master/5141.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=07696b7fa2f80cc1243dff1196951679
Dizzying turnaround in US-Ukraine relations leaves all eyes on Russia	Putin may well stick to previous demands over Ukrainian elections and a rejection of European peacekeeping forces Suddenly the ball is in Russia’s court. The flow of US intelligence and military aid to Ukraine is to resume – and the Kremlin is being asked to agree to a 30-day ceasefire that Kyiv has already told the Americans it will sign up to. It is a dizzying turnaround from the Oval Office row between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump and the apparent abandonment of the White House’s strategy to simply pressurise Ukraine into agreeing to a peace deal. Now, for the first time, Russia is being asked to make a commitment, though it is unclear what will follow if it does sign up.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/11/dizzying-turnaround-in-us-ukraine-relations-leaves-all-eyes-on-russia	2025-03-11T12:45:19-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5311a58961480dd0396f8d58448eaed300e53545/0_127_7635_4581/master/7635.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8f4f1f304b6b36d99eaa897311f7da78

Minister rejects claim that planning reforms designed to penalise farmers – UK politics live	Housing minister defends reforms in planning bill ahead of publication saying they are not aimed at farmers Good morning. The government’s planning and infrastructure bill is being published later today, and in an article for the Times Angela Rayner, the deputy PM and housing secretary, claims it will be -a major step forward in getting Britain building again-. The measures in the legislation have already been well publicised and Rayner sums them up like this. A new road for Norwich was set to make life easier for 44,000 homeowners, speeding up journeys to East Anglia’s biggest hospital and creating 33,000 new jobs. But it was delayed by spurious legal challenges for two years until the case was dismissed as having no logical basis. This government gave it the green light last week. The many organisations that must be consulted in the planning process are also putting up unnecessary obstacles. A row over balls hit from a cricket club has delayed 139 new flats in Bradford. The wait for a development consent order increased by 65 per cent between 2012 and 2021. It now takes around four years to get a decision on major infrastructure. We have been supportive of many of the Government’s changes to planning policy, but giving councils more power to reduce the value of land is a step too far, especially in the context of such a challenging outlook for farmers and the inheritance tax fiasco. This is not about people blocking development, it’s about the state paying the market price for land. We need more houses and more economic development, but not at the cost of basic principles. We are obviously and very clearly not setting out to target agricultural land. The land use framework we’re consulting on currently will ensure that prime agricultural land is protected, and food security is protected. I see this power being used in particular, to much greater effect – and that’s where I want to see it come forward – specifically in urban areas, on previously developed brownfield land where regeneration projects with a significant public interest can be unlocked more easily.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/11/angela-rayner-planning-reform-farmers-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live	2025-03-11T02:41:11-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8a38d1b73f4893a5302601fa0b83a1031369f41/0_67_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f35ecbaefa67bf2ea99c99743e16456c

Lib Dems urge Starmer to visit Canada to back incoming PM Mark Carney in his stand against Trump – UK politics live	Ed Davey’s comments come after the PM angered Canadians by refusing to answer questions on Trump’s stance on Canada Good morning.

But the Trump/Ukraine crisis overshadows everything. Last night Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, was elected leader of the Liberal party in Canada, which means he will become prime minister. Canadian election results don’t over take centre stage in UK politics, but Carney was elected promising fierce opposition to President Trump’s talk of annexing Canada and in London Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, is urging Starmer to fly to Ottawa this week -to stand in solidarity with the country’s new prime minister in response to Trump’s threats against Canada-. In a statement Davey said: It’s vital for both British and Canadian security that we stand strong together. With global instability rising, it’s never been more important to show a united front with our Commonwealth friends – and to stand together against Trump senselessly turning the screws on his allies, whether that’s Canada, the UK or Europe. Responding to the trade war along the North American border, our Prime Minister must stand in solidarity against Trump’s bullying and visit Ottawa in a joint show of strength. Starmer must be clear that Trump’s threats against Commonwealth nations’ sovereignty are unacceptable. Trump allies will be vigilant for any coded message Charles sends, following the warm reception he gave Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Sandringham shortly after the Ukrainian was ambushed by the president and JD Vance in the Oval Office.

But while that might save some Republican politicians from public humiliation, it could also deprive Americans of opportunities to interact with their elected officials, experts said, and prevent people from letting their representatives they are not happy with the increasingly divisive direction of the Trump administration.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/09/republicans-public-events	2025-03-09T06:00:01-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddecda5a7faccc05d1a284399da28c1a62ad90ab/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=83fa3bed959ec7e690a1548d7a8610dc
Gene Hackman’s final days marked by isolation: ‘slowing down and reclusive’	The actor was likely alone in his house for days, disoriented and too frail to seek help, after death of wife Betsy Arakawa Actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, who were found dead last month in Santa Fe, New Mexico, were rarely apart from each other, and it’s that closeness that may have led to the circumstances of their deaths. Arakawa had become Hackman’s caregiver in his later years when he developed Alzheimer’s disease and became incapable of carrying out even the simplest of tasks. She ran the household errands, made sure he remained active and protected him from illnesses.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/09/gene-hackman-final-days	2025-03-09T05:00:03-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5c5b09380da802c06326371cd4136f3e591b9f3/0_154_2464_1479/master/2464.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=159930f32302550d31ee2e69104f511e

After tossing aside decades of alignment with Europe against Russian aggression, the US president suspended military assistance and intelligence to Kyiv and said on Friday he finds it -easier- to work with Russia than Ukraine.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/09/trump-ukraine-russia-explainer	2025-03-09T01:00:48-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/424ac903f8735f52d4cb26d0b0d06bb4ca0d2c75/0_150_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3f20cfbc13ae67ca7d9cca3b128c5f13
Ukraine war live: Zelenskyy says Ukraine ‘fully committed’ to talks ahead of US meeting in Saudi Arabia	Ukrainian president backs negotiations despite Trump’s comments while calling for more sanctions on Russia after deadly missile attack Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine is -fully committed- to having a constructive dialogue with US representatives in Saudi Arabia next week, even as Donald Trump said he found it -easier- to deal with Russia than with Ukraine in efforts to end the war. -Realistic proposals are on the table. The key is to move quickly and effectively,- the Ukrainian president said on X ahead of his trip to Saudi Arabia next week. Three people were killed and seven others injured in a drone attack early on Saturday in the city of Bogodukhiv, the military head of the eastern Kharkiv region, Oleg Synegubov, said. Russia fired two missiles and 145 drones at Bogodukhiv, Ukraine’s air force said. The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said on Saturday that appeasement towards Russia was leading to more tragedy in Ukraine. -This is what happens when someone appeases barbarians,- Tusk wrote on X. -More bombs, more aggression, more victims. Another tragic night in Ukraine.- The Russian defence ministry announced the recapture of Viktorovka, Nikolayevka and Staraya Sorochina in its Kursk region. According to DeepState, an online military tracker linked to the Ukrainian army, the Russian move followed a -breach- in Ukrainian defence lines near the town of Sudzha, which is under Kyiv’s control. An army source interviewed by Ukrainska Pravda newspaper said that the Ukrainian soldiers were trying to -stabilise the situation- but the Russian troops had -completely cut off the supply lines-. Moscow’s defence ministry on Saturday said its air defence systems had destroyed 31 Ukrainian drones over the previous night. A Ukrainian drone attack also targeted Russia’s Kirishi oil refinery and falling debris caused damage to a reservoir, the governor of the north-western Leningrad region, Aleksandr Drozdenko, said. A civilian was injured by a drone attack in Belgorod district near the Ukraine border, the local governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, wrote on Telegram. Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said his country would consider taking part in a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine. The Australian leader spoke on Saturday with his UK counterpart, Keir Starmer, who has joined France in trying to rally a -coalition of the willing- to protect any ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war. -Both of our nations are very clear about our support for Ukraine, and it of course is too early – you can’t have peacekeeping forces without having peace,- Albanese told a news conference. -I certainly have said very clearly, publicly, repeatedly, that we would give consideration to participating in any peacekeeping mission in the Ukraine.- Australia will send a senior representative to a chiefs of defence meeting in Paris on Tuesday to discuss future backing for Ukraine, Albanese said.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/mar/09/ukraine-war-live-volodymyr-zelenskyy-us-trump-putin-saudi-arabia-talks-news	2025-03-09T00:42:34-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95d1b3526ffefd6b39f120ebb23895c09fcca33c/752_552_5248_3149/master/5248.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ae8bb59cedf1a28e163596b052a9134f

Covid, five years on: UK ‘still not ready to protect the population’	Scientific triumphs were made in the battle against the pandemic, but the memories and lessons are already in danger of being lost On 9 March 2020, Martin Landray was studying the likely impact of Covid-19 as it started to sweep Britain. What was needed, he realised, was a method for pinpointing cheap, effective drugs that might limit the impact of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that was filling UK hospitals with ­dangerously ill patients. Within 10 days, Landray – working with Oxford University colleague Peter Horby – had set up Recovery, a drug-testing programme that involved thousands of doctors and nurses working with tens of ­thousands of Covid-19 patients in UK hospitals.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/09/covid-five-years-on-uk-still-not-ready-to-protect-the-population	2025-03-08T22:00:44-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/362748b882f56f3de141f115fc20f2052b747926/0_97_6013_3609/master/6013.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6a9f33ec35cbedc7263a2164145e2cc5

House Republicans unveil spending bill boosting defense and trimming all else	Strategy is not likely to earn Democrats’ votes, so Trump is leaning on Republicans to force it through US House Republicans unveiled a spending bill Saturday that would keep federal agencies funded through 30 September, pushing ahead with a go-it-alone strategy that seems certain to spark a major confrontation with Democrats over the contours of government spending. The 99-page bill would provide a slight boost to defense programs while trimming non-defense programs below 2024 budget year levels. That approach is likely to be a non-starter for most Democrats who have long insisted that defense and non-defense spending move in the same direction.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/house-republicans-spending-bill	2025-03-08T11:30:56-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d529e9bad160210347c7d518d2d71a4827045f6d/0_73_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ec85f36fe7eff4474ac39485e05cd726

Ukraine war live: 11 killed in Donetsk as Russia steps up attacks after Trump defends Putin	High-rise apartment blocks in centre of Dobropillia town hit in attack a day after US suspended intelligence sharing with Kyiv Welcome to our live coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. Here’s a snapshot of the latest to bring you up to speed. At least 11 people were killed and 30 wounded in Russian strikes on eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region late on Friday, the country’s emergency service said on Saturday, raising the earlier death toll of four. Russia carried out huge ballistic missile and drone strikes across Ukraine a day after the US stopped sharing intelligence with Kyiv which had previously given advance warnings of attacks. The strikes came early on Friday as a Ukrainian delegation prepared to meet with US counterparts in Saudi Arabia next week for talks about a possible end to the war, report Luke Harding and Dan Sabbagh. In a post on Truth Social, Donald Trump appeared to criticise Russia’s latest bombardment. The US president posted: -Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely ‘pounding’ Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED.- Separately, Trump said after the strikes that Vladimir Putin was -doing what anybody would do-. -I think he wants to get it [the war] stopped and settled and I think he’s hitting them harder than he’s been hitting them and I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now,- he told reporters in the White House. Trump also said he found it -easier- to deal with Russia than with Ukraine in efforts to end the war and that he trusted Putin, the Russian president. -I believe him,- Trump said. -I’m finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine and they don’t have the cards. It may be easier dealing with Russia.- Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded to Russia’s strikes by calling for a truce covering air and sea. -The first steps to establishing real peace should be forcing the sole source of this war, Russia, to stop such attacks,- the Ukrainian president said on Telegram. Moscow has rejected the idea of a temporary truce, which has also been proposed by Britain and France. US aerospace company Maxar Technologies disabled Ukraine’s access to its satellite images after a request from the Trump administration. Maxar said it had contracts with the US government and dozens of allied and partner nations and -each customer makes their own decisions on how they use and share that data-. Zelenskyy’s approval rating in Ukraine has risen by 10 percentage points since his White House spat with Trump, a survey by a leading Ukrainian pollster showed on Friday. The poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology – conducted from 14 February to 4 March – found 67% of respondents trusted Zelenskyy in March, up from 57% a month earlier. Iran’s foreign ministry denied accusations by Emmanuel Macron that Tehran had supplied equipment to Russia for use in the Ukraine war, calling the French president’s remarks -baseless and false-.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/mar/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-putin-trump-zelenskyy-donetsk-latest-news-updates	2025-03-07T23:24:21-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95c56436f78f6dc030eeff0bf69145ba3fa1ebc6/0_232_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d9980de2f7c5171d35c786b7e6d5c522

The spymaster, the ringleader and the ‘minions’: who’s who of the spy ring trial	The group was led by a fugitive in Moscow who gave orders to a Bulgarian in Great Yarmouth, the court heard A hierarchical network of individuals constituted a Russian-directed spy ring, the Old Bailey heard during a three-month espionage trial. Directed from Moscow by a fugitive, it was led by a Bulgarian based in Great Yarmouth who, largely through a friend and deputy, directed the operations of the others.

‘The dumbest thing I’ve ever done’: spy trial’s tales of scheming, bluster and a love triangle	Trial of three ‘minions’ in spy ring for Russia heard of chaotic errors, tangled relationships, a cancer lie and a red button It began with a simple request, though it was written by one of the world’s most wanted men. -We’d be interested in a Bulgarian guy working for Bellingcat: Christo Grozev,- the author wrote at 7.46pm on 14 December 2020. Another message followed on Telegram: -Can we look into this guy or would it raise too many questions?- And so a spy ring of Bulgarians based in Britain but working for Russia began to form. The author was Jan Marsalek, a fugitive businessman accused of involvement in a €1.9bn fraud on the German payments company Wirecard – and an agent for Russia. Earlier that year he had fled to Moscow, and now he had time on his hands. The message’s recipient was Orlin Roussev, 47, an IT specialist and private investigator who had been based in the UK for several years – and somebody Marsalek appeared to know well.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/07/spy-trial-scheming-bluster-tangled-relationships	2025-03-07T06:46:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3bbd920883c55d3ed7b988811234f4669f7a5cc/0_386_1686_1011/master/1686.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4b934d01c2f8c8fc8d0f827356a66af3

The revelation that waste facilities in Tasmania’s south received more than 5,500 tonnes of dead salmon last month – equivalent to about 1.07 million full-grown Atlantic salmon, or 8% of total annual production in the state – followed weeks of reports of fatty chunks of fish washing up on beaches in the Huon Valley and on Bruny Island.

China vows action over ‘arbitrary’ tariffs as Trump pauses measures against Canada and Mexico – US politics live	Foreign minister calls measures ‘two-faced acts’ Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the coming hours. We start with news that the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said China will continue to retaliate against the United States’ -arbitrary tariffs- despite pausing similar action against Canada and Mexico. Trump told his cabinet secretaries that they are in charge of hiring and firings at their agencies, not Elon Musk. The House has voted to censure Democratic congressman Al Green for disrupting Trump’s address to this week’s joint session of Congress. The motion was approved with 224 votes in favor and 198 opposed, with 10 Democrats in support. In an escalation of his pressure campaign, Trump said the US will not fight for Nato allies who don’t spend enough on their own defense. US district judge Beryl Howell ruled on Thursday that Donald Trump’s firing of a Democratic member of the National Labor Relations Board was illegal and ordered that she be reinstated to her post. Axios reports that the state department is hunting for evidence that foreign students who express support for Palestinians under Israeli occupation while studying in the US are -pro-Hamas-, and can have their visas revoked, based on an AI review of their social media accounts. Trump thanked a reporter for the partisan outlet Breitbart for asking him a friendly question in the Oval Office, which teed him up to attack Democrats. The White House excluded non-partisan reporters from Reuters and the Associated Press to make room for Breitbart and One America News, two pro-Trump outlets. Trump signed an executive order on Thursday evening to establish a -strategic bitcoin reserve-, a day before meeting with executives from the cryptocurrency industry at the White House. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who reportedly endured a profanity-laced tirade from Trump, was asked about his foreign minister’s comment that dealing with the US was now -a psychodrama-. -How would you characterize it?- a reporter asked. -Thursday-, Trudeau replied.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/mar/07/donald-trump-tariffs-china-canada-mexico-us-politics-live-news	2025-03-07T02:57:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0de3ed9765049cf579b50c80481a6572917893d2/0_251_5719_3432/master/5719.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a32b249129293bd6db6db0d5df94fec9

His company – the producer of most of the world’s most advanced semiconductors – would boost its existing $65bn US presence by a whopping $100bn.

And discovered that a change in the US administration, and USAid funding cuts, means there is a growing fear of prison breaks A few weeks ago, Michael Safi travelled to north-east Syria, an area controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. Here, suspected foreign fighters for Islamic State – including those from Britain – have for years been imprisoned without charge and with no idea of when they would be released. Few prisoners in the camp say they are IS members. Michael and fellow journalist, Will Christou, spoke to a former British surgeon from Leicester who told a surprising story of being ‘tricked’ into crossing into Syria from Turkey. They also met an Australian prisoner, who admitted to being an IS member, and whose family for years did not know his whereabouts.	https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/mar/07/inside-the-islamic-state-prisons-the-west-is-trying-to-forget-podcast	2025-03-06T19:00:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5db91da0e1ae59a151f1403ae387bb12d777e1a4/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=31c5d93a0e37f651a593d93fd0f18fc8

In the months after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, clearing the way for Alabama to ban virtually all abortions, Alabama attorney general Steve Marshall repeatedly suggested that abortion rights activists who help people go out of state for abortions could be charged as participants in an illegal conspiracy. The Yellowhammer Fund, an abortion fund that helped people pay for the procedure, and the West Alabama Women’s Center, a former abortion clinic that pivoted to providing services like miscarriage management, joined with other abortion rights advocates to sue Marshall over his comments.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/05/alabama-court-hearing-abortion	2025-03-05T03:00:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dea029afeebd9d9beb743179befb1a8c9adc884/0_179_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d18df9255f0a2fda5fade74b04ce1aed
IRS workforce ‘could halve’ after Trump hails cuts to federal staffing in marathon Congress speech – US politics live	Federal agencies have until 13 March to formulate staff reduction plans as allies and critics react to Trump’s marathon Congress speech Welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of US politics and the Donald Trump administration. I’m Tom Ambrose. We start with news that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is considering reducing its workforce by as much as 50%, according to reports. The agency has already laid off about 7,000 of its 90,000 employees since Donald Trump came to power. Donald Trump on Tuesday declared that his administration was -just getting started- as Democratic lawmakers protested with placards that read -lies- and -false- during his a marathon address to Congress The president’s speech was littered with false claims he has previously been corrected on but continues to repeat – here are some of those -facts- checked He doubled down on his expansionist rhetoric, saying the administration was in the process of -reclaiming the Panama canal- and repeating his threat to take control of Greenland: -One way or the other, we’re going to get it-. The president has also recently stated that the US will -own- the Gaza Strip The dollar has fallen to the lowest level since November, after Trump said his new tariffs will cause -a little disturbance- in his Congress speech Responding to Trump’s speech, Sen Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said that Ronald Reagan -must be rolling in his grave- after last week’s Oval Office spat with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Trump -cozying up to dictators like Vladimir Putin-, and asserted that Trump would have -lost- the cold war Democratic Rep Al Green of Texas was ejected for an outburst during Trump’s speech. He later told the media -It’s worth it to let people know that there are some of us who are going to stand up against this president- The Trump administration has listed over 300 federal buildings for sale.

Minister says welfare budget ‘unsustainable’ amid reports Reeves has earmarked billions in cuts – UK politics live	Justice secretary said there is a ‘moral case’ for getting people into work when asked about the chancellor’s reported plans Good morning. Three weeks today Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, will present her spring statement. Originally this was not meant to involve budget-scale changes for plans to tax or spending (Reeves says she is only going to have one proper budget a year, in the autumn, to ensure stability), but changes to the country’s economic situation mean this statement is going to be more consequential than originally intended and this morning the BBC is running a story that looks like classic Treasury pitch rolling. The markets don’t like surprises and, while exact details of budget announcements are kept secret until the chancellor speaks to MPs, the Treasury invests a lot of effort in ensuring that people have a rough idea of what’s coming. According to a report by the BBC’s economics editor Faisal Islam, Reeves is going to announce cuts, worth several billions pounds, particularly affecting welfare. He says: The Treasury will put the proposed cuts to the government’s official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), on Wednesday amid expectations the chancellor’s financial buffer has been wiped out. Sources said -the world has changed- since Rachel Reeves’s Budget last October, when the OBR indicated she had £9.9bn available to spend against her self-imposed borrowing rules. Clearly the world has changed a lot since the autumn Budget. People are watching that change happen before their eyes. The Office for Budget Responsibility will reflect that changing world in its forecasts later this month and a changing world will be a core feature of the chancellor’s response later this month. This is the Labour party. The clue is in the name. We believe in work. We know that there are many people who are currently receiving state support for being out of work who want to be in work. We know that we have too many of our young people currently out of work, not in education, employment or training. It is right that a Labour government strains every sinew to make sure that the support is available to prevent people from leaving the labour market or, if they have left the labour market, to help them get back. We’ve seen a huge rise in that welfare budget. We know that there are millions of people who are out of work in our country who want to be in work. It is absolutely morally the right thing to do to support people, to make sure either they don’t leave the labour market, or if they have, they’re supported to get back into it.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/05/rachel-reeves-welfare-budget-spring-statement-pmqs-labour-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-news-uk-politics-live	2025-03-05T01:23:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ebe1389c6c5f4b6686a58a386eddef45b65dc9b/0_97_4127_2477/master/4127.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=890ae1635d150bf8d4ffe531dfe49d93

Wednesday briefing: The view from ​Russia as ​Trump upends the world order	In today’s newsletter: Pjotr Sauer explains Russia’s response to the new Trump administration following a fraught week in global relations Good morning. In his address to Congress last night, Donald Trump recited a letter from Volodymyr Zelenskyy offering to return to the negotiating table – and warmly welcomed the tone of discussions his administration has held with Russia. -We’ve received strong signals that they are ready for peace,- he said. -Wouldn’t that be beautiful?- That was not the first sign of Trump’s faith in Vladimir Putin’s promises – but it served to underline what is surely the most radical US foreign policy shift in a generation. Whether parroting Kremlin talking points on Zelenskyy’s democratic credentials, making false claims that Ukraine started the war or cutting off vital military aid to Kyiv, the US president has created a dynamic that would have scarcely been believable six months ago. Killed women count | Nearly one in 10 of all women who died at the hands of men in the UK over the past 15 years were mothers killed by their sons, a report reveals. The statistics have led to calls for the government to take specific action to tackle matricide. Tariffs | Justin Trudeau has claimed the aim of a -dumb- trade war launched by Donald Trump is to usher in the -complete collapse- of the Canadian economy and make it easier for the US to annex Canada. Leading stock market indices fell sharply, with the US benchmark S&amp;P 500 losing all its post-election gains, as the US slapped 25% taxes on Canadian and Mexican goods and hiked tariffs on China.

More than 170 mothers killed by their sons in 15 years in UK, report reveals	Number is nearly one in 10 of all women killed by men, leading to calls for government action to tackle matricide Nearly one in 10 of all women who died at the hands of men in the UK over the past 15 years were mothers killed by their sons, a report reveals. Data analysing the deaths of 2,000 women killed by men since 2009 has given an unprecedented insight into the hidden scourge of matricide, with more than 170 mothers killed by their sons. 61% of women were killed by a current or former partner, 9% of women were killed by their sons, 6% by other family members, 15% by other men they knew and 10% by someone they did not know. Of the 213 women killed by a close family member, 80% were mothers killed by sons. Nearly half of women were stabbed, 27% strangled and 17% hit with a blunt instrument. In 16% of cases, a man used kicking, hitting or stamping as the weapon. In almost a quarter of cases, more than one form of violence was used. Overkill – the use of excessive, gratuitous violence beyond that necessary to cause the victim’s death – happened in 59% of femicides. Leicestershire had the highest rate of femicide over the period, followed by Merseyside, the West Midlands, Greater Manchester and London. Killed women involved in prostitution were younger and less likely to have been born in the UK. Children witnessed at least 163 femicides, while 37 women were killed alongside 53 children, most commonly by their father.

‘A real injustice’: mothers killed by their children is still a hidden issue in UK	Research shows that mothers are seen as a ‘safe space’ for their offspring – nearly all of them sons – to use violence The thought of mothers being abused or killed by their own children – the people they have carried, cared for and nurtured since birth – is something of an underexamined and almost taboo issue in Britain. There is a slowly growing body of research into why children under 18 use violent behaviour towards their parents. There is an even smaller body of research showing why adults – nearly all of them sons – do the same.

Social media firms criticise ‘irrational’ exemption of YouTube from Australia’s under-16s ban	Meta, TikTok and Snapchat release statements in campaign protesting Labor’s handling of contested legislation Meta, TikTok and Snapchat have criticised the Albanese government’s handling of the social media ban for under-16s, launching a campaign against what they have labelled an -irrational- and -shortsighted- decision to exempt YouTube from the contested legislation. The three tech platforms made submissions to a government consultation process on the ban – rushed through parliament at the end of 2024 with little inquiry – calling for a re-evaluation of Labor’s approach and demanding YouTube be subject to the same restrictions they will be.

Plus, the date by which the majority of adults globally will be overweight Good morning. The Trump administration has halted all US military aid to Ukraine, blocking the delivery of ammunition, vehicles, and other equipment as it pressures Kyiv to agree to a peace deal. What has the vice-president, JD Vance, said? That the US having financial interest in Ukraine is the best way to guarantee the country’s security. The comments come amid the minerals deal Washington wants Kyiv to sign. How do Americans feel about Ukraine? 52% of Americans said they -personally support- Ukraine, while only 4% of back Russia, a poll last week found. 44% said they do not support either. A separate poll conducted after the confrontation found that 49% said Trump and JD Vance had a stronger argument over the value of diplomacy with Russia. The 2Way poll also found that 62% thought Zelenskyy’s remarks at the White House were offensive – and 55% said Ukraine needed to negotiate and end the war. What about Mexico? The country’s president is expected to announce her response on Tuesday morning.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/04/first-thing-us-suspends-military-aid-ukraine-trump-zelenskyy-row	2025-03-04T03:30:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3deb44ed65c4f8071763ada2b533faf110d35d29/0_0_5770_3462/master/5770.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ebf716713b25c5dabdd4c5f9b66004b4

Trump to address Congress as policy decisions divide nation – US politics live	President expected to ask for more money for immigration crackdown as Democrats invite fired federal workers to speech Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. My name is Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news over the next few hours. We start with news that president Donald Trump will stand before a joint session of Congress today to give an accounting of his turbulent first weeks in office as a divided nation struggles to keep pace. The Trump administration has suspended delivery of all US military aid to Ukraine, blocking billions in crucial shipments as the White House piles pressure on Ukraine to sue for peace with Vladimir Putin. The decision affects deliveries of ammunition, vehicles, and other equipment including shipments agreed to when Joe Biden was president. It comes after a dramatic blow-up in the White House on Friday during which Donald Trump told Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he was -gambling with- a third world war. The Ukrainian president was told to come back -when he is ready for peace-. US vice-president JD Vance said that the best way to protect Ukraine from another Russian invasion is to guarantee the US has a financial interest in Ukraine’s future. -If you want real security guarantees, if you want to actually ensure that Vladimir Putin does not invade Ukraine again, the very best security guarantee is to give Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine,- Vance said in the interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity which aired Monday night. China and Canada unveiled retaliatory measures against the US after Donald Trump imposed his sweeping tariffs plan at midnight US time, despite warnings it could spark an escalating trade war. US tariffs have come into force of 25% against goods from Canada and Mexico, the US’s two biggest trading partners, and 20% tariffs against China – doubling the levy on China from last month. The duties will affect more than $918bn-worth (£722bn) of US imports from Canada and Mexico. The US health department told employees on Monday they could apply for early retirement over the next 10 days and should respond to a request for information on their accomplishments of the past week, according to emails seen by Reuters. Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, who oversees the so-called -department of government efficiency-, are spearheading an unprecedented effort to shrink the federal bureaucracy, including through job cuts. The US Senate has confirmed Linda McMahon as the nation’s next education secretary, entrusting the former wrestling executive with a department marked for dismantling by Donald Trump. The 76-year-old billionaire businesswoman and longtime Trump ally was approved 51-45, reflecting deep divisions over her qualifications and the administration’s education agenda. McMahon, who previously led the small business administration during Trump’s first term, now faces the paradoxical task of running an agency while simultaneously working toward its potential elimination. Two alleged leaders of a criminal organization suspected of smuggling 20,000 people without permanent legal residency into the US from Guatemala have been arrested in Los Angeles, federal prosecutors said on Monday. Eduardo Domingo Renoj-Matul, known as -Turko-, and his lieutenant, Cristobal Mejia-Chaj, were taken into custody Friday and have pleaded not guilty to multiple charges related to smuggling migrants across the border over five years, the US attorney’s office said. A federal judge ordered the men, who themselves are in the country illegally, jailed without bond until their trial in April.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/mar/04/donald-trump-congress-speech-ukraine-tariffs-democrats-federal-workers-us-politics-live-news	2025-03-04T02:52:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e385535968c59d843c6994afe48c3642d3edc59d/0_163_6000_3601/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c05084401e49dc4339b3c339fc4c6819

Starmer won’t be derailed from Ukraine plan, Rayner says, amid claims Trump’s aid decision ‘humiliated’ PM – UK politics live	Few hours after Starmer’s statement to Commons on Monday, White House suspended all military aid to Ukraine Good morning. Yesterday Keir Starmer had a comfortable two hours in the Commons during which MPs from all sides praised him, lavishly and sincerely, for the leadership he has shown on Ukraine, trying to hold the US and Europe together, while mobilising European efforts to build up support for Ukraine. There were probably only two moments when Starmer lashed out; first at Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, whom he accused of fawning over Vladimir Putin; and then at Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminser, whom he accused of being a keyboard warrior (in response to a question from a Labour MP who was even more critical). The attack on Flynn came about half an hour after Flynn asked a perfectly reasonable question. Unfortunately, it has been reported this afternoon that President Trump is set to meet American aides to discuss withdrawing military aid to Ukraine. Are those reports something that the prime minister recognises, and, if so, what impact will that have on the timetable to which he and President Macron are currently working? I have not seen reports of the United States withdrawing support for Ukraine, and, as I understand it, that is not its position.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/04/keir-starmer-ukraine-plan-donald-trump-aid-labour-conservative-uk-politics-latest-news	2025-03-04T01:12:34-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2baf10edcd01a6346a3265d1a3647d31816d139e/0_259_7775_4665/master/7775.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=76b42ddc4272d30109c864d899ad9c19

Tuesday briefing: Where Gaza’s fragile ceasefire stands – and what it will take to move it forward	In today’s newsletter: With talks stalled, aid blocked and a truce in question, can the path to peace get back on track? Good morning. The first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza expired over the weekend – and now, the only thing stopping the resumption of Israel’s assault on the territory is the will of Benjamin Netanyahu. That is the bleak reality for the hostages still alive in Gaza, and the Palestinian civilians there who were subjected to a new aid embargo on Sunday. Last night, the Israeli government was reported to be planning to ratchet the blockade up further – with a programme of measures referred to as the -hell plan-. When the ceasefire was agreed in January, the theory was that the first phase would provide space for negotiations over a more durable truce. But those talks simply have not happened. Israel is pushing for the release of more hostages in an extension to the first phase – a step that Hamas, fearing the loss of its only source of leverage, refuses to countenance. Both sides are now making preparations for the resumption of violence.

Bog standard? Study seeks most effective toilet training methods	UCL team is inviting parents to share their experiences, as age at which children in west acquire the skill rises Storybooks about potties, underpants featuring superheroes, rewards for doing a wee: toilet training is a rite of passage for any child.

Ministers plan major changes to Send education in England	White paper being prepared as councils hope for relief from huge deficits in special educational needs budgets Labour is preparing major changes to special educational needs provision in English schools, as individual councils raise the alarm over debts running into hundreds of millions of pounds that have pushed many to the brink of bankruptcy. A Guardian analysis has found the vast majority of English upper-tier councils have accumulated often eye-watering special educational needs spending deficits. At least 12 have forecast accumulated deficits of more than £100m, running as high as £312m, when the debts have to be settled in a year’s time. Some councils have raised concerns about profiteering amid frustration over huge fees from private specialist schools, which can charge between £50,000 and £100,000 per place, typically two to three times the cost of state provision. Tensions between headteachers and councils over attempts by the latter to shift millions of pounds from local school budgets to ease high needs deficits. Some schools have said such moves would force them to sack Send support staff.

Guardian Essential poll: RBA rate cut too little too late for many as Albanese’s rating dips again	As the official start of the election campaign nears, almost one in two Australians don’t know who they will vote for or might change their mind More than half of Australians believe last month’s cash rate cut was too little too late and a sign the Labor government’s economic plan is not working, but voters think Anthony Albanese is better placed than Peter Dutton to deliver cost-of-living relief and higher wages and safeguard Medicare. Voters have again marked down Albanese, with his net approval rating dipping to minus eight in the latest Guardian Essential poll. But Australians believe his party would be better – or at least no worse – than the Coalition on some key issues.

Tories fight abolition of hereditary peers as Labour’s Lords reforms stall	Keir Starmer’s plan to replace upper house was scaled back to scrapping hereditaries – but even that is proving difficult Abolishing hereditary peers was supposed to be the easy part of House of Lords reform for Labour, which grandly set out plans three years ago to replace the second chamber altogether. But on Monday Conservative peers will make an effort to clog up the legislation as it goes through parliament, suggesting delays to allow abolished hereditaries more time to find a job, allowing some of them to stay, or even converting them to become life peers. As a detailed scrutiny of the bill gets under way, 116 amendments have been put forward, which are likely to be debated individually. Some propose progressive changes such as cutting numbers of peers, introducing attendance requirements and getting rid of bishops from the house, but many are aimed at watering down the abolition of hereditaries.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/03/abolition-hereditary-peers-labour-lords-reform	2025-03-03T04:00:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bb62dabf7e54e75f6a36aebb5b82b4e3787ba87/1_0_4999_3000/master/4999.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=888ca7da988529f7624ab90f1ad39413

Peter Mandelson criticised after saying Ukraine should give ‘unequivocal backing’ to Trump’s plan – UK politics live	Defence minister Luke Pollard tries to distance the government from the US ambassador’s comments to the media Good morning. Domestic politics has not gone away, but it is all being eclipsed at the moment by the Ukraine crisis, and the efforts Keir Starmer is leading to develop a Europe-led peace plan and – crucially – to keep the US and Europe at least broadly aligned. The stakes are enormous. Labour is very proud of the role the Attlee government played in creating Nato, but now its future as a funtioning alliance is in doubt. In his press conference yesterday Starmer said he did not accept the US is now an -unreliable ally-. But many Europeans who watched President Trump and JD Vance bully and belittle President Zelenskyy on camera in the Oval Office on Friday will have come to a different conclusion. Starmer is expected to make a statement to MPs about his visit to the White House, and yesterday’s summit in London, and that should start after 3.30pm. We need a very radical reset. The reset has to consist of the US and Ukraine getting back on the same page. And President Zelenskyy giving his unequivocal backing to the initiative that President Trump is taking to end the war and to bring a just and lasting peace to Ukraine. And the Europeans too need to back the calls for a ceasefire. And by the way, I think that Ukraine should be the first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow. The UK ambassador to Washington isn’t meant to communicate his own opinion, he is meant to communicate the UK government opinion. Lammy and Starmer need to grip this. What is Mandelson up to? You cannot square what the Prime Minister said this morning with this. What is the Government’s actual position? Our man in DC should be securing US protection for our brave Ukrainian allies, not telling President Zelensky what to do. No. It’s certainly right that Ukrainians want peace. I think of all the people on our continent that want peace, the Ukrainians want it the most. But we’re still in discussions, diplomatic engagement with our European, US and Ukrainian friends as to the shape of that deal. That’s not government policy and you wouldn’t expect me to commentate on every ups and downs in negotiations.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/03/peter-mandelson-ukraine-donald-trump-volodymyr-zelenskyy-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live	2025-03-03T01:12:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72e7098aa494ad66591abd150135b84a45ca41db/0_199_7599_4559/master/7599.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4fd849e23e71bb7de435a6bf864240b9

Monday briefing: UK and Europe pick up the pieces after White House car crash	In today’s newsletter: After Friday’s clash meeting in the Oval Office between Trump and Zelenskyy, Keir Starmer and his European allies will try to broker the peace Ukraine desperately needs Good morning. After the shocking treatment he received at the White House on Friday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy was on friendlier turf yesterday – but whether a bear hug from Keir Starmer and an audience with King Charles will ultimately prove consequential for the war in Ukraine is still anyone’s guess. The Ukrainian president was in the UK to attend a European summit, convened by Starmer, to take steps towards new proposals that might be able to find support in Kyiv and Washington alike. And while there were some signs of European unity, the White House and its surrogates were still suggesting that Zelenskyy was guilty of some sort of insult to the United States that might be enough to make a durable peace impossible. Last night, Zelenskyy refused to say whether he believed he had been ambushed – but said that he was ready to talk to Trump again.

Amid brutal foreign wars and democracy under siege, the Oscars were silent on Trump	No one uttered the US president’s name, and speeches bore few references to Gaza or Ukraine, focusing on the LA fires The 97th Academy Awards had one of the longest run times for the annual show in recent history, yet the least mentions of the current political climate – with not a single person uttering the name -Donald Trump-. While few people watch awards shows – least of all the Oscars – for political discussion, comments on world events have long been an expected part of the broadcasts. Trump himself has even weighed in on a show – at least once while it aired: last year, while campaigning for re-election, he posted on Truth Social and asked rhetorically whether there was ever a -worse host- than Jimmy Kimmel at the 2024 Oscars and criticized his opening monologue.

Europe has a lot to do before it can exert real influence on a Ukraine peace deal	The continent’s role in any ceasefire will be limited unless countries commit more to Kiev and the Zelenskyy/Trump relationship is repaired Europe and the UK are hoping they are on the brink of assembling a credible military coalition that Donald Trump can only refuse to support at risk of appearing openly to ally with Vladimir Putin – an alliance many grassroots Republicans reject.
