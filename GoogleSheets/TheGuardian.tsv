Trump transition process raises ‘concerns about corruption’, top senator says – US politics live	US senator Elizabeth Warren says transition agreement between Trump team and White House fails to answer key questions about FBI vetting and security The MOU was supposed to be signed weeks ago, before the election. Trump has already indicated he will sidestep standard transition processes, including, The Guardian has reported, by issuing security clearances to appointees without requiring FBI background checks. In refusing to sign a transition agreement with the DOJ regarding FBI background checks, the incoming Trump administration stands to forgo access to classified information from Biden administration officials. Lawmakers have already raised concerns about key Trump appointees avoiding the standard security clearance process – which will likely arise during senate confirmation hearings early next year. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the incoming Trump and outgoing Biden administrations outlining some terms of the transfer of power departs from the norm in a few key ways, which is raising eyebrows on Washington. The Trump team said the transition will be privately funded and will not utilize -government buildings or technology [...] and will operate as a self-sufficient organization.- Susie Wiles, Trump’s incoming chief of staff said the transition team -has an existing ethics plan-, which she said would be uploaded to the General Services Administration website. Warren called Trump’s use of private funds -nothing more than a ploy for well-connected Trump insiders to line their pockets while pretending to save taxpayers money.- She expressed -concerns of corruption-. There is a fresh flurry of Trump appointments. Among those announced last night were John Phelan, an investor and Trump campaign donor, as his pick for secretary of the Navy, and Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford University health researcher who opposed Covid-19 lockdowns, to head the National Institutes of Health.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/27/donald-trump-transition-us-politics-updates	2024-11-27T06:24:50-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd455029b6f71b0400472eea9f342ffda3b2158/0_195_3528_2119/master/3528.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b41aa2fb0d8488ba1e6028215148d2e2

Trump backs adviser accused of pay-to-play scheme as ouster attempt backfires	President-elect defends Boris Epshteyn, who was accused of asking potential nominees to pay fees, amid infighting An attempt to force the ouster of Boris Epshteyn, a top adviser to Donald Trump, over accusations that he asked potential administration nominees to pay monthly consulting fees in exchange for lobbying for them appeared to have failed as the president-elect came to his defense.

‘An emotional wrench’: Smithfield traders absorb news that market is to close	Stunned workers at London meat market first established in 1133 say closure will mean end of a way of life The junction at Cowcross Street marks the place where for centuries cattle were driven daily to London’s Smithfield Market. Nearby Cock Lane is another street name linked to the meat and poultry trade centred here since the 12th century, although some accounts attribute its origin to it being the only licensed place for sex work in the medieval city. Soon these will be among the last vestiges of a truly historic site that was central to London life, feeding the city’s people, dispensing justice as a place of public execution and even, in a shameful chapter from the early 19th century, providing a place where a man wishing to avoid a costly divorce could sell his wife.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/27/an-emotional-wrench-smithfield-traders-absorb-news-that-market-is-to-close	2024-11-27T05:39:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c5c7abf6f9f701e6d903e84f599d65f9dba9df6/0_274_8192_4915/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b8d8322282156a6d159627b801d9a6a7

First Thing: Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire in Lebanon takes effect	Reports of cars heading south inside Lebanon despite Israeli army warning. Plus, record South Korea snowfall Good morning. A highly anticipated ceasefire aimed at ending the 14-month-old war between Israel and Hezbollah officially came into effect early this morning, hours after Joe Biden hailed the -historic- moment. The ceasefire began at 4am in Lebanon after the heaviest day of raids on Beirut, including a series of strikes in the city’s centre, since Israel stepped up its air campaign in Lebanon in late September before sending in ground troops. What does the ceasefire stipulate? The resolution calls for the withdrawal of Hezbollah fighters north of the Litani River – about 18 miles from the Lebanon-Israel border – and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon. What other views does Bhattacharya hold? He has questioned the safety of vaccines, testified against the effectiveness of face masks, and argued that NIH officials should not be involved with scientific policy.

Liz Truss opposes assisted dying bill saying NHS should be ‘protecting lives, not ending them’ – UK politics live	The Telegraph, which first reported Truss’s stance, also said Theresa May and Boris Johnson were against the bill Good morning. We have got PMQs later, which means party politics will probably dominate for much of the day in the chamber, but increasingly MPs are preoccupied with a free vote, non-partisan matter, the vote on the assisted dying bill on Friday. This morning there are at least two interesting developments on that story. Three former Conservative prime ministers are all opposed to the bill, the Telegraph is reporting. The paper has a quote from Liz Truss who says: It is wrong in principle: organs of the state like the NHS and the judicial system should be protecting lives, not ending them. No doubt, as we have seen in Canada, vulnerable people would be put under appalling pressure to end their lives early. The law would be ripe for being exploited by the unscrupulous. MPs should vote this terrible Bill down and instead focus on improving health services. Added to Gordon Brown’s intervention last week, that makes four former PMs opposed to a change in the law. There’s still no word from Rishi Sunak, David Cameron, Tony Blair or John Major … or really from Keir Starmer, for that matter. Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP who has tabled the private member’s bill being debated on Friday, has criticised the MPs who have called for the bill to be voted down to allow time for a full policy review. Four Labour backbenchers are among the seven MPs who have tabled an amendment to this effect. The amendment does not oppose assisted dying in principle. In an interview with the Today programme this morning, Leadbeater said the amendment was -disappointing- because, if passed, it would stop the Commons voting on the substance of the bill. She explained: The route of the private member’s bill is absolutely the right route for taking this legislation through. That means that there can be a free vote by all MPs. It is not a government bill. The government has a neutral position on this and, sadly, the amendment that a handful of MPs have put forward is disappointing in that the public clearly want this debate to take place, and I think we’ve got responsibilities as parliamentarians to make sure that that debate does take place. In terms of time and scrutiny, look, this is not a new debate. This debate has been going on for decades. It’s been going on, as you quite rightly said, particularly in recent years, in no short part to due to high-profile campaigners like Esther Rantzen. But I think we can already see from what’s happened in the last few months, this bill will receive more scrutiny and more discussion and more debate, probably, than any piece of legislation.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/27/pmqs-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-assisted-dying-bill-liz-truss-labour-tories	2024-11-27T01:20:07-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ac03c9aaf03f4cfbc7d96d74ae5b39629faec31/0_119_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a3d29f36ef9f4f4da03a138da0b229a1

Wednesday briefing: Why was the UK so poorly prepared for extreme flooding?	In today’s newsletter: Our environment reporter on what went wrong following Storm Bert and whether widespread flooding might make the government to face up to the country’s leaky defences • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. Storm Bert brought heavy rain, gale-force winds and snow across the country last weekend, overwhelming flood defences already described as being in disrepair. Parts of south Wales and south-west England, where a month of rain pummelled sodden towns and villages, fared particularly badly. Middle East | A highly anticipated ceasefire aimed at ending the 14-month-old war between Israel and Hezbollah officially came into effect early on Wednesday morning, hours after Joe Biden hailed the -historic- agreement. The ceasefire officially began at 4am in Lebanon after the heaviest day of raids on Beirut by Israel including a series of strikes in the city centre. Health | Plans to end the deepening crisis in access to NHS dental care are failing, leaving patients unable to get treatment, according to a warning from the National Audit Office. A pledge to provide an extra 1.5m treatments in England this year is in disarray amid falls in both the number of dentists doing NHS work and people receiving help from them. Russia | Russia said it was expelling a British diplomat for alleged spying as tensions between London and Moscow rose after Ukraine starting using British weapons to strike deeper into Russia. The Kremlin has also banned cabinet ministers including Angela Rayner, Yvette Cooper and Rachel Reeves from entering the country under sanctions announced by Moscow’s foreign affairs ministry. World | Keir Starmer’s national security adviser is to travel to Washington as the UK government tries to persuade Donald Trump not to rip up the Chagos Islands agreement.

Plus, prosecutors drop Trump criminal charges for election interference as he prepares to retake the presidency Good morning. Donald Trump has said he will sign an immediate executive order imposing a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% tariff on China. How much trade will this affect? Canada, Mexico and China account for about 40% of the goods the US imports each year, according to official statistics. Beijing said -nobody will win in a trade war-. What’s behind Trump’s love of tariffs? Bill Ackman, the chief executive of the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, said Trump is going to use tariffs as a foreign policy -weapon- to -achieve economic and political outcomes-. What does this tell us about Trump’s legal strategy?

Trump officials to receive immediate clearances and easier FBI vetting	Exclusive: president-elect’s team planning for background checks to occur only after administration takes over bureau Donald Trump’s transition team is planning for all cabinet picks to receive sweeping security clearances from the president-elect and only face FBI background checks after the incoming administration takes over the bureau and its own officials are installed in key positions, according to people familiar with the matter.

Keir Starmer’s jobs plan won’t work because Labour are ducking tough welfare decisions, Tories claim – UK politics live	PM set to unveil what government calls 'biggest employment reforms in generation’ as Tories say he is not making tough calls on sickness and benefits Good morning. Today the government is unveiling what it is calling, in the headline on its overnight press release, the -biggest employment reforms in a generation-. The reforms are intended to tackle the fact that Britain is the only major economy where the employment rate has fallen over the last five years, largely because more people are out of work due to long-term ill health. A white paper called Get Britain Working is being published later, and Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, is due to make a statement in the Commons later. In its overnight briefing, the Department for Work and Pensions has already flagged up numerous initiatives which are in the white paper. Overall, the focus seems to be more carrot than stick. -Our reforms put an end to the culture of blaming and shaming people who for too long haven’t been getting the support they need to get back to work,- Keir Starmer says. But quite a lot of key decisions have been postponed, and at this point it is hard to assess quite how significant, or effective, these meaures will turn out to be. The history of welfare reform is littered with announcements that don’t quite live up to -biggest in a generation- hype. From the broken NHS, flatlining economy, and the millions of people left unemployed and trapped in an inactivity spiral – this government inherited a country that simply isn’t working. But today we’ve set out a plan to fix this. A plan that tackles the biggest drivers of unemployment and inactivity and gives young people their future back through real, meaningful change instead of empty rhetoric and sticking plaster politics. We’re overhauling jobcentres to make them fit for the modern age. We’re giving young people the skills and opportunities they need to prepare them for the jobs of the future. We’re fixing the NHS so people get the treatment and mental health support they desperately need to be able to get back to work. We’re working with businesses and employers to better support people with disabilities and health conditions to stay and progress in work, and it doesn’t stop there. This latest announcement shows that Labour are not prepared to take the tough but necessary choices to bring down the benefits bill. There is no attempt to match the £12bn in welfare savings we promised in our manifesto. They have even dodged the difficult decisions on sickness benefits, which are needed to make the welfare system sustainable in the long term.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/26/keir-starmer-labour-tory-jobs-plan-latest-politics-news-live	2024-11-26T01:12:29-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/396526c1795bdd6274c80e27394d70ceef3e46fb/1710_861_2386_1432/master/2386.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5729f894b4741f76313b9342987af6ed
Russia-Ukraine war live: record number of Russian drones fired overnight	Ukraine’s military shoots down 76 out of 188 weapons with Kyiv coming under attack and critical infrastructure hit in Ternopil Welcome to our coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine with the news that Russia has fired 188 drones into Ukraine, the highest number in a single night. Ukraine’s military said on Tuesday it shot down 76 of the weapons, adding it lost track of 96 of the drones, likely due to active electronic warfare, and five drones headed towards Belarus. The British foreign secretary has said the UK is not sending troops into Ukraine, after Le Monde reported on Monday that France and the UK are -not ruling out- such a move. When he was asked about the report in an interview, David Lammy said the UK’s position had not changed. -We are very clear that we stand ready and continue to support the Ukrainians with training particularly, but there has been a longstanding position that we are not committing UK troops to the theatre of action,- he told newspapers La Repubblica, Le Monde and Die Welt at the G7 foreign ministers’ meeting in Italy. Russian forces are advancing in Ukraine at the fastest rate since the early days of the 2022 invasion, taking an area half the size of Greater London over the past month, analysts and war bloggers say. The war is entering what some Russian and western officials say could be its most dangerous phase after Moscow’s forces made some of their biggest territorial gains. -Russia has set new weekly and monthly records for the size of the occupied territory in Ukraine,- independent Russian news group Agentstvo said in a report. The Russian army captured almost 235 sq km (91 sq miles) in Ukraine over the past week, a weekly record for 2024, it said. Ambassadors from Ukraine and Nato’s 32 members will meet on Tuesday in Brussels over Russia’s firing last week of an experimental hypersonic intermediate-range missile. Russia on Thursday carried out a strike on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro which President Vladimir Putin said was a test of its new Oreshnik missile. But, according to the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency, expectations are low for any major results from the consultations on Tuesday afternoon at the alliance’s Brussels headquarters. The most that is expected is a reiteration of Nato’s earlier insistence that Moscow’s deployment of the new weaponry will not -deter Nato allies from supporting Ukraine-. A new Nato mission located in Wiesbaden will take over the coordination of western military aid for Ukraine in January, Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said on Monday. The setting up of NSATU – Nato Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine – has been months in the planning and is widely seen as an effort to safeguard the aid mechanism against interference by Donald Trump.

Tuesday briefing: Why everyone’s suddenly worked up about ‘non-crime hate incidents’	In today’s newsletter: A police visit to a Daily Telegraph columnist about a tweet unleashed a barrage of coverage – but the story is more complicated than it appears • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. A journalist visited by police over an erroneous tweet. A barber accused of racism over a dodgy haircut. And someone in Warwickshire reported for refusing to shake hands. These are some of the examples cited in recent days in an escalating media storm over -non-crime hate incidents- recorded by police. The problem, frequently laid at the door of the woke mob, is so catastrophically vexing that former Conservative MEP and Daily Telegraph columnist Daniel Hannan declared it evidence of -the bleak reality of our DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] police state-. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, has now said that the police should apply a -common sense and consistent approach-, an apparent nod to the criticisms of how the system works. And there are some reasonable objections to the status quo. But there are also important reasons for its existence that have very little to do with haircuts or handshakes. Unemployment | Teenagers will get training at the Premier League, Royal Shakespeare Company and Channel 4 in a government drive to get hundreds of thousands into jobs or education. The scheme is part of a suite of changes to the welfare system and out-of-work support being announced today. US politics | Donald Trump said on Monday he would sign an executive order imposing a 25% US tariff on products from Mexico and Canada. He said the tariffs would only be lifted if Mexico and Canada clamp down on migrants and illegal drugs crossing the border, and promised an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports. Storm Bert | Forecasters, environment officials and politicians have been criticised over the warnings issued before Storm Bert and the fitness of flood defences to cope with increasingly common extreme weather. The Met Office defended its work, saying that the storm was -well forecast, 48 hours in advance-. Regulation | Britain’s financial sector watchdog is -incompetent at best, dishonest at worst-, according to a damning report by MPs and Lords which called for a big shake-up. An examination of the Financial Conduct Authority found -very significant shortcomings- after a series of financial scandals. Health | Weight-loss drugs can reduce the risk of worsening kidney function, kidney failure and dying from kidney disease by a fifth, according to a study. Compared with placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists like Ozempic reduced the risk of kidney failure by 16% and the worsening of kidney function by 22%, Victim-led hate reporting has had significant and important positive impacts for police, and communities, in diagnosing harm, extremism, and failing integration or community-cohesion efforts … We all know that recording rules can be complex, but they should not be a concern to a victim at their time of distress.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/26/tuesday-briefing-why-everyones-suddenly-worked-up-about-non-crime-hate-incidents	2024-11-25T22:57:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39ed9cf6cf7349a2cc382a02b9c05af036683716/0_4_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2b19407d555432baa586b9a44ca5a829

A year from now, every Australian logging on to Facebook, Instagram or TikTok may be confronted with a prompt that the company is requiring you to prove your age.

Iranian artist Maryam Tafakory wins the 2024 Film London Jarman award	Tafakory’s blend of reality and fiction is ‘a compelling exploration of displacement, memory and resistance’ according to the judging panel Iranian artist Maryam Tafakory has won this year’s Film London Jarman award, which recognises British excellence in the field of moving image. Tafakory took the £10,000 prize for her work, which combines found footage with the cinematic traditions of post-revolutionary Iran. Her 2020 film Irani Bag used a split-screen technique to show how handbags were often deployed in films as stand-ins for human touch. The censorship of intimacy is a theme through Tafakory’s work – from the abstract, non-linear narrative film Nazarbazi (2022) to the following year’s Mast-del, which explored a forbidden relationship between two women.	https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/25/iranian-artist-maryam-tafakory-wins-the-2024-film-london-jarman-award	2024-11-25T11:20:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a948b07a344f7ff2751a4c249d319e03f8359e84/0_271_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e3def5acedb17b382c0968370968895b

First Thing: Amazon workers in 20 countries to protest or strike on Black Friday	Organizers demand better workers’ rights and climate action. Plus, Israeli killing of journalists in Lebanon could be war crime, experts say Good morning. Thousands of Amazon workers are expected to protest or strike in more than 20 countries during Black Friday and Cyber Monday to agitate for better workers’ rights and climate action. What are organizers saying? Christy Hoffman, the general secretary of UNI Global Union, said: -Amazon’s relentless pursuit of profit comes at a cost to workers, the environment and democracy.- Amanda Gearing, a senior organiser at GMB, said: -Amazon represents everything that is broken about [the UK’s] economy.

UK politics live: vote on assisted dying bill impossible to predict, says minister	Jess Phillips says ‘we do not know how this vote is going to go’ with the views of many MPs still unclear Good morning. There is plenty happening today. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, and Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, at both speaking at the CBI conference, where the CBI chief executive Rain Newton-Smith is warning about the impact of the budget on business. Keir Starmer is hosting a meeting at Downing Street about plans to protect women from spiking. -My government was elected on a pledge to take back our streets, and we will never achieve this if women and girls do not feel safe at night,- he says. There will be tributes to John Prescott in the Commons this afternoon. But one issue is going to dominate the week, the vote on the assisted dying bill on Friday, and already that is a big topic of discussion. Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, has been giving interviews this morning and she told the Today programme this morning she is finding it impossible to predict if the bill will pass the second reading vote. She said: We do not know how this vote is going to go. I literally couldn’t call it for you at the moment … Each week I think a different thing. Last week I thought it wouldn’t [pass]. This week I think it might. Honestly, I’ve learned over the years not to try and second guess parliament. I should underline that these figures are *not* a prediction of the vote, but an interesting look at the direction MPs are leaning With 291 MPs not stating a view at the time of writing, the vote very easily could go either way A source close to the MPs campaigning in favour of legalisation told The Telegraph: -If all the MPs who have said they support the Bill turn out and vote for it, then it will pass.- She will make the decision about how she votes on assisted dying on a matter of conscience, just exactly like I will. How she comes to that and what moral code she uses to come to that will be exactly the same as the moral code that I use to come to that decision as well … I think that Shabana is making a decision on what she thinks is best for her constituents, like every constituency MP.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/25/uk-politics-live-assisted-dying-bill-labour-conservatives-starmer-reeves-badenoch	2024-11-25T01:02:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d467eb782da585015bad5c7cb58331d66ab8cd1/0_260_2939_1763/master/2939.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a11de454bc86f97a38da1c55828781f1

Australia politics live: Labor rejects Greens’ compromise offer on housing bill; NSW reveals master plans for 60,000 homes	The Help to Buy bill faces a final vote in the Senate scheduled for Tuesday. Follow today’s news live The government has rejected the Greens’ latest compromise offer to pass the Help to Buy housing bill, continuing the long-running stand-off into the parliament’s final week for 2024. Government sources said the Greens’ demands would be variously unlawful, unhelpful or require spending Labor saw as wasteful. The government is now challenging the Greens to back the Help to Buy bill anyway, still not budging on any demands – with a final vote in the Senate scheduled for tomorrow. Clare O’Neill has today said: This continuous charade from the Greens has to stop. You get the distinct impression the Greens want Australians to continue to be in housing distress, so Adam Bandt can try to harvest those grievances into votes. It’s the crassest form of politics there is, straight out of the Peter Dutton playbook. The Greens are offering Labor an opportunity to announce the construction of 25,000 social and affordable homes, helping over 60,000 people into affordable homes in the middle of a housing crisis, why on earth would Labor block that? Consistently throughout this Parliament, the Greens have blocked and delayed action on the housing crisis, looking for every excuse to vote down legislation which is clearly good for the country.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/nov/25/australia-politics-live-labor-coalition-greens-housing-help-to-buy-question-time-peter-dutton-anthony-albanese-social-media	2024-11-24T12:26:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/860d8e54cd799726e1431f63866e805a23c75a1e/0_139_4168_2501/master/4168.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42d0ed196ec56acae48079aeecf51245

Iranian minister to meet European counterparts after talks on nuclear deal collapse	Meeting comes amid fears Middle East tensions will lead Iran to redouble its efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, will meet his European counterparts in Geneva on Friday after the collapse of a deal last week that would have seen Iran limit its uranium enrichment to 60% purity, just below the threshold to make nuclear weapons. The offer was regarded by Iran as a first step to rebuilding confidence between Tehran and the west over what it insists is its civilian nuclear programme. There are growing fears that wider tensions in the Middle East will result in Tehran redoubling efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon and trying to declare it necessary for its national self-defence.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/24/iranian-minister-to-meet-european-counterparts-after-talks-on-nuclear-deal-collapse	2024-11-24T06:58:36-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4ea4021c08f992f01e452f9895c3edb718f5fd8/0_43_2550_1530/master/2550.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c6dafedd88a78fa0ab34d85579b6eb2f

Russia-Ukraine war live: French foreign minister says there should be ‘no red lines’ in supporting Ukraine	Jean-Noël Barrot says western allies should not put any limits on support for Ukraine against Russia but does not confirm if French weapons have been used Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, has told the BBC in an interview that western allies should not put any limits on support for Ukraine against Russia, and -not set and express red lines-. Ukraine’s air defence units destroyed more than 10 Russia drones that were targeting Kyiv in an overnight drone attack, Ukraine’s military said on Sunday. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries as a result of the attack. -The UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) were flying in different directions towards Kyiv,- Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, said. -The air raid alert in the city lasted for more than three hours.- Ukraine’s air defences downed 50 of 73 Russian drones launched overnight, the Ukrainian military said this morning. In a post on Telegram, the air force said it lost track of 19 drones and four more are still in the air. Russia’s air defence systems destroyed 34 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 27 over the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, Russia’s defence ministry said. Russian media is reporting that colonel general Gennady Anashkin, the commander of the southern grouping, had been removed from his command, for giving misleading reports about the progress of the war. There has been no official confirmation from the Russian ministry of defence. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan will discuss the latest developments in the war with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, on Monday during his visit to Ankara, a Turkish official. They are expected to discuss the removal of defence procurement obstacles between Nato allies and the military alliance’s joint fight against terrorism. Ukraine has lost over 40% of the territory in Russia’s Kursk region that it rapidly seized in a surprise incursion in August as Russian forces have mounted waves of counter-assaults, a senior Ukrainian military source told Reuters. The source, who is on Ukraine’s general staff, said Russia had deployed about 59,000 troops to the Kursk region since Kyiv’s forces swept in and advanced swiftly, catching Moscow unprepared two and a half years into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. -At most, we controlled about 1,376 square kilometres (531 square miles), now of course this territory is smaller. The enemy is increasing its counterattacks,- the source said.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/24/russia-ukraine-war-live-french-foreign-minister-says-there-should-be-no-red-lines-in-supporting-ukraine	2024-11-24T00:41:03-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae7e93f0855289bd2d1364edf46721258b04a834/0_73_2347_1409/master/2347.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=224cbf28411e15721ea87fac5ed84634

Trump depends on the EU and UK to act as peacemakers more than he thinks	The US doesn’t need to spend more on Ukraine. Britain can bring funding to the table – and help Trump reboot alliances With Donald Trump the very meaning of words is up for negotiation. What does he really mean when he promises to -build a wall-? When he pledges to end the Russo-Ukrainian war in one day? His supporters say they don’t take him literally but seriously – but who decides what -serious- is? The very ambiguity can be part of Trump’s appeal. There’s something exhilarating in the sense one is in an exclusive negotiation with the president to define reality. It’s as if he’s welcoming you backstage from the reality show of politics to the discrete board room where meaning is made.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/24/trump-depends-on-the-eu-and-uk-to-act-as-peacemakers-more-than-he-thinks	2024-11-23T21:00:01-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55c732ceca99894ff00b099c7f3d6427a9aac999/0_10_4418_2651/master/4418.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a3c1659684d5260ade9b31ed81943b65

Why it was such a joy to interview John Prescott and discover his sweet, sad soul	The former deputy prime minister, who died this week, spoke freely and didn’t care what journalists thought of him – he was everything today’s guarded politicians are not One of the bad things that comes with being a middle-aged interviewer, as opposed to a younger one, is the tendency to complain loudly that people in public life used to be so much less controlled, so much more wild and free and apt to say the wrong (the interesting) thing. No one likes a nostalgist, after all. But in the case of politicians, I’m afraid there’s no getting away from it. In 2024, unbridled they aren’t. Every word is rehearsed. Even their sandwich fillings have been focus-grouped.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/23/why-it-was-such-a-joy-to-interview-john-prescott-and-discover-his-sweet-sad-soul	2024-11-23T05:27:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8444f3d0eaea63a79ee54752e24f1d94127c0b19/0_113_1132_679/master/1132.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1bafbfa595dec9af2d075e16c98f014e

Reasons for hope as Democrats prevent Trump-led red wave in state races	Democrats had braced for a disaster but state results show a much more nuanced picture than the party had feared After watching Kamala Harris lose the White House and Republicans wrest back full control of Congress, Democrats were bracing for disaster in state legislatures. With the party defending narrow majorities in several chambers across the country, some Democrats expected that Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential race would allow a red wave to sweep through state legislatures.

Storm Bert live: Met Office warns of ‘multiple hazard event’ with snow, ice and flood warnings for UK	Met Office says UK will see as much as 20 to 40cm of snow over hills, accompanied by strong winds New national severe weather warnings have been issued for the weekend by the Met Office as Storm Bert has begun to make an impact with snow closing roads and strong rains and winds expected to cause further travel disruption and potential flooding. Weather warnings and 16 flood alerts have come into effect across the UK, as the Met Office described the forecasted weather as a -multiple hazard event- due to Storm Bert binging with it snow, ice, heavy rain and gale force winds. We’ll see two to four hours of heavy snow across parts of northern England and Scotland during Saturday morning. This snow will accumulate thick and fast, with five to 10cm at lower levels and as much as 20 to 40cm over hills accompanied by strong winds. You can expect blizzards over hills across northern England and Scotland, atrocious conditions for travelling and going over the hills and also the risk of power interruptions because of snow build up on power lines. The melting snow and the heavy rain could lead to localised flooding in places but the wettest spots would be Wales, in the south-west, particularly over south-facing hills, that’s where we’re likely to see gales and certainly the risk of impacts from wind as well as from rain.-	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2024/nov/23/storm-bert-live-met-office-warns-of-multiple-hazard-event-with-snow-ice-and-flood-warnings-for-uk	2024-11-23T00:46:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af6585a2b86765fbb14dff4162ed98fbd8ddcbfd/1287_588_6699_4019/master/6699.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a3ac29646c33507f9fac7ef17c13c40a

While Putin conducts his missile diplomacy, restrictions around the use of long-range weapons may help Kyiv In Kyiv, as autumn turns fast turns to winter, Ukrainians in the government describe a vacuum before the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House on 20 January that will be filled by more war as both sides jockey for advantage. -Trump has said he wants to end the war within 24 hours. Nobody is more interested in this topic than Ukraine,- a senior official told the Guardian. -But the problem is, for the moment, everything is just speculation. Will it be the first peace plan, the second plan, the first variant, the 10th variant?- they said.

Using both hands, she sips it like it’s hot chocolate.

Jeremy Clarkson: presenter, firebrand farmer … politician?	He has always brushed off suggestions of a career in politics but championed the cause of fellow farmers at protests this week Steve Berry, a presenter on the BBC’s Top Gear for six years, can remember the moment he first rubbed up against Jeremy Clarkson’s ego and ambition. It was the mid-1990s and Berry had a new agent who suggested he should push to be the main presenter on the show. -And I thought, ‘Yeah, OK, why not?- recalled Berry, 60. -I just was constantly bombarding them with ideas and I got taken on one side by one of the directors, and he said, ‘You know Jeremy sits there and times how much time he has on the programme’. I said, ‘You what?’ ‘He sits there with a stopwatch’. I have no idea if this is true but he says, ‘He’s worked out that in this season you have had this amount of screen time and if it were a title race you are only a few points off where he is’. So the guy says, ‘So watch yourself’. Next thing I know, I was dragged into [executive producer] Jon Bentley’s office. He said, ‘Sit down. You are never going to be the next Jeremy Clarkson, you know’.

Project 2025: the Trump picks with ties to ultra-rightwing policy manifesto	The president-elect has tried to distance himself from Project 2025, but several key choices have direct links to it On the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly disavowed Project 2025, saying he had -nothing to do- with the blueprint for a conservative presidency and didn’t know the people behind it. But as he starts to assemble his cabinet and White House staff, it seems likely he’ll get to know the people involved very well soon. Trump’s attempts to disavow the project before winning re-election seemed improbable, given that it was written by various members of his first administration and aligned on policy goals with his own proposed second term agenda.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/22/project-2025-trump-picks	2024-11-22T06:00:14-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bb72440e21561f467387af26b886e1c01647815/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=820eb260f0e19b12aa522bb4efb655ee

What does it mean? The court has no police force, so we’re unlikely to see them standing trial anytime soon, but the ruling holds strong moral weight. Netanyahu and Gallant are at risk of arrest if they travel to any of the 124 countries that signed the Rome statute establishing the court. What was the reaction? The move was broadly welcomed by human rights groups. But Joe Biden said it was -outrageous- and Netanyahu’s office called it -antisemitic-. Why has Trump picked Bondi? It is likely to be because of loyalty. She became a fierce defender of his candidacy in 2016, helped with Trump’s legal defense during his first impeachment trial, parroted claims that the 2020 election was stolen, and continued working as a surrogate through the 2024 campaign when she attended Trump’s criminal trial in New York.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/22/first-thing-icc-seeks-netanyahu-arrest-over-allegations-of-war-crimes-and-crimes-against-humanity	2024-11-22T03:28:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4add4f8dc13b7472d9c4fd7eddefeb3ec963e7a3/107_82_3699_2220/master/3699.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4b9ac694b081574800d9826ce9d9c28c

Russia-Ukraine war live: Nato says Moscow’s strike with new ballistic missile won’t alter course of war	Alliance accuses Russia of seeking to intimidate Kyiv’s allies while Volodymyr Zelenskyy calls attack a ‘severe escalation’ Russia fired an -experimental- ballistic missile at the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Thursday in what the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called -a clear and severe escalation- of the 33-month-old war. Vladimir Putin said the strike was -a response to US plans to produce and deploy intermediate and short-range missiles-. The Russian president also threatened further attacks, saying Moscow -had the right- to strike western countries that provided Kyiv with weapons used against Russian targets. The new ballistic missile was part of a wider salvo of nine missiles fired from the Astrakhan region of Russia in the early hours of Thursday. Six of the missiles were intercepted by Ukraine’s air force but the new ballistic missile was not stopped. The missile was said to have hit -without consequences-, Ukraine’s air force said, though it added that complete information about victims had yet to be received. Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for strong worldwide condemnation on the strike, describing it as a major step-up in the -scale and brutality- of the war. The Ukrainian president said the attack was -yet more proof that Russia has no interest in peace-, adding that a -response is needed. Pressure is needed. Russia must be forced into real peace, which can only be achieved through strength-. US and UK sources indicated they believed the missile was an experimental, nuclear-capable, intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), which has a theoretical range of below 3,420 miles (5,500km). That is enough to reach Europe from where it was fired in south-western Russia, but not the US. UN secretary general António Guterres’s spokesperson said Russia’s use of the new ballistic missile was -yet another concerning and worrying development. -All of this [is] going in the wrong direction,- Stéphane Dujarric said as he called on all parties to de-escalate the conflict and -to protect civilians, not hit civilian targets or critical civilian infrastructure-. Russian strikes killed at least two people in the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Sumy, the acting mayor said on Friday. -Several massive explosions occurred in Sumy,- Artem Kobzar said on Telegram. He said air defences were still working as of just before 6am local time and warned residents to stay away from windows. The Sumy regional military administration said a residential neighbourhood had been struck by a Russian drone, adding that rescue operations were under way. It confirmed the two deaths and said 12 people had been injured. Russia’s defence ministry said on Thursday that its forces had captured the eastern Ukrainian village of Dalne in the Donetsk region, a focal point of their advance. Ukraine’s general staff made no acknowledgment of Dalne being in Russian hands. The Ukrainian military’s late report mentioned the village as one of seven in an area where Russian forces had tried to pierce Ukrainian defences 26 times over the previous 24 hours. It said 10 of 16 armed clashes in the area continued. Ukraine’s parliament postponed a sitting due to have taken place on Friday out of security concerns, public broadcaster Suspilne reported, quoting sources. It said the order told members to keep their families out of Kyiv’s government district and quoted parliamentarians as saying that, for the moment, the next sitting was not scheduled until December.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-nato-says-moscows-strike-with-new-ballistic-missile-wont-alter-course-of-war	2024-11-21T23:14:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ef13efa7069f9e9b00c0da95bea9d10016df5dd/0_343_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cbe5f3b6484782c8d56edba2ce8726e5

Putin’s Ukraine missile a warning to west before second age of Trump	The current escalations will set a new status quo for life under Trump – what does the US president have planned? Like Chekhov’s gun coming off the wall in Act V, it was probably only a matter of time before Vladimir Putin launched an experimental, nuclear-capable ballistic missile into Ukraine. It is hardly a coincidence that his decision comes as the war approaches a likely endgame, with both sides jockeying for position ahead of negotiations in the shadow of Donald Trump. Neither Ukraine nor Russia quite knows what Trump will do when he takes office in January. But the escalations taking place now will set a new status quo for the day he becomes president, at which point Trump’s options range from hard-nosed horse-trading to simply throwing Ukraine under the bus.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/22/russia-ukraine-war-ballistic-missile-warning	2024-11-21T23:00:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c67d0e8f7c62dfd56a8250326c690ea2797bab8a/0_0_4264_2559/master/4264.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fb6c21a99ef4b6de9ad8352e52543686

Why Trump’s racism isn’t an issue – or enough of one – for some voters of color	Experts warn assuming minority groups will reject a racist candidate ignores nuance, particularly on the economy Since Donald Trump won the 2024 US presidential election, many have publicly speculated why people of color – with whom Trump made some gains – would vote for a racist candidate. Throughout his campaign, Trump and his supporters spouted a series of racist remarks aimed at Black and Latino people, immigrants at large, and other marginalized groups. He also promised to utilize the military to carry out mass deportations, ban sanctuary cities, and escalate attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts at the federal level. Swaths of non-white voters still supported Trump at the ballot box. And though this sort of data can vary in reliability, experts agree that Trump made inroads among some minorities despite his bigoted comments.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/21/trump-racism-people-of-color-voters	2024-11-21T04:00:46-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/448e72ad6327532d6ac267545e4bb6a3aab5f10a/0_239_7151_4293/master/7151.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fce34a53ca683eeab5fe35f0bb3cd99a

Captain Tom’s family personally benefited from charity they founded, report finds	Watchdog’s highly critical inquiry finds Hannah and Colin Ingram-Moore culpable of ‘serious and repeated’ misconduct The family of the NHS charities fundraiser Captain Sir Tom Moore personally benefited from the charity set up in his name through a series of lucrative deals worth more than £1m, the charities watchdog has ruled in a highly critical report. A Charity Commission inquiry concluded the late Captain Tom’s daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore and her husband, Colin Ingram-Moore, were culpable of -serious and repeated- instances of misconduct, mismanagement and failures of integrity. Hannah Ingram-Moore -initiated the process to secure her appointment as chief executive- of the charity, suggesting she should be paid a salary of £150,000. The charity proposed paying her £100,000 but this was blocked by the commission and she was eventually hired on £85,000. Hannah Ingram-Moore received £18,000 from Virgin Media in September 2021 to judge its Local Legends awards when she was chief executive of the foundation. This was unauthorised and a conflict of interest, and there was no evidence it was undertaken, as she claimed, in a personal capacity. The Ingram-Moores used the charity’s name inappropriately and for their private benefit in a planning application to build a private spa pool in the grounds of their family home. The building was subsequently demolished.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/21/captain-tom-family-personally-benefited-from-charity-they-founded-report-finds	2024-11-20T16:01:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a199706325dfe0f3cdeb507f9f1139a0feeee087/331_321_5436_3260/master/5436.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=215abd0735ed73f3a3dd8faa1720dbfb

Labor’s ‘thought crime’ hate speech laws will turn nation into ‘police state’, Australian Christian Lobby says	Christian Schools Australia also claiming that the harm definition will mean the view sex is unchangeable will be outlawed as ‘hateful’ The Australian Christian Lobby has claimed Labor’s hate speech laws would turn Australia into a -police state- by creating -thought crime- despite the fact the laws are directed towards threats of force or harm. The Albanese government has substantially watered down the laws but is nevertheless facing a religious backlash, with the Catholic church and Christian Schools Australia also claiming that the psychological harm definition will mean the view that sex is immutable will be outlawed as -hateful-.

US embassy in Kyiv closes over threat of ‘significant attack’ | First Thing	It comes as the Kremlin rules out a ‘freeze’ in the conflict. Plus, 204 industrial farming lobbyists attend Cop29 Good morning. The US embassy in Kyiv closed on Wednesday because of a potential significant air attack. -Out of an abundance of caution, the embassy will be closed, and embassy employees are being instructed to shelter in place,- the consular service said. Why has Biden approved missiles and landmines now? The US feels these measures are necessary for Ukraine to keep fighting, and commensurate with Russia’s deployment of North Korean troops. About 10,900 North Korean soldiers in Kursk have been fighting in elite Russian airborne and marine units, according to a lawmaker on the intelligence committee of the South Korean parliament. Biden is also acting before Donald Trump returns to the White House and potentially seeks negotiations. How many aid trucks is Israel letting cross the border? So far in November, Israel says it has allowed in an average of 88 trucks a day, a fraction of the 600 a day that aid agencies say are necessary to meet basic needs. In the northern third of Gaza, where Israeli forces are waging a weeks-long offensive that has killed hundreds of people and displaced tens of thousands, famine conditions may have already set in, experts say. How have food prices changed? The market fluctuates, but before the war a sack of flour cost 40 shekels ($10.68) and milk powder cost 30 shekels. Now, in the center and south of the strip, where most of the population has fled, prices have reached 375 shekels ($100.17) and 300 shekels respectively – if supplies can be found.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/20/first-thing-us-embassy-in-kyiv-closes-over-threat-of-significant-attack	2024-11-20T04:57:19-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb67648d8d32f17acd8b81f4c2fb201e3748b272/0_0_5280_3168/master/5280.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=713dbbde9e13a850a279747fdc96a528

Tories attack BBC for questioning farming lobby’s inheritance tax claims – UK politics live	Row over issue continues with questions likely at PMQs as Angela Rayner faces shadow minister Alex Burghart Good morning. Keir Starmer is travelling back from the G20 summit in Brazil, but he won’t be in the Commons in time for PMQs, and so Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, will be taking questions on his behalf. In line with recent practice, Kemi Badenoch, the new Conservative leader, won’t go up against a deputy, and she will miss the session too. The Tories don’t have a deputy leader, but Badenoch is getting Alex Burghart, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, to stand in for her. The PM might not be answering, but that does not mean the questions get any easier. The situation in Ukraine is looking increasingly perilous, inflation is going up, and figures out yesterday have reignited the row about the government’s decision to cut the winter fuel payment. But the Conservatives may also want to ask about farmers, and the plan to extend inheritance tax to some farms. Traditonally the Tories have liked to think of themselves as a pro-countryside, pro-farming party, and they will have been reassured by the fact that, when they lined up alongside farmers at yesterday’s rally, they did not just have Jeremy Clarkson with them; the Liberal Democrats, the Green party, Greenpeace and even Just Stop Oil were on the farmers’ side too. The job of BBC Verify is to do exactly that but they’ve failed on their own terms. The government is refusing to say how many family farms are subject to their tax raid, only offering partial and out of date statistics which fail to account for the full scale of their reforms.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/20/farming-inheritance-tax-keir-starmer-angela-rayner-uk-politics-live	2024-11-20T01:44:02-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0774110c90ff048eeab77dffc60468e91ca2bf9/0_196_5336_3202/master/5336.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0970ed2bb8d59fca26e47cfbc887fd36

Russia-Ukraine war live: Biden to provide antipersonnel landmines for Ukraine – reports	Move comes as Putin lowers threshold for use of nuclear weapons; North Korean troops have participated in battle, South Korea says The US embassy in Kyiv has received -specific information- of a potential significant air attack on Wednesday and will be closed, the US Department of State Consular Affairs said in a post on X. It recommended US citizens to be prepared to immediately shelter in the event an air alert is announced. The US called on Russia -to stop this bellicose and the irresponsible rhetoric-, but said it has not seen any reason to adjust its nuclear posture. US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said he was -not surprised- by comments by the Kremlin over the revised nuclear doctrine. The UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, also accused Russia of being guilty of making -irresponsible rhetoric-. In a direct message to the Russian president, Starmer added: -On day 1,000 of Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine, I say again: ‘End the war. Get out of Ukraine’.- Ukraine fired US-made long-range missiles into Russia for the first time since the Biden administration lifted restrictions on their use. The target appeared to be an ammunition warehouse. Ukraine’s general staff said it hit a military arsenal of the 1046th logistics centre outside the city of Karachev without confirming the use of the missiles. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine launched six US-made Atacms missiles targeting the south-western Bryansk region overnight. It claimed that five of the missiles were shot down and another was damaged. It said debris from the rockets caused a fire at an unnamed military facility. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, did not directly confirm the missile attack targeting Bryansk but said: -We now have Atacms, Ukrainian long-range capabilities, and we will use them.- The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, appeared to suggest that Russia might respond with nuclear weapons if Ukraine used western-supplied missiles to strike targets inside Russia. The Kremlin said the purpose of its updated nuclear doctrine was to make potential enemies understand the inevitability of retaliation for an attack on Russia or its allies. Russia’s revised nuclear doctrine declares that a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on his country. The doctrine also states that an attack using conventional missiles, drones or other aircraft could be seen as justification for a nuclear response.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/20/russia-ukraine-war-live-biden-us-weapons-missiles-putin-nuclear	2024-11-19T22:16:21-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5f69662b776355f056921942e54ff299fd26d61/0_197_5913_3548/master/5913.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7d92872526fd346a6f1b7b7925a84eb2

Prado show aims to highlight true colours of polychrome sculpture	Madrid Exhibition intends to rescue the technique – coloured paint applied to statues – from centuries of indifference In a darkened corner of the Prado, not far from an outsized crucifixion and a sculpture of a dead, recumbent Christ with eyes of glass, teeth of ivory and fingernails of horn, is another depiction of Jesus that is remarkable in its poignancy, its humanity and its history. The tiny, painted terracotta scene, titled Los primeros pasos de Jesús (Jesus’s First Steps), is domestic rather than divine and shows a chubby, beaming infant ambling towards his equally beaming father. Its creator was the Spanish baroque artist Luisa Roldán who, despite becoming the first female sculptor to the royal court in 1692, is only now making her debut in the hallowed Madrid museum.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/20/prado-show-highlight-true-colours-polychrome-sculpture	2024-11-19T21:00:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cec5ede6b22ba9e62b36360f5c201c5593911ded/0_713_3689_2213/master/3689.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=136b12ef68f1f670175e65455bba0724

First Thing: Putin warns US over using long-range missiles by signing new nuclear doctrine	Kremlin ups rhetoric over decision to allow Kyiv to use US long-range missiles inside Russia. Plus, dozens of Hong Kong pro-democracy activists jailed Good morning. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree lowering the threshold for using nuclear weapons, as the Kremlin intensified its rhetoric over Joe Biden’s decision to permit Kyiv to use US-made long-range missiles for strikes inside Russia. What does the new nuclear doctrine say? It outlines the conditions under which Russia’s leadership might consider launching a nuclear strike.It states that an attack using conventional missiles, drones, or other aircraft could be seen as justification for a nuclear response. What is the humanitarian cost of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine? The UN said in August, that at least 11,743 Ukrainian civilians have been killed, and president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, in February, that 31,000 Ukrainian service members had been killed. The plans: Federalize state national guard personnel and deploy them for immigration enforcement, including sending troops from friendly Republican-governed states into neighboring states with governors who decline to participate. The cost: According to an estimate by the American Immigration Council, deporting 1 million people a year would cost more than $960bn over a decade. The criticisms: The American Civil Liberties Union has attacked Trump’s immigration plans as -inhumane-.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/19/first-thing-putin-warns-us-over-using-long-range-missiles-by-signing-new-nuclear-doctrine	2024-11-19T03:13:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/990c97f0730221292ad03d6f677b335fbdec49eb/0_36_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=11a222bf5dff5d7a818e8a426bdd6b7f

Farmers arrive in Whitehall for protest about inheritance tax plan – UK politics live	Environment minister defends tax changes as farmers protests in London Here is a story from Jamie Grierson this morning about the protests. Good morning. There is an old Westminster adage that says governments should never pick fights with professions that feature as characters in childrens’ books. Voters are happy to see people like bankers, managers and property developers get hammered, the theory goes, but they are inclined to sympathise with postmen (note to the Guardian style guide editors – it is Postman Pat, not Postal worker Pat), doctors, train drivers – and of course farmers. As the last two years have shown, governments have not always been guided by this rule, but it has some merit nevertheless.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/19/farmer-protest-london-inheritance-tax-uk-politics-live-news-updates	2024-11-19T01:03:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/059c37d70696a66961f3f7997050fb1840f82e36/0_260_1973_1183/master/1973.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=101114877c775ab37ace62ccac730fbd

Tuesday briefing: Will a shift in Biden’s missile policy change the war in Ukraine?	In today’s newsletter: Ukraine can now fire US-made long-range missiles into Russian territory – but it may be too little, too late for Volodymyr Zelenskyy • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. The US president, Joe Biden, has lifted the longstanding ban on Ukraine using American-made long-range missiles to fire into Russian territory. The Biden administration secretly first sent the army tactical missile systems, or Atacms, to Ukraine earlier this year under the stipulation that Ukraine would not use it inside Russia. That has now changed, and the US has given Kyiv the green light after reports emerged that 10,000 North Korean troops were in Ukraine. Hong Kong | 47 of Hong Kong’s most prominent pro-democracy figures have been jailed – one for 10 years – in the territory’s largest national security trial, following a prosecution that has been widely criticised as politically motivated and controlled by China’s Communist party government. Poverty | More than one in three children and a quarter of adults are living in poverty in the UK as deprivation levels rise to the highest in the 21st century, according to a landmark report. Cop29 | Raising money needed to tackle the climate crisis need not be a burden on overstretched government budgets, leading economists have said. The sums needed – approximately $1tn a year by 2030 – are achievable without disruption to the global economy, and would help to generate greener economic growth for the future. Labour | A government policy to create 100,000 new nursery places using spare capacity in English primary schools is -unlikely to work- because of a geographical mismatch between capacity and demand, according to research by Frontier Economics, one of the largest economic consultancies in Europe. Environment | More than 51 million chickens are being industrially farmed in the river valleys of the Severn and Wye – the equivalent of 79 chickens for every person in the region, according to new figures. The exponential rise in large intensive poultry units (IPUs) in the valleys is a key driver of river pollution.

First Thing: Biden lifts ban on Ukraine firing US weapons deeper into Russia	Ukraine will be permitted to fire US missiles in Kursk region. Plus, attorneys would be unable to stop Trump’s potential Capitol rioters pardon Good morning. Joe Biden has lifted the ban on Ukraine using long-range missiles to fire into Russian territory by permitting them to be used against Russian and North Korean forces in the Kursk region. How did Russia react? So far, Vladimir Putin has not said anything. But Vladimir Dzhabarov, the first deputy head of the Russian upper house’s international affairs committee, said: -This is a very big step towards the start of world war three.- How could this change the war? Ukraine has recently been losing ground on the frontline, and the deployment of thousands of North Korean troops threatened to tilt the war further in Russia’s favor. As Trump signals his desire to wind up the war with ceasefire negotiations – which critics say will mean, in effect, a Russian land grab – the use of long-range missiles gives Ukraine an opportunity to hang on to its territorial gains in Russia’s Kursk region. It could become a key bargaining chip. But it’s also likely to escalate the conflict. What could be the impact of RFK Jr’s nomination? Dr Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said even if public policies remained unchanged, authorities from the federal government speaking out against vaccines -discourages people who might otherwise be vaccinated, and at that point that’s as bad as not having a vaccine at all-.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/18/first-thing-biden-lifts-ban-on-ukraine-firing-us-weapons-deeper-into-russia	2024-11-18T03:07:58-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e4e470b0137700f1d8be3dcb53f27002dca57d5/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=18942e7e3afecdf3a23acdf9b9f40e46

The Daily Mail is splashing on criticism of the meeting from some Tories. When David Cameron was PM, he cultivated Xi with an eagerness and enthusiasm that makes Starmer look quite hostile towards China by comparison, but over the past decade Tory thinking about China has changed considerably, and the Mail story quotes Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former leader, saying -those suffering genocide and slave labour under the brutal hands of Xi will feel betrayed.-	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/18/keir-starmer-china-xi-jinping-g20-ukraine-latest-live-news	2024-11-18T01:04:40-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb080dbd3c5d86b6b7f880202346ff9e06472276/0_70_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=36abacd21d2ea1137d5c7576a766261e

Experts sound alarm as Trump mulls pardons for January 6 attackers	Attorneys and lawmakers who oppose pardons for Capito rioters would not be able to stop him, legal analysts warn lf Donald Trump follows through on his promise to pardon people who participated in the January 6 riot at the US Capitol, attorneys and lawmakers who oppose such moves would not be able to stop him, according to legal experts. If Trump does issue the pardons, it could indicate to many of his supporters that there was nothing illegal about the riot to prevent the peaceful transfer of power, and would undermine the US constitution, the experts said.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/17/trump-pardon-january-6-rioters	2024-11-17T07:00:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e91830d0ba5b74f4388548b6ea43e7cb4c1e7ca3/0_287_4328_2598/master/4328.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f9b5c53db6f73a34ebb7a3ee520df063
Will Melania be living in the White House for Trump’s second term? Probably not	Incoming first lady is planning to split her time between New York and Florida during her husband’s presidency Melania Trump will probably not be returning to the White House for the next four years with her husband, multiple sources told CNN this week, but rather will be splitting her time between Palm Beach, Florida, and New York City, where Barron is going to college. For many observers it is unclear who might be more relieved by that decision: Melania, who famously did not love her life in DC the first time around, or the White House itself, where Trump’s wife once expressed her discontent by filling the halls with blood-red Christmas trees and destroying the historically beloved Rose Garden.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/17/melania-trump-white-house	2024-11-17T07:00:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c63d363ccdd2678b6e33cf056ac7780c84968100/52_0_5542_3326/master/5542.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c90eb314fd71ef04a498a1181c1387b9

Australian businesses selling essential goods and services to be forced to accept cash payments	Treasury confirms cheques will stay in circulation until 2029 but then cease to be accepted as legal tender Businesses selling essential goods and services such as groceries, medicines and fuel will be forced to accept cash from their customers unless granted a special exemption, under a government mandate to take effect from 1 January 2026. In a move designed to taper the phase-out of cash and ensure those who rely on it can still use it for the near future, the federal government will require certain businesses to take cash payments.

After decades, tiny 500-year-old royal portrait is identified as Mary Tudor	Art historian says miniature is of Henry VIII’s daughter – not his sixth wife Katherine Parr It’s Mary Tudor – by a nose. Not in a horse race, but from a comparison of portraits of Mary, Henry VIII’s elder daughter who became the first crowned queen of England, and Katherine Parr, his sixth wife. For decades, experts, including the noted historian and museum director Sir Roy Strong, have thought that a near 500-year-old miniature was of Parr. Now several leading Tudor authorities are convinced it is Mary, often dubbed -Bloody Mary- because as an ardent Catholic queen she ordered the killing of many Protestants.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/17/after-decades-tiny-500-year-old-royal-portrait-is-identified-as-mary-tudor	2024-11-17T06:00:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6f96b7cb950b502e077d10f33ee673c2051cef9/0_1215_3694_2216/master/3694.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9ca5246b3274a6ad6d6ed46eb2cd0ee5

Middle East crisis live: Israel strike kills Hezbollah lead spokesperson in Beirut	Mohammed Afif killed in first Israeli airstrike on central Beirut in more than a month, official says William Christou reports for the Guardian from Beirut on the strike by Israeli forces on a Ba’ath party center in Ras al-Nabaa, central Beirut, on Sunday afternoon, the first strike on central Beirut in over a month: The attack on the busy residential neighbourhood came without warning, and appeared to cause damage to neighbouring buildings. The strike comes as Israel intensifies its airstrikes across Lebanon as Lebanese officials prepare to give their response to an Israeli ceasefire proposal on Monday. The Israeli military issued a series of evacuation warnings on Saturday and Sunday for Dahiyeh, the southern suburbs of Beirut, striking over a dozen targets in bombings heard across the capital city. Afif had been especially visible after Israel’s military escalation in September and following the assassination of longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was also killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israeli warplanes had earlier pounded the southern suburbs of Beirut after the military warned people to evacuate from several buildings. The Hezbollah militant group has a strong presence in the area, known as the Dahiyeh, and the strikes came as Lebanese officials are considering a U.S.-brokered cease-fire proposal.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/17/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-strike-hezbollah-beirut-mohammed-afif	2024-11-17T05:02:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e75f797e43810f49802f1205f6b515dd5cb2e0a3/0_8_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a42caf50da27bf375b37a3478a75836f

US political minds will be reminding themselves of this fact as the dust settles on America’s election, with some results showing that a few voters were able to simultaneously support Donald Trump and progressive-leaning Democratic candidates. In the Bronx in New York, a strongly Black, Asian and Latino community, Trump’s support jumped 11 points to 33% over 2020, one of the largest margins citywide. At the same time, the leftwing firebrand Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez secured 68.9% of the vote, returning her to Congress for a fourth consecutive term.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/17/trump-aoc-voters	2024-11-17T05:00:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb02f47522197182cc5cfae141a44853564e77aa/34_174_4547_2728/master/4547.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1e60cf6a724534c19b15c5be129efa9e

So when an American TikToker sparked a craze for Swedish candy this year, there was pride that an important part of national culture was being recognised around the world. The Danes may have Ozempic but the Swedes have lördagsgodis – Saturday sweets – where families chew through more than 1kg of sticky treats in an evening. That pride has given way to some irritation. Supplies of some Swedish sweets ran dry in the autumn due to the high demand in the US, South Korea and in Scandinavia.

Overnight and this morning, Russian terrorists used various types of drones, including Shaheds, as well as cruise, ballistic, and aeroballistic missiles – Zircons, Iskanders, and Kinzhals. In total, approximately 120 missiles and 90 drones were launched. Our air defense forces destroyed over 140 aerial targets. The enemy’s target was our energy infrastructure across Ukraine. Unfortunately, some facilities sustained damage from direct hits and falling debris. In Mykolaiv, a drone attack killed two people and injured six others, including two children. My deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims. As of now, some areas remain without power, but all necessary forces are working to mitigate the consequences and restore the infrastructure.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/17/ukraine-war-live-russia-massive-missile-strike-energy-grid	2024-11-17T00:28:23-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bff9e568858820378e2a28098e612f6af3e4ffec/0_129_1019_611/master/1019.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=80a96d36fd4e6b7aa9960e143de98e47

In a radio interview aired on Saturday, the Ukrainian president conceded that the battlefield situation in eastern Ukraine was difficult and Russia was making advances. He said his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, was not interested in agreeing to a peace deal. Zelenskyy criticised a phone call between the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and Putin, saying it opened a -Pandora’s box- by undermining efforts to isolate the Russian leader. -Now there may be other conversations, other calls. Just a lot of words,- Zelenskyy said in his evening address on Friday. -And this is exactly what Putin has long wanted: it is extremely important for him to weaken his isolation and to conduct ordinary negotiations.- According to Reuters, Zelenskyy and other European officials had cautioned Scholz against the move. Scholz said Donald Trump privately held -a more nuanced position than is often assumed- on Ukraine. Trump’s reelection in last week’s US presidential vote has raised concerns he could withdraw Washington’s significant support for Ukraine once back in the White House. Scholz, who spoke to Trump by phone on Sunday, told the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on Friday his call with the president-elect was -perhaps surprisingly, a very detailed and good conversation-. Asked by the paper whether Trump would make a deal over the head of the Ukrainians, Scholz said Trump gave -no indication- that he would. Germany, for its part, would not accept a -peace by diktat-, Scholz said. Scholz urged Putin to pull Russian forces out of Ukraine and begin talks with Kyiv that would open the way for a -just and lasting peace-, in the first phone conversation between the two leaders in nearly two years. The Kremlin said the conversation on Friday had come at Berlin’s request, and that Putin had told Scholz any agreement to end the war in Ukraine must take Russian security interests into account and reflect -new territorial realities-. A German government spokesperson said Scholz -stressed Germany’s unbroken determination to back Ukraine in its defence against Russian aggression for as long as necessary-. Russian air defence units intercepted a series of Ukrainian drones in several Russian regions, officials said, many of them in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops launched a major incursion in August. Russia’s defence ministry said air defences downed 15 drones in Kursk region on the Ukrainian border. It said units downed one drone each in Bryansk region, also on the border, and in Lipetsk region, farther north. The ministry said one drone was downed in central Oryol region. And the governor of Belgorod region, a frequent target on the Ukrainian border, said a series of attacks had smashed windows in an apartment building and caused other damage, but no casualties were reported. Russia will suspend gas deliveries to Austria via Ukraine on Saturday. Russia’s gas export route to Europe via Ukraine is set to shut at the end of this year. Ukraine has said it will not extend the transit agreement with Russian state-owned Gazprom in order to deprive Russia of profits that Kyiv says help to finance the war against it. The Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, said Gazprom’s notice of ending supplies was long expected and Austria has made preparations, but the Ukrainian foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Russia’s action showed it -once again uses energy as a weapon-. Russia’s leading tanker group, Sovcomflot, said on Friday that western sanctions on Russian oil tankers were limiting its financial performance, as it reported falling revenues and core earnings. The US imposed sanctions on Sovcomflot in February, part of Washington’s efforts to reduce Russia’s revenues from oil sales that it can use to finance its war in Ukraine. Sovcomflot reported a 22.2% year-on-year drop in nine-month revenue to $1.22bn and said its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation slumped by 31.5% to $861m.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/16/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskyy-says-war-will-end-sooner-once-trump-enters-white-house	2024-11-16T00:56:56-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ee334bbe0de648585a49307ad8ebf5b2a74018c/0_0_3435_2060/master/3435.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c8d599474cca4d017bcd8fbebd0e52b0
Middle East crisis live: Israel strikes Beirut after evacuation call	Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said ‘the enemy’ carried out three air raids, including one near Haret Hreik Here is the tweet from the IDF’s Arabic spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, calling for the evacuation of southern Beirut’s Haret Hreik neighbourhood a couple of hours ago. -To all residents in the southern suburb area, specifically in the buildings specified in the attached maps and the buildings adjacent to them in Haret Hreik … You are located near Hezbollah facilities and interests, against which the IDF will act forcefully in the near future,- a translation of the post reads. A senior Hamas official has said the Palestinian militant group is -ready for a ceasefire- in Gaza and urged US president-elect Donald Trump to -pressure- Israel to -end the aggression-. -Hamas is ready to reach a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip if a ceasefire proposal is presented and on the condition that it is respected- by Israel, Hamas political bureau member Bassem Naim said. A UN spokesperson said that aid access in Gaza is at a low point with deliveries to parts of the north of the territory all but impossible. -From our perspective, on all indicators you can possibly think of in a humanitarian response, all of them are going in the wrong direction,- Jens Laerke told a press briefing. An Israeli airstrike flattened a building near one of Beirut’s busiest traffic junctions, Tayouneh. The targeted building was located in an area where the southern suburbs meet other. Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister has asked Iran to help secure a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hezbollah and appeared to urge it to convince the militant group to agree to a deal that could require it to pull back from the Israel-Lebanon border. The prime minister made the comments in talks with Ali Larijani, a top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, AP reported. Twenty-one civil defence rescuers were killed in two Israeli strikes on Lebanon on Thursday, marking one of the deadliest days for rescue workers since the fighting began between Israel and Hezbollah 13 months ago. The airstrikes brought the total number of emergency workers killed by Israel in Lebanon to more than 200. Fifty-nine people were killed in Israeli attacks on Lebanon on Thursday, bringing the total killed since October last year to at least 3,445, with 14,599 wounded, the Lebanese health ministry said in a statement on Friday.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/16/israel-lebanon-gaza-war-middle-east-hamas-hezbollah-latest	2024-11-16T00:41:24-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94fcacece6a50d26f1c905e53aeb21bdb9e1ad88/0_198_4464_2678/master/4464.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5b5630fd077d6c2f33d771655f6b3c7a

With the Tories beaten, Labour’s next threat comes from even further right	Reform may well be Labour’s new main opponent, and the next battleground may not be where anyone expected Two key rules of politics are to always look ahead, and to understand your opponent. And so it is that just months after crushing the Conservatives in a general election, many Labour MPs are bracing for fresh challenges and a new foe – Reform UK. Nigel Farage’s party is in parliamentary terms a minnow, its five MPs giving it little more than 1% of the Commons strength enjoyed by Keir Starmer. But many within Labour believe that by the time of the next election, things could be very different.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/15/with-tories-beaten-labour-next-threat-reform-wales	2024-11-15T14:30:21-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc7be1ae5ace75a8953c4359d172a3f39d66fa08/0_0_4496_2698/master/4496.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=68bac02e1b2fdcb6b67ce5c7d53f9735

Lunchables pulled from national school lunch programs in US	Kraft Heinz cites weak demand for pre-packaged meals amid reports of lead and high sodium in supermarket kits After offering the pre-packaged meals branded as Lunchables on school menus across the country just last year, Kraft Heinz, the company that makes the popular lunch and snack kits, is removing their products from a federally assisted meal program while citing weak demand. That cited weak demand and removal came after a Consumer Reports investigation found lead and high levels of sodium in the supermarket versions of Lunchables, though the ones made available at schools were tailored differently to meet federal nutrition regulations. The fact that the version of Lunchables available at schools used different ingredients to meet federal guidelines triggered warnings that they would not taste the same as the ones sold in stores, meaning they could be off-putting to children.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/15/lunchables-removed-national-school-lunch-program	2024-11-15T13:17:42-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b4173ca3c4fa2f8e29eabc8e0c250e243dada18/0_0_3961_2377/master/3961.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f5afa374e2d7135d006125f2804f56b0

How will BBC revamp Match of the Day when Gary Lineker leaves?	Plan is forming for digitally focused show to expand and grow the brand in a fractured media landscape When the BBC confirmed the news this week that Gary Lineker was leaving Match of the Day at the end of this season, the presenter’s official reaction was limited to a terse 21-word statement that he was -delighted- at signing a new contract to cover the FA Cup and 2026 World Cup. The former England striker was – unsurprisingly – more expansive about leaving the BBC’s flagship football programme after 25 years on his own podcast, the Rest is Football, on Thursday. -All things have to come to an end,- he mused. -I think the next contract, they’re looking to do Match of the Day slightly differently.

First Thing: RFK Jr condemned as ‘clear and present danger’ after Trump nomination	Experts warn making the anti-vaccine activist health secretary ‘is going to cost lives’. Plus, Paul Mescal interviews Ridley Scott Good morning. Donald Trump’s nomination of the anti-vaccine activist and conspiracy theorist Robert F Kennedy Jr as US secretary of health and human services has been decried by consumer advocacy groups, public health experts and pundits across the political divide, who say his appointment will cost lives. What happened in Samoa? Kennedy and his anti-vaccine nonprofit, Children’s Health Defense, reportedly spread anti-vaccine falsehoods in Samoa after its government had temporarily suspended its MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination program owing to the death of two babies because nurses had wrongly prepared doses. A year later, a measles outbreak killed 83. Kennedy denies responsibility. What is the controversy surrounding host countries? Azerbaijan is a large-scale fossil fuel producer. One of its government organizing members was also recently filmed appearing to offer help with fossil fuel deals. Is this new? No. Last year’s summit was also held in a petrostate, the United Arab Emirates, while that conference’s president kept his main job of heading the national oil company, Adnoc.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/15/first-thing-rfk-jr-condemned-as-clear-and-present-danger-after-trump-nomination	2024-11-15T03:25:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b742843ecd3ae28186638face98436ced134ee1/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1012ee6b672295036a130a9f71238f75

Two Democratic House members who have been vocal in their criticisms of Trump and his policy agenda told the Guardian they and their colleagues are preparing for -some pretty surreal and dystopic scenarios-.

Trump’s RFK Jr nomination condemned as ‘public health catastrophe’ – US politics live	Widespread criticism of health secretary role for anti-vaccine activist and purveyor of debunked conspiracy theories Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news from Washington over the next few hours. We start with the news that Donald Trump’s nomination of Robert F Kennedy Jr as US secretary of health and human services has prompted widespread criticisms towards Kennedy, an anti-vaccine activist who has embraced a slew of other debunked health-related conspiracy theories. The FBI should investigate both Gaetz and Tulsi Gabbard before they are confirmed for their cabinet posts, Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton has said. Gabbard, who Trump nominated as director of national intelligence, is known for her tolerant view of Russian president Vladimir Putin and Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Elon Musk reportedly met Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations on Monday, and discussed how to defuse tensions between Iran and the US, two Iranian officials told the New York Times. As Trump prepares to address conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, Musk, the world’s richest man, has been assisting in discussions with foreign officials, establishing himself as the country’s most influential civilian come January. Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are seeking Americans who are -high-IQ small-government revolutionaries- and willing to work over 80 hours a week to join their new department, at zero pay. Trump named Musk to co-lead the newly created government efficiency department that sits outside the federal government. Advocates have urged state governments to find new ways to defend immigrants and block Trump’s mass deportation plan. California shielded many non-citizen residents from removal in Trump’s first term but immigrants rights groups warn an aggressive, multi-pronged response will be needed. A Democratic lawmaker will file a motion specifically mentioning Trump can only serve two terms, after the president-elect joked he would be willing to serve an unconstitutional third term as president while meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday. Trump announced his former Georgia congressman Doug Collins as secretary of veterans affairs. Collins ran for Senate in 2020, finishing third in the primary. He also -provided counsel to Trump in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election as Trump sought to challenge Georgia’s election results-.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/15/donald-trump-rfk-jr-matt-gaetz-us-politics-live	2024-11-15T02:52:13-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/175036941419b4e6ceb17f89e431794e7395420e/0_33_4532_2720/master/4532.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2799fbd25a1f31d855f9c2bd9e5193ef

Reeves ‘not satisfied’ with growth as Tories accuse Labour of talking down economy – UK politics live	UK economy at near-standstill as uncertainty over the budget and high interest rates weighed on consumer spending Chancellor Rachel Reeves has says she is not satisfied with the latest GDP figures, which shadow chancellor Mel Stride also described this morning as -disappointing-. The UK economy slowed to a near-standstill in the third quarter as uncertainty surrounding Labour’s first budget and high interest rates weighed on business and consumer spending. At my budget, I took the difficult choices to fix the foundations and stabilise our public finances. Now we are going to deliver growth through investment and reform to create more jobs and more money in people’s pockets, get the NHS back on its feet, rebuild Britain and secure our borders in a decade of national renewal. I think a lot of that is because this government, on coming to office, talked down the UK economy. And it did that because it always planned to jack up taxes in the way that it has in the budget, and wanted to make out there was a bigger problem than there was. The UK economy slowed to a near-standstill with growth of just 0.1% in the third quarter of the year as uncertainty surrounding Labour’s first budget and high interest rates weighed on business and consumer spending Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: -Improving economic growth is at the heart of everything I am seeking to achieve, which is why I am not satisfied with these numbers- Shadow chancellor Mel Stride has been on the media round, describing the figures, which do partly cover a brief period when his party were still in government, as -disappointing- The Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has urged ministers to -rebuild relations- with the EU, warning that Brexit has undermined the UK’s economy Leading Tories Robert Jenrick and Oliver Dowden were on the committee that backed plans for the -rushed and misjudged- £15m purchase of an asbestos-ridden site for asylum accommodation The Liberal Democrats are campaigning about bus fares in England.

Middle East crisis live: Paramedics reported killed in Israeli attack on Lebanon as IDF orders evacuation of Beirut suburb	Lebanon’s state-run national news agency said the Ghobeiry area ‘witnessed heavy gunfire’ from Israeli forces We are restarting our live coverage of Israel’s wars in Lebanon and Gaza. The Israeli military has ordered residents to immediately evacuate the Beirut southern suburb of Ghobeiry, where it says Hezbollah fighters are located. In Gaza, at least two people were killed and several others injured after an overnight Israeli airstrike hit a residential apartment in the centre of Deir al-Balah, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa. In a separate attack, the outlet reports that two members of the same family – a father and son – were killed in an Israeli missile strike that targeted a home in the village of al-Nasr, northeast of the southern city of Rafah. The Israel Defense Forces said two rockets launched from Lebanon at the Haifa Bay area of Israel were successfully intercepted by air defenses. There were no immediate reports of any injuries. Canada’s foreign minister has expressed deep concern about -catastrophic- humanitarian conditions across Gaza and warned about -the life-threatening levels of acute malnutrition.- The country’s foreign affairs minister, Melanie Joly, cited a 8 November report by the Famine Review Committee that found a strong likelihood that famine is occurring or imminent in areas within the northern Gaza Strip. She said Israel must abide by its obligations under international humanitarian law and provide a significant and sustained increase to humanitarian assistance for Palestinians. Israel is using evacuation orders to pursue the -deliberate and massive forced displacement- of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, according to a report by Human Rights Watch, which says the policy amounts to crimes against humanity. The US-based group added it had collected evidence that suggested -the war crime of forcible transfer [of the civilian population]-, describing it as -a grave breach of the Geneva conventions and a crime under the Rome statute of the international criminal court- (you can read more about the report’s findings here).	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/15/middle-east-latest-lebanon-israel-gaza-hamas-hezbollah	2024-11-15T00:05:13-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8f3502f5c89828be522b943973a605e72c6fb0e/275_118_7655_4593/master/7655.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=218bae359c4abacff452414c94916dbb

A pair of doctors who evaluated Lawrence Hecker on 6 November made it a point to note that his illness is -a chronic and progressive disease-, suggesting additional delays beyond several already seen in the case create a risk that the clergyman declines into a state of legal incompetence preventing him from ever standing trial given his advanced age.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/14/lawrence-hecker-new-orleans-priest-trial	2024-11-14T04:00:13-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4f13b08c389e35b108a217bbe1883fb33321d8c/0_222_1154_692/master/1154.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0ab699905f60f9d7b3b7cfb020e1288c

First Thing: Israel accused of crimes against humanity over forced displacement in Gaza	Human Rights Watch says its evidence suggests Israel has committed a war crime against civilians. Plus, Mark Zuckerberg drops a cover of Get Low with T-Pain Good morning. Israel has been accused of crimes against humanity over its use of evacuation orders to pursue the -deliberate and massive forced displacement- of civilians in Gaza, in a new report by Human Rights Watch. How much of Gaza’s population has been displaced? More than 90%, with many civilians forced to move multiple times. What do the Geneva conventions say about displacement? That in occupied territories, civilians must be displaced only in exceptional circumstances – but Israel has used evacuation orders repeatedly. What’s Gaetz’s background? As a member of the Maga-aligned Freedom Caucus in the House, he led the successful charge to oust the former Republican House speaker Kevin McCarthy from his role. Why else might he be controversial? Though charges were never brought, he was investigated by the justice department in a sex-trafficking case involving children, and by the House ethics committee over allegations including sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. He strongly denies wrongdoing.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/14/first-thing-israel-accused-of-crimes-against-humanity-over-forced-displacement-in-gaza	2024-11-14T03:12:55-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64f727ca4a38e9480f9c159fa84a902bae40a10b/0_0_7500_4500/master/7500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=585f7af26393a2ebaca9eda598a445b0

Middle East crisis live: Israel accused of the ‘war crime of forcible transfer’ in Gaza	Report by Human Rights Watch says use of repeated evacuation orders against civilians amounts to crimes against humanity Israel is using evacuation orders to pursue the -deliberate and massive forced displacement- of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, according to a report by Human Rights Watch, which says the policy amounts to crimes against humanity. The US-based group added it had collected evidence that suggested -the war crime of forcible transfer [of the civilian population]-, describing it as -a grave breach of the Geneva conventions and a crime under the Rome statute of the international criminal court-.
