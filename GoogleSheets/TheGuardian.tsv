Middle East crisis live: Air raid sirens sound in Tel Aviv after Hezbollah claims to have targeted Israeli city	Israeli military said about 20 rockets were fired with many intercepted; US secretary of state Antony Blinken due to land in Israel for talks Air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv on Tuesday after Hezbollah said it bombed the Nirit area in the city’s suburbs with missiles. The Israeli military said about 20 rockets were fired in the latest barrage from Lebanon – five toward central Israel and 15 toward the north, and that attempts were made to intercept them. The IDF said there were no immediate reports of injuries. Israel said late Monday it planned to carry out more strikes in Lebanon against a Hezbollah-run financial institution that it targeted the night before and which it says uses customers’ deposits to finance attacks against Israel. At least 15 branches of Al-Qard Al-Hasan were hit late Sunday in the southern neighbourhoods of Beirut, across southern Lebanon and in the eastern Bekaa valley, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. One strike flattened a nine-story building in Beirut with a branch inside it. There were reports that dozens of Palestinians, including children, were killed in attacks carried out by Israeli soldiers in the northern Gaza Strip. Among the casualties were at least 10 people killed in an Israeli attack on Jabalia Preparatory School in Al-Fawqa area, which was functioning as an Unrwa shelter for displaced people, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. Joe Biden’s administration remains -deeply concerned- about the leak of a pair of highly classified intelligence documents describing Israel’s preparations for a retaliatory strike on Iran, the White House has said. There is no indication that additional documents have been compromised and US officials have been in communication with Israeli counterparts about the leak, a spokesperson said. Iran warned the US would bear -full responsibility- in case of a retaliatory attack by Israel on the Islamic Republic, after US president Joe Biden indicated he was aware of Israeli plans to do so. Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, called Biden’s remarks -profoundly alarming and provocative-. The UN warned Monday that almost no aid is entering the besieged Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, where a two-week Israeli military campaign has killed hundreds of people and left thousands trapped. The heads of the United Nations World Food Programme and UN children’s agency Unicef, Catherine Russell and Cindy McCain, have privately appealed to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for help -alleviating the suffering of countless civilians- in Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon, according to a new letter. Up to 1,000 women and children needing medical care will shortly be evacuated from Gaza to Europe, the head of the World Health Organization’s Europe branch said. Israel, which is besieging the war-devastated Palestinian territory, -is committed to 1,000 more medical evacuations within the next months to the European Union,- Hans Kluge said. The US military has rushed its advanced anti-missile system to Israel and it is now -in place-, defence secretary Lloyd Austin said. THAAD, or the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, is a critical part of the US military’s layered air defence systems and adds to Israel’s already formidable anti-missile defences.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/22/middle-east-crisis-live-blog-news-updates-israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-palestine-hamas-hezbollah-war	2024-10-21T22:46:43-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b57afaa3d426bef6f42da1ae0cfd5409c2c2eb7a/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3b78b6a9c225ebd88b482eea3627bce1

Honest Bob Jenrick won’t sleep until everyone sees he’s the maddest person in the room | John Crace	The Tory leadership hopeful believes that if he shouts the same things a bit louder, everyone will eventually come round to his way of thinking You can only conclude that some politicians are simply untreatable. Their egotism and self-delusion so deeply engrained that reality never gets a look in. I give you Robert Jenrick. Exhibit A. He is a worthy successor to Liz Truss as one of the dimmest solipsists you could hope to meet. After trailing in a distant second in last week’s televised Q&amp;A, you’d have thought Honest Bob might have taken a day or two to regroup. After all, if the most Tory-friendly audience imaginable at GB News doesn’t much like you then most people would reasonably conclude they had a problem. If you can’t connect with the few remaining diehard Tory members, then your chances of appealing to the rest of the country are vanishingly small.

With two weeks to go until the US presidential election, the race could hardly be closer. But when you’re next frantically obsessing over the odds, keep in mind: it may not be as simple as who most voters want to see in the Oval Office. If the attempt to subvert the 2020 election was an anti-democratic horror show, its impact was somewhat mitigated by the fact that Donald Trump seemed to be making it up as he went along. This time around, Republicans are a lot more organised in their efforts to influence the outcome – and as the Maga takeover of the GOP has rolled on over the past four years, election denialism has moved from the fringes to become a central tenet of the party.

Bob Woodward’s new book War is a sober but alarming must-read	Watergate reporter says Trump is far worse than Nixon and ‘most reckless and impulsive president in American history’ The Middle East and Ukraine are ablaze, the US mired in turmoil. An octogenarian president recedes from view. The threat of a second Trump term hangs like the sword of Damocles. Fifty years ago, with Carl Bernstein, Bob Woodward captured Watergate and the downfall of Richard Nixon. Now, the US sits at an inflection point once again. Woodward’s fourth book at least in part about Donald Trump is a sober but alarming must-read. War depicts an administration under Joe Biden that is often behind the curve, at times captive to its own wishful thinking. The withdrawal from Afghanistan haunts. Trump mesmerizes. Yet as Woodward tells it, Biden and his team did clearly see the menace Russia posed. Unlike George W Bush, Biden did not need to gaze into Vladimir Putin’s blighted soul. Unlike Trump, he did not feel compelled to fluff his ego like a besotted fanboy.

Harris kicks off birthday at Georgia church as Trump heads to McDonald’s in Pennsylvania – live	Candidates focus on rallying support from battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan Kamala Harris is delivering remarks at a service in New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in the Atlanta suburb of Stonecrest, Georgia. The crowd sang happy birthday when the Vice President, who turns 60 today, took the stage. Harris began her speech by turning the attention towards the ferry dock collapse on Georgia’s Sapelo Island, where at least seven people were killed during a fall celebration by the island’s tiny Gullah-Geechee community of Black slave descendants. Elon Musk promised to award $1m every day to voters as he steps up campaigning for Trump. The commitment, which started on Saturday as Musk handed a lottery-style check to the first winner of his contest at a town hall event, could mean Musk is on the hook for $17m if he remains the sole donor to his own Pac.

As Silicon Valley eyes US election, beware Elon Musk and the tech bros with political nous | John Naughton	The owner of X is just one of many who may prefer Donald Trump to greater regulation under the Democrats Way back in the 1960s -the personal is political- was a powerful slogan capturing the reality of power dynamics within marriages. Today, an equally meaningful slogan might be that -the technological is political-, to reflect the way that a small number of global corporations have acquired political clout within liberal democracies. If anyone doubted that, then the recent appearance of Elon Musk alongside Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania provided useful confirmation of how technology has moved centre-stage in American politics. Musk may be a manchild with a bad tweeting habit, but he also owns the company that is providing internet connectivity to Ukrainian troops on the battlefield; and his rocket has been chosen by Nasa to be the vehicle to land the next Americans on the moon. There was a time when the tech industry wasn’t much interested in politics. It didn’t need to be because politics at the time wasn’t interested in it. Accordingly, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple grew to their gargantuan proportions in a remarkably permissive political environment. When democratic governments were not being dazzled by the technology, they were asleep at the wheel; and antitrust regulators had been captured by the legalistic doctrine peddled by Robert Bork and his enablers in the University of Chicago Law School – the doctrine that there was little wrong with corporate dominance unless it was harming consumers. The test for harm was price-gouging, and since Google’s and Facebook’s services were -free-, where was the harm, exactly? And though Amazon’s products weren’t free, the company was ruthlessly undercutting competitors’ prices and pandering to customers’ need for next-day delivery. Again: where was the harm in that?	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/20/as-silicon-valley-eyes-us-election-elon-musk-is-not-the-only-tech-bro-to-worry-about	2024-10-20T01:00:39-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09c3f9308b486f377d732d10df725dd895414885/0_82_2682_1609/master/2682.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=640012f560f9864d863482cefea207d8

CNN reports that the documents which date from 15 and 16 October started circulating on Friday on Telegram through an account called the Middle East Spectator. The investigation is also examining how the documents were obtained – including whether it was an intentional leak by a member of the US intelligence community or obtained by another method, like a hack – and whether any other intelligence information was compromised, the Associated Press reports. Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in the seaside town of Caesarea was hit by a drone on Saturday, causing superficial damage and no casualties. Neither Netanyahu nor his wife, Sara, were home at the time. -The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake,- Netanyahu said in a statement, vowing that Iran and its proxies would -pay a heavy price-. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, spoke to Benjamin Netanyahu after reports of an attempted drone attack on the Israeli prime minister’s holiday home in Saturday. According to a Downing Street spokesperson, Starmer told Netanyahu that he was alarmed to hear about what Netanyahu called an -assassination attempt- on his life. G7 defence ministers expressed their concern over Israel’s latest attacks on Unifil in Lebanon. The group, which has been meeting in Naples, Italy, said: -We are concerned by the latest events in Lebanon and the risk of further escalation. We express concern over all threats to Unifil’s security.- The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, spoke to his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, on Saturday, reviewing US forces’ -posture adjustments-. Those include the recent deployment of an anti-missile system to reinforce Israel’s defences against regional threats, the Pentagon said in a statement. The US would like to see Israel scale back some of its strikes in and around the Lebanese capital of Beirut, Austin said. -The number of civilian casualties have been far too high,- Austin told reporters at a G7 defence gathering in Naples. Two Israeli airstrikes targeted south Beirut early on Sunday, Lebanese state media reports. -Enemy (Israeli) airplanes carried out two strikes this morning on Beirut’s southern suburbs, one of them hitting a residential building in Haret Hreik- near a mosque and a hospital, the National news agency reported. There were no immediate details of casualties or property damage. The Israeli army ordered civilians located near buildings it claimed were -affiliated with Hezbollah- in two neighbourhoods in south Beirut to immediately evacuate early this morning.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/20/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-gaza-lebanon-hamas-netanyahu-latest-live-news	2024-10-20T00:29:09-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b246cf6581f8499c451f973d3456e1fb20d1cf9/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=613cba02debc4e5f1a60d3df3d10b555

Allegations suggest India is now part of the assassination club | Hannah Ellis-Petersen	Canada’s PM, Justin Trudeau, claims Indian diplomats are implicated in murders on Canadian soil A gruelling week for Indian diplomacy began with an explosive Canadian press conference on Monday. Senior Canadian police officials accused Indian diplomats of being involved in -criminal- activities on Canadian soil, ranging from homicide and targeted assassinations to extortion, intimidation and coercion against members of the Canadian Sikh community. They alleged that Indian diplomats – including the high commissioner himself – were implicated not only in the high profile killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh activist who was gunned down outside a gurdwara in a suburb of Vancouver last June, but also linked to other murders on Canadian soil.

Montana park ranger says Senate candidate Tim Sheehy lied about combat wound	Sheehy has claimed that he was wounded in Afghanistan, but ranger says he investigated accidental shooting in park in 2015 A former Montana park ranger has now publicly accused Tim Sheehy – a Republican running for a US Senate seat in the state – of lying about getting shot while at war in Afghanistan. In an interview with the Washington Post published on Friday, 67-year-old Kim Peach went on the record about how Sheehy – a former US navy seal – actually shot himself on a family trip in 2015 at Glacier national park. Peach’s account explicitly contradicts Sheehy’s claim that he was shot in the arm during military combat, a story that the Republican candidate has shared throughout his US Senate campaign.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/19/tim-sheehy-gunshot-wound-montana-park-ranger	2024-10-19T08:37:48-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a01619d8080db0fcf998d09ba38e2dac1a6300d8/0_47_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f4486af8422ec9347336a6c9c14c8f4c
Revealed: Trump ground game in key states flagged as potentially fake	Data suggests canvassers linked to Elon Musk’s America Pac falsely claimed to have visited homes of potential voters Donald Trump’s campaign may be failing to reach thousands of voters they hope to turn out in Arizona and Nevada, with roughly a quarter of door-knocks done by America Pac flagged by its canvassing app as potentially fraudulent, according to leaked data and people familiar with the matter. The potentially fake door-knocks – when canvassers falsely claim they visited a home – could present a serious setback to Trump as he and Kamala Harris remain even in the polls with fewer than 20 days to an election that increasingly appears set to be determined by turnout.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/19/trump-campaign-leaked-data-voters-elon-musk	2024-10-19T08:30:19-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/add65230b1bb7614fbe2404bb4d54a5fbe7a93ea/0_69_2936_1762/master/2936.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d747200c8d9071d01ea0b7a6ead9ab98

This reflects how many in Israel feel about the death of a man responsible for the ­murder of 1,200 people, mostly civilians and their compatriots, but ­terrorism experts have long debated the ­efficacy of eliminating the ­leaders of violent extremist groups, with some suggesting the strategy is counter-productive.

Kamala Harris joined by Lizzo at campaign event; Donald Trump rallies in Pennsylvania – live	Vice-president is hosting a get-out-the-vote event in Detroit for the city’s first day of early voting, alongside Michigan-born rapper Lizzo Lizzo and Usher are just some of the prominent celibrities backing Harris against her rival Donald Trump. Earlier this week, Lizzo revealed that she voted early for Harris, and Usher said last month that he was endorsing Harris. This week, the campaign announced a fundraising sweepstakes to win tickets to an upcoming get-out-the-vote concert featuring -superstar musicians.- Harris questions whether Trump is -fit to do the job- of president again. She used a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Friday to seize on reports that Donald Trump had been canceling media interviews to question whether he has the stamina for a second presidency if voters choose him over her in November’s election. In the past week, Trump has gone further than ever in branding his political opponents -the enemy within- and talking about deploying the military against them. The latest polling figures seem to mirror such sharply polarised rhetoric, with the seven crucial swing states almost split down the middle in allegiance. Harris announced this week that if elected president, she would fully legalize adult recreational cannabis on the federal level – the first time a presidential nominee has taken such an unambiguous stance on ending cannabis prohibition. The pledge sets Harris apart from both her opponent and her predecessor. While Trump and Biden now support some level of cannabis legalization, Harris is the first to explicitly state that ending prohibition is a priority.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/19/kamala-harris-donald-trump-rallies-us-politics-elections	2024-10-19T07:59:40-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce16be42cc8302a17dca22c7419fdf1d5fffd09f/0_150_5364_3218/master/5364.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b30849521a7fb8875ce87a04aaaaf11d

In at least five of the seven battleground states that could determine whether the next US president is Democrat Kamala Harris or Republican Donald Trump, top election and law enforcement officials have investigated, indicted and even jailed officials who tried to interfere with the vote or delay certification of results, a necessary but largely ceremonial step.

Weight-loss drugs could be key in lowering US obesity rates – experts	Medications like Ozempic ‘transformed’ diabetes care because they improved health outcomes, say experts Obesity rates have decreased slightly in the US and while it’s too early to say whether the trend will hold and what’s causing the change, experts believe weight-loss drugs could be playing a role in continuing to lower obesity and reduce related health risks. These medications – Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and others – are called GLP-1 agonists, and they were originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes. But they also show great promise for treating obesity and other health conditions, like heart disease, kidney and liver issues, sleep apnea, asthma, Covid complications and cancer, among others.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/18/weight-loss-drugs-ozempic-obesity	2024-10-18T07:00:50-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/621da27f915cd0cccbaeb4b3057265e4c8fa1f77/0_217_4368_2620/master/4368.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3ec2caf7ea1f3bb1d3d4005cffccbc70

Walking with breaks might use more energy, but dogs can’t stand it	A new study finds that breaking up your exercise is more effective, but Tim Dowling remains to be convinced Let me start by saying that I am not looking for ways to be more tired. I’m tired enough. However, a new study suggesting that exercise punctuated by frequent breaks requires more energy than -steady-state- exertion has a certain counterintuitive attraction: I can exercise better by resting more. The results of the study, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, are striking. Volunteers on treadmills and stair climbers used 20-60% more oxygen when walking in bursts of 10-30 seconds than they did covering the same distance without stopping. This apparently has something to do with the sheer inefficiency of stop-start activity. -We found that when starting from rest, a significant amount of oxygen is consumed to start walking,- said the study’s author, Francesco Luciano. -We incur this cost regardless of whether we then walk for 10 or 30 seconds, so it proportionally weighs more for shorter rather than longer bouts.- Would this strategy, I wondered, work for me?	https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/18/walking-with-breaks-more-energy-exercise-dogs-tim-dowling	2024-10-18T06:38:19-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2154b83e148c53c640b06865626b9cb2a7c92e89/0_166_7918_4750/master/7918.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=60cd059363c40c58bfcf1b40860f46e9

Hot ticket: Brooklyn Beckham is latest celebrity to launch fiery sauce	Beckham is hot on heels of Ed Sheeran, Alice Cooper and Kim Kardashian as consumers develop appetite for spicy sauces First came tequila. Then rosé. Now the latest celebrity-backed brand isn’t booze but a hot sauce. Recently, Brooklyn Beckham made his debut into the spicy market with Cloud 23. The £15 bottles of sauce, consisting of two flavours, Hot Habanero and Sweet Jalapeño, and labels adorned with kissing cherubim are more akin to a luxury perfume brand. The 25-year-old’s sauces come hot on the heels of the singer Ed Sheeran who has an offering called Tingly Ted’s. The musician Alice Cooper has a line named after his greatest hits, including Poison Reaper, and Kim Kardashian has invested in Oprah’s favourite truffle-infused hot sauce, Truff.	https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/oct/18/brooklyn-beckham-latest-celebrity-launch-hot-sauce	2024-10-18T03:36:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cce4454ad2361ee520013a0c3d03fdb75ffacecb/0_1375_3576_2144/master/3576.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b91c715497a2562ce394896acc79f7a0

Her jokes didn’t land with the audience and she was mocked by comedian and host Jim Gaffigan. The white-tie dinner raises millions of dollars for Catholic charities and has traditionally offered candidates from both parties. Just found out that Lyin’ Kamala is doing a video message tonight instead of being at the Al Smith Dinner. She shouldn’t be allowed to do a video message. Kamala should be there like almost every other Presidential Candidate in their History, except Walter Mondale, who lost 49-1. They didn’t give me the option of a video message, nor would I have done it. This is very disrespectful to everyone involved.

Labour will reform benefits system to save £3bn, says minister – UK politics live	‘We will not go ahead with the Tory plan,’ Alison McGovern says, adding: ‘We will bring forward our own reforms’ Rachel Reeves will seek to make about £3bn of cuts to welfare over the next four years by restricting access to sickness benefits, it is understood, according to the PA news agency. The chancellor is expected to commit to the previous Tory government’s plans to save the sum by reforming work capability rules, as first reported by the Telegraph. We have always said that the work capability assessment is not working and needs to be reformed or replaced alongside a proper plan to support disabled people to work. We will deliver savings through our own reforms, including genuine support to help disabled people into work.- Like all departments, the Department for Work and Pensions has to make savings because we are in a terrible financial situation. To be clear, on that point we will bring forward our own reforms because the last 14 years have been a complete failure when it comes to employment.- We will not go ahead with the Tory plan because that was theirs. We will need to make savings like all departments, but we will bring forward our own reforms.- British foreign secretary David Lammy will meet his counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing on Friday to -challenge- China on sensitive issues like Russia’s war in Ukraine, as the two nations seek to rebuild frayed ties. Lammy is the first British cabinet minister to visit China since Labour prime minister Keir Starmer took office in July. Rachel Reeves is considering raising the tax on vaping products in her budget this month as figures show that a quarter of 11 to 15-year-olds in England have used e-cigarettes. The chancellor is looking at increasing the tax after a consultation carried out by the last Conservative government. The chancellor is taking action to ensure her budget plan for a multibillion-pound increase in government borrowing to fund infrastructure projects avoids a Liz Truss-style meltdown in financial markets. Ahead of her tax and spending event on 30 October, Reeves is convening on Friday the first meeting of a taskforce of leading City figures to advise on infrastructure projects. Kemi Badenoch has criticised a Conservative MP’s suggestion she could not head the Tories because she was too -preoccupied- with her children, saying -it isn’t always women who have parental responsibilities-. Stephen Flynn, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, has written to the prime minister urging him to intervene and stop the cuts in this year’s budget. He said, in a letter seen by the PA news agency, that Starmer must -listen to voters and your own cabinet colleagues: intervene now, overrule the chancellor and stop the cuts, or people in Scotland will never forgive the Labour party-. The Home Office has recruited 200 staff to clear a backlog of 23,300 modern slavery cases left by the last government, a minister has told the Guardian.

Small and lethal: adapted drones carrying explosives ‘hunt’ civilians in Kherson	Ukrainians face new airborne threat that has killed 24 civilians and injured hundreds more since July Sasha Ustenko has survived three attacks by the Russian drones that stalk the streets of Kherson carrying fragmentation grenades to drop on anything that moves. The first, in late July, targeted a parked police car in central Kherson just as Ustenko walked past, throwing him to the ground. The second, in mid-August, hit a drinking water tanker as he queued for supplies, killing the driver. Ustenko was concussed, and came round to see a man lying in a pool of blood. The third time, in late September, he heard the drone buzzing above and sprinted for shelter under the branches of a cherry tree. He hoped its leaves would hide him but the grenade tumbled through the canopy and landed barely a metre away.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/drones-carrying-explosives-stalk-streets-of-kherson-ukraine-russia	2024-10-17T22:00:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e618ab5f4ec88fb13da30e78b93d77a316b98f12/0_364_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5100da98ce3cf05675de7bf2a5f000c3

Killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar: what we know so far	The mastermind of the 7 October attack that triggered the current war in Gaza has been killed in a neighbourhood of Rafah Israel has killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in southern Gaza. Here is what we know so far: Israel’s military said it had killed Sinwar, who is seen as the architect of the 7 October attack in Israel, in Gaza. In a statement, the IDF said: -After completing the process of identifying the body, it can be confirmed that Yahya Sinwar was eliminated.- The statement came shortly after the Israeli foreign minister, Israel Katz, also said Sinwar had been killed. -Mass murderer Yahya Sinwar, who was responsible for the massacre and atrocities of 7 October, was killed today by IDF soldiers,- Katz said in a statement. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, described Sinwar’s death as -the beginning of the end- but warned the -task before us is not yet complete-. In a press conference, Netanyahu said Israel will continue to work until the end of the war. To the people of Israel, Netanyahu said that there are -a lot of challenges still facing us- and that -we have to remain resilient- and -stand firm on our ground and to continue to fight-. He added: -We will not stop the war. We will go into Rafah.- Hamas sources told Reuters that indications suggest Sinwar was killed in an Israeli operation in Gaza. There has been no public response from Hamas at the time of writing. Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, has commended the Israeli military, the Shin Bet intelligence agency, and the security services for the killing of Sinwar. In a post to X, Herzog described Sinwar as the -mastermind- behind the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel and for being -responsible for heinous acts of terrorism against Israeli civilians- for years. He added: -His evil endeavors were dedicated to terror, bloodshed, and destabilizing the Middle East.- In a statement, the Israeli prime minister’s office said that no hostages were believed to have been present at the site of the killing in the Gaza Strip, where Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said -three terrorists were eliminated-. Some in the defence establishment had believed that Sinwar was likely to have surrounded himself with human shields as he sought to evade Israeli troops. US president Joe Biden was briefed aboard Air Force One while heading to Germany. Biden, on his way to Berlin for talks with European leaders, was being kept abreast of developments on board the presidential plane, the official told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on condition of anonymity. Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has recently spoken with his US counterpart, defence secretary Lloyd Austin, according to a US official. The call came moments after Katz announced Sinwar was dead, the official said. According to CNN, Austin was passed a note about Sinwar’s death during a Nato meeting in Brussels earlier today. Israel’s Kan Radio reported that the Hamas leader was killed -by chance-, and not as a result of intelligence gathering. The station also said the bodies found at the site were found with large amounts of cash and fake IDs. Al-Majd, a Hamas-linked website that usually publishes about security issues, has urged Palestinians to wait for information about Sinwar from the group itself, reported Reuters.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/israel-says-hamas-chief-yahya-sinwar-is-dead-what-we-know-so-far	2024-10-17T10:45:40-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f782ace6410b3e4e2b809f30da49960631597f5f/0_109_7189_4314/master/7189.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=02f8e880bc45a7e82f86ff8a24f58f97
Yahya Sinwar: ruthless operator who plotted Hamas 7 October attack	Drawn into Islamist activism as a teenager, Sinwar spent 22 years in Israeli jails before return to frontline militancy Within days of the 7 October attacks last year, Israeli investigators had identified Yahya Sinwar, then the military leader of Hamas in Gaza, as the mastermind. To their increasing astonishment, they learned that not only had Sinwar conceived of what he called Operation al-Aqsa Flood but he had planned and organised the assault almost alone. Only a handful of close aides had been let in on the plans, some with only days to go before the attack, in which about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and 250 abducted, and which triggered an Israeli offensive that has so far killed 42,500 people, also mostly civilians, and left swaths of Gaza in ruins.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/yahya-sinwar-hamas-leader-profile	2024-10-17T10:41:44-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9582842e9507a4b51fe923d634d41fd1ee461497/0_128_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e9874518b6133191f6567fcdc4360912

As of July 2024, around 11,500 Lebanese nationals were believed to be in the US on nonimmigrant visas for business, tourism, temporary work or other opportunities, with California and Michigan hosting the most.

Death of Yahya Sinwar would be boost for Netanyahu but may not end war	Killing, if confirmed, will throw Hamas into disarray and give encouragement to Israeli military and political officials If Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas and mastermind of the 7 October attacks, is dead, the implications for the conflict in Gaza, for Israel’s other campaigns in Lebanon and the occupied West Bank, and for Israel’s domestic politics are significant. There will be the war – or wars – before the killing of the 62-year-old veteran militant and the war(s) after it. One of the biggest immediate impacts will obviously be on Hamas, which has now lost much of its top leadership. Already the head of its military wing in Gaza, Sinwar took charge of the organisation after Ismail Haniyeh, his predecessor, died in a bomb explosion in a government guesthouse in Tehran in July that was blamed on Israel. Other senior officials were killed in Beirut and in Gaza, where Israeli airstrikes successfully targeted military Hamas commanders such as Marwan Issa and Mohammed Deif.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/yahya-sinwar-hamas-gaza-netanyahu-israel-war	2024-10-17T08:49:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e8deff0de4401ad0243eb5c362a2c6e0fe61594/0_0_5339_3205/master/5339.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2523b1fd7b9ccb0a28b4398ed455a74c

Tories would do better with Jenrick as leader than Badenoch, poll suggests ahead of leadership hustings – UK politics live	Conservative leader candidates will take part in GB News hustings at 7pm Good morning. Members of the Conservative party have started getting their ballot papers for the leadership election, and this evening Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick will take part in what may be the only TV event of this stage of the contest – a hustings on GB News starting at 7pm. They won’t go head to head, but they each take questions for an hour. We will be covering it live (although a colleague will be at the helm, not me). Badenoch remains the bookmakers’ favourite, but Jenrick gets a boost today from Electoral Calculus polling, reported in the Telegraph, suggesting that the Tories would do better with him as leader. In his write-up, Charles Hymas says: Mr Jenrick, the former immigration minister, would win 50 extra seats if he was leader of the Tories compared with 30 seats that would be gained if Kemi Badenoch, his rival for the top job, was in charge of the party, according to the poll of nearly 6,300 people by Electoral Calculus … Under Mr Jenrick, the Conservatives would increase their number of seats from 121 to 178, with Labour falling from 412 to 311, the Liberal Democrats dropping from 72 to 58 and Reform rising from five to 24. That would place Labour 14 seats short of a majority.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/17/tory-leader-robert-jenrick-kemi-badenoch-labour-keir-starmer-uk-politics-latest-news	2024-10-17T01:06:46-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44db73d18caaf9dc2544bbfa5a2cf47a0bf499c1/222_0_4556_2734/master/4556.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4c9e3c2456670aec1a701a0b082cece5

Thursday briefing: The £40bn funding gap, £22bn ‘black hole’ and more tricky terms, explained	In today’s newsletter: Chancellor Rachel Reeves is painting a bleak picture ahead of the budget later this month. Here’s what all the jargon means • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. I’m really sorry about this, but today’s newsletter is about the extent of the -black hole- in the public finances and the government’s fiscal rules. I don’t like this any more than you do: I’d frankly rather be writing about whether King Conker is a cheat. But the budget is nearly upon us, and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has started talking about a £40bn funding gap, when you might have only just got used to being alarmed about the £22bn -black hole-. Several of today’s front pages carry reports of planned tax rises to balance the books; meanwhile, Reeves is planning to redefine debt to give herself more room for manoeuvre. If you have found yourself confused by this, congratulations on at least paying close enough attention to notice how knotty it all is. Music | Liam Payne, a former member of the boyband One Direction, has died after falling from a third-floor hotel room in Buenos Aires. Hundreds of fans gathered outside the hotel to pay tribute after the news, while authorities in Argentina said they were investigating the circumstances of Payne’s death. National security | Counter-terrorism police are investigating whether Russian spies planted an incendiary device on a plane to Britain that caught fire at a DHL warehouse in Birmingham in July, the Guardian can reveal. Investigators are examining possible links with a similar incident in Germany, also in July. Extremism | An international network of -race science- activists seeking to influence public debate with discredited ideas on race and eugenics has been operating with secret funding from a multimillionaire US tech entrepreneur. Seattle businessman Andrew Conru pulled his support after being approached by the Guardian. Asylum | Nearly 63,000 people who were waiting for their cases to be processed at the time of the general election are expected to be granted asylum after Labour dropped the Rwanda deportation scheme, an analysis has found. The Refugee Council said the asylum backlog was on track to be 59,000 cases lower at the start of 2025 after the processing of claims accelerated. US election | Kamala Harris said her presidency -would not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency- in her first interview with Fox News as she criticized Donald Trump over his threats against -the enemy within-. In a contentious interview, Harris was pressed on subjects where she has come under attack from the right including immigration and the rights of transgender people. That just means debt should be falling by the last year of that period. That’s it. Think about what that means: it’s like saying on 1 January, right, I’m going to go on a diet this year, but I’m going to lose all the weight in December. Nobody would take you seriously if you said that, and economists from a broad spectrum think it’s stupid. Fiscal rules are there to look plausible, they are often broken when it comes to the crunch, and they rely on the public not really knowing what they mean.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/first-edition-22bn-black-hole-explained	2024-10-16T22:52:24-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/658f207c0266016d4d263565e87d75db6d9e0238/0_0_6912_4147/master/6912.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=66ce1ddbc8275fd7400cccd0683df2d5

Negative stereotypes in international media cost Africa £3.2bn a year – report	Focus on conflict, corruption and poverty heightens perception of risk, raising interest on sovereign debt, authors say Africa loses up to £3.2bn yearly in inflated interest payments on sovereign debt due to persistent negative stereotypes that dominate international media coverage of the continent, according to a new report. Research by consultants Africa Practice and the advocacy non-profit Africa No Filter suggests that media portrayals, especially during elections when global coverage is heightened, focus disproportionately on conflict, corruption, poverty, disease and poor leadership, widening disparities between perceived and actual risks of investing in the continent, and creating a monolithic view of Africa.	https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/oct/17/media-stereotypes-africa-higher-interest-report-payments-on-sovereign-debt	2024-10-16T22:00:06-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d64974956dd271822b5cb1d993ff4414d0849c8b/0_104_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bc806f0d15081d75be1ea5ad8dc2a731

Middle East crisis live: US military strikes Houthi targets in Yemen – Pentagon	US air force used B-2 bombers to target ‘five hardened underground weapons storage locations’ of Iran-backed Houthis, Pentagon says The US military has struck Houthi weapons storage facilities within Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, according to the Pentagon. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said the US military, including air force B-2 bombers, conducted precision strikes against five hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. The US has demanded proof on the ground that Israel does not have a policy of starvation in northern Gaza as it turned up the pressure on the Netanyahu government to allow more aid into the territory. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the security council on Wednesday at a meeting convened by France, UK and Algeria that such a policy -would not just be horrific and unacceptable- but also had -implications under international and US law-. The risk of cholera spreading in Lebanon is -very high-, the World Health Organization has warned, after a case of the acute and potentially deadly infection was detected in the conflict-hit country. The WHO highlighted the risk of cholera spreading among hundreds of thousands of people displaced since Israel escalated its campaign against Hezbollah. Israeli forces have stormed the Jazalone refugee camp in the West Bank and deployed teargas, Al Jazeera reports. A young girl was reportedly treated for breathing issues. Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said that there have been no conversations with any parties on a Gaza ceasefire for the last three to four weeks. -On the prospects of the negotiation … basically in the last three to four weeks, there is no conversation or engagement at all, and we are just moving in the same circle with the silence from all parties,- he said. Shaban al-Dalou, the 19-year-old Palestinian who was burned to death in his makeshift tent when Israel bombed the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital complex in Deir el-Balah on Monday, would have turned 20 today. -Losing him is an incredibly massive loss,- al-Dalou’s uncle, Mohammed al-Dalou said, adding: -He left a mountain of pain and memories.- Hezbollah said it targeted -at 6.50pm (1550 GMT) … the occupied town of Safed with a salvo of rockets- in -defence of Lebanon and its people-. The reported attack marks the third attack in 24 hours which Hezbollah said was a response to Israeli raids across Lebanon which have killed more than 2,300 people in recent weeks. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant on Wednesday, the Pentagon says, after Austin and secretary of state Antony Blinken jointly penned a letter earlier this week urging Israel to improve Gaza’s humanitarian situation.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/17/middle-east-crisis-live-updates-israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war	2024-10-16T20:00:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/753f1f32bef766f63bfaef60413eddd4c5f52f03/0_322_5359_3216/master/5359.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ae5ff4da9f669001bf11778ef1ebd0c

Sunak has checked out, leaving Starmer looking even more startled than usual | John Crace	Forget the Taylor Swift debacle or broken promises over national insurance, Rishi just wanted to ask about China It’s generally not hard to read a politician. You instinctively know when they are being sincere and when they are bullshitting. When push comes to shove, they just aren’t as smart as they would like us to believe they are. They are inherently bad actors. The only people they ever fool are themselves. You know the form. We could all tell when Boris Johnson was lying. It was whenever his lips moved. But there are the odd moments when they are impossible to read. When no one can really be sure what is going on. Are they playing a sophisticated triple bluff? Or have they entered a parallel universe where they are so detached from reality that even they have no idea what they are doing? Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions was a case in point.

Elon Musk’s $75m puts him among largest Republican donors – US politics live	The Tesla CEO gave around $75m to his pro-Donald Trump spending group over a period of three months Elon Musk gave around $75 million to his pro-Donald Trump spending group in the span of three months, federal disclosures showed, underscoring how the billionaire has become crucial to the Republican candidate’s efforts to win the presidential election Reuters reports. America PAC, which is focused on turning out voters in closely contested states that could decide the election, spent around $72 million of that in the July-September period, according to disclosures filed to the Federal Election Commission. The first day of early voting in the battleground state of Georgia saw a record turnout, with 328,000 people casting a vote in person or by mail. This more than doubled the previous record of 136,000 set in 2020. Trump will launch a bus tour of north Carolina later today. The tour will travel across the state for three days before ending at the Wayne County Republican Party HQ on Friday. Early in-person voting begins tomorrow in the battleground state. Kamala Harris will return to the battleground state of Pennsylvania for another campaign event later today, after she visited Erie on Monday. She will then head to Wisconsin to visit Milwaukee, La Crosse and Green Bay on Thursday. Trump refused to say if he would commit to a peaceful transfer of power should he lose the 5 November election, in an interview with Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait. He claimed there had been a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election, despite his supporters’ violent attack on the Capitol on 6 January. He also doubled down on his promise to levy tariffs on all imports in a bid to boost American manufacturing. Economists say this policy would probably mean higher prices for consumers and anger US allies. Yesterday Harris defended her record as a prosecutor, pledged to decriminalise marijuana and push for police reform. She was aiming to shore up support among black men in an interview with radio host Charlamagne tha God. The Harris Victory Fund, the Democratic candidate’s ‘big-dollar fundraising committee’, raised $633m in the three months from 1 July to 30 September.

President Joe Biden said Harris would -cut her own path- once she wins the 2024 election, as he hit the campaign trail to help win over sceptical voters three weeks before Election Day. -Kamala will take the country in her own direction, and that’s one of the most important differences in this election,- he said. -Kamala’s perspective on our problems will be fresh and new.

Keir Starmer to face PMQs as reports claim Treasury must fill ‘£40bn funding gap’ in budget – UK politics live	Sources say Rachel Reeves told cabinet colleagues yesterday the figure was much higher than previously estimated Good morning. Governments engage in expectation management, and the latest example is on the front page of the Financial Times this morning, where there is a story saying Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has identified a -£40bn funding gap- as she prepares the budget, which is happening a fortnight today. In their story George Parker and Sam Fleming report: UK chancellor Rachel Reeves has identified a £40bn funding gap ahead of her Budget in two weeks — far more than previously expected — as she prepares big tax rises to patch up the NHS. The figure represents the funding that Reeves needs to protect key government departments from real-terms spending cuts, cover the enduring impact of an annual £22bn overspend and build up a fiscal buffer for the remainder of the parliament. If we get tax rises on that scale [£40bn], that really would be extraordinary, I mean unprecedented. That would be tax rises sort of three times as big as George Osborne, for example, introduced back in 2010 in the depths of the aftermath of a financial crisis. But that said that, if you are as the government wanting to not just protect public services, but significantly increase spending on the health service and increase spending on other things in line with the size of the economy, yes, there is a very big hole in the public finances.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/16/keir-starmer-pmqs-treasury-budget-40bn-gap-rachel-reeves-uk-politics-live	2024-10-16T01:31:01-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36898fbb52dc46c781c524bbdee886fc4f7036c5/0_0_3255_1953/master/3255.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c59fd9260bbf4b222e834719ea1fe50

Who are the key New Labour figures in Keir Starmer’s government?	The PM is surrounded by Blairites, from Pat McFadden and Liz Kendall to Jacqui Smith and Jonathan Powell In the run-up to the general election, Keir Starmer was regularly compared to Tony Blair. When they were highlighted by the left, the parallels were often intended as insults. When they came from the Labour right, particularly after the landslide result, they were compliments. Starmer has mirrored Blair so far in his ruthlessness towards his own party, his efforts to build relationships with business and his pursuit of public service reform. But he is also more cautious, less seduced by glitz and more to the soft-left in his own views.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/15/who-are-the-key-new-labour-figures-in-keir-starmers-government	2024-10-15T11:12:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d68930ae43654386d246219f2ce593f320a1b4c/0_99_2416_1450/master/2416.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=07c7edfd954964b124d63e3a44cc756a

Middle East crisis live: UN peacekeepers ‘must never be targeted’; Netanyahu ‘won’t strike Iran nuclear facilities’	Security council says peacekeepers ‘must never be the target of an attack’; Israeli PM reportedly tells US he is willing to avoid strikes on oil or nuclear installations Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. The UN security council has expressed -strong concern- after several UN peacekeepers were wounded when they came under fire in southern Lebanon amid clashes between the Israeli military and Iran-backed Hezbollah militants. The council reiterated its support for the peacekeeping mission’s role in supporting regional security. Italy, Britain, France and Germany released a joint statement on Monday condemning Israel for repeatedly attacking UN peacekeepers. -These attacks must stop immediately,- they said, adding deliberate attacks were against international law. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez said there would be -no withdrawal- of the UN peacekeeping force from southern Lebanon after Israeli attacks and calls to leave. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Unifil’s work -is very important. It’s completely unacceptable attacking United Nations troops.- More than 20 people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Christian town in northern Lebanon on Monday, far from Hezbollah’s power centres in Beirut and the south and east of the country. The bombing struck Aitou, a Maronite village near the northern city of Tripoli, hit a small apartment building, killing 21 people according to the Lebanese Red Cross. The village’s mayor told Reuters that the building had been rented to families displaced by the war. It was also a particularly bloody 24 hours in the Gaza Strip. Four people were killed in an Israeli bombing of a hospital courtyard in central Gaza, another strike on a nearby school used as a shelter killed at least 20 people, and a drone strike killed five children playing on the street in al-Shati camp in Gaza City, according to local health authorities. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports of civilian casualties in the three incidents on Sunday and Monday. At least 42,289 Palestinians have been killed and 98,684 wounded in Israeli strikes since 7 October 2023, the Palestinian health ministry said on Monday. Netanyahu is examining a plan to seal off humanitarian aid to northern Gaza in an attempt to starve out Hamas, according to a report. The plan, proposed by a group of retired generals, would give Palestinians a week to leave the northern third of the Gaza Strip, including Gaza City, before declaring it a closed military zone. Those who remain would be considered combatants – meaning military regulations would allow troops to kill them – and denied food, water, medicine and fuel, according to a copy of the plan given to the Associated Press. The UN’s secretary-general, António Guterres, condemned the -large number of civilian casualties in the intensifying Israeli campaign in northern Gaza-, his spokesperson said on Monday. The UN chief -strongly urges all parties to the conflict to comply with international humanitarian law and emphasises that civilians must be respected and protected at all times,- spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said. Israeli forces shot dead two Palestinians in the northern West Bank city of Jenin on Monday, the Palestinian health ministry said. According to Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, one of the men was 17 years old. Four others were injured by Israeli fire during the raid, it said. Ireland’s foreign minister, Micheál Martin, accused Israel of trying to prevent the world from seeing what its troops are doing in Lebanon and Gaza, and of working to undermine the UN. Asked what Israel’s aim might be in demanding that UN peacekeepers leave their bases in Lebanon after a series of attacks, Martin said: -essentially to drive the eyes and ears out of south Lebanon and to give itself free rein-. Officials from the US’s main humanitarian agency attend daily meetings on an Israeli military base that also hosts a notorious prison for Palestinian detainees where torture reportedly runs rampant, the Guardian has learned.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/15/middle-east-crisis-live-un-peacekeepers-lebanon-israel-gaza-iran-netanyahu	2024-10-14T23:32:03-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd6c3e06cb86c75a8c2792d766bb6d82f7fe6ea7/0_140_4200_2521/master/4200.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d69d15e79bb8d9b976891fef34607998

With Israel expected to retaliate, it is not surprising US has announced it will deploy Thaad missile defence systems As Israel’s conflict with Hezbollah and Iran has escalated, it has begun to show a degree of vulnerability. A Hezbollah drone evaded Israel’s much vaunted air defences on Sunday and struck a military canteen when it was busy with soldiers eating dinner. Four were killed and 58 wounded, seven seriously, at a location 40 miles south of the Lebanese border. The drone that hit the canteen of the Golani base near Binyamina appears to have been part of a synchronised attack that allowed it to elude the country’s well organised air defences. Three drones flew from Lebanon over the Mediterranean, and though they were all initially spotted, and two shot down, the other was able to reach its target.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/14/attacks-by-hezbollah-and-iran-showed-a-degree-of-israeli-vulnerability-what-now	2024-10-14T10:53:55-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3e2a5edb9b1d6f5a99b7450b814f311377e3acf/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=de04f6ccd61b37912884258a24f74861

Trump ground game undercut by slow internet that crashes app	Trump campaign wants to hit rural voters but slow internet limits the functionality of the Campaign Sidekick app Donald Trump’s campaign has limited ability to know whether their ground game operation is reaching target voters in battleground states, as the software being used needs fast internet service to properly track canvassers, according to multiple people familiar with the situation.

US election live: Trump and Harris expected in Pennsylvania with little over three weeks until vote	Both candidates campaigning hard as polls show them locked in a tight race for 5 November Good morning and welcome to the US elections blog with a little over three weeks to go until Americans head to the polls. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris were speaking last night and are back on the campaign trail today with both expected to hold events later in the swing state of Pennsylvania. Here’s a round-up of what happened overnight in the US. A man with a shotgun, loaded handgun, ammunition and several fake passports in his vehicle was arrested at a security checkpoint outside Donald Trump’s rally Saturday night in the Southern California desert, police said. He was released the same day on $5,000 bail. The suspect, a 49-year-old resident of Las Vegas, was driving an unregistered black SUV with a -homemade- license plate that was stopped by deputies assigned to the rally in Coachella, east of Los Angeles, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said at a news conference. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump spent Sunday trying to shore up political support among what they perceived to be must-have voting blocs. Polls show them locked in a tight 5 November presidential race. Trump pledged on Sunday to hire an extra 10,000 border patrol agents if he is reelected as president. The Republican presidential candidate said he would meet the goal by asking the US Congress to fund a 10% pay rise for border patrol agents and a $10,000 retention and signing bonus, at a rally in the border state of Arizona, an election battleground. Harris held a rally in Greenville, North Carolina, where she attacked her rival for spreading misinformation related to hurricanes Helene and Milton. -From him, we are just hearing from that same, old tired playbook,- she said. -He has no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people. He is only focused on himself.- Both Harris and Trump will be in Pennsylvania later today. Harris is speaking in the city of Erie and Trump is on the stump in Oaks, a small community about 20 miles from Philadelphia. Speaker Mike Johnson said that passing additional hurricane aid for states impacted by hurricanes Helene and Milton -can wait- until Congress is back in session after the election. Three major polls were released Sunday, showing Kamala Harris either ahead of Donald Trump or running a head-to-head race.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/14/us-election-live-donald-trump-kamala-harris	2024-10-14T02:58:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7ddec8eefb0310a5c77588eb663a44ad063ef35/0_0_4639_2783/master/4639.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1bb81766efdcbaa505d1192d30d9b08b

Middle East crisis live: 20 killed in strike on central Gaza school; Harris urges Israel to get more aid into northern areas	Israeli shelling killed people at a school serving as a shelter for displaced Palestinians in the central Nuseirat camp, say hospitals An Israeli airstrike on a hospital courtyard in the Gaza Strip early Monday killed at least four people and sent flames sweeping through a packed tent camp for people displaced by the war, leaving more than two dozen with severe burns, according to Palestinian medics. Civilians must be protected and must have access to food, water, and medicine. International humanitarian law must be respected.- A Hezbollah drone attack on an army base in central Israel killed four soldiers and severely wounded seven others on Sunday, the Israeli military said, in the deadliest strike by the militant group since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon nearly two weeks ago. Hezbollah called the attack near Binyamina city retaliation for Israeli strikes on Beirut on Thursday that killed 22 people. It later said it targeted Israel’s elite Golani brigade, launching dozens of missiles to occupy Israeli air defence systems during the assault by -squadrons- of drones. The US will send an antimissile system to Israel as well as a crew of US military personnel to operate the system. In a statement released on Sunday, Pentagon press secretary Maj Gen Pat Ryder said that the US will also send an -associated crew of US military personnel to Israel to help bolster Israel’s air defenses-. Sixteen people have been killed during Israel’s raid on Al Ma’asara in Lebanon’s Keserwan district. In a post on Sunday updating the death toll from yesterday’s attacks, the Lebanese health ministry said that in addition to the 16 people killed, 21 people were injured. United Nations secretary general António Guterres warned on Sunday that any attacks against peacekeepers -may constitute a war crime-, his spokesperson said, after Israeli tanks burst through the gates of a peacekeeping base in southern Lebanon. Reuters reports it was the latest accusation of Israeli violations and attacks against the UN peacekeeping mission, known as Unifil, in recent days. In a statement released late on Sunday, the Israeli military said a Merkava tank had been trying to evacuate injured soldiers and had backed into the Unifil post accidentally while under fire amid a smokescreen. In a videoed statement addressed to Guterres on Sunday, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, reiterated Israeli calls for Unifil troops to evacuate. -The time has come for you to withdraw Unifil from Hezbollah strongholds and from the combat zones,- he said. -The IDF has requested this repeatedly and has met with repeated refusal, which has the effect of providing Hezbollah terrorists with human shields.- French president Emmanuel Macron urged his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian to support a -general de-escalation- in the Middle East during a phone conversation on Sunday, the presidential office said. Reuters reports that in a separate discussion, Macron reiterated to Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati the -absolute necessity- of obtaining a ceasefire in Lebanon without further delay.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/14/middle-east-crisis-live-nuseirat-gaza-lebanon-israel-unifil-netanyahu	2024-10-13T23:41:58-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d2f40394ccde4db6b61754216c425ac5c1373b9/0_605_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=066d7e62007993ceef15dcb104a4b128

Environment organisations have been calling for additional funding for preparedness for the disease in wildlife for many months. This is incredible news. The Albanese government is finally investing a serious amount into preparation for what could be the worst environmental disaster in Australia’s history. This level of funding will allow departments to get on with the job of properly preparing to save wildlife and stop extinctions if the deadly bird flu hits our shores.

Trump to hold rally in Arizona as new polls show Harris in the lead – live	Several polls released on Sunday show Kamala Harris in the lead or in a tight race with Donald Trump Good morning, US politics blog readers. There’s another busy news day ahead of us and we’ll keep up with all the developments as they happen. Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona, later today. Kamala Harris’s husband, Doug Emhoff, will head to a Get Out the Jewish Vote campaign event in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. He will later deliver remarks at a Girl Dads for Harris-Walz phone bank in Delaware County. Kamala Harris on Saturday released a report on her health and medical history, which found that -she possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency- if voters elect her in November. A senior aide to Harris, 59, said the vice-president’s advisers viewed the publication of the health report and medical history as an opportunity to call attention to questions about Donald Trump’s physical fitness and mental acuity. Tightening poll figures have triggered nervousness and anxiety in Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign, with Donald Trump making gains in the states where it matters most as the election race enters its climactic final phase, according to The Guardian’s 10-day polling average tracker. Several former Trump administration officials have warned that the former president deliberately withheld disaster aid to states he deemed politically hostile to him as US president and will do so again unimpeded if he returns to the White House.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/13/donald-trump-kamala-harris-polls-politics-latest-updates	2024-10-13T07:31:47-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c88b663cca30eb1e2087af5d1decc1f06651930/0_399_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8cc3e28a4b3c78b40ab0962d8b09ce21

Tax wealth and value public assets: how Reeves can solve her biggest budget challenges | James Smith	Boosting growth and investment while averting austerity is a tough ask, but options are available for the chancellor, writes the research director of the Resolution Foundation • Labour MPs urge Reeves to spend tens of billions more on ailing public services The chancellor has said she wants to avoid a -return to austerity-. She’s also said she’ll deliver a pro-investment, pro-growth budget. Those are laudable goals, but she must fix a dire set of public finances, a tough task not helped by the £22bn overspend uncovered this summer. This is the trilemma facing Rachel Reeves before the government’s pivotal first budget.

Coalition wants to scrutinise ‘national security risk’ of Chinese-made EVs – as it happened	This blog is now closed Coalition would consider mirroring US action on TikTok due to ‘foreign interference risk’, says Paterson Paterson has implied that the Coalition would consider taking similar action to the US on TikTok. TikTok will pose a national security risk and particularly a foreign interference risk in our democracy. The US has taken action. The worrying thing is you might end up with a safer version of TikTok in the United States and a more dangerous version in Australia because we have been unwilling to take that action. Of course, it happened on the Albanese government’s watch. They deserve some of credit for that, but it is a credit to Australia as a whole because the reason why the Chinese government has walked away from these sanctions is because they didn’t work. So much so that the Biden administration is taking very tough action to eliminate them from their market. If our closest ally and friends think it is a concern, we should address it as well. For example, you can impose minimum cybersecurity standards that would lift the bar that all Internet devices like that have to meet, not just cars but other devices connected to the Internet.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/oct/13/australia-news-live-politics-closing-the-gap-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-cost-of-living-voice-referendum	2024-10-12T23:38:46-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd429f2eff0e878b1815c13b2ba9db0b467b52e0/371_315_5629_3377/master/5629.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c9cf9d34c4083858f3d402c27e869b03

As the one remaining centrist candidate, he seemed certain to pick up votes from supporters of one nation Conservative Tom Tugendhat, who had just been knocked out.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/12/james-cleverly-warned-mps-that-tactical-votes-could-kill-his-leadership-hopes	2024-10-12T09:48:05-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b78d8994c8c1838486eb77040fd8abc0333ef920/0_175_5242_3145/master/5242.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f8ce222647de8f992b5fb6da1721bc06

Enrico Berlinguer: the 1970s communist hero inspiring Italy’s youth – and the far right	Italian PM Giorgia Meloni among those admiring Berlinguer as new film and exhibitions celebrate his role as a unifier Enrico Berlinguer was a giant of the Italian left in the 1970s and 80s, coming close to leading the Communist party into government through a -historic compromise- with the country’s Christian Democrats, and championing -Eurocommunism-, a liberal, anti-Stalinist version of Marxism that briefly swept the continent. But his death 40 years ago, and the collapse of Europe’s communist parties in the late 1980s, eclipsed Berlinguer’s legacy, and Italy has since moved across the political spectrum, electing the far-right Giorgia Meloni as prime minister in 2022.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/12/enrico-berlinguer-communism-hero-italy-youth-far-right-film	2024-10-12T08:06:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51001b87dfb9426ff17bbd8c83e0bb2528e92ce5/0_398_5550_3330/master/5550.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0c93c2f95a98e6fe5422e1f2a1032539

Donald Trump to speak at Hispanic event as Kamala Harris releases medical report – live	The Republican and Democratic presidential candidates are campaigning with election day just over three weeks away Good morning and thanks for joining us this Saturday. With election day just over three weeks away, we’ll be covering the latest developments as they happen. Here’s a quick summary of the latest news from yesterday and where things stand today: At a rally in Aurora, Colorado, yesterday, former president Donald Trump announced -Operation Aurora-, a plan to invoke the 1798 Alien Enemies Act if he is re-elected. The law allows the president to detain and deport non‑citizens in times of a declared war or presidentially proclaimed -invasion-. Meanwhile, speaking in Scottsdale, Arizona, Kamala Harris said she would create -a bipartisan council of advisers- if elected president. She’s drawn remarkable support over the past two and a half months from establishment Republicans, most notably Liz and Dick Cheney. Also yesterday, Vogue magazine released its newest issue, featuring Harris on the cover. The photograph of the vice-president stood in stark contrast to Harris’s first appearance on the magazine’s cover three years ago – an image that was widely criticized as unserious and disrespectful. This morning, Harris released a report on her medical history – in contrast to her opponent who has repeatedly promised and then refused to do the same. The report concludes that Harris -possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency-. And Trump is scheduled to speak this afternoon at a Hispanic roundtable in Las Vegas. He’s expected to return to the anti-immigrant message that has defined his campaign. In a change of scenery, Tim Walz is taking a break from the campaign trail today to kick of Minnesota’s pheasant hunting season. He’s spending the day at the Governor’s Pheasant Opener – reiterating the Minnesota governor’s reputation as a hunter despite his firm stance on gun violence regulations.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/12/election-donald-trump-kamala-harris-politics-live-updates	2024-10-12T07:37:12-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51deb9deb203b28efc3270bed5d3f2c579c49309/0_98_2949_1769/master/2949.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=156a26cb23af415863dc8b6ae71bb642

Insurance is failing hurricane survivors: ‘People thought they were covered’	Flooding is separate from typical US home insurance and many homeowners are not adequately covered As millions of US residents begin working to file insurance claims on their homes in the aftermath of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, many could be denied, particularly if their homes were damaged by flooding. A quirk in the US home insurance market is that flood insurance is separate from typical home insurance, which usually covers wind damage from hurricanes but not flooding.

UK ministers also remain unclear on what military action Israel is preparing to take, or its timing, which shows how far the UK is from endorsing an attack on Iran, and how it would prefer a route to de-escalation.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/11/uk-remains-distant-from-any-israeli-plan-to-attack-iran	2024-10-11T09:09:03-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/953f9068db077fdb9b46f9f92822c9f5333ece36/0_69_2066_1239/master/2066.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=85676185ca09884b8dc55ac88a800253
French government faces first major test over deep budget cuts	Bill aims to find €60bn to plug deficit but opposition parties could demand concessions and even topple the administration The new French government is facing its first major test in a hostile parliament as it tries to push through an austerity budget of spending cuts and tax increases on the wealthy and big companies aimed at saving €60bn (£50bn) and reining in a ballooning fiscal deficit.

Just days ago, the leader of the Victorian Liberal party was bracing for a potential leadership challenge.

The environment minister made a partial declaration under section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act in August, blocking a proposal by mining company Regis Resources to build a tailings dam for its $900m McPhillamys gold project in the headwaters of the Belubula River.

Some Australian states are discovering what happens when they have too much rooftop solar	Alerts to possible power shortfalls have become a familiar occurrence. But experts say it won’t be long before the opposite is common When Victoria basks in mostly sunny spring weather this weekend, energy authorities will be monitoring how far electricity demand ebbs. If needed, they’ll turn off rooftop solar systems to ensure stability for the grid.

Obama takes down Trump’s lies and fake ‘strength’, urging men to vote for Harris – US elections live	Former president scoffs at idea Trump’s bullying shows strength in speech that also condemns hurricane lies and asks ‘When did that become OK?’ Good morning, US politics blog readers, there’s another busy news day in store and we’ll keep up with all the developments as they happen. Party politics has seeped further into hurricane news, and you can follow all that in our storm blog, here. Elsewhere, much is afoot on the campaign trail. Here’s what’s in store. Barack Obama said he had -a problem- with men who keep coming up with bogus excuses not to vote for Kamala Harris and leaning into Donald Trump’s macho aggression, in his first appearance on the campaign trail for the Democrats in Pittsburgh yesterday, in the must-win state of Pennsylvania. Expect more events with the former, two-term president. The former president told the crowd: -I’m sorry, gentlemen, I’ve noticed this, especially with some men who seem to think Trump’s behavior of bullying and putting people down is a sign of strength. And I am here to tell you: that is not what real strength is. It never has been. Real strength is about helping people who need it and standing up for those who can’t always stand up for themselves, that is what we should want for our daughters and for our sons, and that is what I want to see a president of the United States of America.- Obama also condemned Trump’s spreading of disinformation about the hurricane, railing against -the idea of intentionally trying to deceive people in their most desperate and vulnerable moments-. He highlighted that lies may discourage some of the people affected from seeking help. Visibly angry, Obama asked: -When did that become OK?- The Democratic governors of three vital battleground states, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, are going to hit the trail together. Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Wisconsin’s Tony Evers plan a midwestern bus tour from next week, called Driving Forward , Whitmer’s Fight Like Hell PAC said and Axios reported this morning. Bill Clinton, who maybe didn’t set the Democratic voting world alight with his lengthy address at the party’s convention in August but is nevertheless always a big name in US politics, is going to Georgia this weekend and then North Carolina, where Trump is marginally ahead in the polls and it’s all hands on deck for the Dems. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’s vice presidential pick, is going to do a TV interview blitz in, where else, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in the coming days, Axios reports. Donald Trump will speak in Aurora, Colorado, this afternoon, a state that’s confidently Democratic these days, but the former president plans to slam it to migrants and asylum seekers again, planning to make claims about Venezuelans and crime levels. This comes after Trump again used brutal language to undercut United States allies in the NATO alliance, saying -we will not protect you- from Russia if they don’t spend as much as they should on paper on their militaries. Trump was speaking in Detroit.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/11/trump-harris-us-elections-obama-latest-updates	2024-10-11T06:52:19-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2188705ff365877450174261cdfdf97e937c983/0_60_7929_4758/master/7929.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=211f67acc154276e6af9354cf07acda7

Hurricane Milton recovery resumes as Republicans stir up political storm	Sixteen people killed by storm but state spared ‘worst-case scenario’ as accusations fly between political candidates Authorities are urgently assessing the cost of Hurricane Milton after the deadly storm spawned tornadoes ahead of slamming into central Florida and then tearing across the state, leaving destroyed homes, streets blocked with downed power lines, fallen trees and debris. At least 16 people have been killed by the storm, according to the Tampa Bay Times and recovery efforts continue, meaning the numbers could rise.

It isn’t just young people who are finding it hard to concentrate on books. In July, the UK charity The Reading Agency found that only half of UK adults now read regularly for pleasure.

And was the navigator who changed the course of world history really from Genoa – as history has long claimed – or was he actually Basque, Catalan, Galician, Greek, Jewish or Portuguese?

First Thing: Death toll climbs as Florida grieves Hurricane Milton’s destruction	At least 10 people have died. Plus, a deadly day of Israeli strikes in Gaza and Lebanon Good morning. The death toll from Hurricane Milton climbed to at least 10 on Thursday as Florida continued to assess the damage from the category 3 storm that caused extensive property damage across the state and left more than 3.5m homes and businesses without power. How bad was the storm surge? Although the powerful storm surge authorities predicted before Milton’s arrival was not as bad as projected, in some areas, such as parts of Sarasota county, a storm surge of 2.4-3 metres (8-10ft) was recorded. What is the role of global heating? It is always complicated when discussing specific weather events. But the burning of fossil fuels has made storms as severe as this month’s Hurricane Helene about 2.5 times more likely than they were in the preindustrial age, scientists at the World Weather Attribution group said. What did Joe Biden say? The president attacked lies and misinformation when asked if he had spoken to Donald Trump, who falsely claimed disaster relief funds were redirected to migrants. -Former President Trump, get a life, man,- Biden said.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/11/first-thing-death-toll-climbs-as-florida-grieves-hurricane-miltons-destruction	2024-10-11T03:04:55-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e62aff4ab7f17bf7e312fc56e9e1d2a8c6df5ef3/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ee555a4bd451b93cfce7689e2a6b72d2

The Middle East and the US election: how they could affect each other	Benjamin Netanyahu has humiliated Biden’s America and seems to anticipate Trump’s return, but would that be so good for Israel? The year since the 7 October attack has demonstrated just how densely intertwined US presidential politics is with the trajectory of events in the Middle East. Each exerts a gravitational pull on the other, often in ways that are damaging for both. Foreign policy rarely matters much in US presidential elections, but this year could be an exception. In a contest likely to be decided by small margins in a handful of states, the fallout from the conflicts in Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon, with a potential war with Iran looming, could have a significant impact on Kamala Harris’s prospects.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/11/the-middle-east-and-the-us-election-how-they-could-affect-each-other	2024-10-11T03:00:51-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a77a1745cea9ffb98e489c3f2fc204b41203c63/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cef7d15bf0d65f842356b126590ef20e

Tories would have to support ECHR withdrawal ‘to serve in my shadow cabinet’, says Jenrick – UK politics live	Conservative leadership hopeful’s plan could lead to many senior Tories refusing to serve on the frontbench In his interview on the Today programme this morning Robert Jenrick, who has been running on a rightwing in the Tory leadership contest, denied telling MPs in private that, if elected leader, he would flip back to the centre. But he also refused to accept the premise of the question, and so it was not entirely clear what he meant. Justin Webb, the presenter, asked him about a report in the i suggesting that Jenrick’s rightwing stance is just tactical. The story says -senior Tories have cast major doubts over the chances of Kemi Badenoch or Robert Jenrick leading the Conservatives into the next election amid growing fears over party unity- and it includes this quote. Some moderates hope the candidates will tack back to the centre ground, should they succeed in convincing the Tory party membership to elect them. One member of the Shadow Cabinet said they had assurances Jenrick would rein in his right-wing polemic if elected party leader. -He has promised me he will turn to the centre,- they said. -I suspect he has told other people the same.- I don’t know where that quote comes from, and I wouldn’t believe everything that you read in the papers. I haven’t said that, no. But let me just address the broader point that it raises. Because there are those who say that the Conservative party, were I to lead it, is going to shift to the right. I actually don’t see these labels as at all relevant. What I want to see is the Conservative party occupy what I describe as the common ground of British politics. The reason that I believe we should leave the European convention on human rights is not an ideological one. I came to this view through the practical experience I had as a minister, in particular at the Home Office, where I saw that we as a country were not able to do the most basic duty of the state, which is to secure our borders. We weren’t able to remove dangerous criminals from the country. We weren’t able to remove terror suspects from the country, and we certainly weren’t able to set up a robust but important and credible deterrent, such as the Rwanda one, because of our continued membership with the ECHR. It would be one of the stable of Conservative policies, so yes, we would go into the next election with it in our manifesto. I believe it’s very important that we do this … I’ve already said to James, who is a friend, someone I respect enormously, that I would be delighted for him to serve in the shadow cabinet should he want to do so. I don’t think the point of difference is as big as perhaps you suggest it is. There is now a consensus within the Conservative party that the ECHR is not working in the interests of the British people, for all the reasons that I’ve just described. Most people now are saying that, at a bare minimum, we need to reform the ECHR.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/11/tory-leadership-echr-withdrawal-robert-jenrick-kemi-badenoch-keir-starmer-labour-devolution-uk-politics-latest-news	2024-10-11T01:53:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e26cb811a465ba6b292904171da96d4483f474f/0_19_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=add2bf880e34d793f5e44113bf341d01

Middle East crisis live: EU chief says Israel firing on peacekeepers ‘not acceptable’; UN says personnel in Lebanon ‘increasingly in jeopardy’	Operational activity of Unifil peacekeepers has virtually come to a halt, UN official tells security council Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. The safety and security of UN peacekeepers in Lebanon are -increasingly in jeopardy- and operational activities have virtually come to a halt since since 23 September, UN peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix told the security council on Thursday evening. At least 22 people were killed and more than 100 others injured after Israeli airstrikes hit residential areas of central Beirut on Thursday evening. The strikes hit the working-class district of Basta and the Nweiri neighbourhood, the deadliest attacks to target central Beirut since Israel intensified its bombardment campaign on the country two weeks ago. Hezbollah’s Al Manar TV reported that the strikes were an attempt to assassinate Wafiq Safa, a top security official with the group, which it said had failed. At least 28 people, including women and children, have been killed after an Israeli airstrike hit a school sheltering displaced people in central Gaza on Thursday morning. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said it had responded to 27 fatalities and 54 injuries after the strike on the school turned shelter in Deir al-Balah. The Israeli military said it targeted militants who were operating in the compound. The Israeli military continued to push on with an offensive that began six days ago, when it sent its troops into Jabaliya, the largest of Gaza’s eight historic refugee camps and the nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya. Palestinian health officials say at least 130 people have been killed so far in the operation, which Israel says is aimed at preventing Hamas from regrouping. The military has told residents to evacuate an area in which the UN estimates more than 400,000 people are trapped. Three hospitals in northern Gaza – Indonesian, Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan hospitals – have been ordered by Israeli forces to evacuate, putting patients’ lives at risk, medics say. The director of Kamal Adwan hospital n northern Gaza said eight patients, mostly children, were at risk inside the intensive care units should the Israeli army force them to evacuate. Israeli bombardment near Kamal Adwan hospital has already caused some damage to the facility, medics said. Officials said they know of many fatalities lying on the roads outside the hospital because of Israeli fire. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, said some Unrwa shelters and services were being forced to shut down for the first time since the war began and that with almost no basic supplies available, hunger was spreading again in northern Gaza, amid witness accounts of bodies lying uncollected in the streets because of the renewed fighting.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/11/middle-east-crisis-live-eu-israel-iran-lebanon-blog-news-updates-hezbollah-hamas-unifil	2024-10-10T22:22:11-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc484b3053a70af4eff38aefdf6b9b08f17b4d44/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=57a10a93ed7c7a696036eeca160cf422

The bang-your-fists-on-the-table motif at the heart of this earworm of a ditty – whose title means -Goodbye, beautiful- – may indeed sound like something cooed through dry fog by a spandex-clad blond at the European song contest.

Hurricane Milton slams into Florida as nearly 3 million without power | First Thing	Joe Biden describes it as the ‘storm of the century.’ Plus, US urges Israel to urgently address ‘catastrophic’ Gaza conditions Good morning. A weakening but still tremendously powerful Hurricane Milton slammed into Florida’s west coast on Wednesday night as a category 3 storm, leaving nearly 3 million homes without power, while bringing -catastrophic- winds likely to cause significant property damage. What do we know about the impact so far? Nearly 3 million homes and businesses in Florida were without power. St Petersburg has had 16 inches of rain since the storm began, half of which fell in just two hours. What is a storm surge? As a hurricane approaches a coast, the churning winds force ocean water up on to land; atmospheric pressure from the storm also helps squeeze the water ashore. Water is heavy, and it can move fast in a surge, sweeping people to their deaths, throwing boats and vehicles, and pulverising structures. This is a developing story.

Louisiana diocese prepares to file for bankruptcy over clergy abuse claims	Alexandria diocese plans to file ‘prearranged chapter 11’ after settlement with victims to avoid ‘lengthy delays’ A Roman Catholic diocese in north-west Louisiana appears ready to join 40 other organizations of its kind in the US by filing for federal bankruptcy protection as the church’s worldwide clergy molestation scandal continues reverberating, according to a letter obtained by the Guardian. But the diocese in question – that of Alexandria, Louisiana – is first aiming to reach a global settlement with those who already have pending clergy abuse claims demanding damages from the institution before it then files what it called a -prearranged chapter 11- financial reorganization. As the letter authored by local attorneys for the Alexandria church put it, the purpose of the strategy is to avoid -the lengthy delays and huge professional fees- incurred by the May 2020 bankruptcy filed by Louisiana’s archdiocese of New Orleans.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/10/louisiana-diocese-bankruptcy-clergy-abuse-settlement	2024-10-10T03:00:17-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b261e9bcfecc510212ff75eeb16ea2b8f60a774/0_240_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=47156ee7b84c74113c22dc708ecba49e

Minister strongly rejects claim from business lobby ‘chaotic’ workers bill will cost jobs – UK politics live	Labour promised employment rights bill within first 100 days in office Good morning. During the election campaign Labour promised to produce an employment rights bill within its first 100 days in office. The anniversary is on Saturday, and, just in time for the deadline, the bill is being published today. It is hugely important to the trade unions, who provide the institutional backbone to the Labour party, and, as Jessica Elgot reports in her overnight story, millions of workers will gain new rights as a result. The government claims the scope of the reform is huge – 9 million people will gain new rights against unfair dismissal, more than 1 million low-paid workers on zero hours will have the right to job security on a new contract, an extra 30,000 parents will gain new rights to paternity leave, and 1.5 million will be newly entitled to unpaid parental leave. Ministers also believe the bill will help at least 1.7 million people into the labour market who are not working because of family commitments – and who would benefit from new policies on flexible working and parental leave.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/10/labour-workers-bill-jobs-keir-starmer-tory-party-leadership-jenrick-badenoch-uk-politics-live	2024-10-10T01:31:36-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a846a541773667065d3972cd4f8bc2d4bc6951f/0_217_5413_3248/master/5413.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=935d971692845d3c1411c6400ff4cb6f

The scramble to flee Florida ahead of Hurricane Milton | First Thing	Floridians are clogging interstates in an effort to escape the path of Hurricane Milton as it intensifies in strength. Plus: the Afghan women holding the Taliban accountable Good morning. Hurricane Milton is barrelling toward Florida’s west coast and is expected to make landfall as early as Wednesday night. An estimated 6 million people across 11 counties in Florida are now under mandatory evacuation orders, with time running out to make preparations. -If you choose to stay … you are going to die,- said Tampa mayor Jane Castor. How bad is Milton predicted to be? In barely a day, Milton went from a tropical storm to a category 5 hurricane, the strongest possible rating, with its winds hitting 180mph. Milton has the potential to become -one of the most destructive hurricanes on record for west-central Florida-, the National Hurricane Center said. What are the hardships facing those evacuating? For some, fleeing home to avoid a disaster is simply not possible. The Federal Reserve has estimated that nearly 40% of Americans would not be able to cover a $400 emergency expense in cash, while a 2021 study found that people who evacuated from the Texas Coastal Bend during Hurricane Harvey spent about $1,200 on average on evacuating – more if they had to stay in hotels. What have local officials done to ease evacuation efforts? Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, lifted tolls on major highways and ordered breakdown lanes open but traffic levels were still above 150% of normal, with accidents blocking some routes. -Unfortunately every storm we see traffic fatalities because people wait until the last minute to leave,- Florida’s transportation secretary, Jared Perdue, said. How has Trump responded to the allegations? Steven Cheung, Trump’s communications director, said: -None of these madeup stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man … clearly upset because President Trump is successfully suing him because of the unauthorized publishing of recordings he made previously.-	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/09/first-thing-the-scramble-to-flee-florida-ahead-of-hurricane-milton	2024-10-09T04:58:20-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4fa3edea503cb11b43a3b4ac01a01dd985dfbaa/0_167_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7f4ae7daea851566f3c1e146169c1873

Cannabis is now legal in many US states – but can the smell get you in trouble?	Parts of the country are starting to treat cannabis like alcohol when it comes to policing intoxicated driving As states around the country continue to legalize recreational and/or medical cannabis use, more are beginning to treat cannabis like alcohol when it comes to policing intoxicated driving. A recent unanimous decision by the Illinois supreme court found that the smell of burnt cannabis alone does not give police license to conduct a warrantless vehicle search, making it the sixth state supreme court to make such a ruling. In contrast, Wisconsin’s supreme court, ruled the opposite just last year. They found that cannabis odor in a vehicle is probable cause to justify a search (unlike in Illinois, adult recreational cannabis is still illegal in Wisconsin).	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/09/dui-cannabis-vehicle-search	2024-10-09T04:00:13-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d39332f618216a65e65a27a554d660a937a3a2c5/0_141_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=33ea58a2222631e5969c24394e256174
US emergency crews struggle as climate crisis fuels ‘unprecedented’ competing disasters	Resources are stretched thin as the south-east grapples with hurricanes and the west swelters in high temperatures It’s been a brutal week in weather-related disasters across the US. Large parts of the south-east are still grappling with the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene, and another potentially catastrophic storm is barreling towards Florida. At the same time, much of the west has been sweltering amid scorching temperatures, which have elevated fire risks and fueled extreme fire behavior. Hurricanes and fires aren’t abnormal in early autumn. But the climate crisis has turned up the dial and created more opportunities for catastrophes to overlap, ultimately adding strain on relief resources, emergency response, and those who have been impacted by the dangerous and destructive events.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/09/hurricanes-wildfires-climate-crisis	2024-10-09T04:00:12-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4ff237eed8731ba24697d9358481704089cd6c2/0_144_7185_4310/master/7185.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5f4823250296d99e3c6c510b977c8cbe

According to the nonpartisan campaign analysis group Cook Political Report, the race between Hovde and Baldwin – in which Baldwin previously enjoyed an ample lead – is now a toss-up.

Tory MPs to choose final two leadership candidates for members’ ballot – UK politics live	Robert Jenrick, the bookmakers’ favourite prior to the Tory conference, has implied he is victim of ‘horse trading’ Good morning. Keir Starmer is taking PMQs today, for the first time since the conference season recess and the internal No 10 reshuffle that saw his chief of staff, Sue Gray, in effect sacked. But there may be even more interest in what Bob Blackman, chair of the Conservative 1922 Committee, has to say at 3.30pm, when he announces the names of the two Tory leadership candidates who will go to the ballot of members. One of them is about 99.999% certain to be James Cleverly. The other will be either Kemi Badenoch or Robert Jenrick. They are both candidates for the Tory right, but Badenoch is a lifelong, conviction rightwinger, very popular with Tory members, while Jenrick is someone elected to parliament as a Cameroon moderniser who says he has been radicalised into favouring ECHR withdrawal by his experience in a Home Office unable to control irregular migration. There’s always horse trading, OK, in the final stages …. I’ve been around long enough to know that in the last few votes in these leadership contests there’s always people moving around votes and so on.

She is not the first outsider who found it impossible to gel with Starmer’s close-knit and fiercely political team who ran his leadership campaign and who worked on Labour’s election strategy.

Shasta county battles rising homelessness and high suicide rates, but its political agenda is focused on remaking the voting system – can the damage be undone? This is the second of three stories on the run-up to the 2024 US presidential election in Shasta county, a region of 180,000 people in northern California that has emerged as a center of the election denial movement and hotbed for far-right politics.

Biden sets 10-year deadline for US cities to replace lead pipes	President to announce in Wisconsin EPA rule aimed at ensuring drinking water is safe for all Americans A decade after the Flint, Michigan, water crisis raised alarms about the continuing dangers of lead in tap water, Joe Biden is setting a 10-year deadline for cities across the nation to replace their lead pipes, finalizing an aggressive approach aimed at ensuring that drinking water is safe for all Americans. The president is expected to announce the final Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule Tuesday in the swing state of Wisconsin during the final month of a tight presidential campaign. The announcement highlights an issue – safe drinking water – that Kamala Harris has prioritized as vice-president and during her presidential campaign. The new rule supplants a looser standard set by former President Donald Trump’s administration that did not include a universal requirement to replace lead pipes.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/biden-lead-pipes-drinking-water	2024-10-08T05:09:55-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/854a9b6615b6b7ee62e224d29d961bf5b6f248a7/0_51_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=268e3010c66ef77dd06039c7c2968356
Hurricane Milton barrels toward Florida as Trump spreads falsehoods | First Thing	A top emergency official says lies spread by Donald Trump and his supporters about Hurricane Helene have hampered recovery efforts. Plus: how to combat food waste Good morning. Hurricane Milton is expected to sweep past Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula and hit the south-west coast of Florida by Wednesday evening local time, bringing sustained winds of nearly 155mph (250km/h) to an area already reeling from Hurricane Helene’s devastation 12 days ago. Almost all of Florida’s west coast was under a hurricane warning and more than a million people were told to evacuate. How has the Fema chief responded to Trump’s falsehoods? Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, have accused the Biden administration of -abandoning- people and, baselessly, of being short of disaster relief funds due to money spent on undocumented migrants. (Fema’s housing program, which offers shelter to migrants leaving detention, is separate from its disaster relief program.) Deanne Criswell, the Fema administrator, said these falsehoods were -creating an impedance to our ability to actually get people the help they need-. What else is the right saying about the hurricanes? The far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has been criticised for spreading false conspiracy theories that -they can control the weather-. Though she never specified who she meant by -they-, she has a history of promoting untrue conspiracy theories around the federal government, her political opponents and Jews. What will happen to disaster relief if Trump is elected? Experts say that under the controversial rightwing Project 2025 manifesto, which was authored by numerous former Trump officials, federal forecasting of severe storms and aid given to shattered towns and cities would be drastically scaled back. What else did Harris say? She vowed to raise taxes on billionaires and the biggest corporations in order to fund her economic proposals, which include plans to build millions of new housing units, tax breaks for new parents and $25,000 down-payment assistance for new homebuyers. Will Trump sit down with 60 Minutes? The CBS correspondent Scott Pelley told the audience that Trump cancelled an interview last week, with the Trump campaign providing -shifting explanations- for why the Republican nominee had declined to participate, including that he did not want to be factchecked. What do the polls say? Harris has a narrow lead over Trump in national polls, though the race is in effect neck and neck in the swing states that will decide the election.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/first-thing-hurricane-milton-barrels-toward-florida-trump-falsehoods	2024-10-08T05:06:19-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b940c70a5fd84623b628a5a2b1adb7bef90fe28/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=54d7ca3e6ba380cd88912e0456c369b5

US supreme court to hear arguments in major ‘ghost guns’ case	Garland v VanDerStok first in series of high-profile cases justices will hear in what is set to be contentious term The US supreme court will hear arguments in a case involving the regulation of -ghost guns- – firearms without serial numbers that are built from kits that people can order online and assemble at home. Garland v VanDerStok is the first in a series of high-profile arguments the court will hear in what is likely to be a contentious term. As ghost guns were increasingly used in crimes – including 1,200 homicides and attempted homicides between 2016 and 2022, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms – the Biden administration issued new rules regulating them in 2022. The new ATF rule classified ghost gun kits as firearms under the Gun Control Act of 1968, the US’s main firearms law – making them subject to the same regulations as all other guns.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/us-supreme-court-ghost-guns	2024-10-08T04:00:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bae31897cede8eabda1c4aa79518c2c7be8c22bf/0_161_7329_4397/master/7329.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5308d050a7e566ebe7be091af1a6fd3f

Labour won’t be able to rely on ethnic minority voters as ‘bloc’ of support in future, says major report – UK politics live	Thinktank UK in a Changing Europe has publishes major report on attitudes and voting behaviours of ethnic minority Britons Good morning. Labour has already been in office for almost 100 days, but in some respects it still feels like we’re at the start of a new political season. This morning Keir Starmer is chairing his first cabinet since Morgan McSweeeney replaced Sue Gray as the key aide in No 10 (a move which could have radical implications, as Pippa Crerar reports here), this afternoon Tory MPs are holding another ballot to elect their next leader, and, with the conference recess over, MPs are getting down to a busy three months of parliamentary business, with the budget only three weeks away tomorrow. Labour won a big majority at the election, but the big story of politics in recent years is the fragementation of the electorate, and this morning the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe has published a major report on the attitudes and voting behaviours of ethnic minority Britons. For anyone interested in this topic, it has lots of very good data, but two findings in particular stand out. Labour will not be able to rely on ethnic minority voters as a ‘bloc’ of support in the future, the report says. In his introduction James Kanagasooriam, the pollster from Focaldata who produced the data used in the report, says that it is still the case that, overall, ethnic minority Britons are much more likely to vote left than right than white Britons. He says: At the 2024 election, the combined vote share of Labour, the Greens and the Liberal Democrats was 66% among ethnic minorities, while that for the Conservatives and Reform UK was 26%. Among white voters, the equivalent figures were 53% and 41%. Any discussion over Labour’s problems with minority voters and Conservative gains needs to be tempered by these facts. At future elections, Labour cannot rely on ethnic minority voters as a ‘bloc’ of support. It is true that the Labour Party still convinces a far greater proportion of minorities with ‘warm’ views of the party to vote for it than the Conservative Party does. But among many ethnic groups, there is a fundamental disjunction between opinion on the salient issues of the day and voting patterns. Our polling suggests that Labour support among ethnic minorities is an ossified cultural and historical legacy that could disappear very quickly. Having a degree makes white voters more leftwing, but ethnic minority voters more leftwing, the report says. In his introduction Kanagasooriam describes this as the Lee Anderson-Rishi Sunak factor in Tory support. He explains: The demography of right and left is vastly different between white and non-white voters. White voters differ hugely on their educational profile, with non-graduates drifting right over the last 20 years, and graduates to the left. Amongst non-white Britons, graduate level education makes you proportionately more likely to be Conservative. Class cleavages and patterns that have disappeared from the voting patterns of white Britons exist and are indeed getting stronger amongst non-white voters. The Conservative Party will continue to have its esoteric coalition of affluent minorities and nongraduate whites and Labour the opposite. In other words, the Lee Anderson - Rishi Sunak spectrum is a feature, not a bug, of right-wing politics.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/08/labour-keir-starmer-tory-leadership-latest-politics-live-news	2024-10-08T01:17:28-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f312e371cdc8462f0af463e5817b68c979efe8d/0_267_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8a2b7d6f071c621adeadd89c354e0adc

‘Democracy should not be monetised’: unions revolt against Chris Minns’ plan to ban protests based on cost	Union leaders criticise NSW premier’s comments advocating police power to prohibit rallies deemed too expensive to patrol The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, is facing a revolt from union leaders after he said police should be able to ban protests if the force decided it was too expensive to patrol them. Minns on Tuesday said police had the grounds to reject a -form 1- application – which protest organisers are required to submit in advance in order to lawfully stage a demonstration in NSW – based on the cost to the force of policing the event.
