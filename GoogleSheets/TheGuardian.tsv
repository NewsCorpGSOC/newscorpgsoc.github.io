Australia accused of ‘exporting climate destruction’ on tiny Pacific neighbours with massive gas expansion plans	Labor government ‘not acting in good faith’ when it stands on global stage and promotes its climate credentials, special envoy at Cop29 says Pacific governments at a UN climate summit are criticising Australia’s plans for a massive gas industry expansion in Western Australia, saying it could result in 125 times more greenhouse gas emissions than their island nations release in a year. As the Cop29 summit in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku begins its second week, representatives from Vanuatu and Tuvalu have called on Australia to stop approving new fossil fuel developments, including a proposal to extend the life of Woodside’s North West Shelf gas facility until 2070.

Russia’s latest attack on Ukraine shows maximalist war aims remain unchanged	As President-Elect Trump talks up negotiations, Putin has made clear his position hasn’t changed since launching invasion in 2022 Millions of Ukrainians woke up early on Sunday morning to a massive Russian missile and drone attack on their country’s infrastructure, the biggest assault from Moscow since the end of August and the first large-scale attack since the US election. Donald Trump once promised to settle the Ukraine war in -24 hours- but the 120 missiles and 90 drones aimed at the nation’s utilities is a reminder that Moscow’s maximalist aspirations to cow and subjugate its neighbour remains unchanged.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/17/russias-latest-attack-on-ukraine-shows-maximalist-war-aims-remain-unchanged	2024-11-17T10:04:24-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c71effb55619847d02396a12fdb1779c3131bbf/0_133_2000_1201/master/2000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c0347d63d012751e9cab1a6d0730eaee

Experts sound alarm as Trump mulls pardons for January 6 attackers	Attorneys and lawmakers who oppose pardons for Capito rioters would not be able to stop him, legal analysts warn lf Donald Trump follows through on his promise to pardon people who participated in the January 6 riot at the US Capitol, attorneys and lawmakers who oppose such moves would not be able to stop him, according to legal experts. If Trump does issue the pardons, it could indicate to many of his supporters that there was nothing illegal about the riot to prevent the peaceful transfer of power, and would undermine the US constitution, the experts said.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/17/trump-pardon-january-6-rioters	2024-11-17T07:00:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e91830d0ba5b74f4388548b6ea43e7cb4c1e7ca3/0_287_4328_2598/master/4328.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f9b5c53db6f73a34ebb7a3ee520df063
Will Melania be living in the White House for Trump’s second term? Probably not	Incoming first lady is planning to split her time between New York and Florida during her husband’s presidency Melania Trump will probably not be returning to the White House for the next four years with her husband, multiple sources told CNN this week, but rather will be splitting her time between Palm Beach, Florida, and New York City, where Barron is going to college. For many observers it is unclear who might be more relieved by that decision: Melania, who famously did not love her life in DC the first time around, or the White House itself, where Trump’s wife once expressed her discontent by filling the halls with blood-red Christmas trees and destroying the historically beloved Rose Garden.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/17/melania-trump-white-house	2024-11-17T07:00:11-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c63d363ccdd2678b6e33cf056ac7780c84968100/52_0_5542_3326/master/5542.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c90eb314fd71ef04a498a1181c1387b9

In a move designed to taper the phase-out of cash and ensure those who rely on it can still use it for the near future, the federal government will require certain businesses to take cash payments.

After decades, tiny 500-year-old royal portrait is identified as Mary Tudor	Art historian says miniature is of Henry VIII’s daughter – not his sixth wife Katherine Parr It’s Mary Tudor – by a nose. Not in a horse race, but from a comparison of portraits of Mary, Henry VIII’s elder daughter who became the first crowned queen of England, and Katherine Parr, his sixth wife. For decades, experts, including the noted historian and museum director Sir Roy Strong, have thought that a near 500-year-old miniature was of Parr. Now several leading Tudor authorities are convinced it is Mary, often dubbed -Bloody Mary- because as an ardent Catholic queen she ordered the killing of many Protestants.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/17/after-decades-tiny-500-year-old-royal-portrait-is-identified-as-mary-tudor	2024-11-17T06:00:12-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6f96b7cb950b502e077d10f33ee673c2051cef9/0_1215_3694_2216/master/3694.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9ca5246b3274a6ad6d6ed46eb2cd0ee5

Guardian Australia called and messaged several wellness clinics and individuals operating out of their homes throughout New South Wales and Queensland, confirming that businesses are offering -collarium- treatments with rates starting at $25 for 20 minutes of use. Some of these businesses did not explicitly advertise collariums on their social media pages or websites but did offer collarium bookings over the phone.

Middle East crisis live: Israel strike kills Hezbollah lead spokesperson in Beirut	Mohammed Afif killed in first Israeli airstrike on central Beirut in more than a month, official says William Christou reports for the Guardian from Beirut on the strike by Israeli forces on a Ba’ath party center in Ras al-Nabaa, central Beirut, on Sunday afternoon, the first strike on central Beirut in over a month: The attack on the busy residential neighbourhood came without warning, and appeared to cause damage to neighbouring buildings. The strike comes as Israel intensifies its airstrikes across Lebanon as Lebanese officials prepare to give their response to an Israeli ceasefire proposal on Monday. The Israeli military issued a series of evacuation warnings on Saturday and Sunday for Dahiyeh, the southern suburbs of Beirut, striking over a dozen targets in bombings heard across the capital city. Afif had been especially visible after Israel’s military escalation in September and following the assassination of longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was also killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israeli warplanes had earlier pounded the southern suburbs of Beirut after the military warned people to evacuate from several buildings. The Hezbollah militant group has a strong presence in the area, known as the Dahiyeh, and the strikes came as Lebanese officials are considering a U.S.-brokered cease-fire proposal.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/17/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-strike-hezbollah-beirut-mohammed-afif	2024-11-17T05:02:06-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e75f797e43810f49802f1205f6b515dd5cb2e0a3/0_8_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a42caf50da27bf375b37a3478a75836f

US political minds will be reminding themselves of this fact as the dust settles on America’s election, with some results showing that a few voters were able to simultaneously support Donald Trump and progressive-leaning Democratic candidates. In the Bronx in New York, a strongly Black, Asian and Latino community, Trump’s support jumped 11 points to 33% over 2020, one of the largest margins citywide.

Swedes left longing for sweets as viral TikTok starts craze for candy	The tradition of chomping through a kilo of sweets once a week is under threat as demand soars for sugary sweets Swedes love sweets. So when an American TikToker sparked a craze for Swedish candy this year, there was pride that an important part of national culture was being recognised around the world. The Danes may have Ozempic but the Swedes have lördagsgodis – Saturday sweets – where families chew through more than 1kg of sticky treats in an evening. That pride has given way to some irritation. Supplies of some Swedish sweets ran dry in the autumn due to the high demand in the US, South Korea and in Scandinavia. And there was another factor, an equally important Swedish tradition: the six-week summer holiday.	https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/17/swedes-left-longing-for-sweets-as-viral-tiktok-starts-craze-for-candy	2024-11-17T04:00:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4317c6b59ad3f3fae6a6661c2656bac9eef6a81c/0_174_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b3ca10e375a8eb3182b2c13cc13f9160

Oxford relying on ‘Deliveroo-style’ contracts with most tutorials not taught by full-time staff	Leading university accused of relying on young academics employed on gig-economy terms Oxford University has been accused of relying on academics on -Deliveroo-style- and precarious fixed-term contracts to give the majority of its tutorials, after new research revealed just a third of lessons are taught by full-time professors. Data obtained through freedom of information requests by the University and College Union and shared exclusively with the Observer, reveals that about 61% of core tutorial teaching is done by academics on fixed-term contracts or in hourly-paid roles. The union says that pay is based mainly on contact hours with students, but once preparation, marking and supporting students is taken into account, this often falls below the minimum wage in real terms.	https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/nov/16/oxford-deliveroo-contracts-tutorials-full-time-staff-gig-economy	2024-11-16T02:06:14-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f520e67a90e90872f710fabddb5aeda3821fb480/0_112_5243_3146/master/5243.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1df48524d00e4e45763ac8c050f97fff

Ukraine war briefing: Zelenskyy says war will ‘end sooner’ once Trump enters White House	US president-elect says the war has ‘got to stop’ as German chancellor urges Putin to start talks with Kyiv in rare phone call. What we know on day 997 Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Russia’s war against his country will -end sooner- than it otherwise would have once Donald Trump becomes US president next year. In a radio interview aired on Saturday, the Ukrainian president conceded that the battlefield situation in eastern Ukraine was difficult and Russia was making advances. He said his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, was not interested in agreeing to a peace deal. Zelenskyy criticised a phone call between the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and Putin, saying it opened a -Pandora’s box- by undermining efforts to isolate the Russian leader. -Now there may be other conversations, other calls. Just a lot of words,- Zelenskyy said in his evening address on Friday. -And this is exactly what Putin has long wanted: it is extremely important for him to weaken his isolation and to conduct ordinary negotiations.- According to Reuters, Zelenskyy and other European officials had cautioned Scholz against the move. Scholz said Donald Trump privately held -a more nuanced position than is often assumed- on Ukraine. Trump’s reelection in last week’s US presidential vote has raised concerns he could withdraw Washington’s significant support for Ukraine once back in the White House. Scholz, who spoke to Trump by phone on Sunday, told the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on Friday his call with the president-elect was -perhaps surprisingly, a very detailed and good conversation-. Asked by the paper whether Trump would make a deal over the head of the Ukrainians, Scholz said Trump gave -no indication- that he would. Germany, for its part, would not accept a -peace by diktat-, Scholz said. Scholz urged Putin to pull Russian forces out of Ukraine and begin talks with Kyiv that would open the way for a -just and lasting peace-, in the first phone conversation between the two leaders in nearly two years. The Kremlin said the conversation on Friday had come at Berlin’s request, and that Putin had told Scholz any agreement to end the war in Ukraine must take Russian security interests into account and reflect -new territorial realities-. A German government spokesperson said Scholz -stressed Germany’s unbroken determination to back Ukraine in its defence against Russian aggression for as long as necessary-. Russian air defence units intercepted a series of Ukrainian drones in several Russian regions, officials said, many of them in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops launched a major incursion in August. Russia’s defence ministry said air defences downed 15 drones in Kursk region on the Ukrainian border. It said units downed one drone each in Bryansk region, also on the border, and in Lipetsk region, farther north. The ministry said one drone was downed in central Oryol region. And the governor of Belgorod region, a frequent target on the Ukrainian border, said a series of attacks had smashed windows in an apartment building and caused other damage, but no casualties were reported. Russia will suspend gas deliveries to Austria via Ukraine on Saturday. Russia’s gas export route to Europe via Ukraine is set to shut at the end of this year. Ukraine has said it will not extend the transit agreement with Russian state-owned Gazprom in order to deprive Russia of profits that Kyiv says help to finance the war against it. The Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, said Gazprom’s notice of ending supplies was long expected and Austria has made preparations, but the Ukrainian foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Russia’s action showed it -once again uses energy as a weapon-. Russia’s leading tanker group, Sovcomflot, said on Friday that western sanctions on Russian oil tankers were limiting its financial performance, as it reported falling revenues and core earnings. The US imposed sanctions on Sovcomflot in February, part of Washington’s efforts to reduce Russia’s revenues from oil sales that it can use to finance its war in Ukraine. Sovcomflot reported a 22.2% year-on-year drop in nine-month revenue to $1.22bn and said its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation slumped by 31.5% to $861m.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/16/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskyy-says-war-will-end-sooner-once-trump-enters-white-house	2024-11-16T00:56:56-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ee334bbe0de648585a49307ad8ebf5b2a74018c/0_0_3435_2060/master/3435.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c8d599474cca4d017bcd8fbebd0e52b0
Middle East crisis live: Israel strikes Beirut after evacuation call	Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said ‘the enemy’ carried out three air raids, including one near Haret Hreik Here is the tweet from the IDF’s Arabic spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, calling for the evacuation of southern Beirut’s Haret Hreik neighbourhood a couple of hours ago. -To all residents in the southern suburb area, specifically in the buildings specified in the attached maps and the buildings adjacent to them in Haret Hreik … You are located near Hezbollah facilities and interests, against which the IDF will act forcefully in the near future,- a translation of the post reads. A senior Hamas official has said the Palestinian militant group is -ready for a ceasefire- in Gaza and urged US president-elect Donald Trump to -pressure- Israel to -end the aggression-. -Hamas is ready to reach a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip if a ceasefire proposal is presented and on the condition that it is respected- by Israel, Hamas political bureau member Bassem Naim said. A UN spokesperson said that aid access in Gaza is at a low point with deliveries to parts of the north of the territory all but impossible. -From our perspective, on all indicators you can possibly think of in a humanitarian response, all of them are going in the wrong direction,- Jens Laerke told a press briefing. An Israeli airstrike flattened a building near one of Beirut’s busiest traffic junctions, Tayouneh. The targeted building was located in an area where the southern suburbs meet other. Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister has asked Iran to help secure a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hezbollah and appeared to urge it to convince the militant group to agree to a deal that could require it to pull back from the Israel-Lebanon border. The prime minister made the comments in talks with Ali Larijani, a top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, AP reported. Twenty-one civil defence rescuers were killed in two Israeli strikes on Lebanon on Thursday, marking one of the deadliest days for rescue workers since the fighting began between Israel and Hezbollah 13 months ago. The airstrikes brought the total number of emergency workers killed by Israel in Lebanon to more than 200. Fifty-nine people were killed in Israeli attacks on Lebanon on Thursday, bringing the total killed since October last year to at least 3,445, with 14,599 wounded, the Lebanese health ministry said in a statement on Friday.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/16/israel-lebanon-gaza-war-middle-east-hamas-hezbollah-latest	2024-11-16T00:41:24-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94fcacece6a50d26f1c905e53aeb21bdb9e1ad88/0_198_4464_2678/master/4464.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5b5630fd077d6c2f33d771655f6b3c7a

First Thing: RFK Jr condemned as ‘clear and present danger’ after Trump nomination	Experts warn making the anti-vaccine activist health secretary ‘is going to cost lives’. Plus, Paul Mescal interviews Ridley Scott Good morning. Donald Trump’s nomination of the anti-vaccine activist and conspiracy theorist Robert F Kennedy Jr as US secretary of health and human services has been decried by consumer advocacy groups, public health experts and pundits across the political divide, who say his appointment will cost lives. What happened in Samoa? Kennedy and his anti-vaccine nonprofit, Children’s Health Defense, reportedly spread anti-vaccine falsehoods in Samoa after its government had temporarily suspended its MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination program owing to the death of two babies because nurses had wrongly prepared doses. A year later, a measles outbreak killed 83. Kennedy denies responsibility. What is the controversy surrounding host countries? Azerbaijan is a large-scale fossil fuel producer. One of its government organizing members was also recently filmed appearing to offer help with fossil fuel deals. Is this new? No. Last year’s summit was also held in a petrostate, the United Arab Emirates, while that conference’s president kept his main job of heading the national oil company, Adnoc.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/15/first-thing-rfk-jr-condemned-as-clear-and-present-danger-after-trump-nomination	2024-11-15T03:25:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b742843ecd3ae28186638face98436ced134ee1/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1012ee6b672295036a130a9f71238f75

Trump’s RFK Jr nomination condemned as ‘public health catastrophe’ – US politics live	Widespread criticism of health secretary role for anti-vaccine activist and purveyor of debunked conspiracy theories Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news from Washington over the next few hours. We start with the news that Donald Trump’s nomination of Robert F Kennedy Jr as US secretary of health and human services has prompted widespread criticisms towards Kennedy, an anti-vaccine activist who has embraced a slew of other debunked health-related conspiracy theories. The FBI should investigate both Gaetz and Tulsi Gabbard before they are confirmed for their cabinet posts, Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton has said. Gabbard, who Trump nominated as director of national intelligence, is known for her tolerant view of Russian president Vladimir Putin and Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Elon Musk reportedly met Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations on Monday, and discussed how to defuse tensions between Iran and the US, two Iranian officials told the New York Times. As Trump prepares to address conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, Musk, the world’s richest man, has been assisting in discussions with foreign officials, establishing himself as the country’s most influential civilian come January. Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are seeking Americans who are -high-IQ small-government revolutionaries- and willing to work over 80 hours a week to join their new department, at zero pay. Trump named Musk to co-lead the newly created government efficiency department that sits outside the federal government. Advocates have urged state governments to find new ways to defend immigrants and block Trump’s mass deportation plan. California shielded many non-citizen residents from removal in Trump’s first term but immigrants rights groups warn an aggressive, multi-pronged response will be needed. A Democratic lawmaker will file a motion specifically mentioning Trump can only serve two terms, after the president-elect joked he would be willing to serve an unconstitutional third term as president while meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday. Trump announced his former Georgia congressman Doug Collins as secretary of veterans affairs. Collins ran for Senate in 2020, finishing third in the primary. He also -provided counsel to Trump in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election as Trump sought to challenge Georgia’s election results-.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/15/donald-trump-rfk-jr-matt-gaetz-us-politics-live	2024-11-15T02:52:13-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/175036941419b4e6ceb17f89e431794e7395420e/0_33_4532_2720/master/4532.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2799fbd25a1f31d855f9c2bd9e5193ef

Reeves ‘not satisfied’ with growth as Tories accuse Labour of talking down economy – UK politics live	UK economy at near-standstill as uncertainty over the budget and high interest rates weighed on consumer spending Chancellor Rachel Reeves has says she is not satisfied with the latest GDP figures, which shadow chancellor Mel Stride also described this morning as -disappointing-. The UK economy slowed to a near-standstill in the third quarter as uncertainty surrounding Labour’s first budget and high interest rates weighed on business and consumer spending. At my budget, I took the difficult choices to fix the foundations and stabilise our public finances. Now we are going to deliver growth through investment and reform to create more jobs and more money in people’s pockets, get the NHS back on its feet, rebuild Britain and secure our borders in a decade of national renewal. I think a lot of that is because this government, on coming to office, talked down the UK economy. And it did that because it always planned to jack up taxes in the way that it has in the budget, and wanted to make out there was a bigger problem than there was. The UK economy slowed to a near-standstill with growth of just 0.1% in the third quarter of the year as uncertainty surrounding Labour’s first budget and high interest rates weighed on business and consumer spending Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: -Improving economic growth is at the heart of everything I am seeking to achieve, which is why I am not satisfied with these numbers- Shadow chancellor Mel Stride has been on the media round, describing the figures, which do partly cover a brief period when his party were still in government, as -disappointing- The Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has urged ministers to -rebuild relations- with the EU, warning that Brexit has undermined the UK’s economy Leading Tories Robert Jenrick and Oliver Dowden were on the committee that backed plans for the -rushed and misjudged- £15m purchase of an asbestos-ridden site for asylum accommodation The Liberal Democrats are campaigning about bus fares in England.

Middle East crisis live: Paramedics reported killed in Israeli attack on Lebanon as IDF orders evacuation of Beirut suburb	Lebanon’s state-run national news agency said the Ghobeiry area ‘witnessed heavy gunfire’ from Israeli forces We are restarting our live coverage of Israel’s wars in Lebanon and Gaza. The Israeli military has ordered residents to immediately evacuate the Beirut southern suburb of Ghobeiry, where it says Hezbollah fighters are located. In Gaza, at least two people were killed and several others injured after an overnight Israeli airstrike hit a residential apartment in the centre of Deir al-Balah, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa. In a separate attack, the outlet reports that two members of the same family – a father and son – were killed in an Israeli missile strike that targeted a home in the village of al-Nasr, northeast of the southern city of Rafah. The Israel Defense Forces said two rockets launched from Lebanon at the Haifa Bay area of Israel were successfully intercepted by air defenses. There were no immediate reports of any injuries. Canada’s foreign minister has expressed deep concern about -catastrophic- humanitarian conditions across Gaza and warned about -the life-threatening levels of acute malnutrition.- The country’s foreign affairs minister, Melanie Joly, cited a 8 November report by the Famine Review Committee that found a strong likelihood that famine is occurring or imminent in areas within the northern Gaza Strip. She said Israel must abide by its obligations under international humanitarian law and provide a significant and sustained increase to humanitarian assistance for Palestinians.

US states urged to find new ways to block Trump’s mass deportation plan	California and other states must mount aggressive, multipronged response to defend immigrants, advocates warn California, home to the largest immigrant population in the US, is bracing for Donald Trump’s plan to enact the -largest deportation operation in American history-, with advocates pushing state leaders to find new and creative ways to disrupt his agenda. The Golden state led the fight against Trump’s first term, shielding many non-citizen residents from removal by restricting local cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

First Thing: Israel accused of crimes against humanity over forced displacement in Gaza	Human Rights Watch says its evidence suggests Israel has committed a war crime against civilians. Plus, Mark Zuckerberg drops a cover of Get Low with T-Pain Good morning. Israel has been accused of crimes against humanity over its use of evacuation orders to pursue the -deliberate and massive forced displacement- of civilians in Gaza, in a new report by Human Rights Watch. How much of Gaza’s population has been displaced? More than 90%, with many civilians forced to move multiple times. What do the Geneva conventions say about displacement? That in occupied territories, civilians must be displaced only in exceptional circumstances – but Israel has used evacuation orders repeatedly. What’s Gaetz’s background? As a member of the Maga-aligned Freedom Caucus in the House, he led the successful charge to oust the former Republican House speaker Kevin McCarthy from his role. Why else might he be controversial? Though charges were never brought, he was investigated by the justice department in a sex-trafficking case involving children, and by the House ethics committee over allegations including sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. He strongly denies wrongdoing.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/14/first-thing-israel-accused-of-crimes-against-humanity-over-forced-displacement-in-gaza	2024-11-14T03:12:55-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64f727ca4a38e9480f9c159fa84a902bae40a10b/0_0_7500_4500/master/7500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=585f7af26393a2ebaca9eda598a445b0

We’re two weeks on from the budget, and from the government’s point of view it seems to have landed quite well.

In the days before the killing of 44-year-old Bobby Smallwood made international news headlines, staffers at Portland’s Legacy Good Samaritan hospital made five separate complaints to administrators against the man later charged with his murder, PoniaX Calles, according to the lawsuit from the victim’s family, which was filed on Tuesday.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/oregon-hospital-security-guard-death	2024-11-13T03:00:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/388e0beffe5400776beb87d2cef6445a3da09864/0_254_3855_2314/master/3855.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dad1b6a114b5f3709bbbfba9bb363e1c
US Congress to hold second hearing on UFOs in attempt to ‘pull back curtain’	House committee’s hearing will have ‘expert witnesses’ to shed light on unidentified anomalous phenomena The United States Congress will hold a hearing on Wednesday to discuss the topic of UFOs that some lawmakers are hopeful will lead to new information on a subject that is the focus of many conspiracy theorists but has also recently attracted serious attention from government officials. The House oversight committee’s hearing will be titled Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.

For months Germany has been hamstrung by the weakness of its squabbling three-way coalition government, leaving allies lamenting that Europe’s most powerful country and largest economy was unable to take big decisions.

Both men, CNN notes, -lead companies with existing, lucrative government contracts.- Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal agencies.

Fox News host Pete Hegseth will serve as secretary of defense, while John Ratcliffe will lead the CIA and William Joseph McGinley will serve as White House counsel Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead a new -Department of Government Efficiency-, which Trump says will not actually be a government agency. They will, according to Trump, work from outside the government to -drive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to government never seen before-.

Streeting defends plan for hospital league tables after backlash – UK politics live	Health secretary says bad managers are NHS’s ‘guilty secret’ in broadcast round ahead of first major speech on health service reform Good morning. Wes Streeting, the health secretary (for England), is giving his first major speech on NHS reform, and there has been almost as much advance pitch-rolling for what he is going to say as you get for a budget. The Department of Health and Social Care has already press released three stories about what Streeting will say, starting on Monday. -Trusts could be banned from using agencies to cover gaps in entry level positions, and agencies could be banned from re-introducing NHS workers that leave permanent jobs,- the DHSC said on Monday, in its first announcement about the reform package. Pay arrangements for NHS trust chief executives will be changed so they are linked to performance, with -no more rewards for failure-, Streeting said in another press release about his plans. -NHS league tables will be introduced to help tackle the NHS crisis-, the DHSC said last night, in a briefing ahead of the speech today. There’s nothing more demoralising than going to work, busting a gut for your patients, and knowing that despite your best efforts you’re letting them down because you’re not given the tools to do the job, and you’re working in a context where … you’ve got poor leadership. On urgent and emergency care, for example, there is a wide variation across NHS performance, ranging from 83% of people in one trust being seen within four hours in type 1 A&amp;Es right down to 38.2%. That’s over 44 percentage points difference.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/13/wes-streeting-nhs-hospital-league-tables-starmer-badenoch-pmqs-uk-politics-live	2024-11-13T00:57:32-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7b22576a7ab771b567f029a78d5a1cc15c2c4f3/0_298_7975_4785/master/7975.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1f0b8faef7c7cefd220877bc8eba2d8d

Middle East crisis live: Aid groups hit out at Israel as US ultimatum over Gaza expires	Humanitarian groups say almost none of the US’s demands that Israel improve conditions in Gaza have been met A coalition of international aid organisations have accused Israel of ignoring a US ultimatum that threatened sanctions if Israel did not implement a series of measures to counter the acute humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The 30-day ultimatum – which was due to expire yesterday or today – was delivered on 13 October, and almost none of its demands have been met, the humanitarian groups say. Donald Trump has chosen the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee as the next US ambassador to Israel. Huckabee has a track record of hardline, occasionally provocative, pro-Israel rhetoric and previously said Israel has a rightful claim to the West Bank, which he refers to by its Hebrew and biblical name of Judea and Samaria. Palestinian medical officials say Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 46 people in the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours, including 11 at a makeshift cafeteria in an Israeli-declared humanitarian zone. In Lebanon, warplanes struck Beirut’s southern suburbs and killed 33 people elsewhere across the country on Tuesday. Large explosions shook Beirut’s southern suburbs – an area known as Dahiyeh, where Hezbollah has a significant presence – soon after the Israeli military issued evacuation warnings for 11 houses there. Lebanese state-run media reported an Israeli strike on an apartment south of the capital Beirut on Wednesday that injured an unspecified number of people. -Israeli warplanes launched a strike at dawn targeting a residential apartment in a building in the Dawhet Aramoun area, injuring people,- the official National News Agency said. International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi will visit Tehran on Wednesday for crucial talks on Iran’s nuclear programme. His visit comes only two days after the Israel defence minister warned that Iran was -more exposed than ever to strikes on its nuclear facilities-. US forces on Tuesday carried out strikes against targets linked to an Iranian-backed militia in Syria in response to a rocket attack on Washington’s troops in the country, the US military said. The strikes targeted the group’s -weapons storage and logistics headquarters facility … in response to a rocket attack on US personnel,- the US Central Command (Centcom) said in a post on social media that did not identify the militia by name. Australia will not change its laws on the supply of weapons or ammunition to Israel if the coalition wins the next federal election, opposition foreign spokesperson Simon Birmingham says. The Liberal senator said the coalition had -no plans- to change the rules, as it emerged during a parliamentary hearing Australia had amended or lapsed at least 16 defence-related export permits to Israel after a review.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/13/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-aid-gaza-us-ultimatum-sanctions-lebanon	2024-11-12T23:59:09-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/967ba583087ccfa06c5daaac090e89b15ee236c9/0_200_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4709b8b5122bf123e48224c1b925f799
The C of E’s CEO: how will history judge Justin Welby’s tenure as archbishop of Canterbury?	Welby worked hard to hold the Anglican church together on many controversial issues, but in the end it was his own failings that led to his downfall In the almost 12 years that Justin Welby has been archbishop of Canterbury, the Church of England has both cemented its place at the heart of the establishment and become less and less relevant to the lives of most citizens. Welby has buried a queen, crowned a king and married a prince. He has offered spiritual counsel to six prime ministers and debated issues of national importance in the House of Lords. He has addressed the nation regularly via the BBC, with Christmas, new year and Easter messages and occasional Thought for the Day broadcasts.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/13/how-will-history-judge-justin-welby-tenure-as-archbishop-of-canterbury	2024-11-12T23:50:55-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c77555912662bd074badae14fe4577b7fcbba02d/0_117_2345_1407/master/2345.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=94ae778b772ccbe90c34f181fa56e069

Portland’s first ranked-choice vote elects progressive outsider as mayor	As US electorate moves to right, Oregon city bucks trend and also elects most diverse city council in history In 2022 it appeared the political winds in Portland, Oregon, one of the US’s most progressive cities, were beginning to shift. Residents who had grown frustrated over the city’s approach to homelessness rejected incumbent Jo Ann Hardesty – the first Black woman to serve on the city council – in favor of the -law-and-order- Democrat Rene Gonzalez, who pledged to back an expanded police force and -clean up- Portland. But this month, as swaths of the US electorate moved to the right, the Pacific north-west city took a markedly different approach. Residents elected the most diverse city council in Portland history, opting for more progressives, and rejected Gonzalez as mayoral candidate. Instead, they chose Keith Wilson, a businessperson who has never before held office and has promised to end unsheltered homelessness in a year.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/portland-mayor-election-keith-wilson	2024-11-12T12:00:36-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/611a3c59ab8db102ed5f6e88761474d19ef5b513/205_368_4210_2526/master/4210.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=172882a6ea7c796f619f031ffd66eb85

Australia news live: average age for first porn viewing reduces by two years; NSW nurses to begin strike	Girls now see porn for the first time before they are 14, on average. Follow today’s news live Girls are now seeing porn for the first time at 13.6 years, on average – two years younger than they were in 2018. And more than 70% of young people say porn often shows aggression and violence towards women, a new report from Our Watch has found. Our Watch’s concern is with the representation of certain people, particularly women, rather than porn itself. It’s the frequent viewing of violent porn, that is sexist and derogatory, [and] associated with a greater likelihood of men and boys holding attitudes that can lead to violence against women. The line between IRL [in real life] and online is very blurry, so we can’t just say certain types of porn are bad… we’ve actually got to take proactive actions across the rest of a young person’s life so they can critique it. I want to assure the community that we are doing everything we can to minimise the impact of this on their care. NSW Health is working hard to ensure postponed surgeries are rescheduled as quickly as reasonably possible.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/nov/13/australia-news-live-average-age-for-first-porn-viewing-reduces-by-two-years-nsw-nurses-to-begin-strike	2024-11-12T11:44:59-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30731f9fee75ce74481cb900ac7b7bb3cf028db/0_189_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4211029e06a01371dc5eacfff460ae75

Justin Welby: why archbishop chosen for his managerial skills had to go	Failure to tackle Church of England’s safeguarding issues and own knowledge of abuse reflect religions’ denial In earlier times it used to be more straightforward: archbishops of Canterbury such as Thomas Becket and William Laud used to get it in the neck from the king; or, in the case of Simon Sudbury who was killed in the 14th-century Peasants’ Revolt, at the hands of the mob. Now, it’s more likely to be a politician. Justin Welby has resigned after having lost the confidence of the Church of England over his failure to tackle the institution’s chaotic handling of safeguarding, and his own personal culpability in failing to spot his own vulnerability, arising from his links to and knowledge of the rapacious abuser John Smyth.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/12/justin-welby-why-archbishop-chosen-for-his-managerial-skills-had-to-go	2024-11-12T11:19:15-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c77555912662bd074badae14fe4577b7fcbba02d/0_58_2345_1408/master/2345.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=37b6edd6cec325144398ef47df6fe287

Some will think a woman should lead the C of E and age limitation will rule out a number of bishops • Keir Starmer refuses to back Justin Welby Justin Welby’s resignation will trigger a search for the 106th archbishop of Canterbury, a role that combines moral and spiritual leadership, ceremonial duties, a seat in the House of Lords, oversight of Anglican churches in more than 160 countries, and the day-to-day management of a large but declining English institution. Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York, is expected to step up to the number one position in the Church of England until a new archbishop of Canterbury can be appointed – a process that will take several months.

But he said he also offered to remain in office until the resolution of the bankruptcy.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/new-orleans-catholic-church-gregory-aymond	2024-11-12T04:00:57-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/013df1f3eb9ba443f8466d224a81c81be20ccc04/0_36_3599_2159/master/3599.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6bfdf15ae6f52e7cb4f7abf04522504c

Trump poised to appoint Rubio as judge decides whether to overturn criminal conviction – US politics live	Former Republican challenger likely to become secretary of state as further developments expected in Trump’s legal battles Good morning, and welcome to our US politics blog. US President-elect Donald Trump announced several new members of his incoming administration on Monday, and is reportedly expected to name Marco Rubio – a one time challenger in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries – as secretary of state. The New York Times reports that Trump is expected to name Florida senator Marco Rubio his secretary of state. The paper cites three unnamed sources -familiar with [Trump’s] thinking-. Rubio has said that Ukraine needs to seek a negotiated settlement with Moscow rather than focus on regaining all territory that Russia has taken in the last decade. He was also one of 15 Republican senators to vote against a $95 billion military aid package for Ukraine, passed in April. Rubio serves as the vice-chairman of the Senate intelligence committee and sits on the foreign relations committee. The US president-elect has reportedly asked US Representative Michael Waltz, a retired Army National Guard officer and war veteran, to be his national security adviser. Waltz, regarded by many in Washington as hawkish on China and Iran, has also been a member of the intelligence and foreign affairs committees. Trump picked South Dakota governor Kristi Noem to serve as the next secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, CNN reported on Tuesday, citing two sources. The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for a range of issues, including border protection, immigration, disaster response and the US secret service. Noem, once seen as a possible running mate for Trump, made headlines after refusing to impose a statewide mask mandate during the pandemic. Trump announced that the former New York congressman Lee Zeldin will be selected to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump, who oversaw the rollback of more than 100 environmental rules when he last was US president, said Zeldin was a -true fighter for America First policies- and that -he will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions-. Stephen Miller, the author of Trump’s so-called -Muslim ban- immigration policy during his first term, is set to be his deputy chief of staff with a broad portfolio. Trump said on Sunday that Tom Homan, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), will be in charge of the country’s borders in his new administration. Homan told Fox News: -If sanctuary cities don’t want to help us, then get the hell out of the way, because we’re coming.- New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, 40, has been made ambassador to the United Nations. Stefanik, a Trump-skeptic turned Trump-ally, is the House Republican Conference chair, making her the fourth-ranking House Republican. On Thursday, Trump made his first appointment, naming Susie Wiles, who has worked on Republican campaigns since the days of Ronald Reagan, White House chief of staff. She was previously the campaign manager for his victorious bid for re-election.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/12/donald-trump-marco-rubio-juan-merchan-stormy-daniels-us-politics-live	2024-11-12T02:59:28-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa308146121a4425136d2e2d48282839b8fabddd/0_0_6086_3651/master/6086.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0c8ab1a9f6df8993bf1a270c00d0ae6a

Starmer says Labour MPs must decide for themselves on assisted dying, refusing to say how he will vote – UK politics live	The prime minister says his MPs must ‘make their own mind up’ on whether to vote in favour of legalising assisted dying Good morning. Parliament passes important laws (as well as some rather tedious ones), but normally the process is predictable because the government is in charge and most of what it does foreshadowed in a manifesto. Once a minister says ‘X will become law’, usually it does. But assisted dying is different because the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater is trying to change the bill through the private member’s bill process, MPs will have a free vote and no one really has much of a clue as to what will happen. The main uncertainty is whether or not MPs will vote to give the bill a second reading when it is debated, on Friday 29 November. But even if it passes at second reading, given the jeopardy inherent in the private member’s bill process, it could still be touch and go whether it becomes law. Look, it’s going to be a free vote and I mean that. It will be for every MP to decide for themselves how they want to vote. I’m not going to be putting any pressure whatsoever on Labour MPs. They will make their own mind up, as I will be.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/12/keir-starmer-labour-kim-leadbeater-assisted-dying-bill-uk-politics-news-updates	2024-11-12T01:13:16-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a73118582c864545e3618b35a7cf0411442cffce/0_0_7073_4246/master/7073.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=09bdcdc6ec7599efdefbaa26ded92ebd
Middle East crisis live: New Israeli defence minister dismisses talk of ceasefire in Lebanon	Comments from Israel Katz follow remarks from fellow minister yesterday that ‘certain progress’ had been made Israel’s newly appointed defense minister Israel Katz has said there will be -no ceasefire- and -no respite- in Lebanon, which has seen a series of Israeli airstrikes and ground incursions in recent weeks. Over 3,000 people have been killed. Posting to social media Israel Katz said: The warning and powerful activity carried out by the IDF and the security agencies against Hezbollah and the elimination of [Hassan] Nasrallah are a picture of victory and the offensive activity should be continued, in order to worsen Hezbollah’s capabilities and realise the fruits of victory. In Lebanon there will be no ceasefire and there will be no respite. We will continue to hit Hezbollah with full force until the goals of the war are achieved. Israel will not agree to any arrangement that does not guarantee Israel’s right to enforce and prevent terrorism on its own, and meeting the goals of the war in Lebanon, [which are] disarming Hezbollah and them withdrawing beyond the Litani River, and returning the residents of the north safely to their homes. Israel’s recently appointed defence minister, Israel Katz, has dismissed talk of a ceasefire in Lebanon, saying -there will be no ceasefire and there will be no respite- Israel’s newly appointed foreign minister, Gideon Saar, who replaced Katz in the role, had said on Monday that -certain progress- had been made on ceasefire talks in Lebanon.

Trump ‘right’ to speak to Putin over Ukraine war, says UK defence secretary – UK politics live	Comments by John Healey come as Starmer is in Paris to meet Macron and discuss implications of Trump’s victory Good morning. Keir Starmer is in Paris this morning for talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron. The prime minister is visiting to attend the French Armistice Day service, but the real interest will lie in what the leaders of Europe’s two military powers have to say as they discuss the implications of Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. Here is Jessica Elgot’s overnight preview story. Donald Trump spoke on the phone with Vladimir Putin on Thursday and discussed the war in Ukraine, the Washington Post reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. The US president-elect advised the Russian president not to escalate the war in Ukraine and reminded him of -Washington’s sizeable military presence in Europe-, the Post reported. Ukraine is certainly under pressure. Russia is certainly escalating, and President Trump has reportedly told Putin and warned him against further escalation. If he’s done that, he’s right to do so. Russia is escalating with massing North Korean troops on their territory. It’s escalating with more than 2,000 one-way attack kamikaze drones aimed at Kyiv and the rest of the Ukrainian cities in the last month alone. And one person is responsible for that escalation, and that’s Putin.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/11/starmer-macron-trump-putin-ukraine-uk-politics-live	2024-11-11T00:59:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d11e795cdda6d54cd944631bdd95d58307aa5b06/0_104_8640_5184/master/8640.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25ff442507b3acc283d5fd2af64d56e6

Israel claims to have intercepted projectile from Yemen as firefighters battle blazes – Middle East crisis live	IDF says fires in Bet Shemesh area, west of Jerusalem, were sparked by debris from intercepting missile fired from Yemen Outgoing US president Joe Biden is due to meet with Israel’s president Isaac Herzog on Tuesday, according to a report from Reuters.

Sweep of swing states rubs salt in Democrats’ wounds as Trump prepares to meet Biden	Trump to visit Oval Office on Wednesday as Biden says he will ‘ensure a peaceful and orderly transition’ Donald Trump was declared the winner in Arizona early on Sunday, completing the Republicans’ clean sweep of the so-called swing states and rubbing salt in Democrats’ wounds as it was announced that the president-elect is scheduled to meet with Joe Biden at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the presidential handover. In a national campaign that was projected as being extremely close but he ended up winning handily, the result in Arizona gives Trump 312 electoral college votes, compared with Kamala Harris’s 226. The state joins the other Sun belt swing states – Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina – and the three Rust belt states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in voting Republican. All were expected to be extremely competitive but all went for Trump, though by fairly close margins.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/10/trump-arizona-swing-states-sweep	2024-11-10T11:55:01-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/827418b53de6099f2f9152ff1aa05bb97d836ad6/0_79_3376_2026/master/3376.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=766efa098b78b0f93c810d4b47a1449d

‘The movement is not over’: leaders of Uncommitted look ahead at organizing during Trump term	While disappointed, leaders say Democratic party stuck with ‘status quo’ instead of listening to voter concerns Following Donald Trump’s decisive victory in this week’s presidential election, leaders of the anti-war group Uncommitted National Movement expressed their disappointment over the results, highlighting the Democratic party’s failure to listen to its base and prioritize progressive policies. Since the movement formed last winter, its leaders have urged the Democratic party to heed their demands of a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and to adopt an arms embargo on Israel, or risk losing their votes. While a full picture of how Arab and Muslim Americans voted in the presidential election is still being captured, this election showed a shift among communities that had long formed the Democratic base. A majority of Muslim Americans voted for the Green party candidate Jill Stein at 53%, according to a nationwide exit poll of more than 1,500 Muslim Americans by the civil rights group Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), followed by 21% for Trump and 20% for vice-president Kamala Harris.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/10/uncommitted-movement-leaders-organizing-trump	2024-11-10T05:00:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a5f190d5604844ff813f71ab274df078a03dabc/0_221_3300_1979/master/3300.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=be45b407db043d107dbe1a22b40f7967

Trump’s White House circle takes shape amid fears over extremist appointments	President-elect said to be considering immigration and foreign policy hardliners – plus the controversial RFK Jr Donald Trump’s second administration has begun to take shape amid fears over extremist appointments and how far right the US will go while Republicans control the White House and probably both chambers of Congress. The range of names being put forward varies from members of Trump’s inner circle to the world’s richest man, tech mogul Elon Musk. Alongside plutocrats and technocrats are hardline ideologues on immigration and foreign policy and the controversial figure of Robert F Kennedy Jr, a leading vaccine conspiracy theorist.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/10/trump-white-house-circle	2024-11-10T04:00:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27d2c09b600f2ae4328bee779ca41a3f29819c8a/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b1f8eb9e93e7512dc34c287f84773100
Kamala Harris is just the latest victim of global trend to oust incumbents	Voters across the world have backed any alternative to the people in charge What do the British Conservatives, the New Zealand Labour party, the LDP of Japan and the ANC of South Africa have in common? Defeat. All four led governments that have been pummelled at the polls recently as part of the greatest wave of anti-incumbent voting ever seen. Governments of left and right, radicals and moderates, liberals and nationalists: all are falling. This week the US Democratic party joined the electoral casualty list, bested by the man they ousted four years ago, the past and now future president, Donald Trump. Critics and cheerleaders alike see Trump as an extraordinary figure with a unique appeal. But his triumph is the rule, not the exception. Defeated vice-president Kamala Harris ran ahead of the global trend, even more so in the crucial swing states. But she was swept away nonetheless.	https://www.theguardian.com/global/2024/nov/10/kamala-harris-is-just-the-latest-victim-of-global-trend-to-oust-incumbents	2024-11-10T04:00:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d81477f4180749705d72e83c356ba9dab4d19800/0_182_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f8004b5be09d574517ee5e696d0170bb

Donald Trump wins Arizona as US House moves closer to Republican control – US politics live	President-elect completes clean sweep of seven battleground states; Republican representative defeats former Navajo Nation president for House seat Donald Trump won the presidential election in Arizona, the Associated Press (AP) declared on Saturday, completing a clean sweep of all seven battleground states and locking in a decisive electoral college victory over the Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris. Trump, who had secured the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White House by early Wednesday, now has what is expected to be a final total of 312 votes to Harris’ 226. Protests against Trump erupted in the US on Saturday as people on both coasts took to the streets in frustration about his re-election. Thousands of people in major cities including New York City and Seattle demonstrated against the former president and now president-elect amid his threats against reproductive rights and pledges to carry out mass deportations at the start of his upcoming presidency. Biden and Trump will meet on Wednesday in the Oval Office, the White House announced on Saturday. -At President Biden’s invitation, President Biden and president-elect Trump will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday,- the press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said in a statement. Republicans on Saturday appeared close to clinching control of the US House of Representatives, a critical element for Trump to advance his agenda when the president-elect returns to the White House in January. The AP reported that three US House races in Arizona were too early to call on Saturday, most notably the first and sixth congressional districts. The president-elect has charged Howard Lutnick, a longtime friend, and one of the few high-profile figures in corporate America to vocally endorse his campaign, with recruiting officials who will deliver, rather than dilute, his agenda. The CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, and co-chair of Trump’s transition team, has made no secret of his plan to stack the new White House with loyalists – and keep out anyone who threatens to derail his pledges. A senior adviser to Trump said that the incoming US administration’s priority for Ukraine will be achieving peace rather than helping it regain territory captured by Russia in the almost three years of the war. In an interview with the BBC, broadcast on Saturday, Bryan Lanza, who has been a political adviser to Trump since his 2016 presidential campaign, said: -When Zelenskyy says we will only stop this fighting, there will only be peace, once Crimea is returned, we’ve got news for President Zelenskyy: Crimea is gone.- An employee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) has been fired from her job and is being investigated because she told a disaster relief team she was directing in Florida after Hurricane Milton to avoid homes displaying election campaign signs supporting Trump, conduct that the agency head on Saturday called -reprehensible-.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/10/donald-trump-arizona-swing-states-house-representatives-republicans-us-politics-latest-updates	2024-11-10T00:57:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4de7ba42cceec10b200fb94a63959087d9bcb02/0_213_7008_4205/master/7008.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=71a8f52781f3e0ccaa6e18ce05fa6dd3

Texas woman sets record for donating more than 2,000 liters of breastmilk	Alyse Ogletree has helped nourished hundreds of thousands of babies as a means of giving to charity Alyse Ogletree would love it if she could donate immense amounts of money to all sorts of worthy causes, but as a mother raising three young children, that’s not something realistic. So the 36-year-old from Flower Mound, Texas, has found another way to fulfill her philanthropic instinct: giving away a record amount of breastmilk that officials estimate has been enough to nourish hundreds of thousands of premature babies. -I have a big heart, [but] at the end of the day, I’m not made of money and I can’t give away money to good causes over and over because I have a family to support for,- Ogletree said in an interview recently published on Guinness World Records’ website.

Middle East live: at least nine Palestinians killed after reported Israeli attack in ‘humanitarian zone’	Al Jazeera reports that women and children are among the dead after the Israeli attack on the al-Mawasi area near Khan Younis Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the conflicts in the Middle East. At least 14 people were killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza late on Friday and early on Saturday, the Palestinian news agency Wafa has reported. There is a -strong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas- of the northern Gaza Strip, a committee of global food security experts warned on Friday, as Israel claims to be pursuing a military offensive against Palestinian militant group Hamas in the area. -Immediate action, within days not weeks, is required from all actors who are directly taking part in the conflict, or have influence on its conduct, to avert and alleviate this catastrophic situation,- the independent Famine Review Committee (FRC) said in a rare alert. The FRC said it could be -assumed that starvation, malnutrition, and excess mortality due to malnutrition and disease, are rapidly increasing- in north Gaza. -Famine thresholds may have already been crossed or else will be in the near future,- the global hunger monitor said. Nearly 70% of the people killed in the war in Gaza are women and children, according to a UN analysis of verified deaths that highlights the heavy civilian toll of the conflict. In a new report, the most detailed analysis of its kind yet, the UN human rights office said it had verified 8,119 of those killed during the first six months of the war in Gaza. Of the fatalities, 3,588 were children and 2,036 were women. The youngest victim was a one-day-old boy and the oldest was a 97-year-old woman. The UN’s peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon said on Friday that the Israeli military’s -deliberate and direct destruction- of its property was a -flagrant violation- of international law. Since Israel launched a ground campaign across the border against Hezbollah fighters at the end of September, Unifil has accused the Israel Defense Forces on several occasions of deliberately attacking its bases, including by shooting at peacekeepers and destroying watchtowers, which Israel denies. In its latest accusation, Unifil said the IDF used excavators and a bulldozer to destroy part of a fence and concrete structure at a UN peacekeeping position in southern Lebanon on Thursday. Peacekeepers had also observed Israeli troops this week removing a barrel that marks blue line, it said. Benjamin Netanyahu has appointed a hardline supporter of the war in Gaza and longtime backer of settlements in the West Bank as his ambassador to the US as Israel prepares for the incoming administration of Donald Trump. Yechiel Leiter, an American-born rightwing publicist and former government aide who immigrated to Israel four decades ago, was announced as Israel’s next ambassador to Washington on Friday. Amsterdam police have made more than 60 arrests after what authorities called -hateful antisemitic violence- against Israeli football fans. A plane carrying football supporters brought home from the Dutch capital by the Israeli government landed on Friday at Israel’s Ben Gurion airport after the clashes on Thursday, which took place after a Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv. Amsterdam’s police chief, Peter Holla, said there had been -incidents on both sides-, starting on Wednesday night when Maccabi fans tore down a Palestinian flag from the facade of a building in the city centre and shouted -fuck you Palestine-. A social media video verified by Reuters showed Maccabi fans setting off flares and chanting -Olé, olé, let the IDF win, we will fuck the Arabs-, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/09/middle-east-live-israel-gaza-war-hamas-lebanon-hezbollah	2024-11-09T00:13:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4dc1f8e202985448dea2e3b89f50fc8ba61f535/0_279_5500_3301/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=131f8b15988bf193615ed0eeaf9885ae

The news comes after a White House address on Thursday, two days after Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris in the US presidential election, when Joe Biden called on Americans to -bring down the temperature- after months of heated political battle.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/08/project-2025-kevin-roberts-book-burning-fbi-new-york-times	2024-11-08T02:00:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e947de6a571d8340f93140c57691fd67cf7a18c/0_359_6192_3714/master/6192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c441beb93eaa2c97eb2daf146d62d72f
UK must seize ‘opportunities’ of Trump presidency, says David Lammy – politics live	UK foreign secretary says US election result ‘not wholly bad’ and Britain should not underestimate opportunities of the next four years Good morning. As the Labour government tries to work out what having Donald Trump back in the White House will mean for Britain, and what it must do in response, David Lammy is absolutely at the centre of that debate. Partly that is because he is foreign secretary, and partly it’s because (in a crowded field) he is probably the British MP who has been most outspoken and critical about Trump in the past. Lammy has now given a long interview to the BBC’s Newscast podcast to discuss these issues. And, as Jamie Grierson reports, he dismissed suggestions that his past diatribes about Trump would damage the relationship now by describing his comments as -old news-. The first thing is to say that, on the whole, foreign policy is less partisan than domestic policy. And that is the case in the American system as much as it is in our system. The second thing to say is, yes, there will be differences and there will be areas where we disagree actually, I suspect. In a world where there’s war in Europe, where there’s a tremendous loss of life in the Middle East, where the US and the UK genuinely have a special relationship, where we got someone who’s about to become again the US president who has experience of doing the job last time around, we will forge common interests. We will agree and align on much and, where we disagree, we’ll have those conversations as well, most often in private.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/08/labour-david-lammy-donald-trump-keir-starmer-conservatives	2024-11-08T01:24:46-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bda3538d102be22e8416aef84b457769cb2ea30f/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=498a77c8b42cf360f921223d75bcbea0

Labor’s plan to re-impose ankle bracelet and curfew regime ‘very likely’ to face legal challenge, advocates say	Measure alongside bill to facilitate removal of non-citizens criticised as heavy-handed proposals ‘that interfere with fundamental rights’ Legal challenges against the Albanese government’s plans to re-impose ankle bracelets and curfews on non-citizens released from indefinite immigration detention are -very likely- as the home affairs minister tries to contain the fallout from a scathing high court ruling.

Israel sends rescue planes to Amsterdam after attacks on football fans – Middle East crisis live	Security minister says fans ‘encountered antisemitism and were attacked with unimaginable cruelty just because of their Jewishness’ Hezbollah said it targeted a naval base near the Israeli city of Haifa with missiles, the second such attack in less than 24 hours. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), the group said it targeted the Stella Maris naval base, north west of Haifa, with a missile barrage, -in response to the attacks and massacres committed by the Israeli enemy-. The US state department’s spokesperson, Matthew Miller, has said the US would continue to pursue a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon until the end of President Biden’s term. Miller said: -We will continue to pursue an end to the war in Gaza, an end to the war in Lebanon, a surge of humanitarian assistance [to Gaza], and that is our duty to pursue those policies right up until noon on 20 January when the president-elect takes office.- People in Gaza have been pushed -beyond breaking point- with families, widows and children enduring -almost unparalleled suffering-, according to the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council. Jan Egeland visited Gaza this week and found -scene after scene of absolute despair-, with families torn apart and unable to bury relatives who had died. Israel’s ousted defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has reportedly said the army has achieved all its objectives in Gaza and that Netanyahu rejected a hostages-for-peace deal against the advice of his own security establishment. Gallant was speaking to hostages’ families on Thursday, two days after being sacked by Netanyahu, and reports of his remarks quickly surfaced in Israeli media. Donald Trump will as president give Netanyahu a -blank check- in the Middle East, possibly opening the way for all-out war between Israel and Iran, the former CIA director and US defense secretary Leon Panetta predicted. -With regards to the Middle East, I think he’s basically going to give Netanyahu a blank check,- Panetta said of Trump, who won the presidential election this week and will take office again in January.

Trump’s return to White House means abortion rights face new chapter of peril	A nationwide abortion ban could become a reality, and access to other forms of reproductive healthcare are at risk Abortion, the issue thought to be the magic bullet that would mortally wound Donald Trump’s chances at a second presidency, instead failed to stop him on Tuesday. Now, two years after a conservative supermajority on the US supreme court ended federal protections for the procedure, the future of American abortion access is facing a new chapter of extraordinary peril. While seven states passed ballot measures to amend their state constitutions and protect abortion rights, Trump’s return to the White House means those hard-fought efforts may amount to nothing. Despite the gridlock in US Congress, a nationwide abortion ban could soon become a reality: anti-abortion advocates hope that Trump will resurrect a 19th-century anti-vice law to effectively implement a nationwide ban. Access to other forms of reproductive healthcare, such as contraception and in vitro fertilization, are also at risk.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/07/abortion-donald-trump-return-to-white-house	2024-11-07T02:00:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95f1b8bbaadf0f5ccb7d84d23276e0577d3600e9/0_396_8256_4952/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25919f5f5e6ad4598abb68a2a2f6f7ae

Pat McFadden pushes back against Trump alarmism and says ‘fiery’ campaign claims might not happen – UK politics live	Prime minister’s chief fixer says UK relationship with US is strong and will continue with Trump in the White House Good morning. The election of Donald Trump as the next US president will create profound challenges for Labour, and for many governments around the world, and 24 hours on we are starting to get a better sense of how Labour will respond. Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister and Starmer’s lead political -fixer- in government has just finished a media round where he has been talking about almost nothing else. And the strategy that is emerging? Be nice, and hope for the best. Keir Starmer has been working hard to establish a good relationship with Trump since he became PM and we saw more of this last night, when he had his first call with the president-elect. No 10 normally issues a readout when the PM has a call with a foreign leader, and normally these are among the most dry, boring and uninformative press releases to come out of Whitehall. But this is what Downing Street released last night. The prime minister spoke to President-elect Donald Trump this evening to congratulate him on his historic victory. The prime minister offered his hearty congratulations and said he looked forward to working closely with President-elect Trump across all areas of the special relationship. I think in the end the relationship between the two countries is just much deeper than stuff like that … One thing I know as a cabinet member in the British government is the friendship between the United States and the United Kingdom is really important, it’s benefit beneficial for both countries, and it’s in our national interest to maintain that. I think you’ve got to understand that in an election, a lot of fiery things are said, and President-elect Trump says a lot of fiery things, and the important thing is what he actually does. We obviously have interests as a trading nation. We want to protect and look after our interests, and we always want to have a dialogue with the US administration about those.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/07/keir-starmer-labour-donald-trump-uk-politics-latest-live-news	2024-11-07T01:30:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/959469d8e1bb153cb0bbf1c4d7692abe793f4785/360_100_1981_1189/master/1981.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a7b8897fb0e20f273b2540413f636592

Thursday briefing: What lies ahead for the US in a second Trump administration	In today’s newsletter: After winning Tuesday’s election, America’s first convicted president will assemble his transition team – here’s what we know so far about his plans • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. Kamala Harris conceded the US election to Donald Trump overnight. In a speech at Howard University, the vice-president urged supporters not to lose hope, saying -this is a time to organise, to mobilise and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together-. Harris, hoarse from the frenzied campaign that began a little over 100 days ago, contrasted sharply with Trump following his defeat in the 2020 election, which he never formally conceded. Environment | It is -virtually certain- that 2024 will be the hottest year on record, the European Union’s space programme has found. The prognosis comes the week before diplomats meet at the Cop29 climate summit and a day after a majority of voters in the US, the biggest historical emitter of planet-heating gas, chose to make Donald Trump president. Middle East | Many Israelis were reeling after Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to dismiss his popular defence minister, Yoav Gallant, in the midst of a multifront war. The prime minister said he had fired Gallant over what he described a -crisis of trust-. Gallant, a member of Netanyahu’s Likud party and a senior general, has been replaced by the foreign minister, Israel Katz, a Likud lawmaker and loyalist who has little military background. Politics | The Reform UK MP Lee Anderson has apologised after parliament’s watchdog on bullying and harassment told him to do so for telling a security guard who asked for his ID to -fuck off, everyone opens the door to me-. Economy | Rachel Reeves has committed not to increase taxes at Labour’s next budget and said the government would need to -live within the means- of her spending plans if public services came under mounting pressure. Health | Doing just five extra minutes of exercise a day could help lower blood pressure, a study suggests. High blood pressure affects 1.28 billion adults worldwide and is one of the biggest causes of premature death. It can lead to strokes, heart attacks, heart failure, kidney damage and many other health problems, and is often described as a silent killer due to its lack of symptoms.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/07/first-edition-second-trump-administration	2024-11-06T23:11:54-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0ee5cef678f964c3ccdd2d8222c07dbfa1f4dc0/0_47_4633_2779/master/4633.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3ab85795a074d90e89a04f0806e6fcf8
US diplomats brace as Trump plans foreign policy shake-up in wider purge of government	Analysts say it is hard to separate the president-elect’s bluster from his actual plans but it’s clear his priority is to bin many of Joe Biden’s policies The US foreign policy establishment is set for one of the biggest shake-ups in years as Donald Trump has vowed to both revamp US policy abroad and to root out the so-called -deep state- by firing thousands of government workers – including those among the ranks of America’s diplomatic corps. Trump’s electoral victory is also likely to push the Biden administration to speed up efforts to support Ukraine before Trump can cut off military aid, hamper the already-modest efforts to restrain Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu in Gaza and Lebanon and lead to a fresh effort to slash and burn through major parts of US bureaucracy including the state department.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/us-election-donald-trump-foreign-policy-plans-government-purge	2024-11-06T23:00:54-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5dd725b43a6c08954bdabeefd28b33b67da0155/0_83_1886_1132/master/1886.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=94ca88548980e2a7d03861cafb23b72c

Facebook asks US supreme court to dismiss fraud suit over Cambridge Analytica scandal	Securities fraud lawsuit brought by shareholders accuses the social media platform of misleading them about misuse of user data The US supreme court grappled on Wednesday with a bid by Meta’s Facebook to scuttle a federal securities fraud lawsuit brought by shareholders who accused the social media platform of misleading them about the misuse of user data. The justices heard arguments in Facebook’s appeal of a lower court’s decision allowing the 2018 class action suit led by Amalgamated Bank to proceed. The suit seeks unspecified monetary damages in part to recoup the lost value of the Facebook stock held by the investors. It is one of two cases coming before them this month – the other one involving artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia on 13 November – that could lead to rulings making it harder for private litigants to hold companies to account for alleged securities fraud.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/06/facebook-cambridge-analytica-lawsuit	2024-11-06T10:31:18-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fd44beb8d5bf2d47ef1c7251526419884d551a7/0_60_2584_1552/master/2584.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0acf3fbf675ee3ce4690ebfcf87eb3ef

‘Stranger than fiction’: Sunderland doctor Thomas Kwan’s plan for murder	GP in inheritance row aimed to kill his mother’s partner by wearing disguise to administer a fake Covid booster jab -Sometimes the truth really is stranger than fiction,- said the prosecuting barrister, Peter Makepeace KC, as he outlined a case which reads like the plot of an airport thriller. Think of an Agatha Christie-inspired Columbo episode with a splash of Breaking Bad. The story of the outwardly respectable GP Thomas Kwan and his plot to kill a man he greedily saw as standing in the way of his inheritance is a wild one.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/06/sunderland-doctor-thomas-kwan	2024-11-06T03:14:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36a594c2132d8c75d18a037903b0acab8abddd66/65_43_1482_889/master/1482.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=55fbe5eb9ccd33fad1ba75d3fe903507

Trump win is a victory for Netanyahu, but Israeli PM may not get it all his way	US president-elect has indicated he wants an end to war in Gaza and his position on conflict with Iran remains unclear The US election result is highly consequential for the Middle East and is first and foremost a win for Benjamin Netanyahu, who did not try to hide his preference for a Trump victory. The Biden administration had put off imposing any meaningful pressure on the Israeli prime minister until after the election, despite its growing frustration with him on multiple issues: the obstruction of aid into Gaza, his campaign against the UN, his obstruction of a hostage-for-peace deal, and his government’s support for violent West Bank settlers.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/trump-netanyahu-victory-israel-middle-east	2024-11-06T02:55:26-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/655c8c6530d7cad378953338782dfa646261a12b/0_76_2763_1658/master/2763.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=67feada3c83e3485febd6a300291dabc

Orbán, Zelenskyy, Macron and European leaders respond to Trump’s win	Public congratulations but private foreboding as heads of state, ministers and diplomats express hopes for cooperation and peace Western leaders raced to respond to the return of Donald Trump to the White House with a powerful mandate to put his policy of -America first- into action once again. But many of the public congratulations could do little to disguise the private foreboding of what the next four years will augur for European security, populism and the world economy.

US election 2024 live: Donald Trump on brink of victory as world leaders congratulate likely new president	Former president poised to return to White House after sweeping key early battleground states Donald Trump is poised to win the US presidency after an unexpected sweep through key battleground states. The former president was set for a return to the White House after a contentious election in which democracy itself had been at stake and which is likely to take the United States into uncharted political waters. -This was a movement like nobody’s ever seen before, and frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time. There’s never been anything like this in this country, and maybe beyond. -And now it’s going to reach a new level of importance, because we’re going to help our country. We’ll help our country … we have a country that needs help, and it needs help very badly. We’re going to fix our borders. We’re going to fix everything about our country. And we made history for a reason tonight, and the reason is going to be just that we overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible, and it is now clear that we’ve achieved the most incredible political thing. The swing states still to be called are Wisconsin (10 electoral college votes), Nevada (6), Michigan (15) and Arizona (11). The other states still to be called are Alaska and Maine. Alaska is considered a red state, and its three electoral college votes could deliver Trump the presidency. Missouri, Colorado, New York and Maryland all passed measures to protect abortion rights, while in Florida, an effort to roll back a six-week ban fell short. Republicans have retaken the majority in the Senate, the Associated Press reported, after picking up seats in Ohio and West Virginia, and fending off challenges to their candidates in Texas and Nebraska. Republicans will control Congress’s upper chamber for the first time in four years. Donald Trump will be in a position to confirm his supreme court justices, federal judges and appointees to cabinet posts. The House is still in play, but Republicans hold a strong lead, with 190 representatives to the Democrats’ 168. There were decisive victories for Democrats elsewhere in the election. The US will have two Black women serving as senators for the first time in American history, with the election of Lisa Blunt Rochester from Delaware and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland. Sarah McBride, a Delaware state senator, also made history as the first out transgender person elected to the US House of Representatives. McBride, 34, won Delaware’s at-large House seat in Tuesday’s general election against the Republican candidate John Whalen III, a former Delaware state police officer and businessman. The House seat, Delaware’s only one, has been Democratic since 2010. Trump won in Iowa despite the state’s foremost pollster Ann Selzer on Saturday finding Harris leading by a small amount that was nonetheless within the survey’s margin of error. The finding was viewed as a potential sign of strength for Harris in nearby Wisconsin and Michigan, two swing states that are demographically similar to Iowa. The Trump campaign decried Selzer’s poll as an outlier, which turned out to be the case.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/06/us-presidential-election-2024-donald-trump-kamala-harris-latest-news-updates	2024-11-06T02:30:56-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ff74e8b71b77f4c5200e7ae54c34ee7024d2d6c/0_151_3666_2200/master/3666.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5b7d50bc0e5763c0b4a53e01190c3ce2

Voting on US election day ‘by and large normal’ despite some glitches, experts say	Errors cause delay for some voters as over 30 bomb threats called that FBI says are ‘from Russian email domains’ Voting on election day this year largely went smoothly, despite a few glitches, typical of any election, that some Republicans used to sow distrust in the voting process. As in every election, there were a handful of administrative and technological errors that caused delay for a small numbers of voters. Elections in the United States are administered at the local level, which means that county election offices, often operating on shoestring budgets, are in charge of overseeing the vote.

As Americans appeared poised to return Donald Trump to power, it was her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond, who appeared onstage instead. He tried to strike a note of optimism – there were still votes to be counted. But the scene had echoes of Hillary Clinton’s loss in 2016, when her campaign chairman, not the candidate, came out to address supporters awaiting the result of a presidential election that many hoped would finally shatter the -hardest, highest- glass ceiling.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/kamala-harris-presidential-election-day	2024-11-05T23:18:37-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ef4c175974eb8f0e9eba7e3fe92b44072e3e8b1/0_233_6987_4194/master/6987.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2463fb46c4db2bdf8143ad7b566b4c64
North Korea’s involvement in Ukraine draws China into a delicate balancing act	The entry of North Korean troops risks a dangerous escalation in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It also puts Beijing in a tight spot In October 1950, barely a year after the Chinese civil war ended, Mao Zedong sent the first Chinese soldiers to fight in the Korean war. Between 180,000 and 400,000 of Chairman Mao’s troops would die in that conflict, including his own son. But it was important to defend North Korea in that battle, Mao reportedly said, because -without the lips, the teeth are cold-. That Chinese idiom has been used to described China and North Korea’s close relationship for more than seven decades. China sees North Korea as a strategic security buffer in the region, while North Korea relies on its superpower neighbour for economic, political and military support. But that relationship is now under strain thanks to another war which is drawing Communist-rooted countries into a common battle.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/06/north-korea-troops-russia-ukraine-war-china-relationship	2024-11-05T23:02:51-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4b3137b70ce363df72e83c4458acca152f9b522/11_269_1623_974/master/1623.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=83ffd37d20d080ddab46f76c4db95cc4
Wednesday briefing: Trump wins in Georgia and North Carolina put Harris on the brink	In today’s newsletter: A bleak night for Kamala Harris is still developing, with the first swing states called for her opponent and others trending his way, while her party lost control of the Senate • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. The votes are still being counted, and it is not yet possible to call the winner of the race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. But the pattern of votes cast so far suggests that Trump is a very strong favourite to win. He has been called as the winner of key states North Carolina and Georgia. The remaining battlegrounds are not yet decided, but he currently appears on course to win all five of them, and could win the popular vote. While there is still a theoretical path for Harris, it looks very remote. Trump is expected to address his supporters soon. Harris did not appear at her HQ at Howard University, and her campaign told supporters that she would speak on Wednesday morning.

Shomari Figures elected as first congressman in Alabama’s redrawn majority-Black district	Mobile-born Figures, who worked in Obama’s White House, becomes first Black man to hold position since 1832 Tuesday night was a celebratory one for voters in Alabama’s newly redrawn second congressional district two. Shomari Figures, who was born in Mobile, was elected to the US House of Representatives, becoming the first Black person to hold the position since 1832. To some district two residents, Figures’ election is proof that their work to get the district redrawn and to educate voters was worth it. For them, Figures, who worked in Barack Obama’s White House, represents an opportunity for change and progress in the majority-Black district. Voting advocates in and around district two for months had been working to inform voters about the district change. In March, during super Tuesday, some feared their efforts were in vain as voter turnout was low. Still, many organizations across the state and district continued trying to reach people – even on election day.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/05/alabama-congressional-district-shomari-figures	2024-11-05T22:19:19-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f134f6c98626bb8d679f4728f81052500c8fc2e0/0_0_5924_3555/master/5924.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=862323a72841758f026b9997fc18ab80

Clashes over budget could push Germany’s ailing coalition to collapse	With contradictory proposals unlikely to mesh, leaders to decide whether there is scope for alliance to continue When, in 2021, Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats went into a -traffic light- coalition with the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats, the new government was riding high on an enthusiastic spirit of cooperation. There were promises to modernise, reinvigorate and green-proof Europe’s largest economy. Germany, the coalition partners said, had sleep-walked into a complacent state during 16 years of rule under Angela Merkel. The new trio in power would jolt the country out of its hubris, and deliver it into a new era of vigour and creative transformation.

Four of those states could overturn post-Roe abortion bans and restore access.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/05/florida-abortion-ballot-ban-measure-amendment	2024-11-05T17:49:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e71a4c0274848cdec1a3c3deeb04de959ee698bb/0_13_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=94ebee436bc1d66ede6e4d9c0de8c39f

Frustrated Arab and Muslim voters in New Jersey divided on which candidate will bring change	Israel’s war in Gaza, funded with substantial US support, has inspired some to back the Green party, while others say Kamala Harris is the ‘lesser evil’ Fifty-year-old Maged Judeh initially did not want to vote in Tuesday’s US election, he said while exiting the South Paterson library community center polling location in New Jersey. Judeh, a Venezuelan Palestinian Muslim American, has lived in Paterson for over 25 years, a city with one of the largest Muslim and Arab populations in the United States. His father survived the 1948 Nakba – when more than 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled from their homes in the war surrounding Israel’s creation. Because of Israel’s current war in Gaza, which is funded with substantial US support, Judeh said he has been completely turned off to either major political party.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/05/arab-muslim-voters-new-jersey-election	2024-11-05T16:59:26-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e941b09b9725c3e6244c4734398f7bcb9cd580c8/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fbaa70c5ff0f1263de0dbbd6e2892630

Netanyahu’s sacking of Gallant likely to precede a shake-up of Israel-US relations	The ex-defence minister was close to his US counterpart and his loss will give the prime minister a freer hand Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to fire his defence minister, Yoav Gallant, removes one of the harshest critics from his own government and empowers members of the far-right and ultra-Orthodox interests in Israel to key positions in Netanyahu’s cabinet. By all accounts, the key causes for Gallant’s departure lie in domestic Israeli politics: the two men’s disagreements over a hostage deal with Hamas, Gallant’s opposition to blanket exemptions for ultra-Orthodox Jews from service in the IDF, and over a leaking scandal involving a close aide to Netanyahu.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/05/netanyahus-sacking-of-gallant-likely-to-precede-a-shake-up-of-israel-us-relations	2024-11-05T15:16:33-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06d1b195f74250719de78b5191a3922fb109ab9b/1213_0_4681_2809/master/4681.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c6f0122c6e18dbf79b8133cf5b053597

Alleged white supremacist charged with drone plot against Nashville power plant	Skyler Philippi, 24, arrested on charges of attempting to use weapon of mass destruction and targeting an energy facility A white supremacist plotted to attack a power substation in Nashville, Tennessee, with an explosives-loaded drone, federal authorities alleged on Monday while announcing his arrest.

The forecaster called 49 out of 50 states in the 2008 election, as well as the outcome of the 2012 and 2020 races.

A government that conducts psychological warfare against its own people, while continuously forsaking them, has no mandate to continue a war.

Tuesday briefing: Hour by hour, what to expect as the results roll in	In today’s newsletter: A guide to what we’ll know, and when – with a serious warning attached: it might drag on for days • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. This time tomorrow, we may know who’s going to be the next president of the United States. Or we may know that we don’t yet know. Or we may know who’s projected to win, but be bracing ourselves for weeks of enervating legal action and protest. It’s going to be that sort of night, I’m afraid. There’s been a bit of a sense in the last few days that momentum has been shifting towards Kamala Harris, but most respected polling dorks are treating that narrative with the same caution they viewed the one before that, which suggested a rush towards Donald Trump. The smart way to approach it is to remember that there is literally no need to make a prediction because we will have actual numbers very soon, and then get into a flotation tank and stick on some Sigur Rós. Education | University tuition fees in England are to go up for the first time in eight years, taking annual payments up to a record £9,535 per student, the government has announced. The inflation-linked rise, amid warnings of a deepening financial crisis in the sector, was coupled with an increase in student maintenance loans. Conservatives | Kemi Badenoch has appointed Robert Jenrick shadow justice secretary, with Mel Stride shadow chancellor and Priti Patel shadow foreign secretary, as she began to put together a frontbench team. But there were questions over whether Jenrick, who lost to Badenoch in the leadership contest, had initially sought another post. Brazil | Federal police in Brazil have formally charged the alleged mastermind of the murders of Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira in the Amazon, accusing him of arming and funding the criminal group responsible for the crime.

Accrual of status credits could be key to Qantas dominance among MPs and public servants, expert says	Since 2010 government travellers have been banned from accepting frequent flyer points for work-related travel. But ban did not extend to status credits The accrual of personal airline status credits by public servants, politicians and their staff travelling for work may influence which carrier they fly with despite rules that insist on the cheapest fare, an expert in aviation loyalty programs says. Adele Elisio, publisher of The Champagne Mile frequent-flyer website, says many regular travellers value status credits – which are earned on paid flights and calculated on travel distance and fare level – over points that can be traded for flights and seat upgrades.

Musk-linked Pac accused of targeting Jewish and Arab Americans in swing states	Future Coalition Pac accused of sending the two groups very different messages about Harris’s position on Gaza A political action committees (Pac) linked to Elon Musk are accused of targeting Jewish and Arab American voters in swing states with dramatically different messages about Kamala Harris’s position on Gaza, a strategy by Trump allies aimed at peeling off Democratic support for the vice-president. Texts, mailers, social media ads and billboards targeting heavily Arab American areas in metro Detroit paint Harris as a staunch ally of Israel who will continue supplying arms to the country. Meanwhile, residents in metro Detroit or areas of Pennsylvania with higher Jewish populations have been receiving messaging that underscores her alleged support for the Palestinian cause.

Trump and Harris scramble to win votes in key states in final day of campaigning	Ex-president hurtles through four rallies across three states as vice-president puts focus on Pennsylvania Donald Trump began hurtling through four Maga rallies across three battleground states – and delivered a dark and dystopian speech about the -migrant invasion- of murderers and drug dealers – while Kamala Harris put all her last chips on Pennsylvania in a frantic final day of campaigning from both candidates. With the polls showing the contest essentially deadlocked between two vastly different political visions, both the ex-president and the vice-president were scrambling on Monday to drive home their message.

Badenoch plucks Patel, Jenrick and Stride from the Tories’ tiny gene pool of talent | John Crace	James Cleverly has the right idea – head down and sit tight until KemiKaze crashes and burns of her own accord Just do the maths. There are 120 other Tory MPs from which Kemi Badenoch can select her ministerial team. Or put it another way, there’s about a one in five chance of any MP making it into the shadow cabinet and a near 100% chance of becoming a ministerial bag carrier. These are days of plenty for ambitious young Tory MPs with one eye on their own careers. It just requires a different mindset. There again, not every Tory MP will necessarily want a place in Kemi’s team. James Cleverly very publicly snubbed his new boss at the weekend, saying he’d rather a return to the backbenches than carry on as shadow home secretary. He was fed up with having to defend someone else’s brainless policies. A year in Westminster: John Crace, Marina Hyde and Pippa Crerar.

‘It’s kind of whispered in corridors’: women being forced into underground abortion networks in rural NSW, study finds	A small but influential number of medical practitioners are leaving pregnant women unable to access abortion in many parts of the state A small but influential number of medical practitioners who either actively obstruct abortion care or who are uninterested in providing it are leaving women unable to access abortion in many parts of rural New South Wales, a study has found. It has led to informal and often underground networks of health workers providing information and access to abortion care to patients, the study found, with these providers burning out due to high demand and attitudes toward them.

Given the comparisons to Hitler and Mussolini, experts say it’s important to remember that fascism is a process While Democratic strategists debate whether or not their attack ads labeling Donald Trump a fascist have been effective, experts and academics told the Guardian his campaign and the Republican party he now heads have clear autocratic sympathies and political qualities that are firmly in line with fascism movements historically.

Starmer to give speech about ‘severity’ of illegal migration threat as Badenoch works on shadow cabinet – UK politics live	Starmer to urge world to ‘wake up’ to severity of illegal migration threat at Glasgow’s Interpol meeting Good morning. Interpol, the International Criminal Police Organisation, which has 196 member countries, has a general assembly and, for the first time in 50 years, it is meeting in Britain. Keir Starmer will address the meeting in Glasgow and he is going to deliver a -wake up- call on illegal migration, saying that the world needs to face up to the scale of the problem and that tackling the problem needs to be internationalised. Britain cannot do it on its own, he implies. According to extracts from the speech released in advance, Starmer will say: The world needs to wake up to the severity of this challenge. I was elected to deliver security for the British people. And strong borders are a part of that. But security doesn’t stop at our borders. There’s nothing progressive about turning a blind eye as men, women and children die in the channel. Keir Starmer’s announcement on tackling gangs will mean absolutely nothing without a deterrent to stop migrants wishing to make the dangerous journey across the channel. It is a shame that Starmer has not recognised the extent of the crisis in the channel sooner, as he and the Labour party voted against numerous measures to stop the gangs while they were in opposition.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/04/keir-starmer-labour-migration-interpol-kemi-badenoch-conservative-shadow-cabinet-uk-politics-latest-news	2024-11-04T01:13:02-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b39c300e275e1478862528408dce89810d5fd1b6/142_0_1905_1144/master/1905.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=94fcab69b1324dec300ceda47020da1a

US election 2024 live: Harris and Trump converge on rust belt as final day of campaigning begins	Democratic and Republican candidates set to blitz rallies in Pennsylvania and Michigan as polls shows race too close to call The Guardian US has been averaging national and state polls to see how the two candidates are faring. Nationally, Kamala Harris has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over Donald Trump, virtually identical to last week. The election will be decided in the seven battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In these states, the polls are too close to call. Kamala Harris pledged to -do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza- in her final rally in Michigan on Sunday, as she attempted to appeal to the state’s large Arab American and Muslim American population two days out from the election. Michigan is home to about 240,000 registered Muslim voters, a majority of whom voted for Joe Biden in 2020, helping him to a narrow victory over Donald Trump. But Arab Americans and Muslim Americans in the state have expressed dissatisfaction over the vice-president’s stance on Israel’s war on Gaza. Harris was making her fourth stop of the day in Michigan, having earlier spoken at a church in Detroit and stopped by a barber shop in Pontiac. Trump is holding his final rally of the campaign in Michigan on Monday night. Donald Trump said he should never have left the White House after his defeat in 2020 and joked darkly he would be fine with reporters getting shot. -We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,- Trump said at a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania. -I shouldn’t have left, I mean honestly, we did so well, we had such a great – - he said before abruptly cutting himself off. In other comments, as he denigrated the media, he said: -To get to me, somebody would have to shoot through fake news, and I don’t mind that much, because, I don’t mind. I don’t mind.- Donald Trump again suggested he would give a role on health policy to Robert F Kennedy Jr at a rally in Macon, Georgia. -I told a great guy, RFK Jr., Bobby — I said, ‘Bobby, you work on women’s health, you work on health, you work on what we eat. You work on pesticides. You work on everything,- he said. Kennedy, a well known vaccine sceptic, on Saturday said that the former president would push to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected. Harris dodged a question on whether she voted for California’s Proposition 36, which would make it easier for prosecutors to send repeat shoplifters and drug users to jail or prison, after submitting her ballot. The measure would roll back provisions of Proposition 47, which downgraded low-level thefts and drug possession to misdemeanors. The Trump campaign claimed that recent polling by the New York Times and the Des Moines Register is designed to suppress Trump voter turnout by presenting a bleak picture of his re-election prospects. The memo claims that the Times’s polls have biased samples and overrepresent Democratic voters compared with actual voter registration and turnout trends. Trump also disputed a shock Iowa poll that found Kamala Harris leading the former president in the typically red state 47% to 44%. -No President has done more for farmers, and the Great State of Iowa, than Donald J. Trump,- Trump said in a post on the Truth Social network on Sunday morning. -In fact, it’s not even close! All polls, except for one heavily skewed toward the Democrats by a Trump hater who called it totally wrong the last time, have me up, by a lot-.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/04/donald-trump-kamala-harris-us-election-polls-latest-live-news	2024-11-03T23:29:02-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e815e5c6798cc728228e554bba2d75f8ece224e0/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42051860c9e31b2e09bd47bde23ce127

‘Nail in the coffin’: family farmers respond to inheritance tax changes	Rachel Reeves announced in her budget that after April 2026 heirs will pay tax when farms are passed on For more than 100 years, the family of 56-year-old Andrew Smith has had a cattle farm on Bodmin Moor in Cornwall. Smith, who now runs the farm, sees chancellor Rachel Reeves’s changes to inheritance tax rules as a grave betrayal of British farmers.

Monday briefing: Can Kemi Badenoch face the past and plot a path for the future?	In today’s newsletter: The new Conservative party leader was announced on Saturday – and must build a credible opposition from a small pool of colleagues in the House of Commons • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. Kemi Badenoch was elected as Conservative leader over the weekend, and now has a window of about two minutes of mainstream attention before the US election devours the entire news agenda. That is not time to plot the next five years in any detail. But it doesn’t take long to observe just how stiff the challenge she faces will be. The contest was billed as a postmortem of the election defeat – but as it played out, we don’t even know in any detail why Badenoch thinks the Tories lost. She said yesterday that the threat of Reform UK was a symptom of her party not being -consistent enough about values- – without being specific about what that would mean in practice. Meanwhile she starts with a reputation as an abrasive media performer who is firmly on the right of her party, and will soon have to decide whether to oppose public spending increases just four months after a landslide defeat. US election | In the final stretch of the presidential race, Donald Trump has said he should never have left the White House after his defeat in 2020 and joked darkly he would be fine with reporters getting shot. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris promised to work to end the war in Gaza as she attempted to appeal to Arab American and Muslim American voters in Michigan. Europe | The pro-western incumbent Maia Sandu has won a second term in office in the Moldovan presidential election, preliminary results have shown, marking a significant boost for the country’s EU aspirations and a clear rebuke to Moscow. Labour | Rachel Reeves has admitted she was wrong to say before the election that no major tax rises would be needed, but promised there was -no need to increase taxes further- after last week’s budget raised £40bn. Spain | Hundreds of people have heckled Spain’s King Felipe and prime minister Pedro Sánchez – throwing mud and shouting -murderers- – as they visited an area in Valencia devastated by last week’s floods. The scenes laid bare the degree of anger among residents who feel abandoned by the authorities. Work | One thousand workers in the UK will get extra time off with no loss of pay in the first official pilot by the four-day week campaign under the Labour government. Amid growing momentum for a shorter working week, the campaign will present its findings in the summer.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/04/monday-briefing-can-kemi-badenoch-face-the-past-and-plot-a-path-for-the-future	2024-11-03T22:51:02-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d94a2121763591fb4386287db03f091f3849602c/0_474_3011_1806/master/3011.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=062143bdc9343b5b7787892bd111595f
