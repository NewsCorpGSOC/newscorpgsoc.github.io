Women in Oregon say police and state failed in investigation of doctor accused of sexual abuse	Dozens of former patients of David Farley say he carried out abuse for years, and that he wasn’t indicted because investigation was inadequate An Oregon physician who is accused of sexually abusing dozens of women in his care has evaded criminal charges – but patients hope to attain some level of justice by continuing to pursue a lawsuit against him demanding damages. In a CNN article published Sunday, patients of the former doctor, David Farley, said they hope their litigation holds him to some account after he subjected them to years of unnecessary breast, genital and rectal exams, adding to a spate of cases involving US physicians reported to have violated people in their care during their most vulnerable moments.

Deadly avian flu strain could enter Australia via thieving migratory birds, scientists warn	Birds practicing kleptoparasitism – harassing each other until they drop their saliva-covered food – seen as ‘plausible pathway’ for arrival of H5N1 Scientists have identified a new way for an aggressive strain of bird flu to enter Australia, via the habit of some migratory birds of harassing other birds and stealing their food and potentially their viruses. Australia is the only continent to have so far escaped a virulent H5N1 strain of avian flu – known as 2.3.4.4b and discovered in Europe in 2021– that has devastated bird populations in other parts of the world.

Cooper defends Labour examining Italy’s migrant policies – UK politics live	Home secretary says Starmer’s visit part of ‘pursuing Britain’s interests’ but says Albania-style scheme not an option ‘at the moment’ Good morning. Rishi Sunak had a good relationship with Giorgia Meloni, the leader of a far-right party who became PM in Italy around the same time he did in the UK, and he took a very close interest in what her government is doing to stop irregular migration into her country by back. Keir Starmer has abandoned Sunak’s Rwanda scheme, but not everything has changed in Whitehall and today he is in Italy for talks with Meloni and to see if he can learn anything that might help Labour reduce small boat crossings. In a press release about the trip, Downing Street said: As part of the visit Keir Starmer will discuss with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni her country’s success in tackling irregular migration. Italy has seen a 60 per cent drop in irregular migration by sea over the past year thanks to tough enforcement and international cooperation. Well, we’ve always worked with other democratically elected countries, including those led by political parties that we’re not aligned with. The last Labour government did that. Other governments have done that. That’s just always been the case. It’s part of making sure that we are pursuing Britain’s interests, working internationally with other governments. The areas that I think are important in terms of working with Italy are particularly around tackling organised immigration crime, the smuggler and the trafficking gangs. Italy has been doing this, they have made some significant progress on doing this. The Italian arrangement with Albania is not yet up and running, and we will be interested to see how that develops. We’ve always said we would look at what works. It is a very different kind of programme from the Rwanda one. The Rwanda scheme was run for two and a half years by the Conservatives. They spent £700m on sending four volunteers to Rwanda. That is not a workable programme. It’s not in place at the moment, so no. As we’ve always said, we will look at anything that works. But no, that’s not the scheme that we’re looking at at the moment. What we’re looking at at the moment is developing new Europol taskforces.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/16/keir-starmer-giorgia-meloni-immigration-uk-politics-live	2024-09-16T01:01:46-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9e83f99cf4d41590d19d7deed96ed24aa668320/0_223_6667_4000/master/6667.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a586fb4aac8a3cfa7bf437296953d123

Israel-Gaza war: new generations being recruited as conflict continues, senior Hamas official says	Osama Hamdan rejects claim by Israeli defence minister that Hamas ‘no longer exists’ as a military formation Welcome to our live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war and the wider Middle East crisis. I’m Tom Ambrose. A senior Hamas official has told Agence France-Presse that new generations of fighters have been recruited since the 7 October attacks, less than a week after Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant told journalists that Hamas, -no longer exists- as a military formation in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed publicly on Tuesday that three Israeli hostages were mistakenly killed in a strike that also took the life of Hamas’ northern Gaza brigade chief, Ahmed Ghandour, in November. According to reports from Hebrew media, families of Sgt. Ron Sherman, Cpl. Nik Beizer, both 19, and civilian Elia Toledano, 28, who were abducted by Hamas on 7 October, were informed by IDF officials that their loved ones had tragically lost their lives as a result of IDF actions after a comprehensive inquiry. Israel is allegedly recruiting asylum seekers from Africa to take part in military operations in Gaza in exchange for residency rights, according to an investigation by Israel’s daily newspaper Haaretz. According to the report, based on testimonies of asylum seekers and defence officials, speaking off-the-record, Israel’s defence establishment is -offering African asylum seekers who contribute to the war effort in Gaza assistance in obtaining permanent status in Israel-. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to New York on 24 September, the first day of the high-level general debate by world leaders at the annual UN general assembly, his office said Sunday. It said Netanyahu is scheduled to stay until 28 September in the US, which he had visited in July for official talks and a congressional address. A sniper killed a UN worker on the roof of his home in the northern West Bank, the UN has said, as friends and family gathered in Turkey to bury a US-Turkish activist who had been killed by the Israeli military at a protest six days earlier and around 30km away.

River Stour sculpture commemorates 16th century drowning that inspired Shakespeare	Figure of woman on her back underwater draws inspiration from Hamlet’s Ophelia and death of senior Tudor judge Almost 500 years ago, a wealthy and well-connected judge named Sir James Hales walked into the river Stour near Canterbury in order to take his own life. Hales had risen to favour under King Henry VIII, but had refused to convert to Catholicism under the repressive regime of his daughter Mary, and was imprisoned in the Tower of London. Battling with his mental health after his release in 1554, he drowned himself. But as suicide was a crime at the time, his widow was denied the right to inherit his property and so took the matter to law, in a case that became so famous in the 16th century that it inspired Shakespeare’s portrayal of the suicide by drowning of Hamlet’s Ophelia.	https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/sep/15/river-stour-sculpture-commemorates-16th-century-drowning-that-inspired-shakespeare	2024-09-15T07:45:04-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8f50514b9bd91dbcbd79e5aa0dfaf2a4346826a/0_158_7373_4426/master/7373.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=92af2a800c1f6335f6b616ef3c5d78b6

David Lammy: PMs and partners rely on donors to help them ‘look their best’	Labour leader’s use of donations to pay for wife’s wardrobe is normal practice in UK, suggests foreign secretary The foreign secretary, David Lammy, has suggested it is routine for political donors to pay for outfits for prime ministers and their spouses, in a row over the late declaration of funds for a personal shopper and clothes for Keir Starmer’s wife, Victoria. The donations by the Labour donor Waheed Alli, which paid for clothing for Victoria Starmer, were not initially declared in the register of MPs’ interests, the Sunday Times reported. The gift was registered late, after Starmer approached the parliamentary authorities on Tuesday following advice.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/15/david-lammy-pms-and-partners-rely-on-donors-to-help-them-look-their-best	2024-09-15T04:38:07-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b928275db358c3820191e5ce7416f5a1c8bc31a/0_93_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=838ad430a2b74ca021c6ad9313f2e745
Real v fake: how the Harris-Trump debate laid out different takes on AI	One candidate revels in AI-generated images of cats and geese, while the other posts real photos of her grandparents In their first, and likely only debate, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump argued about artificial intelligence. They spoke of China, chips and -domestic innovation-. The country learned how Harris, Trump and their allies would – or intentionally wouldn’t – use artificial intelligence for their own ends. But the real lessons were in the aftermath. The online furor over the IRL confrontation revealed that Republicans use AI to illustrate their political points. Democrats do not.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/15/ai-harris-trump-debate	2024-09-15T04:00:56-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba37abe24734df3ae203ba307bae65475e24f70c/0_132_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=45bac5f3e87f1e1cbc38d80ccecc788a
Louisiana town the canary in the coalmine as climate effects worsen	Lake Charles has been battered by storms over the past 20 years – and now its most famous landmark lies in ruins Last week, one south-west Louisiana city in particular was girding itself for Hurricane Francine’s blow: Lake Charles, located about four hours west of New Orleans and two hours east of Houston. In the lottery of hurricane paths over the past 20 years, Lake Charles has been very, very unlucky. But Francine’s impact on the city turned out to be relatively minor, a summer storm like locals are used to.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/15/louisiana-lake-charles-climate	2024-09-15T04:00:56-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3adb4ee8a87f4f8bdc2c6c9de8806255a854bfa4/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ac1e14fa200e3d6a618b541b5c0557f7
Murdoch family fights to keep succession battle secret as Nevada hearings loom	Labyrinthine drama over which Murdoch child will get Fox Corp empire begins out of public view on Monday The Murdoch family succession drama enters a new phase in a Reno, Nevada, courtroom this week when patriarch Rupert Murdoch will probably argue that plans by three of his children to potentially change the business model of the news-communications empire will damage the interests of Fox Corp shareholders.

Nearby was a large pile of logs. -It’s a pretty neanderthal arrangement,- she explained. -When the power shuts off we feed the stove with wood. In winter we do this round the clock. Our plants require constant temperatures. They don’t like cold and hot.- Inside the glass nursery were dozens of rare specimens. All were bromeliads native to the Americas. Silvery wisps of beard-like Tillandsia descended from a pipe. A pineapple poked out of a stem. A screen next to the stove protected a group of starfish-like earth stars, native to Brazil. The collection needed a minimum temperature of 10C, Yaroslavska – a senior researcher – said.

Middle East crisis live: UN worker killed by Israeli sniper in West Bank; Israel reports missile from Yemen	Sufyan Jaber Abed Jawwad was the first Unrwa employee killed in the West Bank in more than a decade; missile hit unpopulated area, Israel military says Welcome back to our live coverage on the Israel-Gaza war and the wider Middle East crisis. I’m Tom Ambrose. The UN says a sniper killed one of its employees on the roof of his home in the northern West Bank. Sufyan Jaber Abed Jawwad, a sanitation worker with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, was the first Unrwa employee killed in the West Bank in more than a decade. Mourners gathered in the Aegean town of Didim, south-west Turkey, on Saturday for the funeral of a US-Turkish activist, who was shot dead while protesting Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. The killing last week of 26-year-old Aysenur Ezgi Eygi has sparked international condemnation and angered Turkey, further escalating tensions over the war in Gaza. A large crowd gathered during the prayers including Eygi’s family, members of president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Islamic-rooted AKP party, and activists advocating the Palestinian cause. Erdoğan has vowed to ensure -that Aysenur Ezgi’s death does not go unpunished-. The Israeli military has said it was likely Eygi was hit -unintentionally- by forces while they were responding to a -violent riot-, and said it is looking into the case. Israeli airstrikes hit central and southern Gaza overnight into Saturday, killing at least 14 people, Gaza’s civil defence agency said.-We have recovered the bodies of 11 martyrs, including four children and three women, after an Israeli airstrike hit the house of the Bustan family in eastern Gaza City,- agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told Agence France-Presse (AFP). The strike took place near the Shujaiya school in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, he said. The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the strike. Bassal said Israeli forces carried out similar strikes in some other parts of the territory overnight, killing at least 10 people. Five people were killed in northwestern Gaza City when an airstrike hit a group of people near Dar Al-Arqam school, he said. Three others were killed in a strike in the al-Mawasi area of the southern Khan Younis governorate, where tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge, Bassal added. At least 41,182 Palestinians have been killed and 95,280 others injured in Israel’s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October, Gaza’s health ministry said on Saturday. The toll includes 64 deaths in the previous 48 hours, according to the ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and militants in its count. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) disaster risk management teams, in cooperation with the Palestine Ministry of Social Development, distributed food parcels to 11,000 families in Gaza and North Gaza governantes, the humanitarian organisation shared on X. Richard Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) representative in Gaza and the West Bank, said in a statement on Saturday that he is -hopeful these pauses will hold- as the UN agency prepare for the next round of polio vaccinations in Gaza in four week’s time. About 559,000 children under the age of 10 have recovered from their first dose, the WHO said, as part of a campaign to inoculate children in Gaza. The second doses are expected to begin later this month as part of an effort in which the WHO said parties had already agreed to. A new attempt has begun to try to salvage an oil tanker burning in the Red Sea after attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, an EU naval mission said on Saturday. The EU’s Operation Aspides published images dated Saturday of its vessels escorting ships heading to the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/15/middle-east-crisis-live-un-worker-killed-by-israeli-sniper-in-west-bank-israel-reports-missile-from-yemen	2024-09-15T00:15:47-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45436a8677cd84d954db47f1a6f43c6c9e70a116/0_118_5088_3053/master/5088.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0f626ea192c4bcc5d3a0228da83d94bf

Nurseries in England say new rules have reduced care to ‘crowd control’	The first study into Tory shake-up of childcare shows staff are overwhelmed The first major study into the Conservatives’ controversial shake-up of childcare has revealed that nursery staff are often doing more -crowd control- than education, because of the increased number of children they are looking after. Since September last year, nurseries in England have been allowed to increase child-to-staff ratios, so one adult now looks after five two-year-olds rather than four. The change was intended to help deliver the party’s pledge of 15 hours’ free childcare a week from this month for working parents of children aged from nine months to three years.	https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/sep/14/nurseries-in-england-say-new-rules-have-reduced-care-to-crowd-control	2024-09-14T11:11:56-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b096a01c1ebad798f4ff3952cb48754167f8399/0_214_3700_2221/master/3700.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fcf3210014a70150a88ae9e3ed4e126f

Most are pale white Akbaş dogs or Kangal shepherds, with their distinctive dark muzzle, pale golden coat and large bodies designed to herd livestock, although on the streets of Istanbul they are more commonly found lazing outside coffee shops, rotund and docile from a lifetime of treats. In cities at least, the stray dogs are popular enough to be seen as part of the architecture. One particularly large and sleepy example that dozes outside an ice-cream shop on Istanbul’s main shopping street has become a local celebrity nicknamed -The Boulder-, complete with a string of rave reviews left by delighted tourists.

‘They have done fantastically well’: how London’s blockbuster Vincent Van Gogh exhibition is reframing myths	The five-star Poets and Lovers show at the National Gallery will dispel the tortured genius label Vincent van Gogh’s maverick talent has put him at the centre of European culture for more than a century. His works make headlines when they sell, from the record-breaking moment his Irises went for £27m at Sotheby’s in 1987, right up to this month’s predicted hoopla in Hong Kong, where Christie’s are to auction his riverside scene, Moored Boats, painted two years earlier, for an estimated $30-50m – likely to set a record for works from his later, Parisian period. The Dutch artist’s dramatic renderings of simple things – plants, trees, furniture and faces – are international emblems of the way we value art. So much so that London’s National Gallery’s renowned 1888 sunflower painting was deliberately targeted last year by Just Stop Oil climate activists, who lobbed the contents of a soup tin at it.	https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/sep/14/vincent-van-gogh-national-gallery-show-dispel-tortured-genius-label	2024-09-14T06:00:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f696fe64aa50dfd8f4e48f4130f4c658220aafd3/0_74_2480_1487/master/2480.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=53a3b543e189a9482e2f3f9bcab49394
What debate? Harris and Trump back to brutal grind of swing state campaigns	After an epic week saw Harris pass her biggest test and Trump go off the rails, the election countdown gallops on Even as gleeful Democrats spent days circulating video clips and memes of Kamala Harris ridiculing and riling Donald Trump in Tuesday’s presidential debate, the candidates themselves got back to the brutal grind of winning over the tiny proportion of voters who will decide November’s election in a clutch of swing states. Harris is on a -New Way Forward- tour of pivotal areas this weekend to exploit the momentum from her humiliation of Trump. On Friday, she was in Pennsylvania, perhaps the most crucial of crunch states, to push the themes she hit hard in the debate in painting the former president as a threat to democracy, women’s rights and the US’s international standing.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/14/poll-campaign-debate-harris-trump-swing-state	2024-09-14T06:00:28-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a9992d92b6cdc433e078eb71def2a2aac65d1bd/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9543f760241f0aa2576b165c4fc17f17
Haitian immigrants helped revive a struggling Ohio town.

He got a text from a friend telling him to turn on the debate.

They passed the mourners, the cameras and the flag-topped lances of the Húsares de Junín cavalry regiment, and set it down in the hall of Lima’s brutalist culture ministry. Behind the coffin, holding hands and dressed in black under a pale but warm spring sky, came its occupant’s eldest daughter and youngest son. A crowd of ministers, political allies and military top brass awaited them at the ministry’s double doors.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/14/transformative-for-better-and-for-worse-whats-the-legacy-of-perus-alberto-fujimori	2024-09-14T04:13:17-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e19e6d884d71aa04468666a7e187863c3c348ea/0_79_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=36d37dd29af6dd1f0f014949daaa86cd

Musk has been tweeting for hours about his interview with Donald Trump, and he will continue into the night before taking a few hours’ break – presumably to sleep – and then logging back on to tweet dozens more times. Over the next 24 hours, Musk will post over 145 times about a range of obsessions, projects and grievances to his 195 million followers. He will share anti-immigrant content, election conspiracies and attacks against the media. He will exchange tweets with far-right politicians, conservative media influencers and sycophantic admirers. He will send a litany of one-word replies that say -yeah-, -interesting- or simply feature a cry-laughing emoji.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/14/elon-musk-tweets-trump-conspiracy	2024-09-14T00:30:20-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4cc96605ac8d669a0007d1274ea61ef93ee02d5/0_159_4554_2732/master/4554.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=db3abf10479f4204ce3a1f992508ec77
Russia-Ukraine war live: Nato chief says group could have done more to prevent war	Nato should have done more to arm Ukraine before the war, the alliance’s outgoing head Jens Stoltenberg said Nato could have done more to arm Ukraine to try to prevent Russia’s invasion in 2022, the outgoing head of the western military alliance said in an interview released on Saturday. -Now we provide military stuff to a war – then we could have provided military stuff to prevent the war,- Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg told German weekly newspaper FAS. Keir Starmer and Joe Biden have discussed letting Ukraine fire long-range, western-supplied missiles into Russia, while stopping short of any formal announcement. Vladimir Putin has threatened it would amount to Nato joining the war. The UK prime minister told reporters at the White House that he had a -wide-ranging discussion about strategy- with the US president but that it was not just a meeting about -a particular capability-. Biden dismissed Vladimir Putin’s sabre-rattling threats, saying he did not accept that Ukraine using Storm Shadows missiles against Russia proper would amount to Nato going to war with Moscow, reports Dan Sabbagh in Washington. -I do not think much about Vladimir Putin,- Biden said. Moscow’s ambassador to the UN told the security council on Friday that loosening the missile strike restrictions would mark an escalation to -direct war- between Moscow and Nato. Washington officials accused Putin of trying to scare Nato countries away from supporting Ukraine, reports Andrew Roth. In Europe, leaders played down Putin’s threats. The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said: -I would not attach excessive importance to the latest statements from President Putin. They rather show the difficult situation the Russians have on the front.- Zelenskiy said the Ukrainian incursion into Russia’s border region of Kursk had produced the desired result of slowing Moscow’s advance on another front in Ukraine’s east. The Ukrainian president said in Kyiv on Friday that Russia’s counterattack in Kursk produced no major successes – contradicting Vladimir Putin’s accounts of Russian advances on both fronts. Zelenskiy said Russia had about 40,000 troops on the Kursk front. -So far we have seen no serious [Russian] success.- Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday its troops had taken back 10 villages out of 100 that Kyiv had occupied. The battlefield reports of either side were not able to be independently verified. The Ukrainian general staff said on Friday that Russian forces had focused their assaults near the town of Kurakhove, about 33km (20 miles) south of the key logistics hub of Pokrovsk in Ukraine’s Donetsk region. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had captured Dolynivka, positioned between Pokrovsk and Kurakhove, the latest in a series of localities Moscow says it has seized. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said 49 Ukrainian prisoners of war had been returned from Russia, with Agence France-Presse witnessing the group being greeted at the border with Belarus. The Ukrainian president did not clarify whether it was part of an exchange with Russia, as is usually the case, but AFP journalists had earlier seen Russian prisoners of war being loaded on to a bus near the border. Romania started training its first group of Ukrainian F-16 pilots this week, the Nato country’s defence ministry said. The first four pilots had started their -theoretical training-, a ministry spokesperson told AFP, with practical training to follow -towards the end of the year-. Drone fragments fell on a municipal building in Kyiv’s Obolon district north of the city centre early on Saturday, said the mayor. Writing on Telegram, Vitali Klitschko said no fire broke out and emergency services were sent. He earlier said air defence units had been in action. A Reuters witness said explosions were heard. The head of Kyiv’s military administration, Serhiy Popko, urged people to remain in shelters as drones still posed a threat. The air raid alert was later lifted for the city but remained in effect for several regions of central Ukraine.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-nato-putin-zelenskiy	2024-09-14T00:15:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c90b934ace43b3316bbab25cf76ffc271c8d7cea/0_399_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3006091132510ef6b51eb7d30c3502fe

Would his death or capture stop the war? A group of Israel hostages were huddled in a tunnel in Gaza a few days after they had been dragged from their homes on 7 October, when the man who had plotted their abduction appeared out of the subterranean gloom. His hair and beard were grey and his dark-ringed eyes stared out from under thick black brows. It was a face familiar to them from a thousand broadcasts and newspaper stories: Yahya Sinwar. The Hamas leader in Gaza was the most feared man in Israel, even before he ordered the October raid in which 1,200 people – two-thirds of them civilians – were killed and 250 taken hostage.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/14/hunt-for-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-israel-prime-target	2024-09-13T21:00:16-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43f1a111810d2f9ce6986d5e0ca8e3d0c8bd0ded/0_138_6236_3743/master/6236.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f39091bea004e9d4eb90879ac8067b1e

Useless, beneficial, a social-life killer: teens weigh in on Australia’s plan for child age limits on social media	Some see the ban as worthwhile amid online dangers, while others say it would be socially inconvenient – and hard to enforce The prime minister of Australia’s plan to impose an age limit for teenagers to access social media kicked off a debate this week over what the age should be, whether a ban is feasible and if the restriction would be good for kids. While Anthony Albanese has argued the policy is something parents have called for, and experts in mental health and other industries warn it could force kids into less safe situations, the teens who are affected have largely been absent from discussions.	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/sep/14/australia-social-media-ban-teenagers-under-16-reactions	2024-09-13T08:00:02-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4959fa18c8e7d36edb0ba226c7475d8bf77e429/0_74_6128_3678/master/6128.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=59123a43b8688197453a7cdd81e606bc

US election live updates: Harris pushes for second debate with Trump: ‘We owe it to voters’	Harris campaign releases memo blasting Trump for ‘toxic positions’ he took during this week’s debate, saying he should respond to them Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump may have put the kibosh on another debate against Kamala Harris yesterday, but the vice-president isn’t letting the matter rest. Yesterday, Harris told a crowd in North Carolina that -I believe we owe it to the voters to have another debate-, and this morning, her campaign released a memo blasting Trump for the -toxic positions- he took during their encounter, and saying he should respond to them – implicitly in the form of another debate against the vice-president. The Harris campaign has said it would be happy to participate in such an event next month, but that would require Trump to reverse his position. Expect the former president to elaborate on the subject around 12pm ET, when he holds a press conference in Los Angeles. Here’s what else is going on today: Harris campaigns at 6.35pm ET in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, the swing state that some believe will be the most important in deciding the outcome of this election. Tim Walz, Harris’s running mate, is campaigning in the two other Great Lake swing states, Michigan and Wisconsin.

First Thing: Putin warns Nato over Ukraine missiles	First Thing: Putin’s warning follows suggestions US may lift restrictions on Ukraine using long-range weapons. Plus, Bernardine Evaristo on the books of her life Good morning. Vladimir Putin has said that a western move to let Kyiv use long-range weapons against targets inside Russia would mean Nato would be -at war- with Moscow. How do the US and UK see things? Blinken and the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, say Russia is escalating the war by accepting weapons from Iran. -The escalator here is Putin. Putin has escalated with the shipment of missiles from Iran. We see a new axis of Russia, Iran and North Korea,- Lammy said. What’s the latest in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine? Russian troops have recaptured a swathe of villages in the Kursk region, dealing a significant blow to Ukraine’s military incursion into Russia. What do the UN’s aid figures say? In July, an average of 100 trucks entered each day, largely through the southern Kerem Shalom crossing. This number halved in August, while just 147 trucks have entered so far in September, although the UN added that there may be gaps in the reporting because of the dangers of staff monitoring aid entry at crossing points. How many aid workers have been killed in Israel’s offensive? An estimated 280 humanitarian workers, most employed by Unrwa, have been killed in Gaza, according to the UN’s office of humanitarian affairs.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/13/first-thing-putin-warns-lifting-ukraine-missile-restrictions-put-nato-at-war-with-russia	2024-09-13T02:58:17-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12650a2e2c1ed98298764871750cd41f74958188/0_254_3811_2287/master/3811.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c4c03338c59cd27bbfae5710ad6c48bd

Atlanta’s Emory University targeted by anti-Palestinian group: ‘It’s scary’	Conservative group posts flyers with photos and names of students and faculty, calling them ‘anti-Israel’ Students and faculty at Atlanta’s Emory University have been targeted by an outside group posting and handing out flyers labeling 14 of their colleagues -anti-Israel-. The flyer, titled -Security Alert-, included the names, ages and mugshot-style photos of each of them, arranged under the word -Arrested-. Campus Reform, a national group of conservative students, put its logo on the flyer, which refers to arrests made during last April’s protests seeking Emory divestment from Israel. Charges for most of that day’s 28 arrests remain unresolved and awaiting trial, after several faculty leaders have been unsuccessful in efforts to get Emory president Gregory Fenves to ask prosecutors to drop them.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/12/emory-university-campus-reform-israel-flyers	2024-09-12T04:00:22-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eee9318bf88469de53d14d92953c4cec9f68e83/0_183_5479_3288/master/5479.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=640c0edb55a8572cc56c1b9dd7cb5a74
First Thing: Gaza officials say 18 dead in Israeli strike on school, including six UN staff	UN chief condemns ‘dramatic violations of international humanitarian law’. Plus, Republicans dismayed by Trump’s debate Good morning. An Israeli airstrike on a school being used as a shelter for displaced Palestinians has killed 18 people, Gaza’s civil defence agency said. The UN’s Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa reported that six of its staff were among the dead. What did the UN say after the airstrike? -These dramatic violations of international humanitarian law need to stop now,- said the UN chief, António Guterres. Unrwa head, Philippe Lazzarini, said: -Humanitarian staff, premises and operations have been blatantly and unabatedly disregarded since the beginning of the war-. What is the humanitarian cost of the war? About 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage in Hamas’s 7 October assault on southern Israel. More than 41,000 people have been killed in Israel’s military offensive on Gaza, according to the health ministry in the territory.

Russia-Ukraine war live: Russian counter-offensive reported in Kursk	Moscow said it had defeated Ukrainian units in a number of villages but there was no independent confirmation or immediate comment from Ukraine Russian forces have begun a significant counter-offensive against Ukrainian troops in Russia’s Kursk region, according to pro-Moscow war bloggers and a senior Russian commander. Pro-Ukrainian observers also reported heavy fighting in part of the occupied area and the possible Russian recapture of villages. Ukraine’s air force said on Thursday it had shot down 44 out of 64 drones launched by Russia overnight. Russian forces also used five missiles, the air force added in a statement posted on the Telegram messaging app. The Institute for the Study of War said on Thursday morning that it would be -premature to draw conclusions- about the counterattacks at this stage. The thinktank reported: -Russian forces began counterattacks along the western edge of the Ukrainian salient in Kursk oblast and reportedly seized several settlements north-east and south of Korenevo on September 10 and 11.- The ISW continued: -The size, scale, and potential prospects of the September 11 Russian counterattacks in Kursk oblast are unclear and the situation remains fluid as of this report … Ukrainian forces reportedly began new attacks against the Russian counterattack west of Snagost and throughout the Ukrainian salient in Kursk oblast.- Maj Gen Apti Alaudinov, who commands Chechnya’s Akhmat special forces fighting in Kursk, said Russian troops had gone on the offensive and taken back control of about 10 settlements in Kursk.

A decision is understood to have already been made in private. Blinken and the British foreign secretary, David Lammy, met with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, in Kyiv on Wednesday.

Starmer to deliver damning verdict on how Tories left NHS and set out reform vision – UK politics live	The prime minister will deliver a speech this morning after Lord Darzi’s damning report on the NHS Good morning. Keir Starmer has been in office for just over two months, and for much of that time the government has focused on trying to explain to the public just how bad was the legacy the left by the Tories. There has been extensive focus on the economy, and on prisons. Today Starmer is focusing on the NHS. And, arguably, this is the most important issue at all. According to polling by More in Common, at the next election the single issue most likely to determine whether Labour has succeeded or not is whether NHS waiting lists have fallen. The state of the NHS isn’t an accident. The health service was hit by three big shocks. The 2010s saw the biggest slowdown in funding since it was founded in 1948. The next big shock was the top-down reorganisation of the NHS, which threw it into chaos for years. Then came the shock of the Covid pandemic, which hit the NHS harder than other similar countries – largely because of the other two shocks. People have every right to be angry. It’s not just because the NHS is so personal to all of us - it’s because some of these failings are life and death. Take the waiting times in A&amp;E. That’s not just a source of fear and anxiety - it’s leading to avoidable deaths. This government is working at pace to build a 10-year plan. Something so different from anything that has come before. Instead of the top-down approach of the past, this plan is going to have the fingerprints of NHS staff and patients all over it.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/12/keir-starmer-nhs-darzi-report-labour-tories-uk-politics	2024-09-12T00:44:44-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db6d795e2fe283253e125ebe262be8da0f3c8592/0_61_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=70c8d1657a063a83853383ff505f650a

Israel-Gaza war live: UN chief condemns ‘violations’ of humanitarian law after six Unrwa staff killed in Israeli airstrike	António Guterres calls Israeli strike on Gaza school sheltering displaced people ‘unacceptable’, after local authorities report 18 killed in attack Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war. UN chief António Guterres has condemned an Israeli airstrike on a central Gaza school being used as a shelter for displaced Palestinians that killed 18 people, according to the Hamas-run territory’s civil defence agency. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of Unrwa, has said that the staff who died in Wednesday’s attack had been providing support to families who had sought refuge in the school, and that at least 220 of his agency’s staff had been killed in Gaza since the start of the war. Elsewhere on Wednesday, a strike hit a home near the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, killing 11 people, including six brothers and sisters ranging from 21 months to 21 years old, according to the European hospital, which received the casualties. Hamas said on Wednesday that its negotiators had reiterated their readiness to implement an -immediate- ceasefire with Israel in Gaza based on a previous US proposal without new conditions from any party. The group said in a statement that their negotiation team, led by senior official Khalil al-Hayya, had met mediators in Doha to discuss the latest developments in Gaza. CIA director William Burns, who is also the chief US negotiator on Gaza, said on Saturday that a more detailed ceasefire proposal would be made in the next several days. The previous proposal put forward by president Joe Biden in June laid out a three-phase ceasefire in return for the release of Israeli hostages. However lingering issues, including control of the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow stretch of land on Gaza’s border with Egypt, remain. Joe Biden has described the Israel Defense Force’s fatal shooting of the Turkish American protester Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi as -totally unacceptable- in his first extensive comments on her death. In a statement on Wednesday, Biden said that Israel had -acknowledged responsibility- for Eygi’s death, but he stopped short of backing the demands put out by Eygi’s family and other human rights advocates for an independent inquiry into the fatal shooting of the American activist at a protest in the West Bank town of Beita last week.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/12/israel-gaza-war-unrwa-middle-east-hamas-latest-news	2024-09-11T23:17:46-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a381f3fc35c00b987cbc4cd429e55064e4822ac/0_164_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0baa61c40137efac4c38b79dea355f3b

Thursday briefing: How the long-awaited renters’ reform bill could transform housing as we know it	In today’s newsletter: Labour’s new plans aim to shut the door on unscrupulous landlords. But what will change for the millions of people renting? • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. In 2019, Theresa May’s Conservative party pledged to end no-fault evictions (that is, where landlords oust tenants without giving a reason), and introduced the first iteration of the renters’ reform bill. But pressure from lobbyists, interest groups and Tory backbenchers who were themselves landlords led to countless delays and the eventual watering down of the proposals. Charities and advocacy groups expressed concern about the sloth-like progress of the bill, but that did little to hurry the previous government. US election 2024 | Donald Trump’s campaign was in damage control mode on Wednesday amid widespread dismay among supporters over a presidential debate performance that saw Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, repeatedly goad him into going wildly off-message and missing apparent opportunities to tackle her on policy.

NHS | Long delays for hospital, GP and mental health services are leading to thousands of unnecessary deaths and have ruptured -the social contract between the NHS and the people-, an inquiry has concluded. The findings of the study by Lord Ara Darzi, commissioned by Labour when it came to power, will be cited by Keir Starmer, who will warn that the NHS has to -reform or die-. Northern Ireland | The government is to establish an independent public inquiry into the February 1989 loyalist murder of the Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane, the Northern Ireland secretary, Hilary Benn, has announced. Finucane was 39 when he was shot dead in his family home in north Belfast by the Ulster Defence Association in an attack found by a series of investigations to have involved collusion with the state.

Harris was strongest at debate when talking about abortion while Trump relied on tired old lies	Harris spoke passionately about women’s personal experiences post-Roe, as Trump repeated his usual extreme rhetoric Throughout his 2024 campaign for president, Donald Trump has avoided giving straight, consistent or accurate answers to questions about abortion – and in his first debate appearance against Kamala Harris, Trump kept up that streak. Moderators introduced abortion, one of the biggest issues in the election, by asking about the most recent example of Trump’s incoherence on the topic: his position on a Florida ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights into the state’s constitution. Over the last few weeks, Trump initially suggested that he would vote in favor of the measure – which would restore abortion rights in a state that has banned the procedure past six weeks of pregnancy – before quickly backtracking amid outrage from his anti-abortion base.

Harris comes out swinging in presidential debate | First Thing	Kamala Harris kept Donald Trump on the defensive as he devolved into bizarre and false tangents about crowd sizes, abortion and immigration. Plus: how to get a better night’s sleep Good morning. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump faced off in a presidential debate in Philadelphia on Tuesday, with Harris landing a number of blows as Trump spouted bizarre falsehoods about abortion and immigration. What were the most memorable moments? After Harris wrapped one remark with a jab about Trump’s crowd sizes, Trump began to ramble – about immigrants eating people’s pets. -In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats,- said Trump. -They’re eating the pets of the people that live there.- ABC moderators interjected to say that the city manager of Springfield, Ohio, told the network there were no credible reports of specific claims of pets being harmed by individuals within the immigrant community. How did the moderators do? ABC’s moderators David Muir and Linsey Daviswere largely praised for factchecking Trump’s falsehoods and rerouting discussions back to the questions. When Trump falsely accused Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, of calling for abortion in the ninth month and -execution after birth-, Davis responded: -There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it’s born.- Another boost for Harris: After the debate concluded, superstar Taylor Swift endorsed Harris on Instagram, signing the post as -childless cat lady- in a jab at misogynistic comments made by the Republican vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/11/first-thing-kamla-harris-comes-out-swinging-in-presidential-debate-donald-trump	2024-09-11T03:12:58-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/084f25597fc1fa122c698721c495516ba33240c2/0_286_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=422b71d618418c4d2094199d10ff04af

Is it game over for Venezuela’s opposition as Maduro clings to power?	Opposition leaders are adamant their campaign to remove Maduro is very much alive – even as their candidate widely believed to have won the vote has gone into exile in Spain Against all the odds, they pulled off a once-inconceivable democratic victory against one of the world’s most unyielding authoritarian regimes. Even more astonishingly, Venezuela’s opposition activists managed to prove it, gathering a vast cache of voting data that offered concrete proof of their success. Yet six weeks after Venezuela’s presidential election, it was the candidate widely believed to have won the vote, Edmundo González, who has flown into exile in Spain, while the apparent loser, Nicolás Maduro, looks set to keep power.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/11/venezuela-election-maduro-gonzalez-exiled	2024-09-11T02:00:06-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8b082f8661175a8dfec74a5c6bfc7b891bbdd00/0_121_4514_2710/master/4514.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7412cc16abfb0a7a88dcf17881f0a9c2

Keir Starmer to face PMQs as latest figures show economy stalling over summer – UK politics live	Prime minister faces Rishi Sunak after figures show growth is flatlining Good morning. Keir Starmer faces PMQs later today. It is only his third as prime minister, but there is not much novelty factor left, perhaps because his non-performative, serious, ‘government of service’ focus has been evident for some years. This afternoon he is likely to face more questions about the decision to means-test the winter fuel payment. But growth figures out this morning are also important – not because they reflect badly on the government (Labour was not even in office at the start of July), but because they illustrate the size of the challenge it faces. Starmer and Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, say boosting growth is their top priority. But this morning’s figures show that, in July, there was no growth at all. It was the second month in a row where the economy flatlined. Larry Elliott has the details here.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/11/pmqs-keir-starmer-labour-rishi-sunak-conservatives-latest-uk-politics-live-updates	2024-09-11T00:57:41-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0590d7f31115ef151cf95443f0932d32471b24ba/0_109_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=46b71b86be2f5d042a82202cb2f622e4

Wednesday briefing: Trump takes the bait on night that could transform the presidential race	In today’s newsletter: His advisors wanted him to tie Harris to the Biden administration – but instead he lost his temper. Here are the key moments • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. If you had a sinking feeling on June 28 when you woke up to the news that Joe Biden had turned in an utterly incoherent debate performance, you will probably have a bit more appetite for your boiled egg this time. A few hours ago, the only scheduled debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris came to an end – and even Fox News said Harris won. Democrats’ moods can only have been improved by the news, a few minutes after it ended, that Taylor Swift had endorsed Harris, and signed her post -childless cat lady-. And CNN’s snap poll suggested that voters thought Harris won by a margin of 63% to 37% – nearly as big a margin as Trump achieved over Biden last time around. Key to Harris’ success was baiting her opponent into rants on marginal topics, instead of talking about the issues that voters are interested in. Winter fuel allowance | MPs have voted to remove the winter fuel allowance from all but the poorest pensioners in England and Wales. Just one Labour MP, Jon Trickett, voted for the opposition motion but 52 abstained – at the higher end of predictions.

Trump-Harris debate live: presidential nominees to face off in high-stakes showdown	Harris and Trump expected to go on attack when debate kicks off at 9pm ET, as polls show one of tightest US election races ever Good evening, US politics blog readers, and thanks for joining us as we cover tonight’s debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, which we expect to be a milestone in what has already been a historically tumultuous presidential race. The two contenders are set to square off for 90 minutes at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, with ABC News hosting and their anchors, David Muir and Linsey Davis, moderating. The Democratic and Republican candidates are meeting as polls indicate a neck-in-neck race between them, particularly in the seven swing states expected to decide the winner. This will be Harris’s first debate against Trump since she became the Democratic standard bearer. Joe Biden and Trump faced off in June, but the president put in such a poor showing that it sparked a plunge in his poll numbers and a Democratic pressure campaign that contributed to his decision to end his bid for a second term. Though Harris has been vice-president since 2021, she has done only one formal interview since launching her presidential campaign, and polls have indicated that voters are looking to find out more about her plans, if elected. This debate could present her with the opportunity to do that – while, for Trump, he’ll be given the chance to make the case for his return to the White House. Will either candidate deliver a knockout blow to the other? Biden certainly received one when he encountered Trump just over two months ago, though he was far from the only candidate to emerge from a debate with their campaign hanging by a thread. Will Trump say something insensitive about Harris’s racial identity? Just days after she launched her campaign, the former president claimed that the vice-president was not really Black, sparking outrage. What will Harris say about her policies? She inherited a campaign from Biden, but has slowly deviated from some of his proposals. Look out for anything she has to say about US support to Israel, and her previous stances toward immigration – a subject Trump is sure to bring up.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/10/harris-trump-presidential-debate-updates	2024-09-10T15:44:31-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dee6de38a9282a6105cc4a04617a2016276d0d3e/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b35e7fbf64d30a0fe9ba02a62582d59b

Family of Ethel Rosenberg say US document proves she was no Soviet spy	Sons whose mother was executed with her husband Julius in 1953 say newly released document proves innocence The family of Ethel Rosenberg, who was sent to the electric chair along with her husband, Julius, in 1953 after being convicted of spying for the Soviets at the height of the Red Scare, have called on Joe Biden to formally exonerate her after a newly released document appeared to show that the US government knew she was not a spy. The couple maintained their innocence until the end and the case of the Rosenbergs has long been seen as a possible miscarriage of justice. Though most historians see Julius Rosenberg as a real Soviet spy, questions about Ethel Rosenberg’s role have lingered and their sons, Robert and Michael Meeropol, have long campaigned in their family’s cause.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/10/ethel-rosenberg-soviet-spy-new-evidence	2024-09-10T11:54:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/feff2c823c1ff9388af862e2dd64f2f92fe7ff5f/0_384_2008_1204/master/2008.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03f0cda00c2c53121770d8bb94c1ba64

Apple loses EU court battle over €13bn tax bill in Ireland	Ruling is a fillip for European Commission efforts to clamp down on ‘sweetheart’ tax deals Apple has lost a high-profile, €13bn (£11bn) Irish tax battle with Brussels in a decision that will bolster the European Commission’s efforts to clamp down on favourable -sweetheart- tax deals for multinationals. The European court of justice (ECJ) ruling, which had been eagerly awaited, comes after years of legal wrangling over whether the European Commission was right to demand in 2016 that €13bn in -illegal- tax breaks for Apple should be repaid because it gave the iPhone maker an unfair advantage.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/sep/10/apple-loses-eu-court-battle-tax-bill-ireland	2024-09-10T02:23:48-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2584b8496c453a6212233c4b78e5d4caac5499e0/0_166_7724_4635/master/7724.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6dd25b5068e421b59bca4112d0e567a7

Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans have tried to blame Harris for the Afghanistan pullout, including in a report by House GOP lawmakers today. Our investigation reveals the Biden-Harris administration had the information and opportunity to take necessary steps to plan for the inevitable collapse of the Afghan government. At each step of the way, however, the administration picked optics over security. Without involving the Afghan government, he and his administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban that freed 5,000 Taliban fighters and allowed them to return to the battlefield. This chaotic approach severely hindered the Biden-Harris administration’s ability to execute the most orderly withdrawal possible and put our service members and our allies at risk.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/09/trump-harris-presidential-debate-election-latest-updates	2024-09-09T15:59:56-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b37b1f5c23d472eae975f0b6381b9599ea3ae4a7/0_104_4639_2783/master/4639.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=37a29180bf181d8f6a97df5c0f5510b0

Anti-Maduro campaign ‘stronger than ever’ after Venezuelan election, says Machado	Opposition leader María Corina Machado said exile of key figure Edmundo González ‘changes absolutely nothing’ The Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has insisted the campaign to end Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian rule is -stronger than ever-, but the banishing of one of its key figures to Spain has thrown many supporters off balance. Edmundo González, who the US and other countries have recognised as the winner of Venezuela’s 28 July presidential election, flew into exile on Sunday after several weeks holed up in the Dutch ambassador’s residence in Caracas. An arrest warrant, seemingly designed to force the retired diplomat to flee, had been issued a week earlier.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/anti-maduro-campaign-venezuela-machado-gonzales	2024-09-09T12:05:59-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70e1a5aa20424514ffe943b55e6b84d6ee79ef41/0_0_5173_3105/master/5173.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c604ed0bd9ddb2e98da46d9cab5dd12

Monday’s hearing is the latest in the long saga of Salameh, once vaunted as a financial wizard who earned Lebanon its reputation as the -Switzerland of the Middle East- during his 30-year tenure.

Middle East crisis: Israeli strikes on Syria kill at least 25 people, war monitor says – as it happened	Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the dead include civilians as well as soldiers and ‘Syrians working with pro-Iran groups’ The UN human rights chief has said that ending the war in Gaza is a priority and asked countries to act on what he called Israel’s -blatant disregard- for international law in the occupied Palestinian territories. -States must not – cannot – accept blatant disregard for international law, including binding decisions of the (UN) security council and orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), neither in this nor any other situation,- the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Turk, said in a speech at the opening of the UN human rights council in Geneva. The court considers that the violations by Israel of the prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force and of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination have a direct impact on the legality of the continued presence of Israel, as an occupying power, in the occupied Palestinian territory. The sustained abuse by Israel of its position as an occupying power, through annexation and an assertion of permanent control over the occupied Palestinian territory and continued frustration of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, violates fundamental principles of international law and renders Israel’s presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful. Forcible evictions, extensive house demolitions and restrictions on residence and movement. The transfer by Israel of settlers to the West Bank and East Jerusalem and maintenance of their presence. Its failure to prevent or to punish attacks by settlers. Restricting the access of the Palestinian population to water. Israel’s use of the natural resources in the occupied Palestinian territory. The extension of Israel’s law to the West Bank and East Jerusalem.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/09/middle-east-crisis-seven-killed-in-israeli-airstrike-on-iran-linked-military-site-in-syria-says-war-monitor	2024-09-09T07:01:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd28d950d57c091f8974d93ab34a4a7908bbbac9/0_460_7265_4359/master/7265.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=169e54cfaa6f5ef5fce0d1b5f067b3c6

Weather tracker: Francine looking likely to be next Atlantic hurricane	An area of low pressure in the Gulf of Mexico is moving landward, and is expected to bring intense rainfall Francine could soon be the next to be ticked off the list of Atlantic hurricane storm names this week. On Friday, a broad area of low pressure emerged in the Gulf of Mexico, designated as Invest 91L. An -invest- – a shorthand for -investigative area- – refers to a region of atmospheric disturbance, characterised by low pressure and thunderstorms, and is closely monitored for its potential to evolve into a tropical cyclone. Invest 91L is anticipated to encounter more favourable environmental conditions as it progresses northward over the coming days, meandering along the eastern coasts of Mexico and Texas. The National Hurricane Center has now labelled this as a potential tropical cyclone, and it is expected to reach hurricane status before reaching the Gulf coast of the US. It advises that hurricane and storm surge watches will probably be issued on Monday for coastal parts of Texas and Louisiana, with the impacts expected to be felt from Tuesday night.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/weather-tracker-francine-likely-atlantic-hurricane	2024-09-09T01:29:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24cc1827e84491c0c221ac628bc03071cdb1fd63/0_52_3168_1900/master/3168.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1a9b1687edb0a93e205a820382e25175
