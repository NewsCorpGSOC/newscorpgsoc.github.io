Engineers found such a pickup could enter the crowded tourist strip at speeds ranging from 12-70mph – yet city officials are installing new street barriers that can only withstand 10mph impacts, according to an April city-contracted engineering analysis and city bid documents reviewed by Reuters.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/05/new-orleans-street-barriers-safety	2025-01-05T04:00:17-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dc3a6c18f7079288157946ceb2de43cc71209f4/0_184_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a615d9de7914b0c7c9dfb030f071d108
An Ivy League football player, a cook, a mother: the victims of the New Year’s Day attack in New Orleans	Those who died on Bourbon Street had gathered to celebrate the new year and were locals, tourists, students and parents University students.

Ukraine waits for Trump the dealmaker to broker end of Putin’s war | Shaun Walker in Kyiv	The US president-elect’s policy on the conflict may prove decisive, but appeasing both sides will be a challenge A new year in Ukraine began in much the same way as the old one finished: with deadly Russian drone attacks across the country. In Kyiv, one person was killed and at least six others were injured in the first few hours of 2025. It is Ukraine’s third new year since Russia’s invasion. If 2023 began with hopes high that Ukrainian battlefield gains would push Russia back and lead to an outright victory, by the start of 2024 the Ukrainian army and population were already settled in for the long haul and had few illusions about a quick victory.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/04/ukraine-dealmaker-trump-putin-war-russia-zelenskyy	2025-01-04T08:29:31-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55c732ceca99894ff00b099c7f3d6427a9aac999/0_26_4418_2651/master/4418.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=78a1b857311b088c22bdd6b74798b492

First Thing: Arrest of South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol fails amid security force standoff	Anti-corruption officials say they were blocked by 200 presidential personnel. Plus, FBI says New Orleans terror suspect acted alone Good morning. South Korea’s political crisis took a dramatic turn on Friday when investigators were forced to abandon an attempt to arrest the impeached president, Yoon Suk Yeol, after a tense standoff with his security forces. What are the details of Friday’s standoff? Local media reports said anti-corruption officials – who are leading a joint team of police and prosecutors – entered the compound to find themselves blocked by troops under the control of the presidential security service. What happened on 3 December? Yoon declared martial law in an attempt to root out what he described as -anti-state, pro-North Korean- forces – a reference to opposition MPs in the national assembly. He did not provide any evidence for those claims, however. He was forced to lift the order six hours later after lawmakers forced their way past troops into the parliament building to vote it down. What do we know about the New Orleans attack suspect? It’s understood Jabbar was born and raised in Texas, served in the US army 2007-2015, and in 2022 was $27,000 behind on house payments, he said in court documents. Jabbar’s brother told AP that in recent months he’d isolated himself. Why didn’t steel bollards stop the attack? Seven years ago, officials began installing barriers at intersections in the French Quarter of the city. But the steel bollards were in the process of being replaced over New Year’s Eve.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/03/first-thing-arrest-of-south-korean-president-yoon-suk-yeol-fails-amid-security-force-standoff	2025-01-03T02:32:10-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa19edbf0482114c05b6dac6818d0ae662ff4005/0_0_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=37343acafc9f657f0c3d835c4b097dc5

Streeting defends pace of plans for adult social care reform – UK politics live	Ministers to launch historic commission to reform ‘failing’ system amid warnings the NHS risks being overwhelmed Wes Streeting has set out overnight for the Guardian his view on the new Labour government’s proposal for adult social care reform. The health secretary wrote: By 2050, there will be 4 million more people aged 65+ in England than today. If we do nothing, real social care costs are expected to nearly double by 2038, compared with 2018 numbers. Many more people will be left without the care they need, the burdens will fall on the health service and our NHS will be overwhelmed. We can’t keep paying a heavier and heavier price for failure. Our NHS can’t afford to keep bearing a heavier burden. We can’t afford not to act. Labour took a lot of flak in the general election campaign for not spelling out in more detail our plans for a National Care Service. I was honest about the reason why – general election campaigns are where plans for social care go to die. If anyone is going to help us to break the cycle of bad politics, knock heads together, and forge the national consensus I think we need on social care, it is Louise Casey. And that work will begin in April. It will report initially next year. And within three years I hope we will have built the consensus we need to build a national care service fit to meet the challenges for older and disabled people in the 21st century.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/03/wes-streeting-adult-social-care-reform-elon-musk-uk-politics-live-updates	2025-01-03T01:12:38-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1de800d53bf6061d31c375d7b1b4a6347a48125/0_304_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=70f8f898159a73578eb8d97244c6d434

The question New Orleans investigators hope to answer: will there be another attack?	The FBI says the attacker acted alone, but links to Islamic State mean further violence can’t be ruled out As investigators examine the terrorist attack in New Orleans on Wednesday, they will be hoping to answer three questions: who was responsible? How was the attack executed? And why? All will be vital to answering the most pressing question of all: will there be another attack in the immediate hours or days to come? Their first priority will have been to identify the attacker. The FBI has said it believes Shamsud-Din Jabbar, the 42-year-old who drove a pickup truck into a crowd celebrating the new year, acted alone. He hired a vehicle, procured an assault rifle, as well as body armour and ammunition. He also fabricated what appeared to be several pipe bombs containing plastic explosives, which he may have pre-positioned to target police.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/02/the-question-new-orleans-investigators-hope-to-answer-will-there-be-another-attack	2025-01-02T09:35:41-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0f1e097fd9c32615a175d2239bdd7b52175f4c4/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ee642f1606deacdaf9cb135a9bbf45a2

Automatic voter registration may be an answer to UK’s troubling turnout gap	Experts say evidence from abroad shows AVR is effective – and it’s one of several proposals to try to boost voting A healthy democracy depends on people participating in it. In the UK, the proportion of people doing so is falling. Voter turnout in general elections stayed above 70% from 1945 through to 1997, hitting more than 80% in 1950 and 1951. But it collapsed to 59.4% when Tony Blair won his second term in 2001, and though it rose again between 2010 and 2019, it has not reached the 70% mark since 1997. In the 2024 election, turnout fell to 59.7%. The decline has been acute enough to trigger concern among Labour officials. Before July, the Guardian revealed they were drawing up plans to introduce automatic voter registration (AVR). In the election, when it came around, just 52% of adults living in the UK exercised their right to vote – the lowest proportion since universal suffrage was introduced. Crucially, this statistic counts all adults eligible to vote in the UK, not just those registered on the electoral roll.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/01/automatic-voter-registration-uk-turnout-gap-elections	2025-01-01T09:26:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53be2671a1f2793c6ebd77c914bd06516bd643fe/0_0_4122_2474/master/4122.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=00501a5a13da57650ec21cb5180ac23a

Cause of South Korea plane crash unclear as officials focus on bird strikes	Experts say bird strikes are relatively common and should not have been enough to cause landing gear failure No one knows for certain what caused Jeju Air flight 7C2216 to crash, killing all but two of its 181 passengers and crew. As darkness fell at Muan international airport in South Korea and officials fielded questions from distraught relatives of the dead, the most likely explanation was that the plane had been struck by one or more birds, triggering a sequence of events that prevented the pilot from deploying the landing gear. Aviation officials focused on bird strikes – and, to a lesser extent, the weather – as the most probable cause, even as some experts said the relatively common phenomenon would not have been enough to cause a catastrophic failure of the landing gear.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/29/cause-of-south-korea-plane-crash-unclear-bird-strikes-landing-gear	2024-12-29T08:37:04-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/995c199518186f55d2d7edfcfc7d2c207dc08f43/0_202_5336_3203/master/5336.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fb472537199ef5f4e3ca9da26bbdc933

South Korea plane crash: all except two are presumed dead on Jeju Air flight carrying 181 people, say authorities – live updates	South Korea facing worst domestic civil aviation disaster after Boeing 737-800 with 175 passengers and six crew skidded off runway and hit wall at Muan airport Dozens are feared dead after a plane skidded off the runway while attempting a landing without landing gear at Muan international airport in South Korea on Sunday morning The exact casualty figures have not yet been tallied, though authorities are provisionally reporting that 28 people are believed to have died, according to news agency Newsis. Fire officials have warned that given the severe damage to the aircraft, the number of casualties could rise. Jeju Air flight 2216 from Bangkok to Muan was carrying 181 people – 175 passengers and six crew – when it came down, skidded along the runway and hit fencing and a wall around the perimeter before catching fire.

But perhaps no American media has attracted as much ire from the president-elect as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting – a non-profit corporation created by federal law in 1967 to distribute funding to public media organizations like PBS and NPR.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/28/trump-npr-pbs-funding-cut	2024-12-28T05:00:38-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8e97160cc56c0d831edb45491d0f4141a7c7f26/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=15002bcc713d8d96f55ec5743b1a3e66

‘Anti-woke’ dog food and pro-America lipstick: US sees rise in rightwing stores	A number of marketplaces have sprung up seeking to make use of anti-establishment fervor – are they here to stay? Among the many odd things to come out of Donald Trump’s political movement – see ear bandages, doomed boat rallies and rubbish dancing – one that could be here to stay is more prosaic: the creation of a series of rightwing marketplaces and products seeking to capitalize on anti-establishment fervor. In recent years a number of platforms have sprung up to sell conservative-made items, from -anti-woke- dog food to pro-America lipstick, in a pushback against what they claim is -cancel culture- in the US – and what others might see as a fairly cynical attempt to cash in on rightwing Americans’ political beliefs.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/28/anti-woke-shopping-public-square	2024-12-28T04:00:38-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/813227a42e73850ffaae14cc699c1bdfa38a24cd/0_12_3257_1955/master/3257.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8420f666a1ee8ae97897183465488cc6

Russia-Ukraine war live: Moscow says Kyiv plot to kill high-ranking officer with music speaker bomb foiled	Claim from FSB comes two weeks after Ukrainian assassination of senior Russian general Igor Kirillov On 8 March 2023, International Women’s Day, Russian soldiers were handing out tulips and boughs of mimosa to women and girls in the city of Melitopol, southern Ukraine – a move designed to promote friendly relations between the occupiers and the inhabitants. But the night before, someone had been discreetly sticking posters to walls and lamp-posts. They bore the image of a young Ukrainian woman, dressed in a traditional embroidered shirt, smashing a bouquet over a Russian soldier’s head. -I don’t want flowers,- read the slogan. -I want my Ukraine.- Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service accused American and British spies of trying to provoke attacks against Russian military bases in Syria in a bid to force the evacuation of the bases, the state-run RIA news agency said on Saturday. The SVR gave no evidence for its allegation. North Korean troops deployed in Russia’s Kursk region are suffering heavy losses and being left unprotected by the Russian forces they are fighting alongside, according to Ukraine, while the US says Russian and North Korean generals see the soldiers as -expendable-. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Friday that said Russian troops were sending the North Koreans into battle with minimal protection and that the North Koreans were taking extreme measures to avoid being taken prisoner. -Their losses are significant, very significant,- the Ukrainian president said in his nightly video address. The Biden administration pledged to approve fresh military aid to Ukraine, including crucial air defence systems. John Kirby, the US national security communications adviser, said the promised US security assistance package was expected to be announced -in the next couple of days-, though it was unclear how much it will include. Slovakia has confirmed its readiness to host any peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, despite Kyiv’s accusation that it is playing into the hands of Vladimir Putin. The Russian president on Thursday called it -acceptable- for the country to become a -platform- for dialogue over the conflict. The Slovak prime minister, Robert Fico, said on Facebook late on Friday: -If someone wants to organise peace talks in Slovakia, we will be ready and hospitable.- Ukraine has received its first batch of liquefied natural gas from the US, a deal that Kyiv says will boost Ukrainian and European energy security as a major gas transit deal with Russia ends. -Dtek, Ukraine’s largest private energy company, has today taken delivery of its first cargo of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States,- the company said on Friday. The consignment was of about 100m cubic metres of gas, it told Agence France-Presse. A Russian court has sentenced a singer who burned his passport in protest against Moscow’s Ukraine war to five-and-a-half years in prison.

‘It was like I was reborn’: Sednaya prison’s former inmates adapt to a new Syria	Former prisoners endured hearing fellow inmates being executed – but they are the lucky ones, with 100,000 people still missing Of all the horrors Mohammed Ammar Hamami remembers from his time in the Assad regime’s notorious Sednaya prison, the most vivid is the clanging of metal execution tables being moved around on the floor below. About once every 40 days, prison guards would drag the tables away from under the feet of condemned men. Nooses around their necks and hands tied behind their backs, they would die by hanging. Most of the bodies were burned in Sednaya’s crematorium.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/26/it-was-like-i-was-reborn-sednaya-prisons-former-inmates-adapt-to-a-new-syria	2024-12-26T05:32:28-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92c8a577afb0f66b4b70759eeaa799ed903867df/0_187_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eceab1d6e284dc4d453ea597380b1486

Middle East crisis live: 14 security personnel killed in Syria after clash over former prison officer	Security personnel and three armed men killed in Tartous province after forces sought to arrest officer linked to Sednaya prison, says Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza and developments in the Middle East more widely. Fourteen security personnel from Syria’s new authorities and three armed men were killed in clashes in Tartous province when forces attempted to arrest an officer linked to the notorious Sednaya prison, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Five journalists were killed when their vehicle was struck in the vicinity of Al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat in central Gaza, health authorities said. Palestinian media and local reporters said the vehicle was marked as a media van and was used by journalists to report from inside the hospital and Nuseirat camp. The journalists worked for the Al-Quds Al-Youm television channel. The Israeli army said its air force attacked the vehicle in a -targeted manner- and that members of the Islamic Jihad militant group were inside. In a separate incident, five people were killed and 20 wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a house in Gaza City’s Zeitoun neighbourhood early on Thursday, medics with the Gaza health authorities reported. They warned the death toll could rise as many people remained trapped under the rubble. A baby girl has frozen to death in Gaza, the third to die from the cold, in Gaza’s tent camps in recent days, doctors said. The father of three-week-old Sila, Mahmoud al-Faseeh, wrapped her in a blanket to try to keep her warm in their tent in the Muwasi area outside the town of Khan Younis, but it was not enough, he told the Associated Press. On Wednesday, Hamas and Israel traded blame over their failure to conclude a ceasefire agreement despite progress reported by both sides in past days. Israel’s air and ground offensive has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry. It says more than half the fatalities have been women and children, but does not say how many of the dead were fighters.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/26/middle-east-crisis-live-security-personnel-killed-syria-sednaya-prison-gaza-israel-latest-updates	2024-12-26T01:01:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72f05a5ccbd2dadff383da682b82c435e555053e/0_189_4300_2580/master/4300.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=69afe26c36e9247d0b915814451b6dd5
Russia-Ukraine war live: Ukrainian military says it shot down 20 of 31 drones launched by Russia overnight	11 ‘imitator drones’ did not reach their targets after active engagement from the Ukrainian military, it said Hello – Welcome to the Guardian’s blog covering the Russia-Ukraine war. Joe Biden has asked the US defence department to continue its surge of weapons deliveries to Ukraine, describing Russia’s Christmas Day attack against some of Ukraine’s cities and its energy infrastructure as -outrageous-. Christmas morning in Ukraine was overshadowed by a massive Russian aerial attack using cruise missiles to target energy infrastructure across the country, which Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned as -inhuman-. The attack left half a million people in Kharkiv region without heating, in temperatures just a few degrees Celsius above zero, while there were blackouts in the capital, Kyiv, and elsewhere. Ukraine’s air defences downed 59 of 78 Russian missiles and 54 of 102 drones launched overnight and on Wednesday morning, the Ukrainian military said. British prime minister Keir Starmer has also condemned the Russian attack launched on Ukraine’s energy grid, which killed one person. Nato member Romania said it had not detected any Russian missile passing through its airspace to target Ukraine, as claimed by Kyiv. Russia’s Federal Security Service claimed on Thursday that it had foiled several plots by Ukrainian intelligence services to kill high-ranking Russian military officers and their families in Moscow. It claimed four Russian citizens allegedly involved in the plots had been detained. Ukraine’s SBU intelligence service has claimed responsibility for the killing of Igor Kirillov, chief of Russia’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection troops, who died after a bomb attached to an electric scooter exploded outsided his apartment building on 17 December. A Russian cargo ship that sank on Tuesday in the Mediterranean Sea was the target of an -act of terrorism-, according to the vessel’s owner. The Ursa Major sank while it was sailing through international waters between Spain and Algeria, leaving two crew members missing. The Ukrainian navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk said Russia faced -systemic problems- in maintaining its fleet but gave no indication that Kyiv was involved in the incident. Falling debris from a Ukrainian drone that was shot down caused an explosion and a fatal fire in a shopping centre in the city of Vladikavkaz in Russia’s North Ossetia region, the local governor said on Wednesday. One woman was reported to have been killed inside the shopping centre. Russia’s foreign ministry said Australia had been in contact about the possible capture by the Russian army of an Australian citizen fighting with Ukrainian forces. Oscar Jenkins was reportedly captured by Russian soldiers while fighting alongside Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region. Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a call with the Japanese prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, where he thanked Japan’s government for a decision to transfer an additional $3bn secured from frozen Russian assets. The Ukrainian leader also thanked Japan for the total $12bn in humanitarian and financial aid provided to Ukraine, according to a readout of the Wednesday call.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-ukrainian-military-russian-drones-latest-updates	2024-12-26T00:24:20-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7490487111a41480d6398b47626dbc5b4dc34b1/0_260_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=13edd08dff8fb15194da323a8fd58461

Calls for Labour to honour pledge to toughen anti-hunt laws	Government urged to ban trail hunting as data suggests illegal foxhunting is still widespread in England and Wales Animal welfare campaigners are calling on ministers to keep to a pledge to toughen anti-hunt laws, as figures suggest illegal foxhunting remains widespread in England and Wales. Almost 20 years since the Hunting Act 2004 was brought in by Tony Blair’s government, the League Against Cruel Sports (Lacs) – the animal welfare charity that was the driving force behind the original ban – says its data evidences how stronger legislation is required to close loopholes and prohibit trail hunting, which campaigners say has been used as a smokescreen for illegal foxhunting.

But of those 24 banned marches, 21 were proposed by far-right groups: the BNP, National Front, English Defence League and the White Nationalist party, a now-defunct neo-Nazi outfit.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/24/protests-banned-britain-two-tier-policing-far-right	2024-12-24T01:56:22-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9fd4846bf85fd47d29afdba1b905ed7ff394504/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5bdcec12ab874b0142b0b6cec5789931

More than 10,000 members of armed forces not fit to fight, MoD figures show – UK politics live	Nearly a quarter of soldiers and officers in the regular army cannot engage in combat without any restrictions Mark Francois, the shadow defence minister, told the Times that urgent action was needed to increase the size of the armed forces, and improve the fitness of people already serving, in the light of the figures it has revealed about the number of service personnel not fit to fight. (See 9.25am.) He said: Not only has the army now shrunk to just over 71,000 soldiers, almost 2,000 below its established strength [but] of those, almost a quarter are not medically fully deployable. This requires urgent action, not just regarding recruitment and retention but also remedial action, especially physiotherapy, to ensure our remaining soldiers are truly fighting fit.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/dec/24/uk-politics-latest-news-labour-tories-british-army	2024-12-24T01:34:25-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ba8e2031ab69b11f495a33ed2e623750dcf7ea0/0_377_5660_3396/master/5660.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=781feff15045ebcccd23d1feb72b0970

Middle East crisis live: ‘some progress’ made on Israel-Gaza hostage and ceasefire deal, Netanyahu says	Israeli prime minister tells lawmakers he is taking ‘significant action through all channels to return our loved ones’ Welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza and developments in the Middle East more widely. Israeli forces have been attacking health facilities in northern Gaza, as it besieges and -directly targets- the Indonesian hospital, Kamal Adwan hospital, and al-Awda hospital in north Gaza over the past hours, according to the territory’s health ministry. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, has confirmed that the IDF assassinated former Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran earlier this year, and warned that the military would also -decapitate- the leadership of Yemen’s Houthi rebels. The UN peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon on Monday said it has observed recent -concerning actions- by the Israeli army in southern Lebanon, including the destruction of residential areas and road blockages. The Israeli military says three soldiers were killed yesterday in combat in northern Gaza. The military did not provide details of the circumstances. A Qatari delegation visited the Syrian capital on Monday for the first time in more than a decade and met with the country’s top insurgent commander, who said strategic cooperation between Damascus and Doha will begin soon.

Major show to celebrate UK’s forgotten female trailblazer of abstract art	Exhibition in Bristol, the city of her birth, celebrates Paule Vézelay whose ascent was stymied by sexism and war Britain’s -first- abstract artist, whose legacy has mostly been obscured because of a combination of sexism and the second world war, is to have her first major exhibition in more than 40 years. Paule Vézelay, born in Bristol in 1892, moved to Paris where she moved in the same circles as Georges Braque, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and Sophie Taeuber-Arp, and created one of the first British abstract works in 1928, a few years before Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore began their experimentations.	https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/dec/24/paule-vezelay-first-abstract-artist-bristol-exhibition	2024-12-23T23:00:40-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04978b1c1ca8528d9b7bd2200da867d77533585f/0_227_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7bea2718ce3270575078dedc9fc1219e
Tuesday briefing: What Reform UK might get from Elon Musk’s $100m – and what he might want in return	In today’s newsletter: With rumours of the political party courting a game-changing investment, people are asking not only what they might do with the money, but what the tech titan might get in return Good morning. I don’t know how long Elon Musk spent mulling over his rumoured suggestion that he might give $100m to Reform, but since it amounts to about 0.02% of his total wealth, I imagine it will have taken about as much time as most people spend mulling over a Christmas book token for their favourite nephew. But if $100m is chicken feed for the world’s richest man, it is enough money to be transformative for Nigel Farage and his cohorts – and for UK politics more generally. In the weeks since the story first broke, a growing chorus has urged Labour to update the rules on political donations to limit the influence of international money on British political parties. Meanwhile, Reform have unsurprisingly forgotten about their general view of foreigners who don’t understand British culture, and suggested that this might just be the start. Water industry | Thames Water intentionally diverted millions of pounds pledged for environmental clean-ups towards other costs including bonuses and dividends, the Guardian can reveal. The embattled water company is trying to secure £3bn in emergency funding and at least £3.25bn more in equity investment to prevent its collapse. US politics | A House ethics committee report on Matt Gaetz, the former Florida Republican congressman, found -substantial evidence- that he paid for sex with a minor. Gaetz, briefly Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general, broke rules -prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress-, the report said. Gaza | Palestinian medics said Israeli airstrikes on Gaza killed at least 20 people overnight, including a strike on an encampment in an Israel-declared humanitarian zone that killed eight people, including two children. US news | Luigi Mangione, the man accused of fatally shooting the CEO of UnitedHealthcare Brian Thompson, pleaded not guilty to murder and terror charges in a state case that will run parallel to his federal prosecution. Education | Children with special education needs and disabilities (Send) have been victims of a -vicious downward spiral- of declining support over the past decade, Anne Longfield, the former children’s commissioner for England, has said, as she urged the government to take action.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/24/tuesday-briefing-elon-musk-100-million-donation-reform-uk-nigel-farage	2024-12-23T22:53:39-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2113ce03ca722de6fa9e64d9411abe4b45ed4be/192_60_3752_2251/master/3752.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=20dfb4099e8a0a49c7dd27de61766b47

Mixed ruling leaves Missouri abortion rights in limbo despite ballot measure	Judge said state’s ban ‘clearly contrary’ to recently passed constitutional amendment but left other laws in place More than two months after Missouri residents voted to add abortion rights into their state constitution and overturn the state’s ban on the procedure, abortions have not yet resumed in Missouri – and it’s not clear when they will, according to a key Planned Parenthood official in the region. The day after the election, Missouri Planned Parenthood affiliates filed a lawsuit asking the court to eliminate a slew of abortion restrictions that, the affiliates said, made it impossible to perform the procedure. On Friday evening, the Jackson county circuit court judge Jerri Zhang ruled that several restrictions, including the state’s near-total ban, were -clearly contrary- to the state’s new constitutional amendment and could not be enforced.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/23/missouri-abortion-rights-ruling	2024-12-23T13:16:54-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e28805a2af497093d90c3d2849a112f999b3472d/0_53_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=513dcc866944c020ac5b14dfccd6a009

Russia-Ukraine war live: North Korea preparing to send more troops to Russia, says South Korea	Troops and weapons, including suicide drones, to be shipped to Russia to support war against Ukraine, say Seoul’s joint chiefs of staff Hello and welcome to the Ukraine live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest from the conflict. We start with news that South Korea’s military said on Monday that it has detected signs of North Korea preparing to send more troops and weapons, including suicide drones, to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. Russian president, Vladimir Putin met the Slovakian prime minister, Robert Fico, in the Kremlin on Sunday, a rare visit by a European Union leader to Moscow, as a contract allowing for Russian gas to transit through Ukraine nears expiry. Russia has captured two more villages in east Ukraine, the latest territorial gains for Moscow’s advancing army. The defence ministry said on Telegram on Sunday that its troops had -liberated- the villages of Lozova in the north-eastern Kharkiv region and Krasnoye – called Sontsivka in Ukraine. Zelenskyy told Ukraine’s diplomats on Sunday that the country will have to fight to persuade allies to allow it to take up Nato membership, but has described the goal as -achievable- as it searches for security guarantees to protect it from Russia. Nato secretary general Mark Rutte said he considered the sometimes harsh criticism of German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to be unjustified, news wire DPA reported. Although Germany has been a vital ally of Ukraine, its hesitation in providing long-range Taurus cruise missiles has been a source of frustration in Kyiv, which is battling a foe armed with a powerful array of long-range weaponry. Russian forces executed five Ukrainian prisoners of war, Ukraine’s parliamentary commissioner for human rights, Dmytro Lubinets, claimed on Sunday. Russian troops shot the five unarmed soldiers after capturing them, Lubinets alleged on Telegram, without providing more details. A video purporting to show the Russian capture of an Australian man fighting for Ukraine on the war’s eastern front has prompted urgent inquiries by Australia’s government.

Locals win fight to save mysterious, medieval Spanish chapel from oblivion	Home to vivid 16th-century frescoes, the Ermita de San Jorge is on the brink of being saved from centuries of decay A mysterious, dilapidated and exquisitely painted Spanish chapel into which knights on horseback may have ridden centuries ago to receive a wet and most unusual blessing could be on the verge of salvation after a decades-long campaign by local heritage groups. No one knows much about the crumbling and semi-subterranean Ermita de San Jorge, which sits in a hollow 7 miles (12km) from the city of Cáceres in Extremadura, south-west Spain. Local experts believe it may have been built in the 14th century close to the defensive line erected to guard against possible Muslim incursions after the Christian reconquest, while the only definitively recorded date in its first centuries comes courtesy of Juan de Ribera who decorated the inside of the chapel with vivid biblical frescoes in 1565.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/23/locals-win-fight-to-save-spanish-chapel-from-oblivion-ermita-de-san-jorge	2024-12-23T00:32:16-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9058071ff317451ca6f4b78253a2c281f1c62651/0_16_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ce95de342f13dc1e765ddd478ec2eb0f

Middle East crisis live: Israel orders closure of one of last functioning hospitals in northern Gaza	Head of Kamal Adwan hospital says it is ‘next to impossible’ to obey shut down order due to lack of ambulances to evacuate patients Hello, and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza and developments in the Middle East more widely. Israel late last night ordered the closure and evacuation of one of the last hospitals still partly functioning in northern Gaza. We currently have nearly 400 civilians inside the hospital, including babies in the neonatal unit, whose lives depend on oxygen and incubators. We cannot evacuate these patients safely without assistance, equipment, and time. We are sending this message under heavy bombardment and direct targeting of the fuel tanks, which if hit will cause a large explosion and mass casualties of the civilians inside. Israeli forces have carried out three consecutive attacks overnight on the Gaza Strip, killing at least 11 Palestinians, according to Al Jazeera, which said the military killed four people in two separate air raids in the so-called designated -safe zone- of al-Mawasi. Palestinian news agency Wafa is reporting that four Palestinian people were killed and three others injured after Israel bombed the new camp area northwest of the al-Nuseirat refugee camp. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Phillipe Lazzarani, said there has been in -escalation- in attacks over the past day, with more civlians reported killed and injured. In a post on X, he wrote: -Attacks on schools and hospitals have been commonplace. The world must not become numb.- Jordan’s foreign minister Ayman Safadi is due to meet with Syria’s new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, and -several Syrian officials-, later today in Damascus, Jordan’s foreign ministry said. Al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, led the Sunni Islamist rebels who swept into the Syrian capital earlier this month and forced Bashar-al Assad from power.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/23/middle-east-crisis-israel-orders-kamal-adwan-hospital-close-gaza-syria-latest-updates	2024-12-22T23:47:52-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5958cbf0f5a47a74cbe5d4ca4c42651d4e760c5b/135_0_2803_1682/master/2803.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9829c6dd24da5b9e9da8024af63dec91

Lib Dems could force Commons vote on Waspi compensation, says Cooper	Daisy Cooper says party shocked and angry over Labour government’s refusal to spend up to £10bn on payouts The Liberal Democrats could force a Commons vote on compensation for Waspi women, the party’s deputy leader has said, capitalising on unease among Labour MPs over the government’s decision to rule it out. Daisy Cooper suggested the Lib Dems were open to using one of their upcoming opposition day debates in the House of Commons to call for a vote on the issue, which could test the strength of feeling among Labour backbenchers.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/dec/23/lib-dems-could-force-commons-vote-on-waspi-compensation-says-cooper	2024-12-22T22:00:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da06f6f0f3791081cb54666f9ffcb6e575b33ff7/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fa4f4c0deb5ba38559a5c7eede1a3c02

After falling short in a 2021 leadership spill against former opposition leader Michael O’Brien, and losing by a single vote to John Pesutto following the Liberals’ 2022 state election defeat, Battin now appears to have the numbers to snatch the leadership.

The solid gold Imperial Order of the Star of Ethiopia used to be in the possession of Ras Desta Damtew, a son-in-law of Emperor Haile Selassie and a guerrilla army commander whose capture and execution in 1937 spelled the end of Ethiopia’s resistance to fascist Italy’s occupation.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/23/ethopian-resistance-hero-gold-medal-ras-desta-damtew-auction-italy	2024-12-22T21:00:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e43a2027ab97a72059baf3c9f08e2dc0338165f/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=366193d8f8416b22d766ad704bc73657
Syria’s disappeared: one woman’s search for her missing father	Uncertainty over the disappeared is forcing many to confront the brutal reality of Assad’s military prisons The last time Alaa Qasar saw her father, in 2013, he studied her face as if he was trying to memorise it. Moutaz Adnan Qasar had returned to her after his release by Bashar al-Assad’s security forces, who had arrested and questioned him after he had led his family out of the besieged Damascus suburb of Ghouta. Back with his family, he lined up his three children and stared at them hard. The next day he was re-arrested and he was not seen again. -They told us he would come back to us the next day but he didn’t. They said he was talking to terrorists, but he wasn’t talking to anyone. He would just go to work and then come home,- said Qasar, 29, a secretary in Damascus and the eldest of her siblings.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/23/syrian-woman-search-for-missing-father-assad-military-prisons	2024-12-22T21:00:08-08:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5e68d4cd4bfa00ff867809bfa4fe867d81a0834/0_248_5621_3373/master/5621.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4e513f200ef0e575182a744cb1933ac8
