Italian leaders push back at accusations of police racism and homophobia	Council of Europe monitor reports ‘many accounts of racial profiling’ but Giorgia Meloni says force ‘deserves respect’ The Council of Europe has come under fire from Italian leaders after the publication of a report accusing the country’s police force of racist and homophobic abuse. In its latest snapshot of Italy, published on Monday, the ECRI, the council’s independent human rights monitoring body, said that during a visit to Italy its delegation learned about -many accounts of racial profiling by law enforcement officials that impacts especially the Roma community and people of African descent-.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/23/italy-council-of-europe-accusations-police-racism-homophobia	2024-10-23T04:49:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/550fa88a08f54da9e32878019e07f4dd492017f6/2812_1718_2114_1268/master/2114.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=76fb72cc57ff7763b041072949cf0222

The event will focus on the past, present and future of fights over access to voting, including the sweeping changes to Georgia’s voting laws since 2020.

Details were briefed out last night, here is the news release, and here is Helena Horton’s story. But instead Reed has spent the morning fending off a rather bizarre story about the Trump campaign filing a complaint with election regulators in the US alleging that the Labour party is interfering in the US presidential election.

Coalition’s building standards freeze could see a ‘Grenfell Tower inferno’ in Australia, Labor says	Peter Dutton’s proposed 10-year freeze to national building codes would be a shame, one industry leader says, ‘given the serious impacts of our changing climate’ The industry minister, Ed Husic, has accused the opposition of condemning Australians to live in -shoddy- homes that could result in a -Grenfell Tower inferno- onshore, after it revealed plans to freeze building standard improvements for a decade if elected. The proposal has already drawn criticism from housing experts and the independent ACT senator David Pocock, but some industry groups have also distanced themselves from the 10-year freeze to national building codes.

What does Elon Musk want from all this politicking?	The billionaire is pledging to give away $1m a day and campaigning hard – is deregulation the driving motivation? Over the weekend, Elon Musk pledged to give away $1m a day to registered voters in battleground states in the US who sign a petition by his America Pac in support of the first and second amendments. He awarded the first prize, a novelty check the size of a kitchen island, at a Pennsylvania rally on Saturday and the second on Sunday in Pittsburgh. He says he’ll keep doing it until the election on 5 November. The stunt is potentially illegal, experts say. After endorsing Donald Trump in July, Musk quickly founded America Pac and funded it with $75m. For the past several weeks, he’s been making multiple in-person campaign appearances per day, focusing especially on Pennsylvania, a swing state. These constant fights with the full alphabet of regulatory agencies has coincided with Musk making numerous public statements in favor of deregulation, as well as calling for a full-scale audit of the federal government. That idea has found purchase with Trump, who announced in September that he would launch a Musk-led government efficiency commission that would audit federal agencies for places to cut. Musk wants to call it the Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, invoking one of his favorite memes, an expressive shiba inu. Although the plan is vague on details and fails to address the obvious conflict of interest in Musk auditing the regulators that oversee his companies, both Trump and Musk have repeatedly brought up the idea of Musk holding some role in a potential Trump administration. During an appearance on Fox News earlier this week, Trump said that he would create a new position called ‘secretary of cost-cutting’ and appoint Musk. ‘He’s dying to do this,’ Trump said.	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/23/what-does-elon-musk-want-us-elections	2024-10-23T00:00:03-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a008ee15efeca203901374fb954755061463d8f/0_365_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=26ed4c6e6e831452b8da44ac6138ac7f

Middle East crisis live: Israel says it killed Hezbollah’s presumed next leader	Israeli military says strikes in Beirut earlier this month killed Hashem Safieddine Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the Middle East conflict. Israel said on Tuesday a strike it carried out in Beirut three weeks ago killed Hashem Safieddine, the presumed successor to late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was also killed in an Israeli attack last month. Israel is weighing the use of private security contractors – possibly involving UK special forces veterans – to deliver aid to Gaza, as conditions in the north of the strip worsen dramatically, the Guardian has learned. At least three Israeli strikes targeted Beirut’s southern suburbs Tuesday evening, according to Lebanon’s official ANI news agency. Two of the strikes hit the Laylake district, near a stadium. The strikes came shortly after Israel’s military issued new evacuation warnings for residents in specific buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Lebanon’s health ministry on Tuesday revised upward the casualty toll from the Israeli strike near Beirut’s main government hospital on Monday to at least 18 people killed, including four children, and 60 wounded. Israeli jets hit a Hezbollah target close to the Rafik Hariri university hospital in Beirut but did not target the hospital and it was not affected by the strike, the Israeli military said on Tuesday. At least 63 people were killed in Israeli strikes on Lebanon over the past 24 hours, bringing the total death toll to 2,530, the Lebanese government said on Tuesday. It also said that more than 11,800 people had been wounded by Israeli strikes on Lebanon since October 2023. Seven Palestinian civilians were killed during Israeli artillery bombardment of a school sheltering displaced people in northern Gaza on Tuesday, Wafa, the Palestinian news agency reported, citing local sources. Separately, at least three Palestinians were killed and several wounded by an Israeli drone strike targeting a group of people in western Gaza City, the Anadolu news agency said. Palestinians under an Israeli siege in northern Gaza -are rapidly exhausting all available means for their survival-, the UN’s humanitarian office has warned. The UN’s office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (OCHA) accused Israel of denying its requests to deliver life-saving aid to northern Gaza, as well as of denying requests to help rescue dozens of people trapped under their collapsed homes in the Falouja area of the Jabalia refugee camp in the north. Lebanon will need $250m a month to help more than a million people displaced by Israeli attacks, its minister in charge of responding to the crisis said on Tuesday. Nasser Yassin told Reuters the government response, helped by local initiatives and international aid, only covered 20% of the needs of 1.3 million people. Keir Starmer has accused Vladimir Putin of disrupting food supplies to Gaza after British intelligence suggested Russia had stepped up its attacks on Ukrainian ports. Starmer said it was clear the Russian president was -willing to gamble on global food security- after several grain ships en route to developing countries were damaged by Russian strikes, and are believed to have delayed a vessel carrying vegetable oil destined for the World Food Programme in Palestine. The FBI is investigating the leak of a pair of highly classified intelligence documents describing Israel’s preparations for a retaliatory strike on Iran, the Washington Post reported. -The FBI is investigating the alleged leak of classified documents and working closely with our partners in the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community,- the FBI said in a statement.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/23/middle-east-israel-gaza-war-hamas-hezbollah-lebanon-hashem-safieddine	2024-10-22T23:30:04-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/247c6c01ba3ac010c267a31f8f972e654527847a/0_352_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5f0b21f57b2dd335e1e2865cca77dec6
Wednesday briefing: What reforms could actually solve the prison capacity crisis?	In today’s newsletter: With a sentencing review ordered and the crisis in the criminal justice system deepening, the government is tasked with finding solutions to what seems like an intractable problem • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. If the answer is -prison works-, it now seems that the most likely question is: what is a good example of a demonstrable policy failure where successive governments have nonetheless decided to stick with the status quo? England and Wales lock up more people than any other country in western Europe, with Scotland close behind; thanks largely to longer sentences, the prison population has doubled since 1993. But while crime has dropped considerably over that period, the same effect has been seen in countries that don’t lock up nearly so many people – and about 44% of freed prisoners are convicted again within a year. UK news | Police chiefs have asked the government to make it harder to prosecute officers after a sergeant was acquitted of the murder of Chris Kaba, in a move that drew immediate criticism from campaigners as a grant of -effective immunity-. It meanwhile emerged that Kaba had shot a man a few days before he was killed and was allegedly a core member of a south London gang. Middle East | Israel has confirmed the killing of the presumed next leader of Hezbollah in an airstrike on southern Beirut earlier in October. In a statement on Tuesday evening, the Israeli military said strikes in the suburb of Dahiyeh had killed Hashem Safieddine three weeks ago. Hezbollah has not yet commented. Water | Water companies in England could be banned from making a profit under plans for a complete overhaul of the system. The idea is one of several under consideration by a new commission amid public fury over sewage in rivers and mismanagement. US elections | Donald Trump has filed an extraordinary complaint against the UK’s Labour party, claiming that volunteers joining the Kamala Harris campaign are guilty of -blatant foreign interference-. Keir Starmer insisted he could maintain a good relationship with Trump despite the claim. Culture | Abba’s Björn Ulvaeus, actor Julianne Moore and Radiohead singer Thom Yorke are among 10,500 signatories of a statement from the creative industries warning artificial intelligence companies that unlicensed use of their work is a -major, unjust threat- to artists’ livelihoods.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/23/first-edition-prison-sentencing-crisis	2024-10-22T22:59:13-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5c663ac46903ad709fb6ddf64108020934cd1c7/312_134_5491_3295/master/5491.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a3e50209c00cbe1bf18949742ba59f1a

Police chiefs ask government to make it harder to prosecute officers after Chris Kaba shooting	Exclusive: Campaigners say calls to redraw rules are cynical attempt to secure ‘effective immunity’ for officers Police chiefs have formally asked the government to make it harder to investigate and prosecute officers after the fatal shooting of Chris Kaba led to a Scotland Yard sergeant being acquitted of murder, the Guardian has learned. Campaigners have criticised the move, saying calls to redraw the rules were a cynical attempt by police leaders to secure -effective immunity- for their officers. Making it harder for the Crown Prosecution Service to charge officers, with police chiefs proposing prosecutors would have to prove training or approved professional practice was not being followed before taking action. Changing the standard of proof required for a verdict of unlawful killing ahead of the inquest into Kaba expected as early as next year. Currently the ruling is made on a balance of probabilities, the civil standard. Police chiefs want it to be the criminal standard, which is beyond reasonable doubt. Making it harder to disprove a claim of self-defence in misconduct inquiries, by changing the standard to the higher criminal test, rather than the current civil test.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/22/police-chiefs-government-make-harder-prosecute-officers-after-chris-kaba-shooting	2024-10-22T12:11:22-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d730bf6e7be4a9221083ca13fa13c535245c83f8/0_190_4501_2700/master/4501.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=205d3bc02b89f5c105c837469813d4cc

Israel mulls using private security contractors to deliver aid to Gaza	Discussion about letting private firms bid for contracts comes before Knesset vote on banning UN relief agency from operating in Israel Israel is weighing the use of private security contractors – possibly involving UK special forces veterans – to deliver aid to Gaza, as conditions in the north of the strip worsen dramatically, the Guardian has learned.

First Thing: people killed and dozens injured in Israeli airstrike near Beirut hospital	Antony Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv for talks. Plus, Liz Cheney backs Kamala Harris on abortion Good morning. At least 13 people were killed and 57 injured in an Israeli airstrike on Monday near Hariri hospital, Beirut’s main government hospital, the health ministry said, revising upwards its initial death toll of four. What has the impact been on Lebanese civilians? Israel’s invasion of Lebanon, launched 1 October, has displaced more than 1.2 million people multiple times, according to Lebanese authorities. At least 2,483 people have been killed, according to the health ministry. What is the US doing? Secretary of state Antony Blinken has arrived in Tel Aviv, where he will meet Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Blinken is expected to stress the need for Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza and to discuss securing the release of the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza. As Israel’s most powerful ally and weapons supplier, the US has sent more than 10,000 highly destructive 2,000lb bombs and thousands of Hellfire missiles since the start of its war on Gaza. What did Cheney say? -I’m pro-life and I have been very troubled, deeply troubled by what I have watched happen in so many states since Dobbs … I have been troubled by the extent to which you have women who – as the vice-president said, in some cases have died – who can’t get medical treatment that they need because providers are worried about criminal liability.- What are the polls saying? The election is essentially deadlocked. Harris has small polling leads in Pennsylvania and Nevada, while Trump has small polling leads in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, but all are well within the margin of error and all the races in the all-important battleground states remain too close to call.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/22/first-thing-people-killed-and-dozens-injured-in-israeli-airstrike-near-beirut-hospital	2024-10-22T03:58:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2280bfe6bdd09577aa6b2b45edc8262e63fb4fd1/0_171_3656_2194/master/3656.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ab5be1f7e59fd9f2c17c0b640984a551

Donald Trump urges Christian voters to participate in 2024 election – US politics live	Republican candidate claims that Kamala Harris administration would restrict religious freedoms during event in North Carolina Good morning and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest from the campaign trail, with polling day now just two weeks away. We start with the news that Donald Trump has urged Christian voters on Monday to participate in the 2024 election, claiming that a Kamala Harris administration would restrict religious freedoms and casting himself as a protector of Christians. Liz Cheney, former Republican congresswoman and longtime opponent of abortion rights, condemned Republican bans on the procedure and urged conservatives on Monday to support Kamala Harris. Jill Biden acknowledged on Monday that her husband made -the right call- by stepping down from his run for re-election. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, said Elon Musk’s plan to give away $1m a day in support of Donald Trump is a reflection of a ticket with -no plan-. The Central Park Five sued Trump for defamation after he falsely said during the presidential debate that they had pleaded guilty to a brutal rape 35 years ago, despite the fact that they had their convictions overturned. A Republican county supervisor in Arizona who refused to certify the 2022 midterm election has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. The politics writer Olivia Nuzzi and New York magazine have parted ways after she was placed on leave following the disclosure that she had engaged in a -personal- relationship with Robert F Kennedy Jr. Key rightwing legal groups tied to Trump and his allies have banked millions of dollars from conservative foundations and filed multiple lawsuits challenging voting rules in swing states. Trump doubled down on false claims about the federal government’s hurricane recovery efforts and promoted baseless conspiracy theories about immigration.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/22/donald-trump-christian-voters-kamala-harris-election-us-politics-latest-updates	2024-10-22T02:29:09-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e02c7179b7055cae5a0dab1afb6867195593e00/0_124_5125_3075/master/5125.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=339dbc5dac51515c37dee95c48240e02
David Gauke calls for end to ‘bidding war’ between parties as he is appointed to sentencing review – UK politics live	Former Conservative justice sectary to carry out review by Ministry of Justice considering alternatives to sending people to jail Paul Brand from ITV says, if the government thinks that, by getting David Gauke to carry out the sentencing review, they will get the Conservatives support for it, they will probably be disappointed. He has posted this on social media. Govt hopes by appointing Gauke - a former Tory Justice Sec (tho admittedly a centrist in today’s party) - they can get cross-party agreement on sentencing reform. But it’s likely Tory leadership candidates will say Labour being soft on criminals, and on the political debate goes. Prison works. It ensures that we are protected from murderers, muggers and rapists - and it makes many who are tempted to commit crime think twice ... This may mean that more people will go to prison. I do not flinch from that.

Muster dogs waited patiently atop barrels and a windmill slowly twirled above a pile of hay.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/22/barbecue-kangaroo-pies-and-jimmy-barnes-charles-and-camilla-go-quintessentially-australian-for-final-day-of-tour	2024-10-22T00:25:32-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38e59e756ef9512737548f808c271d4e26a128bf/1_188_2916_1750/master/2916.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a79383fc24153049a4dad64e68e49bd4

Middle East crisis live: Air raid sirens sound in Tel Aviv after Hezbollah claims to have targeted Israeli city	Israeli military said about 20 rockets were fired with many intercepted; US secretary of state Antony Blinken due to land in Israel for talks Air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv on Tuesday after Hezbollah said it bombed the Nirit area in the city’s suburbs with missiles. The Israeli military said about 20 rockets were fired in the latest barrage from Lebanon – five toward central Israel and 15 toward the north, and that attempts were made to intercept them. The IDF said there were no immediate reports of injuries. Israel said late Monday it planned to carry out more strikes in Lebanon against a Hezbollah-run financial institution that it targeted the night before and which it says uses customers’ deposits to finance attacks against Israel. At least 15 branches of Al-Qard Al-Hasan were hit late Sunday in the southern neighbourhoods of Beirut, across southern Lebanon and in the eastern Bekaa valley, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. One strike flattened a nine-story building in Beirut with a branch inside it. There were reports that dozens of Palestinians, including children, were killed in attacks carried out by Israeli soldiers in the northern Gaza Strip. Among the casualties were at least 10 people killed in an Israeli attack on Jabalia Preparatory School in Al-Fawqa area, which was functioning as an Unrwa shelter for displaced people, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. Joe Biden’s administration remains -deeply concerned- about the leak of a pair of highly classified intelligence documents describing Israel’s preparations for a retaliatory strike on Iran, the White House has said. There is no indication that additional documents have been compromised and US officials have been in communication with Israeli counterparts about the leak, a spokesperson said. Iran warned the US would bear -full responsibility- in case of a retaliatory attack by Israel on the Islamic Republic, after US president Joe Biden indicated he was aware of Israeli plans to do so. Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, called Biden’s remarks -profoundly alarming and provocative-. The UN warned Monday that almost no aid is entering the besieged Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, where a two-week Israeli military campaign has killed hundreds of people and left thousands trapped. The heads of the United Nations World Food Programme and UN children’s agency Unicef, Catherine Russell and Cindy McCain, have privately appealed to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for help -alleviating the suffering of countless civilians- in Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon, according to a new letter. Up to 1,000 women and children needing medical care will shortly be evacuated from Gaza to Europe, the head of the World Health Organization’s Europe branch said. Israel, which is besieging the war-devastated Palestinian territory, -is committed to 1,000 more medical evacuations within the next months to the European Union,- Hans Kluge said. The US military has rushed its advanced anti-missile system to Israel and it is now -in place-, defence secretary Lloyd Austin said. THAAD, or the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, is a critical part of the US military’s layered air defence systems and adds to Israel’s already formidable anti-missile defences.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/22/middle-east-crisis-live-blog-news-updates-israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-palestine-hamas-hezbollah-war	2024-10-21T22:46:43-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b57afaa3d426bef6f42da1ae0cfd5409c2c2eb7a/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3b78b6a9c225ebd88b482eea3627bce1

Honest Bob Jenrick won’t sleep until everyone sees he’s the maddest person in the room | John Crace	The Tory leadership hopeful believes that if he shouts the same things a bit louder, everyone will eventually come round to his way of thinking You can only conclude that some politicians are simply untreatable. Their egotism and self-delusion so deeply engrained that reality never gets a look in. I give you Robert Jenrick. Exhibit A. He is a worthy successor to Liz Truss as one of the dimmest solipsists you could hope to meet. After trailing in a distant second in last week’s televised Q&amp;A, you’d have thought Honest Bob might have taken a day or two to regroup. After all, if the most Tory-friendly audience imaginable at GB News doesn’t much like you then most people would reasonably conclude they had a problem. If you can’t connect with the few remaining diehard Tory members, then your chances of appealing to the rest of the country are vanishingly small.

Montana’s Senate race offers litmus test	Jon Tester is fighting to keep his Senate seat amid the prospect that Democrats like him are now facing political extinction in the state He was a young and little-known underdog. So Max Baucus, candidate for Congress, decided to trek 630 miles across Montana and listen to people talk about their problems. -As luck would have it, on the first day, I walked into a blizzard,- he recalls, pointing to a photo of his young self caked in snow. -It was cold! But the blizzard didn’t last that long.- Baucus shed 12lbs during that two and a half month journey in 1974. He also made friends. The Democrat defeated a Republican incumbent and would soon go on to serve as a Montana senator for 36 years. He never lost an election but saw his beloved home state undergo many changes. Among them is the prospect that Democrats like him are now facing political extinction.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/21/montana-senate-race-jon-tester-democrats	2024-10-21T11:00:42-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a59d2d0f6b580f777cdeb70fb6db70475c1fc7fa/0_160_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ed895c74217f0596dc9bd0126b42fbed

But the new rule would expand that coverage, allowing millions of people on private health insurance to pick up free condoms, birth control pills or morning-after pills from local storefronts without a prescription.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/21/biden-white-house-birth-control-rules	2024-10-21T06:27:05-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1af3d950800367ca9267e247d9a55d22407b004b/0_71_5088_3052/master/5088.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=607130aa2a1d7afcbe0f7a48d6433d48

Monday briefing: The Trump acolytes planning to interfere with November’s election	In today’s newsletter: From stacking election boards to purging voter rolls, we look at the tactics that could sway key states • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. With two weeks to go until the US presidential election, the race could hardly be closer. But when you’re next frantically obsessing over the odds, keep in mind: it may not be as simple as who most voters want to see in the Oval Office.

This time around, Republicans are a lot more organised in their efforts to influence the outcome – and as the Maga takeover of the GOP has rolled on over the past four years, election denialism has moved from the fringes to become a central tenet of the party.

North Carolina grapples with holding election in hurricane disaster zone	Candidates weigh how to balance disaster relief with campaigning as election boards work around damaged polling stations and misinformation In a normal life Jon Council would be holding his last campaign fundraiser of the 2024 cycle, exhorting local small business owners in Watauga county to back his bid to become a county commissioner over a plate of spaghetti and garlic bread. But in the wake of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene, which left western North Carolina reeling from massive floods that swept away buildings, downed power lines, and left thousands of people stranded in their homes, life is anything but normal in this part of the Appalachians.

Bob Woodward’s new book War is a sober but alarming must-read	Watergate reporter says Trump is far worse than Nixon and ‘most reckless and impulsive president in American history’ The Middle East and Ukraine are ablaze, the US mired in turmoil. An octogenarian president recedes from view. The threat of a second Trump term hangs like the sword of Damocles. Fifty years ago, with Carl Bernstein, Bob Woodward captured Watergate and the downfall of Richard Nixon. Now, the US sits at an inflection point once again. Woodward’s fourth book at least in part about Donald Trump is a sober but alarming must-read. War depicts an administration under Joe Biden that is often behind the curve, at times captive to its own wishful thinking. The withdrawal from Afghanistan haunts. Trump mesmerizes. Yet as Woodward tells it, Biden and his team did clearly see the menace Russia posed. Unlike George W Bush, Biden did not need to gaze into Vladimir Putin’s blighted soul. Unlike Trump, he did not feel compelled to fluff his ego like a besotted fanboy. War is published in the US by Simon &amp; Schuster	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/oct/20/bob-woodward-book-war	2024-10-20T08:39:32-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/543127b86d2e6e66437eafb6b09c31c3dfc2b3cf/0_236_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=38da297af1bcf891fa6a88bb07df6cda

Harris kicks off birthday at Georgia church as Trump heads to McDonald’s in Pennsylvania – live	Candidates focus on rallying support from battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan Kamala Harris is delivering remarks at a service in New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in the Atlanta suburb of Stonecrest, Georgia. The crowd sang happy birthday when the Vice President, who turns 60 today, took the stage. Harris began her speech by turning the attention towards the ferry dock collapse on Georgia’s Sapelo Island, where at least seven people were killed during a fall celebration by the island’s tiny Gullah-Geechee community of Black slave descendants.

Robin Hood, morris dances and UFOs: English folklore survey gets post-Brexit reboot	A fresh look at cultural identity will follow outline of 60-year-old Survey of Language and Folklore, conducted by two academics driving a red Mini In 1964, two young academics clambered into a red Mini and, armed with a mountain of printed slips, set out to conduct what would become the definitive survey of English folklore and traditions for the next 60 years. John Widdowson and Paul Smith went to town centres, ­community halls, Women’s Institute meetings. They handed the simple forms out to anyone who visited Sheffield University, where they were based.

As Silicon Valley eyes US election, beware Elon Musk and the tech bros with political nous | John Naughton	The owner of X is just one of many who may prefer Donald Trump to greater regulation under the Democrats Way back in the 1960s -the personal is political- was a powerful slogan capturing the reality of power dynamics within marriages. Today, an equally meaningful slogan might be that -the technological is political-, to reflect the way that a small number of global corporations have acquired political clout within liberal democracies. If anyone doubted that, then the recent appearance of Elon Musk alongside Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania provided useful confirmation of how technology has moved centre-stage in American politics. Musk may be a manchild with a bad tweeting habit, but he also owns the company that is providing internet connectivity to Ukrainian troops on the battlefield; and his rocket has been chosen by Nasa to be the vehicle to land the next Americans on the moon. There was a time when the tech industry wasn’t much interested in politics. It didn’t need to be because politics at the time wasn’t interested in it. Accordingly, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple grew to their gargantuan proportions in a remarkably permissive political environment. When democratic governments were not being dazzled by the technology, they were asleep at the wheel; and antitrust regulators had been captured by the legalistic doctrine peddled by Robert Bork and his enablers in the University of Chicago Law School – the doctrine that there was little wrong with corporate dominance unless it was harming consumers. The test for harm was price-gouging, and since Google’s and Facebook’s services were -free-, where was the harm, exactly? And though Amazon’s products weren’t free, the company was ruthlessly undercutting competitors’ prices and pandering to customers’ need for next-day delivery. Again: where was the harm in that?	https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/20/as-silicon-valley-eyes-us-election-elon-musk-is-not-the-only-tech-bro-to-worry-about	2024-10-20T01:00:39-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09c3f9308b486f377d732d10df725dd895414885/0_82_2682_1609/master/2682.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=640012f560f9864d863482cefea207d8
Middle East crisis live: Israeli strike on Gaza residential building kills at least 73 people, officials say	Israel says number of dead exaggerated after strike on town of Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Israel’s wars on Gaza and Lebanon. In northern Gaza, an Israeli airstrike hit several houses and a multi-storey residential building in the town of Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza on Saturday night, killing at least 73 people, officials said. The US government is investigating an alleged leak about classified US intelligence on Israel’s strikes against Iran, CNN reports. CNN reports that the documents which date from 15 and 16 October started circulating on Friday on Telegram through an account called the Middle East Spectator. The investigation is also examining how the documents were obtained – including whether it was an intentional leak by a member of the US intelligence community or obtained by another method, like a hack – and whether any other intelligence information was compromised, the Associated Press reports. Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in the seaside town of Caesarea was hit by a drone on Saturday, causing superficial damage and no casualties. Neither Netanyahu nor his wife, Sara, were home at the time. -The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake,- Netanyahu said in a statement, vowing that Iran and its proxies would -pay a heavy price-. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, spoke to Benjamin Netanyahu after reports of an attempted drone attack on the Israeli prime minister’s holiday home in Saturday. According to a Downing Street spokesperson, Starmer told Netanyahu that he was alarmed to hear about what Netanyahu called an -assassination attempt- on his life. G7 defence ministers expressed their concern over Israel’s latest attacks on Unifil in Lebanon. The group, which has been meeting in Naples, Italy, said: -We are concerned by the latest events in Lebanon and the risk of further escalation. We express concern over all threats to Unifil’s security.- The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, spoke to his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, on Saturday, reviewing US forces’ -posture adjustments-. Those include the recent deployment of an anti-missile system to reinforce Israel’s defences against regional threats, the Pentagon said in a statement. The US would like to see Israel scale back some of its strikes in and around the Lebanese capital of Beirut, Austin said. -The number of civilian casualties have been far too high,- Austin told reporters at a G7 defence gathering in Naples. Two Israeli airstrikes targeted south Beirut early on Sunday, Lebanese state media reports. -Enemy (Israeli) airplanes carried out two strikes this morning on Beirut’s southern suburbs, one of them hitting a residential building in Haret Hreik- near a mosque and a hospital, the National news agency reported. There were no immediate details of casualties or property damage. The Israeli army ordered civilians located near buildings it claimed were -affiliated with Hezbollah- in two neighbourhoods in south Beirut to immediately evacuate early this morning.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/20/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-gaza-lebanon-hamas-netanyahu-latest-live-news	2024-10-20T00:29:09-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b246cf6581f8499c451f973d3456e1fb20d1cf9/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=613cba02debc4e5f1a60d3df3d10b555

Allegations suggest India is now part of the assassination club | Hannah Ellis-Petersen	Canada’s PM, Justin Trudeau, claims Indian diplomats are implicated in murders on Canadian soil A gruelling week for Indian diplomacy began with an explosive Canadian press conference on Monday. Senior Canadian police officials accused Indian diplomats of being involved in -criminal- activities on Canadian soil, ranging from homicide and targeted assassinations to extortion, intimidation and coercion against members of the Canadian Sikh community. They alleged that Indian diplomats – including the high commissioner himself – were implicated not only in the high profile killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh activist who was gunned down outside a gurdwara in a suburb of Vancouver last June, but also linked to other murders on Canadian soil. The diplomats had even worked with a gang run by India’s most notorious mob boss to get their dirty work done, they alleged.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/20/allegations-suggest-india-is-now-part-of-the-assassination-club	2024-10-19T22:00:37-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fb5fa7bd6db8392801321bfbfda4e3d9c1a5f32/0_167_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d4b7e576e858a906e4463df0c6f7c604

Rachel Reeves will tax businesses to plug £9bn black hole in NHS	The chancellor is set to announce a revenue-raising budget designed to reset Britain’s public finances Rachel Reeves is set to use one of the most pivotal budgets of recent times to call on businesses to pay more tax to help restore the NHS, amid warnings that the health service has been left with a £9bn hole in its finances. The chancellor is expected to stake her reputation on a tax-­raising budget designed as a reset of the public finances. She has already had to deal with cabinet skirmishes over funding unveiled alongside the statement. However, Reeves is understood to believe that the public will accept a multibillion-pound hike in business taxes if it is linked to repairing the health system’s finances.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/19/rachel-reeves-will-tax-businesses-to-plug-9bn-black-hole-in-nhs	2024-10-19T12:00:24-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8da36ccb3f8006b3475178b530ee3d3f1681b03/0_178_5392_3236/master/5392.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=aa16de82005a0f45e85df58260c1a743
Protecting the Green Triangle: experts warn of ‘irreversible’ groundwater decline	The groundwater system in western Victoria and south-east South Australia has begun to show signs of collapse, threatening the water security of SA’s second biggest city Some of the best-quality groundwater in Australia underlies the upper and lower south-east of South Australia and parts of south-western Victoria. But almost 200 years of draw down for agriculture, farming and domestic use has changed the surface drainage. Underground water in some areas has collapsed and water quality is deteriorating, putting at risk not only a fragile natural ecosystem but a $5bn regional economy.

In an interview with the Washington Post published on Friday, 67-year-old Kim Peach went on the record about how Sheehy – a former US navy seal – actually shot himself on a family trip in 2015 at Glacier national park.

This reflects how many in Israel feel about the death of a man responsible for the ­murder of 1,200 people, mostly civilians and their compatriots, but ­terrorism experts have long debated the ­efficacy of eliminating the ­leaders of violent extremist groups, with some suggesting the strategy is counter-productive.

Kamala Harris joined by Lizzo at campaign event; Donald Trump rallies in Pennsylvania – live	Vice-president is hosting a get-out-the-vote event in Detroit for the city’s first day of early voting, alongside Michigan-born rapper Lizzo Lizzo and Usher are just some of the prominent celibrities backing Harris against her rival Donald Trump. Earlier this week, Lizzo revealed that she voted early for Harris, and Usher said last month that he was endorsing Harris. This week, the campaign announced a fundraising sweepstakes to win tickets to an upcoming get-out-the-vote concert featuring -superstar musicians.- Harris questions whether Trump is -fit to do the job- of president again. She used a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Friday to seize on reports that Donald Trump had been canceling media interviews to question whether he has the stamina for a second presidency if voters choose him over her in November’s election. In the past week, Trump has gone further than ever in branding his political opponents -the enemy within- and talking about deploying the military against them. The latest polling figures seem to mirror such sharply polarised rhetoric, with the seven crucial swing states almost split down the middle in allegiance. Harris announced this week that if elected president, she would fully legalize adult recreational cannabis on the federal level – the first time a presidential nominee has taken such an unambiguous stance on ending cannabis prohibition. The pledge sets Harris apart from both her opponent and her predecessor. While Trump and Biden now support some level of cannabis legalization, Harris is the first to explicitly state that ending prohibition is a priority.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/19/kamala-harris-donald-trump-rallies-us-politics-elections	2024-10-19T07:59:40-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce16be42cc8302a17dca22c7419fdf1d5fffd09f/0_150_5364_3218/master/5364.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b30849521a7fb8875ce87a04aaaaf11d

Weight-loss drugs could be key in lowering US obesity rates – experts	Medications like Ozempic ‘transformed’ diabetes care because they improved health outcomes, say experts Obesity rates have decreased slightly in the US and while it’s too early to say whether the trend will hold and what’s causing the change, experts believe weight-loss drugs could be playing a role in continuing to lower obesity and reduce related health risks. These medications – Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and others – are called GLP-1 agonists, and they were originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes. But they also show great promise for treating obesity and other health conditions, like heart disease, kidney and liver issues, sleep apnea, asthma, Covid complications and cancer, among others.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/18/weight-loss-drugs-ozempic-obesity	2024-10-18T07:00:50-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/621da27f915cd0cccbaeb4b3057265e4c8fa1f77/0_217_4368_2620/master/4368.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3ec2caf7ea1f3bb1d3d4005cffccbc70

Walking with breaks might use more energy, but dogs can’t stand it	A new study finds that breaking up your exercise is more effective, but Tim Dowling remains to be convinced Let me start by saying that I am not looking for ways to be more tired. I’m tired enough. However, a new study suggesting that exercise punctuated by frequent breaks requires more energy than -steady-state- exertion has a certain counterintuitive attraction: I can exercise better by resting more. The results of the study, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, are striking. Volunteers on treadmills and stair climbers used 20-60% more oxygen when walking in bursts of 10-30 seconds than they did covering the same distance without stopping. This apparently has something to do with the sheer inefficiency of stop-start activity. -We found that when starting from rest, a significant amount of oxygen is consumed to start walking,- said the study’s author, Francesco Luciano. -We incur this cost regardless of whether we then walk for 10 or 30 seconds, so it proportionally weighs more for shorter rather than longer bouts.- Would this strategy, I wondered, work for me?	https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/18/walking-with-breaks-more-energy-exercise-dogs-tim-dowling	2024-10-18T06:38:19-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2154b83e148c53c640b06865626b9cb2a7c92e89/0_166_7918_4750/master/7918.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=60cd059363c40c58bfcf1b40860f46e9

Labour will reform benefits system to save £3bn, says minister – UK politics live	‘We will not go ahead with the Tory plan,’ Alison McGovern says, adding: ‘We will bring forward our own reforms’ Rachel Reeves will seek to make about £3bn of cuts to welfare over the next four years by restricting access to sickness benefits, it is understood, according to the PA news agency. The chancellor is expected to commit to the previous Tory government’s plans to save the sum by reforming work capability rules, as first reported by the Telegraph. We have always said that the work capability assessment is not working and needs to be reformed or replaced alongside a proper plan to support disabled people to work. We will deliver savings through our own reforms, including genuine support to help disabled people into work.- Like all departments, the Department for Work and Pensions has to make savings because we are in a terrible financial situation. To be clear, on that point we will bring forward our own reforms because the last 14 years have been a complete failure when it comes to employment.- We will not go ahead with the Tory plan because that was theirs. We will need to make savings like all departments, but we will bring forward our own reforms.- British foreign secretary David Lammy will meet his counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing on Friday to -challenge- China on sensitive issues like Russia’s war in Ukraine, as the two nations seek to rebuild frayed ties. Lammy is the first British cabinet minister to visit China since Labour prime minister Keir Starmer took office in July. Rachel Reeves is considering raising the tax on vaping products in her budget this month as figures show that a quarter of 11 to 15-year-olds in England have used e-cigarettes. The chancellor is looking at increasing the tax after a consultation carried out by the last Conservative government. The chancellor is taking action to ensure her budget plan for a multibillion-pound increase in government borrowing to fund infrastructure projects avoids a Liz Truss-style meltdown in financial markets. Ahead of her tax and spending event on 30 October, Reeves is convening on Friday the first meeting of a taskforce of leading City figures to advise on infrastructure projects. Kemi Badenoch has criticised a Conservative MP’s suggestion she could not head the Tories because she was too -preoccupied- with her children, saying -it isn’t always women who have parental responsibilities-. Stephen Flynn, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, has written to the prime minister urging him to intervene and stop the cuts in this year’s budget. He said, in a letter seen by the PA news agency, that Starmer must -listen to voters and your own cabinet colleagues: intervene now, overrule the chancellor and stop the cuts, or people in Scotland will never forgive the Labour party-. The Home Office has recruited 200 staff to clear a backlog of 23,300 modern slavery cases left by the last government, a minister has told the Guardian.

Small and lethal: adapted drones carrying explosives ‘hunt’ civilians in Kherson	Ukrainians face new airborne threat that has killed 24 civilians and injured hundreds more since July Sasha Ustenko has survived three attacks by the Russian drones that stalk the streets of Kherson carrying fragmentation grenades to drop on anything that moves. The first, in late July, targeted a parked police car in central Kherson just as Ustenko walked past, throwing him to the ground. The second, in mid-August, hit a drinking water tanker as he queued for supplies, killing the driver. Ustenko was concussed, and came round to see a man lying in a pool of blood. The third time, in late September, he heard the drone buzzing above and sprinted for shelter under the branches of a cherry tree. He hoped its leaves would hide him but the grenade tumbled through the canopy and landed barely a metre away.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/drones-carrying-explosives-stalk-streets-of-kherson-ukraine-russia	2024-10-17T22:00:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e618ab5f4ec88fb13da30e78b93d77a316b98f12/0_364_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5100da98ce3cf05675de7bf2a5f000c3

The expert committee’s reports are based on an analysis of anonymized cases, chosen for their implications for future euthanasia requests.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/canada-nonterminal-maid-assisted-death	2024-10-17T12:51:47-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9aa0b985d1e6a257ddd708a38c2ae33b291d6c1/0_44_4189_2514/master/4189.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d018d645e29bc07741fa1c22c45cfc95
Australia news live: NT lowers age of criminal responsibility to 10; royals due to arrive on wet Sydney evening	The new Country Liberal government fulfils election pledge on ‘fighting crime’. Follow today’s news live Children as young as 10 could face jail after the Northern Territory parliament last night passed a law to lower the age of criminal responsibility, Australian Associated Press reports. After the Territory recently became the first jurisdiction in Australia to raise the age to 12, the incoming government has moved quickly to return it to 10. We know reverting to a system where it is the judge’s discretion around what to do with a 10 and 11-year-old creates much better opportunities for authorities to intervene early in their lives. I feel sad for territory children, sad because we have a government who has taken a policy position that says ... in order to help you, we need to criminalise you first. Putting children into cells ... that is child abuse.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/oct/18/australia-news-live-northern-territory-lowers-age-of-criminal-responsibility-royal-tour-king-charles-queen-camilla	2024-10-17T12:38:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41d945c04969f6afda0e04b48c95abb912890eaa/0_41_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=32e3c7fe283d099f744ab18a3fe1d1f5
Russia wants to ‘create havoc’ if it is behind DHL fires, says air freight expert	Goal seems to be for people ‘to lose confidence in the system’, says Brandon Fried after devices found in Birmingham and Leipzig Russia is aiming to disrupt western confidence if it is proven to be behind an incendiary device plot that led to two parcels catching light at DHL sites in Birmingham and Leipzig in July, an expert has said. The dangerous packages are not thought to have been sophisticated but in both cases appear to have evaded security checks.

Killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar: what we know so far	The mastermind of the 7 October attack that triggered the current war in Gaza has been killed in a neighbourhood of Rafah Israel has killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in southern Gaza. Here is what we know so far: Israel’s military said it had killed Sinwar, who is seen as the architect of the 7 October attack in Israel, in Gaza. In a statement, the IDF said: -After completing the process of identifying the body, it can be confirmed that Yahya Sinwar was eliminated.- The statement came shortly after the Israeli foreign minister, Israel Katz, also said Sinwar had been killed. -Mass murderer Yahya Sinwar, who was responsible for the massacre and atrocities of 7 October, was killed today by IDF soldiers,- Katz said in a statement. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, described Sinwar’s death as -the beginning of the end- but warned the -task before us is not yet complete-. In a press conference, Netanyahu said Israel will continue to work until the end of the war. To the people of Israel, Netanyahu said that there are -a lot of challenges still facing us- and that -we have to remain resilient- and -stand firm on our ground and to continue to fight-. He added: -We will not stop the war. We will go into Rafah.- Hamas sources told Reuters that indications suggest Sinwar was killed in an Israeli operation in Gaza. There has been no public response from Hamas at the time of writing. Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, has commended the Israeli military, the Shin Bet intelligence agency, and the security services for the killing of Sinwar. In a post to X, Herzog described Sinwar as the -mastermind- behind the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel and for being -responsible for heinous acts of terrorism against Israeli civilians- for years. He added: -His evil endeavors were dedicated to terror, bloodshed, and destabilizing the Middle East.- In a statement, the Israeli prime minister’s office said that no hostages were believed to have been present at the site of the killing in the Gaza Strip, where Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said -three terrorists were eliminated-. Some in the defence establishment had believed that Sinwar was likely to have surrounded himself with human shields as he sought to evade Israeli troops. US president Joe Biden was briefed aboard Air Force One while heading to Germany. Biden, on his way to Berlin for talks with European leaders, was being kept abreast of developments on board the presidential plane, the official told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on condition of anonymity. Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has recently spoken with his US counterpart, defence secretary Lloyd Austin, according to a US official. The call came moments after Katz announced Sinwar was dead, the official said. According to CNN, Austin was passed a note about Sinwar’s death during a Nato meeting in Brussels earlier today. Israel’s Kan Radio reported that the Hamas leader was killed -by chance-, and not as a result of intelligence gathering. The station also said the bodies found at the site were found with large amounts of cash and fake IDs. Al-Majd, a Hamas-linked website that usually publishes about security issues, has urged Palestinians to wait for information about Sinwar from the group itself, reported Reuters.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/israel-says-hamas-chief-yahya-sinwar-is-dead-what-we-know-so-far	2024-10-17T10:45:40-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f782ace6410b3e4e2b809f30da49960631597f5f/0_109_7189_4314/master/7189.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=02f8e880bc45a7e82f86ff8a24f58f97
Yahya Sinwar: ruthless operator who plotted Hamas 7 October attack	Drawn into Islamist activism as a teenager, Sinwar spent 22 years in Israeli jails before return to frontline militancy Within days of the 7 October attacks last year, Israeli investigators had identified Yahya Sinwar, then the military leader of Hamas in Gaza, as the mastermind. To their increasing astonishment, they learned that not only had Sinwar conceived of what he called Operation al-Aqsa Flood but he had planned and organised the assault almost alone. Only a handful of close aides had been let in on the plans, some with only days to go before the attack, in which about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and 250 abducted, and which triggered an Israeli offensive that has so far killed 42,500 people, also mostly civilians, and left swaths of Gaza in ruins.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/yahya-sinwar-hamas-leader-profile	2024-10-17T10:41:44-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9582842e9507a4b51fe923d634d41fd1ee461497/0_128_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e9874518b6133191f6567fcdc4360912

As of July 2024, around 11,500 Lebanese nationals were believed to be in the US on nonimmigrant visas for business, tourism, temporary work or other opportunities, with California and Michigan hosting the most.

Death of Yahya Sinwar would be boost for Netanyahu but may not end war	Killing, if confirmed, will throw Hamas into disarray and give encouragement to Israeli military and political officials If Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas and mastermind of the 7 October attacks, is dead, the implications for the conflict in Gaza, for Israel’s other campaigns in Lebanon and the occupied West Bank, and for Israel’s domestic politics are significant. There will be the war – or wars – before the killing of the 62-year-old veteran militant and the war(s) after it. One of the biggest immediate impacts will obviously be on Hamas, which has now lost much of its top leadership. Already the head of its military wing in Gaza, Sinwar took charge of the organisation after Ismail Haniyeh, his predecessor, died in a bomb explosion in a government guesthouse in Tehran in July that was blamed on Israel. Other senior officials were killed in Beirut and in Gaza, where Israeli airstrikes successfully targeted military Hamas commanders such as Marwan Issa and Mohammed Deif.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/yahya-sinwar-hamas-gaza-netanyahu-israel-war	2024-10-17T08:49:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e8deff0de4401ad0243eb5c362a2c6e0fe61594/0_0_5339_3205/master/5339.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2523b1fd7b9ccb0a28b4398ed455a74c

Tories would do better with Jenrick as leader than Badenoch, poll suggests ahead of leadership hustings – UK politics live	Conservative leader candidates will take part in GB News hustings at 7pm Good morning. Members of the Conservative party have started getting their ballot papers for the leadership election, and this evening Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick will take part in what may be the only TV event of this stage of the contest – a hustings on GB News starting at 7pm. They won’t go head to head, but they each take questions for an hour. We will be covering it live (although a colleague will be at the helm, not me). Badenoch remains the bookmakers’ favourite, but Jenrick gets a boost today from Electoral Calculus polling, reported in the Telegraph, suggesting that the Tories would do better with him as leader. In his write-up, Charles Hymas says: Mr Jenrick, the former immigration minister, would win 50 extra seats if he was leader of the Tories compared with 30 seats that would be gained if Kemi Badenoch, his rival for the top job, was in charge of the party, according to the poll of nearly 6,300 people by Electoral Calculus … Under Mr Jenrick, the Conservatives would increase their number of seats from 121 to 178, with Labour falling from 412 to 311, the Liberal Democrats dropping from 72 to 58 and Reform rising from five to 24. That would place Labour 14 seats short of a majority.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/17/tory-leader-robert-jenrick-kemi-badenoch-labour-keir-starmer-uk-politics-latest-news	2024-10-17T01:06:46-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44db73d18caaf9dc2544bbfa5a2cf47a0bf499c1/222_0_4556_2734/master/4556.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4c9e3c2456670aec1a701a0b082cece5

Thursday briefing: The £40bn funding gap, £22bn ‘black hole’ and more tricky terms, explained	In today’s newsletter: Chancellor Rachel Reeves is painting a bleak picture ahead of the budget later this month. Here’s what all the jargon means • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. I’m really sorry about this, but today’s newsletter is about the extent of the -black hole- in the public finances and the government’s fiscal rules. I don’t like this any more than you do: I’d frankly rather be writing about whether King Conker is a cheat. But the budget is nearly upon us, and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has started talking about a £40bn funding gap, when you might have only just got used to being alarmed about the £22bn -black hole-. Several of today’s front pages carry reports of planned tax rises to balance the books; meanwhile, Reeves is planning to redefine debt to give herself more room for manoeuvre. If you have found yourself confused by this, congratulations on at least paying close enough attention to notice how knotty it all is. Music | Liam Payne, a former member of the boyband One Direction, has died after falling from a third-floor hotel room in Buenos Aires.

National security | Counter-terrorism police are investigating whether Russian spies planted an incendiary device on a plane to Britain that caught fire at a DHL warehouse in Birmingham in July, the Guardian can reveal. Investigators are examining possible links with a similar incident in Germany, also in July. Extremism | An international network of -race science- activists seeking to influence public debate with discredited ideas on race and eugenics has been operating with secret funding from a multimillionaire US tech entrepreneur. Seattle businessman Andrew Conru pulled his support after being approached by the Guardian. Asylum | Nearly 63,000 people who were waiting for their cases to be processed at the time of the general election are expected to be granted asylum after Labour dropped the Rwanda deportation scheme, an analysis has found. The Refugee Council said the asylum backlog was on track to be 59,000 cases lower at the start of 2025 after the processing of claims accelerated.

That just means debt should be falling by the last year of that period. That’s it. Think about what that means: it’s like saying on 1 January, right, I’m going to go on a diet this year, but I’m going to lose all the weight in December. Nobody would take you seriously if you said that, and economists from a broad spectrum think it’s stupid. Fiscal rules are there to look plausible, they are often broken when it comes to the crunch, and they rely on the public not really knowing what they mean.-	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/first-edition-22bn-black-hole-explained	2024-10-16T22:52:24-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/658f207c0266016d4d263565e87d75db6d9e0238/0_0_6912_4147/master/6912.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=66ce1ddbc8275fd7400cccd0683df2d5

Research by consultants Africa Practice and the advocacy non-profit Africa No Filter suggests that media portrayals, especially during elections when global coverage is heightened, focus disproportionately on conflict, corruption, poverty, disease and poor leadership, widening disparities between perceived and actual risks of investing in the continent, and creating a monolithic view of Africa.	https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/oct/17/media-stereotypes-africa-higher-interest-report-payments-on-sovereign-debt	2024-10-16T22:00:06-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d64974956dd271822b5cb1d993ff4414d0849c8b/0_104_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bc806f0d15081d75be1ea5ad8dc2a731

Iraq militias step up Israel attacks as Iran looks to junior proxies	Analysts suggest proxies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen fighting hidden conflict could be targets for Israel as it considers retaliation against Tehran Iran-linked militias in Iraq have launched about 40 attacks involving missiles, drones or rockets on Israel in the past two and a half weeks, the latest escalation in a largely clandestine proxy battle fought across a swath of the Middle East. The attacks began in October last year when the war in Gaza started, but data compiled by the Washington Institute, a US-based thinktank, shows a sharp increase in their pace after Israel killed the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an airstrike on 27 September.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/iraq-militias-step-up-israel-attacks-as-iran-looks-to-junior-proxies	2024-10-16T21:00:04-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65ef6ea1a20e9b829a9b97bf90077d2153608a34/0_256_5639_3384/master/5639.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4062f0678150ac56789d0d12dff226f9

Middle East crisis live: US military strikes Houthi targets in Yemen – Pentagon	US air force used B-2 bombers to target ‘five hardened underground weapons storage locations’ of Iran-backed Houthis, Pentagon says The US military has struck Houthi weapons storage facilities within Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, according to the Pentagon. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said the US military, including air force B-2 bombers, conducted precision strikes against five hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. The US has demanded proof on the ground that Israel does not have a policy of starvation in northern Gaza as it turned up the pressure on the Netanyahu government to allow more aid into the territory. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the security council on Wednesday at a meeting convened by France, UK and Algeria that such a policy -would not just be horrific and unacceptable- but also had -implications under international and US law-. The risk of cholera spreading in Lebanon is -very high-, the World Health Organization has warned, after a case of the acute and potentially deadly infection was detected in the conflict-hit country. The WHO highlighted the risk of cholera spreading among hundreds of thousands of people displaced since Israel escalated its campaign against Hezbollah. Israeli forces have stormed the Jazalone refugee camp in the West Bank and deployed teargas, Al Jazeera reports. A young girl was reportedly treated for breathing issues. Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said that there have been no conversations with any parties on a Gaza ceasefire for the last three to four weeks. -On the prospects of the negotiation … basically in the last three to four weeks, there is no conversation or engagement at all, and we are just moving in the same circle with the silence from all parties,- he said. Shaban al-Dalou, the 19-year-old Palestinian who was burned to death in his makeshift tent when Israel bombed the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital complex in Deir el-Balah on Monday, would have turned 20 today. -Losing him is an incredibly massive loss,- al-Dalou’s uncle, Mohammed al-Dalou said, adding: -He left a mountain of pain and memories.- Hezbollah said it targeted -at 6.50pm (1550 GMT) … the occupied town of Safed with a salvo of rockets- in -defence of Lebanon and its people-. The reported attack marks the third attack in 24 hours which Hezbollah said was a response to Israeli raids across Lebanon which have killed more than 2,300 people in recent weeks. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant on Wednesday, the Pentagon says, after Austin and secretary of state Antony Blinken jointly penned a letter earlier this week urging Israel to improve Gaza’s humanitarian situation.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/17/middle-east-crisis-live-updates-israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war	2024-10-16T20:00:29-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/753f1f32bef766f63bfaef60413eddd4c5f52f03/0_322_5359_3216/master/5359.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ae5ff4da9f669001bf11778ef1ebd0c

Skeleton crew: California driver nabbed for using plastic bag of bones as HOV lane passenger	CHP says carpool lanes should incentivize ridesharing for living humans, not replicas of the body’s support system Drivers looking to beat California’s endless traffic can use designated carpool lanes, provided they’ve got others in their car.

You instinctively know when they are being sincere and when they are bullshitting. When push comes to shove, they just aren’t as smart as they would like us to believe they are. They are inherently bad actors. The only people they ever fool are themselves. You know the form. We could all tell when Boris Johnson was lying. It was whenever his lips moved. But there are the odd moments when they are impossible to read. When no one can really be sure what is going on. Are they playing a sophisticated triple bluff? Or have they entered a parallel universe where they are so detached from reality that even they have no idea what they are doing? Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions was a case in point.

Elon Musk’s $75m puts him among largest Republican donors – US politics live	The Tesla CEO gave around $75m to his pro-Donald Trump spending group over a period of three months Elon Musk gave around $75 million to his pro-Donald Trump spending group in the span of three months, federal disclosures showed, underscoring how the billionaire has become crucial to the Republican candidate’s efforts to win the presidential election Reuters reports. America PAC, which is focused on turning out voters in closely contested states that could decide the election, spent around $72 million of that in the July-September period, according to disclosures filed to the Federal Election Commission. The first day of early voting in the battleground state of Georgia saw a record turnout, with 328,000 people casting a vote in person or by mail. This more than doubled the previous record of 136,000 set in 2020. Trump will launch a bus tour of north Carolina later today. The tour will travel across the state for three days before ending at the Wayne County Republican Party HQ on Friday. Early in-person voting begins tomorrow in the battleground state. Kamala Harris will return to the battleground state of Pennsylvania for another campaign event later today, after she visited Erie on Monday. She will then head to Wisconsin to visit Milwaukee, La Crosse and Green Bay on Thursday. Trump refused to say if he would commit to a peaceful transfer of power should he lose the 5 November election, in an interview with Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait. He claimed there had been a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election, despite his supporters’ violent attack on the Capitol on 6 January. He also doubled down on his promise to levy tariffs on all imports in a bid to boost American manufacturing. Economists say this policy would probably mean higher prices for consumers and anger US allies. Yesterday Harris defended her record as a prosecutor, pledged to decriminalise marijuana and push for police reform. She was aiming to shore up support among black men in an interview with radio host Charlamagne tha God. The Harris Victory Fund, the Democratic candidate’s ‘big-dollar fundraising committee’, raised $633m in the three months from 1 July to 30 September. This was over a third higher than the amount raised by Biden in the same period in 2020, the New York Times reported. President Joe Biden said Harris would -cut her own path- once she wins the 2024 election, as he hit the campaign trail to help win over sceptical voters three weeks before Election Day. -Kamala will take the country in her own direction, and that’s one of the most important differences in this election,- he said. -Kamala’s perspective on our problems will be fresh and new.

Keir Starmer to face PMQs as reports claim Treasury must fill ‘£40bn funding gap’ in budget – UK politics live	Sources say Rachel Reeves told cabinet colleagues yesterday the figure was much higher than previously estimated Good morning. Governments engage in expectation management, and the latest example is on the front page of the Financial Times this morning, where there is a story saying Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has identified a -£40bn funding gap- as she prepares the budget, which is happening a fortnight today. In their story George Parker and Sam Fleming report: UK chancellor Rachel Reeves has identified a £40bn funding gap ahead of her Budget in two weeks — far more than previously expected — as she prepares big tax rises to patch up the NHS. The figure represents the funding that Reeves needs to protect key government departments from real-terms spending cuts, cover the enduring impact of an annual £22bn overspend and build up a fiscal buffer for the remainder of the parliament. If we get tax rises on that scale [£40bn], that really would be extraordinary, I mean unprecedented. That would be tax rises sort of three times as big as George Osborne, for example, introduced back in 2010 in the depths of the aftermath of a financial crisis. But that said that, if you are as the government wanting to not just protect public services, but significantly increase spending on the health service and increase spending on other things in line with the size of the economy, yes, there is a very big hole in the public finances.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/16/keir-starmer-pmqs-treasury-budget-40bn-gap-rachel-reeves-uk-politics-live	2024-10-16T01:31:01-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36898fbb52dc46c781c524bbdee886fc4f7036c5/0_0_3255_1953/master/3255.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c59fd9260bbf4b222e834719ea1fe50

Who are the key New Labour figures in Keir Starmer’s government?	The PM is surrounded by Blairites, from Pat McFadden and Liz Kendall to Jacqui Smith and Jonathan Powell In the run-up to the general election, Keir Starmer was regularly compared to Tony Blair. When they were highlighted by the left, the parallels were often intended as insults. When they came from the Labour right, particularly after the landslide result, they were compliments. Starmer has mirrored Blair so far in his ruthlessness towards his own party, his efforts to build relationships with business and his pursuit of public service reform. But he is also more cautious, less seduced by glitz and more to the soft-left in his own views.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/15/who-are-the-key-new-labour-figures-in-keir-starmers-government	2024-10-15T11:12:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d68930ae43654386d246219f2ce593f320a1b4c/0_99_2416_1450/master/2416.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=07c7edfd954964b124d63e3a44cc756a

Middle East crisis live: UN peacekeepers ‘must never be targeted’; Netanyahu ‘won’t strike Iran nuclear facilities’	Security council says peacekeepers ‘must never be the target of an attack’; Israeli PM reportedly tells US he is willing to avoid strikes on oil or nuclear installations Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. The UN security council has expressed -strong concern- after several UN peacekeepers were wounded when they came under fire in southern Lebanon amid clashes between the Israeli military and Iran-backed Hezbollah militants. The council reiterated its support for the peacekeeping mission’s role in supporting regional security. Italy, Britain, France and Germany released a joint statement on Monday condemning Israel for repeatedly attacking UN peacekeepers. -These attacks must stop immediately,- they said, adding deliberate attacks were against international law. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez said there would be -no withdrawal- of the UN peacekeeping force from southern Lebanon after Israeli attacks and calls to leave. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Unifil’s work -is very important. It’s completely unacceptable attacking United Nations troops.- More than 20 people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Christian town in northern Lebanon on Monday, far from Hezbollah’s power centres in Beirut and the south and east of the country. The bombing struck Aitou, a Maronite village near the northern city of Tripoli, hit a small apartment building, killing 21 people according to the Lebanese Red Cross. The village’s mayor told Reuters that the building had been rented to families displaced by the war. It was also a particularly bloody 24 hours in the Gaza Strip. Four people were killed in an Israeli bombing of a hospital courtyard in central Gaza, another strike on a nearby school used as a shelter killed at least 20 people, and a drone strike killed five children playing on the street in al-Shati camp in Gaza City, according to local health authorities. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports of civilian casualties in the three incidents on Sunday and Monday. At least 42,289 Palestinians have been killed and 98,684 wounded in Israeli strikes since 7 October 2023, the Palestinian health ministry said on Monday. Netanyahu is examining a plan to seal off humanitarian aid to northern Gaza in an attempt to starve out Hamas, according to a report. The plan, proposed by a group of retired generals, would give Palestinians a week to leave the northern third of the Gaza Strip, including Gaza City, before declaring it a closed military zone. Those who remain would be considered combatants – meaning military regulations would allow troops to kill them – and denied food, water, medicine and fuel, according to a copy of the plan given to the Associated Press. The UN’s secretary-general, António Guterres, condemned the -large number of civilian casualties in the intensifying Israeli campaign in northern Gaza-, his spokesperson said on Monday. The UN chief -strongly urges all parties to the conflict to comply with international humanitarian law and emphasises that civilians must be respected and protected at all times,- spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said. Israeli forces shot dead two Palestinians in the northern West Bank city of Jenin on Monday, the Palestinian health ministry said. According to Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, one of the men was 17 years old. Four others were injured by Israeli fire during the raid, it said. Ireland’s foreign minister, Micheál Martin, accused Israel of trying to prevent the world from seeing what its troops are doing in Lebanon and Gaza, and of working to undermine the UN. Asked what Israel’s aim might be in demanding that UN peacekeepers leave their bases in Lebanon after a series of attacks, Martin said: -essentially to drive the eyes and ears out of south Lebanon and to give itself free rein-. Officials from the US’s main humanitarian agency attend daily meetings on an Israeli military base that also hosts a notorious prison for Palestinian detainees where torture reportedly runs rampant, the Guardian has learned.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/15/middle-east-crisis-live-un-peacekeepers-lebanon-israel-gaza-iran-netanyahu	2024-10-14T23:32:03-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd6c3e06cb86c75a8c2792d766bb6d82f7fe6ea7/0_140_4200_2521/master/4200.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d69d15e79bb8d9b976891fef34607998

With Israel expected to retaliate, it is not surprising US has announced it will deploy Thaad missile defence systems As Israel’s conflict with Hezbollah and Iran has escalated, it has begun to show a degree of vulnerability. A Hezbollah drone evaded Israel’s much vaunted air defences on Sunday and struck a military canteen when it was busy with soldiers eating dinner. Four were killed and 58 wounded, seven seriously, at a location 40 miles south of the Lebanese border. The drone that hit the canteen of the Golani base near Binyamina appears to have been part of a synchronised attack that allowed it to elude the country’s well organised air defences. Three drones flew from Lebanon over the Mediterranean, and though they were all initially spotted, and two shot down, the other was able to reach its target.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/14/attacks-by-hezbollah-and-iran-showed-a-degree-of-israeli-vulnerability-what-now	2024-10-14T10:53:55-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3e2a5edb9b1d6f5a99b7450b814f311377e3acf/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=de04f6ccd61b37912884258a24f74861

US election live: Trump and Harris expected in Pennsylvania with little over three weeks until vote	Both candidates campaigning hard as polls show them locked in a tight race for 5 November Good morning and welcome to the US elections blog with a little over three weeks to go until Americans head to the polls. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris were speaking last night and are back on the campaign trail today with both expected to hold events later in the swing state of Pennsylvania. Here’s a round-up of what happened overnight in the US. A man with a shotgun, loaded handgun, ammunition and several fake passports in his vehicle was arrested at a security checkpoint outside Donald Trump’s rally Saturday night in the Southern California desert, police said. He was released the same day on $5,000 bail. The suspect, a 49-year-old resident of Las Vegas, was driving an unregistered black SUV with a -homemade- license plate that was stopped by deputies assigned to the rally in Coachella, east of Los Angeles, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said at a news conference. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump spent Sunday trying to shore up political support among what they perceived to be must-have voting blocs. Polls show them locked in a tight 5 November presidential race. Trump pledged on Sunday to hire an extra 10,000 border patrol agents if he is reelected as president. The Republican presidential candidate said he would meet the goal by asking the US Congress to fund a 10% pay rise for border patrol agents and a $10,000 retention and signing bonus, at a rally in the border state of Arizona, an election battleground. Harris held a rally in Greenville, North Carolina, where she attacked her rival for spreading misinformation related to hurricanes Helene and Milton. -From him, we are just hearing from that same, old tired playbook,- she said. -He has no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people. He is only focused on himself.- Both Harris and Trump will be in Pennsylvania later today. Harris is speaking in the city of Erie and Trump is on the stump in Oaks, a small community about 20 miles from Philadelphia. Speaker Mike Johnson said that passing additional hurricane aid for states impacted by hurricanes Helene and Milton -can wait- until Congress is back in session after the election. Three major polls were released Sunday, showing Kamala Harris either ahead of Donald Trump or running a head-to-head race.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/14/us-election-live-donald-trump-kamala-harris	2024-10-14T02:58:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7ddec8eefb0310a5c77588eb663a44ad063ef35/0_0_4639_2783/master/4639.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1bb81766efdcbaa505d1192d30d9b08b

Middle East crisis live: 20 killed in strike on central Gaza school; Harris urges Israel to get more aid into northern areas	Israeli shelling killed people at a school serving as a shelter for displaced Palestinians in the central Nuseirat camp, say hospitals An Israeli airstrike on a hospital courtyard in the Gaza Strip early Monday killed at least four people and sent flames sweeping through a packed tent camp for people displaced by the war, leaving more than two dozen with severe burns, according to Palestinian medics. Civilians must be protected and must have access to food, water, and medicine. International humanitarian law must be respected.- A Hezbollah drone attack on an army base in central Israel killed four soldiers and severely wounded seven others on Sunday, the Israeli military said, in the deadliest strike by the militant group since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon nearly two weeks ago. Hezbollah called the attack near Binyamina city retaliation for Israeli strikes on Beirut on Thursday that killed 22 people. It later said it targeted Israel’s elite Golani brigade, launching dozens of missiles to occupy Israeli air defence systems during the assault by -squadrons- of drones. The US will send an antimissile system to Israel as well as a crew of US military personnel to operate the system. In a statement released on Sunday, Pentagon press secretary Maj Gen Pat Ryder said that the US will also send an -associated crew of US military personnel to Israel to help bolster Israel’s air defenses-. Sixteen people have been killed during Israel’s raid on Al Ma’asara in Lebanon’s Keserwan district. In a post on Sunday updating the death toll from yesterday’s attacks, the Lebanese health ministry said that in addition to the 16 people killed, 21 people were injured. United Nations secretary general António Guterres warned on Sunday that any attacks against peacekeepers -may constitute a war crime-, his spokesperson said, after Israeli tanks burst through the gates of a peacekeeping base in southern Lebanon. Reuters reports it was the latest accusation of Israeli violations and attacks against the UN peacekeeping mission, known as Unifil, in recent days. In a statement released late on Sunday, the Israeli military said a Merkava tank had been trying to evacuate injured soldiers and had backed into the Unifil post accidentally while under fire amid a smokescreen. In a videoed statement addressed to Guterres on Sunday, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, reiterated Israeli calls for Unifil troops to evacuate. -The time has come for you to withdraw Unifil from Hezbollah strongholds and from the combat zones,- he said. -The IDF has requested this repeatedly and has met with repeated refusal, which has the effect of providing Hezbollah terrorists with human shields.- French president Emmanuel Macron urged his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian to support a -general de-escalation- in the Middle East during a phone conversation on Sunday, the presidential office said. Reuters reports that in a separate discussion, Macron reiterated to Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati the -absolute necessity- of obtaining a ceasefire in Lebanon without further delay.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/14/middle-east-crisis-live-nuseirat-gaza-lebanon-israel-unifil-netanyahu	2024-10-13T23:41:58-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d2f40394ccde4db6b61754216c425ac5c1373b9/0_605_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=066d7e62007993ceef15dcb104a4b128

Follow today’s news live Environment ministers to meet and discuss preparedness for H5N1 strain Work by Wildlife Health Australia more than a year ago warned the consequences of the H5N1 strain of bird flu in native birds could be catastrophic. Environment organisations have been calling for additional funding for preparedness for the disease in wildlife for many months. This is incredible news. The Albanese government is finally investing a serious amount into preparation for what could be the worst environmental disaster in Australia’s history. This level of funding will allow departments to get on with the job of properly preparing to save wildlife and stop extinctions if the deadly bird flu hits our shores. I am particularly concerned about the potential impact on species already at risk of extinction and not well placed to cope with significant mortalities. This includes marine mammals such as the endangered Australian sea lion, and sea birds like the Christmas Island frigatebird which has only one breeding site.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/oct/14/labor-prepare-for-bird-flu-health-funding-republicans-king-charles-visit-politics-labor-liberals-greens-vic-nsw-qld-economy	2024-10-13T13:28:42-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/640d29ed967035dc797aff1d8e137f307797859f/0_0_4499_2700/master/4499.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d9817a93095a09615f466bb904b59a91

Trump to hold rally in Arizona as new polls show Harris in the lead – live	Several polls released on Sunday show Kamala Harris in the lead or in a tight race with Donald Trump Good morning, US politics blog readers. There’s another busy news day ahead of us and we’ll keep up with all the developments as they happen. Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona, later today. Kamala Harris’s husband, Doug Emhoff, will head to a Get Out the Jewish Vote campaign event in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. He will later deliver remarks at a Girl Dads for Harris-Walz phone bank in Delaware County. Kamala Harris on Saturday released a report on her health and medical history, which found that -she possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency- if voters elect her in November. A senior aide to Harris, 59, said the vice-president’s advisers viewed the publication of the health report and medical history as an opportunity to call attention to questions about Donald Trump’s physical fitness and mental acuity. Tightening poll figures have triggered nervousness and anxiety in Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign, with Donald Trump making gains in the states where it matters most as the election race enters its climactic final phase, according to The Guardian’s 10-day polling average tracker. Several former Trump administration officials have warned that the former president deliberately withheld disaster aid to states he deemed politically hostile to him as US president and will do so again unimpeded if he returns to the White House.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/13/donald-trump-kamala-harris-polls-politics-latest-updates	2024-10-13T07:31:47-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c88b663cca30eb1e2087af5d1decc1f06651930/0_399_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8cc3e28a4b3c78b40ab0962d8b09ce21

Those are laudable goals, but she must fix a dire set of public finances, a tough task not helped by the £22bn overspend uncovered this summer.

Coalition wants to scrutinise ‘national security risk’ of Chinese-made EVs – as it happened	This blog is now closed Coalition would consider mirroring US action on TikTok due to ‘foreign interference risk’, says Paterson Paterson has implied that the Coalition would consider taking similar action to the US on TikTok. TikTok will pose a national security risk and particularly a foreign interference risk in our democracy. The US has taken action. The worrying thing is you might end up with a safer version of TikTok in the United States and a more dangerous version in Australia because we have been unwilling to take that action. Of course, it happened on the Albanese government’s watch. They deserve some of credit for that, but it is a credit to Australia as a whole because the reason why the Chinese government has walked away from these sanctions is because they didn’t work. So much so that the Biden administration is taking very tough action to eliminate them from their market. If our closest ally and friends think it is a concern, we should address it as well. For example, you can impose minimum cybersecurity standards that would lift the bar that all Internet devices like that have to meet, not just cars but other devices connected to the Internet.	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/oct/13/australia-news-live-politics-closing-the-gap-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-cost-of-living-voice-referendum	2024-10-12T23:38:46-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd429f2eff0e878b1815c13b2ba9db0b467b52e0/371_315_5629_3377/master/5629.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c9cf9d34c4083858f3d402c27e869b03

But his death 40 years ago, and the collapse of Europe’s communist parties in the late 1980s, eclipsed Berlinguer’s legacy, and Italy has since moved across the political spectrum, electing the far-right Giorgia Meloni as prime minister in 2022.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/12/enrico-berlinguer-communism-hero-italy-youth-far-right-film	2024-10-12T08:06:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51001b87dfb9426ff17bbd8c83e0bb2528e92ce5/0_398_5550_3330/master/5550.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0c93c2f95a98e6fe5422e1f2a1032539

Donald Trump to speak at Hispanic event as Kamala Harris releases medical report – live	The Republican and Democratic presidential candidates are campaigning with election day just over three weeks away Good morning and thanks for joining us this Saturday. With election day just over three weeks away, we’ll be covering the latest developments as they happen. Here’s a quick summary of the latest news from yesterday and where things stand today: At a rally in Aurora, Colorado, yesterday, former president Donald Trump announced -Operation Aurora-, a plan to invoke the 1798 Alien Enemies Act if he is re-elected. The law allows the president to detain and deport non‑citizens in times of a declared war or presidentially proclaimed -invasion-. Meanwhile, speaking in Scottsdale, Arizona, Kamala Harris said she would create -a bipartisan council of advisers- if elected president. She’s drawn remarkable support over the past two and a half months from establishment Republicans, most notably Liz and Dick Cheney. Also yesterday, Vogue magazine released its newest issue, featuring Harris on the cover. The photograph of the vice-president stood in stark contrast to Harris’s first appearance on the magazine’s cover three years ago – an image that was widely criticized as unserious and disrespectful. This morning, Harris released a report on her medical history – in contrast to her opponent who has repeatedly promised and then refused to do the same. The report concludes that Harris -possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency-. And Trump is scheduled to speak this afternoon at a Hispanic roundtable in Las Vegas. He’s expected to return to the anti-immigrant message that has defined his campaign. In a change of scenery, Tim Walz is taking a break from the campaign trail today to kick of Minnesota’s pheasant hunting season. He’s spending the day at the Governor’s Pheasant Opener – reiterating the Minnesota governor’s reputation as a hunter despite his firm stance on gun violence regulations.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/12/election-donald-trump-kamala-harris-politics-live-updates	2024-10-12T07:37:12-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51deb9deb203b28efc3270bed5d3f2c579c49309/0_98_2949_1769/master/2949.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=156a26cb23af415863dc8b6ae71bb642

Insurance is failing hurricane survivors: ‘People thought they were covered’	Flooding is separate from typical US home insurance and many homeowners are not adequately covered As millions of US residents begin working to file insurance claims on their homes in the aftermath of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, many could be denied, particularly if their homes were damaged by flooding. A quirk in the US home insurance market is that flood insurance is separate from typical home insurance, which usually covers wind damage from hurricanes but not flooding. Homeowners must purchase flood insurance separately if they want their homes protected against flooding.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/12/flood-insurance-hurricane-milton-helene	2024-10-12T03:00:24-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c04924d1c7ad968dfa97e8000a7cd4d1085f11ba/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f348cb93c7e42396866be3a7e84cf651

Party politics has seeped further into hurricane news, and you can follow all that in our storm blog, here. Elsewhere, much is afoot on the campaign trail. Here’s what’s in store. Barack Obama said he had -a problem- with men who keep coming up with bogus excuses not to vote for Kamala Harris and leaning into Donald Trump’s macho aggression, in his first appearance on the campaign trail for the Democrats in Pittsburgh yesterday, in the must-win state of Pennsylvania. Expect more events with the former, two-term president. The former president told the crowd: -I’m sorry, gentlemen, I’ve noticed this, especially with some men who seem to think Trump’s behavior of bullying and putting people down is a sign of strength. And I am here to tell you: that is not what real strength is. It never has been. Real strength is about helping people who need it and standing up for those who can’t always stand up for themselves, that is what we should want for our daughters and for our sons, and that is what I want to see a president of the United States of America.- Obama also condemned Trump’s spreading of disinformation about the hurricane, railing against -the idea of intentionally trying to deceive people in their most desperate and vulnerable moments-. He highlighted that lies may discourage some of the people affected from seeking help. Visibly angry, Obama asked: -When did that become OK?- The Democratic governors of three vital battleground states, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, are going to hit the trail together. Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Wisconsin’s Tony Evers plan a midwestern bus tour from next week, called Driving Forward , Whitmer’s Fight Like Hell PAC said and Axios reported this morning. Bill Clinton, who maybe didn’t set the Democratic voting world alight with his lengthy address at the party’s convention in August but is nevertheless always a big name in US politics, is going to Georgia this weekend and then North Carolina, where Trump is marginally ahead in the polls and it’s all hands on deck for the Dems. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’s vice presidential pick, is going to do a TV interview blitz in, where else, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in the coming days, Axios reports. Donald Trump will speak in Aurora, Colorado, this afternoon, a state that’s confidently Democratic these days, but the former president plans to slam it to migrants and asylum seekers again, planning to make claims about Venezuelans and crime levels. This comes after Trump again used brutal language to undercut United States allies in the NATO alliance, saying -we will not protect you- from Russia if they don’t spend as much as they should on paper on their militaries. Trump was speaking in Detroit.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/11/trump-harris-us-elections-obama-latest-updates	2024-10-11T06:52:19-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2188705ff365877450174261cdfdf97e937c983/0_60_7929_4758/master/7929.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=211f67acc154276e6af9354cf07acda7
Chemical leak kills at least two workers at Texas oil refinery	Dozens of other people received medical treatment during Deer Park’s second shelter-in-place order in weeks At least two workers at a Houston-area oil refinery were killed Thursday after hydrogen sulfide leaked at the plant, setting off urgent warnings for nearby residents to stay indoors before authorities later determined that the public was not in danger. Nearly three dozen other people were either transported to hospitals or treated at the scene, said Ed Gonzalez, Harris county’s sheriff. Hours after the leak began, Gonzalez said the area was still unsafe for investigators to enter and that officials may not be able to get inside until Friday.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/11/chemical-leak-texas-oil-refinery	2024-10-11T06:21:46-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d635f54c76201a738bab5bbd1bdac84df2d32d3e/0_114_4965_2978/master/4965.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3dd49e514036b51d2e4785291ae006d0

Hurricane Milton recovery resumes as Republicans stir up political storm	Sixteen people killed by storm but state spared ‘worst-case scenario’ as accusations fly between political candidates Authorities are urgently assessing the cost of Hurricane Milton after the deadly storm spawned tornadoes ahead of slamming into central Florida and then tearing across the state, leaving destroyed homes, streets blocked with downed power lines, fallen trees and debris. At least 16 people have been killed by the storm, according to the Tampa Bay Times and recovery efforts continue, meaning the numbers could rise. The hurricane made landfall less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene hit north-west Florida and stayed over land as a tropical storm, with an unexpectedly high death toll of 230 people, the highest since Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, and brought damage from flooding and high winds to 10 states.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/11/florida-in-hurricane-milton-damage	2024-10-11T06:15:35-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0aa3e3648abf148467a0be166775809fb50ca67e/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c608e3aebbeb8835497f2a5d8d59c29d

First Thing: Death toll climbs as Florida grieves Hurricane Milton’s destruction	At least 10 people have died. Plus, a deadly day of Israeli strikes in Gaza and Lebanon Good morning. The death toll from Hurricane Milton climbed to at least 10 on Thursday as Florida continued to assess the damage from the category 3 storm that caused extensive property damage across the state and left more than 3.5m homes and businesses without power. How bad was the storm surge? Although the powerful storm surge authorities predicted before Milton’s arrival was not as bad as projected, in some areas, such as parts of Sarasota county, a storm surge of 2.4-3 metres (8-10ft) was recorded. What is the role of global heating? It is always complicated when discussing specific weather events. But the burning of fossil fuels has made storms as severe as this month’s Hurricane Helene about 2.5 times more likely than they were in the preindustrial age, scientists at the World Weather Attribution group said. What did Joe Biden say? The president attacked lies and misinformation when asked if he had spoken to Donald Trump, who falsely claimed disaster relief funds were redirected to migrants. -Former President Trump, get a life, man,- Biden said.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/11/first-thing-death-toll-climbs-as-florida-grieves-hurricane-miltons-destruction	2024-10-11T03:04:55-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e62aff4ab7f17bf7e312fc56e9e1d2a8c6df5ef3/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ee555a4bd451b93cfce7689e2a6b72d2

The year since the 7 October attack has demonstrated just how densely intertwined US presidential politics is with the trajectory of events in the Middle East. Each exerts a gravitational pull on the other, often in ways that are damaging for both. Foreign policy rarely matters much in US presidential elections, but this year could be an exception. In a contest likely to be decided by small margins in a handful of states, the fallout from the conflicts in Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon, with a potential war with Iran looming, could have a significant impact on Kamala Harris’s prospects.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/11/the-middle-east-and-the-us-election-how-they-could-affect-each-other	2024-10-11T03:00:51-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a77a1745cea9ffb98e489c3f2fc204b41203c63/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cef7d15bf0d65f842356b126590ef20e

Tories would have to support ECHR withdrawal ‘to serve in my shadow cabinet’, says Jenrick – UK politics live	Conservative leadership hopeful’s plan could lead to many senior Tories refusing to serve on the frontbench In his interview on the Today programme this morning Robert Jenrick, who has been running on a rightwing in the Tory leadership contest, denied telling MPs in private that, if elected leader, he would flip back to the centre. But he also refused to accept the premise of the question, and so it was not entirely clear what he meant. Justin Webb, the presenter, asked him about a report in the i suggesting that Jenrick’s rightwing stance is just tactical. The story says -senior Tories have cast major doubts over the chances of Kemi Badenoch or Robert Jenrick leading the Conservatives into the next election amid growing fears over party unity- and it includes this quote. Some moderates hope the candidates will tack back to the centre ground, should they succeed in convincing the Tory party membership to elect them. One member of the Shadow Cabinet said they had assurances Jenrick would rein in his right-wing polemic if elected party leader. -He has promised me he will turn to the centre,- they said. -I suspect he has told other people the same.- I don’t know where that quote comes from, and I wouldn’t believe everything that you read in the papers. I haven’t said that, no. But let me just address the broader point that it raises. Because there are those who say that the Conservative party, were I to lead it, is going to shift to the right. I actually don’t see these labels as at all relevant. What I want to see is the Conservative party occupy what I describe as the common ground of British politics. The reason that I believe we should leave the European convention on human rights is not an ideological one. I came to this view through the practical experience I had as a minister, in particular at the Home Office, where I saw that we as a country were not able to do the most basic duty of the state, which is to secure our borders. We weren’t able to remove dangerous criminals from the country. We weren’t able to remove terror suspects from the country, and we certainly weren’t able to set up a robust but important and credible deterrent, such as the Rwanda one, because of our continued membership with the ECHR. It would be one of the stable of Conservative policies, so yes, we would go into the next election with it in our manifesto. I believe it’s very important that we do this … I’ve already said to James, who is a friend, someone I respect enormously, that I would be delighted for him to serve in the shadow cabinet should he want to do so. I don’t think the point of difference is as big as perhaps you suggest it is. There is now a consensus within the Conservative party that the ECHR is not working in the interests of the British people, for all the reasons that I’ve just described. Most people now are saying that, at a bare minimum, we need to reform the ECHR.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/11/tory-leadership-echr-withdrawal-robert-jenrick-kemi-badenoch-keir-starmer-labour-devolution-uk-politics-latest-news	2024-10-11T01:53:53-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e26cb811a465ba6b292904171da96d4483f474f/0_19_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=add2bf880e34d793f5e44113bf341d01

Middle East crisis live: EU chief says Israel firing on peacekeepers ‘not acceptable’; UN says personnel in Lebanon ‘increasingly in jeopardy’	Operational activity of Unifil peacekeepers has virtually come to a halt, UN official tells security council Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. The safety and security of UN peacekeepers in Lebanon are -increasingly in jeopardy- and operational activities have virtually come to a halt since since 23 September, UN peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix told the security council on Thursday evening. At least 22 people were killed and more than 100 others injured after Israeli airstrikes hit residential areas of central Beirut on Thursday evening. The strikes hit the working-class district of Basta and the Nweiri neighbourhood, the deadliest attacks to target central Beirut since Israel intensified its bombardment campaign on the country two weeks ago. Hezbollah’s Al Manar TV reported that the strikes were an attempt to assassinate Wafiq Safa, a top security official with the group, which it said had failed. At least 28 people, including women and children, have been killed after an Israeli airstrike hit a school sheltering displaced people in central Gaza on Thursday morning. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said it had responded to 27 fatalities and 54 injuries after the strike on the school turned shelter in Deir al-Balah. The Israeli military said it targeted militants who were operating in the compound. The Israeli military continued to push on with an offensive that began six days ago, when it sent its troops into Jabaliya, the largest of Gaza’s eight historic refugee camps and the nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya. Palestinian health officials say at least 130 people have been killed so far in the operation, which Israel says is aimed at preventing Hamas from regrouping. The military has told residents to evacuate an area in which the UN estimates more than 400,000 people are trapped. Three hospitals in northern Gaza – Indonesian, Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan hospitals – have been ordered by Israeli forces to evacuate, putting patients’ lives at risk, medics say. The director of Kamal Adwan hospital n northern Gaza said eight patients, mostly children, were at risk inside the intensive care units should the Israeli army force them to evacuate. Israeli bombardment near Kamal Adwan hospital has already caused some damage to the facility, medics said. Officials said they know of many fatalities lying on the roads outside the hospital because of Israeli fire. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, said some Unrwa shelters and services were being forced to shut down for the first time since the war began and that with almost no basic supplies available, hunger was spreading again in northern Gaza, amid witness accounts of bodies lying uncollected in the streets because of the renewed fighting.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/11/middle-east-crisis-live-eu-israel-iran-lebanon-blog-news-updates-hezbollah-hamas-unifil	2024-10-10T22:22:11-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc484b3053a70af4eff38aefdf6b9b08f17b4d44/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=57a10a93ed7c7a696036eeca160cf422

Children being traumatised at Gatwick deportation centre, finds watchdog	Assessment finds detention unit is subjecting families to ‘unnecessary suffering’ amid lengthy Home Office delays Young children are being traumatised while held at a Gatwick airport deportation centre that should be closed down, a watchdog has found. The independent monitoring board (IMB) also said the children’s parents were being subjected to -callous treatment and unnecessary suffering- because of the Home Office’s lengthy decision-making process over removals. Children are witnessing or overhearing their parents’ -considerable distress- at their expected deportation, despite staff efforts to shield them. Children are being asked by staff to translate for their distraught parents, despite having been taken from their homes and facing removal to a country they may know very little about.

Hurricane Milton slams into Florida as nearly 3 million without power | First Thing	Joe Biden describes it as the ‘storm of the century.’ Plus, US urges Israel to urgently address ‘catastrophic’ Gaza conditions Good morning. A weakening but still tremendously powerful Hurricane Milton slammed into Florida’s west coast on Wednesday night as a category 3 storm, leaving nearly 3 million homes without power, while bringing -catastrophic- winds likely to cause significant property damage. What do we know about the impact so far? Nearly 3 million homes and businesses in Florida were without power. St Petersburg has had 16 inches of rain since the storm began, half of which fell in just two hours. What is a storm surge? As a hurricane approaches a coast, the churning winds force ocean water up on to land; atmospheric pressure from the storm also helps squeeze the water ashore. Water is heavy, and it can move fast in a surge, sweeping people to their deaths, throwing boats and vehicles, and pulverising structures. This is a developing story.

Louisiana diocese prepares to file for bankruptcy over clergy abuse claims	Alexandria diocese plans to file ‘prearranged chapter 11’ after settlement with victims to avoid ‘lengthy delays’ A Roman Catholic diocese in north-west Louisiana appears ready to join 40 other organizations of its kind in the US by filing for federal bankruptcy protection as the church’s worldwide clergy molestation scandal continues reverberating, according to a letter obtained by the Guardian. But the diocese in question – that of Alexandria, Louisiana – is first aiming to reach a global settlement with those who already have pending clergy abuse claims demanding damages from the institution before it then files what it called a -prearranged chapter 11- financial reorganization. As the letter authored by local attorneys for the Alexandria church put it, the purpose of the strategy is to avoid -the lengthy delays and huge professional fees- incurred by the May 2020 bankruptcy filed by Louisiana’s archdiocese of New Orleans.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/10/louisiana-diocese-bankruptcy-clergy-abuse-settlement	2024-10-10T03:00:17-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b261e9bcfecc510212ff75eeb16ea2b8f60a774/0_240_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=47156ee7b84c74113c22dc708ecba49e

Minister strongly rejects claim from business lobby ‘chaotic’ workers bill will cost jobs – UK politics live	Labour promised employment rights bill within first 100 days in office Good morning. During the election campaign Labour promised to produce an employment rights bill within its first 100 days in office. The anniversary is on Saturday, and, just in time for the deadline, the bill is being published today. It is hugely important to the trade unions, who provide the institutional backbone to the Labour party, and, as Jessica Elgot reports in her overnight story, millions of workers will gain new rights as a result. The government claims the scope of the reform is huge – 9 million people will gain new rights against unfair dismissal, more than 1 million low-paid workers on zero hours will have the right to job security on a new contract, an extra 30,000 parents will gain new rights to paternity leave, and 1.5 million will be newly entitled to unpaid parental leave. Ministers also believe the bill will help at least 1.7 million people into the labour market who are not working because of family commitments – and who would benefit from new policies on flexible working and parental leave.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/10/labour-workers-bill-jobs-keir-starmer-tory-party-leadership-jenrick-badenoch-uk-politics-live	2024-10-10T01:31:36-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a846a541773667065d3972cd4f8bc2d4bc6951f/0_217_5413_3248/master/5413.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=935d971692845d3c1411c6400ff4cb6f

(His opponent, Tim Walz, said in a clip that’s now been spliced for campaign ads: -That is a damning non-answer.-)	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/09/jd-vance-pence-january-6-jack-smith	2024-10-09T06:59:46-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/141a9a422769d007d86584fcea0a5a1653cca5c1/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e55b94a0f2b3bc9e42e4b353ecd983b1
