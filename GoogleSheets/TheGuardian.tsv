Russia-Ukraine war live: Russian counter-offensive reported in Kursk	Moscow said it had defeated Ukrainian units in a number of villages but there was no independent confirmation or immediate comment from Ukraine Russian forces have begun a significant counter-offensive against Ukrainian troops in Russia’s Kursk region, according to pro-Moscow war bloggers and a senior Russian commander. Pro-Ukrainian observers also reported heavy fighting in part of the occupied area and the possible Russian recapture of villages. Ukraine’s air force said on Thursday it had shot down 44 out of 64 drones launched by Russia overnight. Russian forces also used five missiles, the air force added in a statement posted on the Telegram messaging app. The Institute for the Study of War said on Thursday morning that it would be -premature to draw conclusions- about the counterattacks at this stage. The thinktank reported: -Russian forces began counterattacks along the western edge of the Ukrainian salient in Kursk oblast and reportedly seized several settlements north-east and south of Korenevo on September 10 and 11.- The ISW continued: -The size, scale, and potential prospects of the September 11 Russian counterattacks in Kursk oblast are unclear and the situation remains fluid as of this report … Ukrainian forces reportedly began new attacks against the Russian counterattack west of Snagost and throughout the Ukrainian salient in Kursk oblast.- Maj Gen Apti Alaudinov, who commands Chechnya’s Akhmat special forces fighting in Kursk, said Russian troops had gone on the offensive and taken back control of about 10 settlements in Kursk. The UK’s foreign secretary, David Lammy, and his US counterpart Antony Blinken have returned to Poland after their visit to Ukraine. The pair took the overnight train from Kyiv and crossed into eastern Poland at 6.30am local time. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, gave his strongest hint yet that the White House is about to lift its restrictions on Ukraine using long-range weapons supplied by the west on key military targets inside Russia. A decision is understood to have already been made in private. Blinken and the British foreign secretary, David Lammy, met with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, in Kyiv on Wednesday. British government sources indicated that a decision had already been made to allow Ukraine to use Storm Shadow cruise missiles on targets inside Russia, although it is not expected to be publicly announced on Friday when Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, meets Joe Biden in Washington DC.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/12/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-counter-offensive-latest-news	2024-09-12T00:45:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b50bf117583c507368285b54be5163a749ce0333/289_0_1973_1184/master/1973.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=abfd9b8a2087c6dd64c9dcab0f10e7f0
Starmer to deliver damning verdict on how Tories left NHS and set out reform vision – UK politics live	The prime minister will deliver a speech this morning after Lord Darzi’s damning report on the NHS Good morning. Keir Starmer has been in office for just over two months, and for much of that time the government has focused on trying to explain to the public just how bad was the legacy the left by the Tories. There has been extensive focus on the economy, and on prisons. Today Starmer is focusing on the NHS. And, arguably, this is the most important issue at all. According to polling by More in Common, at the next election the single issue most likely to determine whether Labour has succeeded or not is whether NHS waiting lists have fallen. The state of the NHS isn’t an accident. The health service was hit by three big shocks. The 2010s saw the biggest slowdown in funding since it was founded in 1948. The next big shock was the top-down reorganisation of the NHS, which threw it into chaos for years. Then came the shock of the Covid pandemic, which hit the NHS harder than other similar countries – largely because of the other two shocks. People have every right to be angry. It’s not just because the NHS is so personal to all of us - it’s because some of these failings are life and death. Take the waiting times in A&amp;E. That’s not just a source of fear and anxiety - it’s leading to avoidable deaths. This government is working at pace to build a 10-year plan. Something so different from anything that has come before. Instead of the top-down approach of the past, this plan is going to have the fingerprints of NHS staff and patients all over it.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/12/keir-starmer-nhs-darzi-report-labour-tories-uk-politics	2024-09-12T00:44:44-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db6d795e2fe283253e125ebe262be8da0f3c8592/0_61_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=70c8d1657a063a83853383ff505f650a

Israel-Gaza war live: UN chief condemns ‘violations’ of humanitarian law after six Unrwa staff killed in Israeli airstrike	António Guterres calls Israeli strike on Gaza school sheltering displaced people ‘unacceptable’, after local authorities report 18 killed in attack Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war. UN chief António Guterres has condemned an Israeli airstrike on a central Gaza school being used as a shelter for displaced Palestinians that killed 18 people, according to the Hamas-run territory’s civil defence agency. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of Unrwa, has said that the staff who died in Wednesday’s attack had been providing support to families who had sought refuge in the school, and that at least 220 of his agency’s staff had been killed in Gaza since the start of the war. Elsewhere on Wednesday, a strike hit a home near the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, killing 11 people, including six brothers and sisters ranging from 21 months to 21 years old, according to the European hospital, which received the casualties. Hamas said on Wednesday that its negotiators had reiterated their readiness to implement an -immediate- ceasefire with Israel in Gaza based on a previous US proposal without new conditions from any party. The group said in a statement that their negotiation team, led by senior official Khalil al-Hayya, had met mediators in Doha to discuss the latest developments in Gaza. CIA director William Burns, who is also the chief US negotiator on Gaza, said on Saturday that a more detailed ceasefire proposal would be made in the next several days. The previous proposal put forward by president Joe Biden in June laid out a three-phase ceasefire in return for the release of Israeli hostages. However lingering issues, including control of the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow stretch of land on Gaza’s border with Egypt, remain. Joe Biden has described the Israel Defense Force’s fatal shooting of the Turkish American protester Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi as -totally unacceptable- in his first extensive comments on her death. In a statement on Wednesday, Biden said that Israel had -acknowledged responsibility- for Eygi’s death, but he stopped short of backing the demands put out by Eygi’s family and other human rights advocates for an independent inquiry into the fatal shooting of the American activist at a protest in the West Bank town of Beita last week.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/12/israel-gaza-war-unrwa-middle-east-hamas-latest-news	2024-09-11T23:17:46-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a381f3fc35c00b987cbc4cd429e55064e4822ac/0_164_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0baa61c40137efac4c38b79dea355f3b

Thursday briefing: How the long-awaited renters’ reform bill could transform housing as we know it	In today’s newsletter: Labour’s new plans aim to shut the door on unscrupulous landlords. But what will change for the millions of people renting? • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. In 2019, Theresa May’s Conservative party pledged to end no-fault evictions (that is, where landlords oust tenants without giving a reason), and introduced the first iteration of the renters’ reform bill. But pressure from lobbyists, interest groups and Tory backbenchers who were themselves landlords led to countless delays and the eventual watering down of the proposals. Charities and advocacy groups expressed concern about the sloth-like progress of the bill, but that did little to hurry the previous government. US election 2024 | Donald Trump’s campaign was in damage control mode on Wednesday amid widespread dismay among supporters over a presidential debate performance that saw Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, repeatedly goad him into going wildly off-message and missing apparent opportunities to tackle her on policy.

Following his announcement the government would introduce legislation to ban younger teens and children from social media by the end of the year, Anthony Albanese wrote in a Wednesday opinion piece in the Herald Sun that the response had been led by -many mums and dads … pushing for change-, and a -strong campaign- from the paper.

Harris was strongest at debate when talking about abortion while Trump relied on tired old lies	Harris spoke passionately about women’s personal experiences post-Roe, as Trump repeated his usual extreme rhetoric Throughout his 2024 campaign for president, Donald Trump has avoided giving straight, consistent or accurate answers to questions about abortion – and in his first debate appearance against Kamala Harris, Trump kept up that streak. Moderators introduced abortion, one of the biggest issues in the election, by asking about the most recent example of Trump’s incoherence on the topic: his position on a Florida ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights into the state’s constitution. Over the last few weeks, Trump initially suggested that he would vote in favor of the measure – which would restore abortion rights in a state that has banned the procedure past six weeks of pregnancy – before quickly backtracking amid outrage from his anti-abortion base.

Europe watches Harris-Trump debate for clues on direction US may take	Diplomats most struck by Republican’s refusal to say whether he wanted Ukraine to defeat Vladimir Putin The TV debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump was as keenly watched by European diplomats and politicians as US voters, eager to see who may be next in the White House and – crucially – the direction a vital ally may next take. One diplomat said they empathised when Harris adopted a series of poses that ranged from pity, bemusement and genuine curiosity about what craziness would emerge from Trump’s mouth next as she listened to his conspiracy-laden theories. However, the diplomat said they still did not underestimate Trump and the hold he had over one part of a divided America, adding: -Never write him off.-	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/11/harris-trump-debate-europe-diplomats-us-ukraine-putin	2024-09-11T04:49:00-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/218ce4917cc917b68492f3a6847a51ae91aada40/0_142_5740_3446/master/5740.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0e2605d7198adcbde795362c3b8c1791

Harris comes out swinging in presidential debate | First Thing	Kamala Harris kept Donald Trump on the defensive as he devolved into bizarre and false tangents about crowd sizes, abortion and immigration. Plus: how to get a better night’s sleep Good morning. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump faced off in a presidential debate in Philadelphia on Tuesday, with Harris landing a number of blows as Trump spouted bizarre falsehoods about abortion and immigration. What were the most memorable moments? After Harris wrapped one remark with a jab about Trump’s crowd sizes, Trump began to ramble – about immigrants eating people’s pets. -In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats,- said Trump. -They’re eating the pets of the people that live there.- ABC moderators interjected to say that the city manager of Springfield, Ohio, told the network there were no credible reports of specific claims of pets being harmed by individuals within the immigrant community. How did the moderators do? ABC’s moderators David Muir and Linsey Daviswere largely praised for factchecking Trump’s falsehoods and rerouting discussions back to the questions. When Trump falsely accused Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, of calling for abortion in the ninth month and -execution after birth-, Davis responded: -There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it’s born.- Another boost for Harris: After the debate concluded, superstar Taylor Swift endorsed Harris on Instagram, signing the post as -childless cat lady- in a jab at misogynistic comments made by the Republican vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/11/first-thing-kamla-harris-comes-out-swinging-in-presidential-debate-donald-trump	2024-09-11T03:12:58-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/084f25597fc1fa122c698721c495516ba33240c2/0_286_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=422b71d618418c4d2094199d10ff04af

The chain of communications, released by the ACT supreme court on Wednesday, revealed Sofronoff had sent transcripts of inquiry conversations and other -strictly confidential- information to Albrechtsen. The Australian columnist sent Sofronoff a meme that likened him to The Wolf, a fixer character in Quentin Tarantino’s movie Pulp Fiction.

Keir Starmer to face PMQs as latest figures show economy stalling over summer – UK politics live	Prime minister faces Rishi Sunak after figures show growth is flatlining Good morning. Keir Starmer faces PMQs later today. It is only his third as prime minister, but there is not much novelty factor left, perhaps because his non-performative, serious, ‘government of service’ focus has been evident for some years. This afternoon he is likely to face more questions about the decision to means-test the winter fuel payment. But growth figures out this morning are also important – not because they reflect badly on the government (Labour was not even in office at the start of July), but because they illustrate the size of the challenge it faces. Starmer and Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, say boosting growth is their top priority. But this morning’s figures show that, in July, there was no growth at all. It was the second month in a row where the economy flatlined.

Wednesday briefing: Trump takes the bait on night that could transform the presidential race	In today’s newsletter: His advisors wanted him to tie Harris to the Biden administration – but instead he lost his temper. Here are the key moments • Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition Good morning. If you had a sinking feeling on June 28 when you woke up to the news that Joe Biden had turned in an utterly incoherent debate performance, you will probably have a bit more appetite for your boiled egg this time. A few hours ago, the only scheduled debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris came to an end – and even Fox News said Harris won. Democrats’ moods can only have been improved by the news, a few minutes after it ended, that Taylor Swift had endorsed Harris, and signed her post -childless cat lady-. And CNN’s snap poll suggested that voters thought Harris won by a margin of 63% to 37% – nearly as big a margin as Trump achieved over Biden last time around. Key to Harris’ success was baiting her opponent into rants on marginal topics, instead of talking about the issues that voters are interested in. Winter fuel allowance | MPs have voted to remove the winter fuel allowance from all but the poorest pensioners in England and Wales. Just one Labour MP, Jon Trickett, voted for the opposition motion but 52 abstained – at the higher end of predictions. Conservatives | Mel Stride has been knocked out of the race to succeed Rishi Sunak as Conservative party leader after the second round of voting by MPs. On Tuesday, the former work and pensions secretary became the second casualty in the weeks-long leadership contest, which is due to culminate in early November.

English Heritage asks public for help to recover London’s ‘lost’ plaques	War damage, demolition and refurbishment blamed for disappearing roundels now themselves part of history The very first commemorative blue plaque was awarded in 1867, in honour of the poet Lord Byron at his house and birthplace in Holles Street, near Cavendish Square in London. But the plaque – the first in a long, prestigious tradition of recognising some of the most influential figures in history – was lost when the house was demolished in 1889.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/sep/11/english-heritage-asks-public-for-help-to-recover-londons-lost-plaques	2024-09-10T16:01:55-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7729b0f6a5d4946c204ea87dfc133e1333d6cd65/0_153_2040_1224/master/2040.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=85c2f68aad390591bec73aad4b64c50b
UK arms donated to Ukraine would cost £2.71bn to replace, says watchdog	Figure is largely in addition to £7.8bn committed since Russia’s invasion, says National Audit Office report Britain has donated arms and equipment to Ukraine that would cost £2.71bn to replace, largely in addition to the £7.8bn committed by prime ministers since Russia’s full-scale invasion, according to a National Audit Office report. The cost of replacing missiles, artillery and other munitions also significantly exceeds their £171.5m value on the government’s books, because the Ministry of Defence wants to replace the old weapons supplied at current prices.	https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/sep/11/uk-arms-donated-to-ukraine-would-cost-271bn-to-replace-says-watchdog	2024-09-10T16:00:54-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60dd72361bf2067e051bc32575332be8add50aee/0_116_8070_4842/master/8070.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0676454f96437ff6306d25d6895971b4
Trump-Harris debate live: presidential nominees to face off in high-stakes showdown	Harris and Trump expected to go on attack when debate kicks off at 9pm ET, as polls show one of tightest US election races ever Good evening, US politics blog readers, and thanks for joining us as we cover tonight’s debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, which we expect to be a milestone in what has already been a historically tumultuous presidential race. The two contenders are set to square off for 90 minutes at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, with ABC News hosting and their anchors, David Muir and Linsey Davis, moderating. The Democratic and Republican candidates are meeting as polls indicate a neck-in-neck race between them, particularly in the seven swing states expected to decide the winner. This will be Harris’s first debate against Trump since she became the Democratic standard bearer. Joe Biden and Trump faced off in June, but the president put in such a poor showing that it sparked a plunge in his poll numbers and a Democratic pressure campaign that contributed to his decision to end his bid for a second term. Though Harris has been vice-president since 2021, she has done only one formal interview since launching her presidential campaign, and polls have indicated that voters are looking to find out more about her plans, if elected. This debate could present her with the opportunity to do that – while, for Trump, he’ll be given the chance to make the case for his return to the White House. Will either candidate deliver a knockout blow to the other? Biden certainly received one when he encountered Trump just over two months ago, though he was far from the only candidate to emerge from a debate with their campaign hanging by a thread. Will Trump say something insensitive about Harris’s racial identity? Just days after she launched her campaign, the former president claimed that the vice-president was not really Black, sparking outrage. What will Harris say about her policies? She inherited a campaign from Biden, but has slowly deviated from some of his proposals. Look out for anything she has to say about US support to Israel, and her previous stances toward immigration – a subject Trump is sure to bring up.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/10/harris-trump-presidential-debate-updates	2024-09-10T15:44:31-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dee6de38a9282a6105cc4a04617a2016276d0d3e/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b35e7fbf64d30a0fe9ba02a62582d59b

‘We’ll get the blame’: tensions simmer within Labour over winter fuel cut	While Commons rebellion was small-scale, behind the scenes, anger over handling of the policy is said to run high In the end, the vote to cut the winter fuel allowance passed easily. Hundreds of loyalist Labour MPs tramped through the lobbies to back the government’s controversial plan. No 10 will hope the heat has gone out of the issue. But despite dodging a major rebellion, plenty in government were not taking much comfort from the result. Scores of MPs abstained in silent protest, fearful that they could be condemning vulnerable pensioners to a cold, hard winter.	https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/sep/10/well-get-the-blame-tensions-simmer-within-labour-over-winter-fuel-cut	2024-09-10T11:58:09-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1895b6f9ce49a0114456543ccf6853d86136aa0b/0_2_3357_2015/master/3357.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=63f170d3e3f3d15aebf470d7d063bef3
Family of Ethel Rosenberg say US document proves she was no Soviet spy	Sons whose mother was executed with her husband Julius in 1953 say newly released document proves innocence The family of Ethel Rosenberg, who was sent to the electric chair along with her husband, Julius, in 1953 after being convicted of spying for the Soviets at the height of the Red Scare, have called on Joe Biden to formally exonerate her after a newly released document appeared to show that the US government knew she was not a spy. The couple maintained their innocence until the end and the case of the Rosenbergs has long been seen as a possible miscarriage of justice. Though most historians see Julius Rosenberg as a real Soviet spy, questions about Ethel Rosenberg’s role have lingered and their sons, Robert and Michael Meeropol, have long campaigned in their family’s cause.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/10/ethel-rosenberg-soviet-spy-new-evidence	2024-09-10T11:54:15-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/feff2c823c1ff9388af862e2dd64f2f92fe7ff5f/0_384_2008_1204/master/2008.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=03f0cda00c2c53121770d8bb94c1ba64

He was elected on a promise to lift sanctions and develop more balanced relations with the east and west, especially Europe.

First Thing: Harris and Trump make final preparations as Philadelphia debate looms	Polls neck and neck as the presidential candidates prepare to clash in Tuesday’s ABC debate. Plus, inside the global organ trade Good morning. At 9pm EST tonight, on a debate stage in Philadelphia, weeks of rigorous preparation and breathless analysis will be road-tested with reality, as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump go head-to-head in their first presidential debate.

‘We are all Jenin together’: West Bank city seeks normality after IDF’s deadly raids	Palestinians go back to work but struggle to see positive future after destruction of Israel’s 10-day raid that killed 21 in city In the occupied West Bank city of Jenin, residents are struggling to return to normality after the longest – and deadliest – Israeli military operation in the area for 20 years. On Sunday, the start of the working week, traffic choked the city centre for the first time in nearly two weeks after roads were repaired; street vendors sold peaches and the first of the season’s pomegranates as the city slowly came back to life. But in some places, sewage still flowed through streets dug up by military bulldozers. Many burnt-out buildings showed signs of fierce fighting, the upper floors now peppered with bullet holes and broken windows. Water and electricity infrastructure was severely damaged, and it is not clear when these services will be restored.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/10/jenin-west-bank-normality-idf-israel-deadly-raids	2024-09-09T21:00:38-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5248d890eb52522c284331a36c4bce089aea6e93/0_550_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=230386181c3f9f91148258fa49a29798

DoJ warns states over voter purges – as it happened	Pew report says 49% of voters would choose Harris, with the same number planning to vote for Trump; justice officials remind states about voting laws The statement of support for Kamala Harris by a group of retired top military officials comes a day before the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, and the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, will host a congressional gold medal ceremony honoring the 13 service members killed in the chaotic 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal. Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans have tried to blame Harris for the Afghanistan pullout, including in a report by House GOP lawmakers today. Our investigation reveals the Biden-Harris administration had the information and opportunity to take necessary steps to plan for the inevitable collapse of the Afghan government. At each step of the way, however, the administration picked optics over security. Without involving the Afghan government, he and his administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban that freed 5,000 Taliban fighters and allowed them to return to the battlefield. This chaotic approach severely hindered the Biden-Harris administration’s ability to execute the most orderly withdrawal possible and put our service members and our allies at risk.	https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/09/trump-harris-presidential-debate-election-latest-updates	2024-09-09T15:59:56-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b37b1f5c23d472eae975f0b6381b9599ea3ae4a7/0_104_4639_2783/master/4639.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=37a29180bf181d8f6a97df5c0f5510b0

Middle East crisis: Israeli strikes on Syria kill at least 25 people, war monitor says – as it happened	Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the dead include civilians as well as soldiers and ‘Syrians working with pro-Iran groups’ The UN human rights chief has said that ending the war in Gaza is a priority and asked countries to act on what he called Israel’s -blatant disregard- for international law in the occupied Palestinian territories. -States must not – cannot – accept blatant disregard for international law, including binding decisions of the (UN) security council and orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), neither in this nor any other situation,- the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Turk, said in a speech at the opening of the UN human rights council in Geneva. The court considers that the violations by Israel of the prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force and of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination have a direct impact on the legality of the continued presence of Israel, as an occupying power, in the occupied Palestinian territory. The sustained abuse by Israel of its position as an occupying power, through annexation and an assertion of permanent control over the occupied Palestinian territory and continued frustration of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, violates fundamental principles of international law and renders Israel’s presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful.

Weather tracker: Francine looking likely to be next Atlantic hurricane	An area of low pressure in the Gulf of Mexico is moving landward, and is expected to bring intense rainfall Francine could soon be the next to be ticked off the list of Atlantic hurricane storm names this week. On Friday, a broad area of low pressure emerged in the Gulf of Mexico, designated as Invest 91L. An -invest- – a shorthand for -investigative area- – refers to a region of atmospheric disturbance, characterised by low pressure and thunderstorms, and is closely monitored for its potential to evolve into a tropical cyclone. Invest 91L is anticipated to encounter more favourable environmental conditions as it progresses northward over the coming days, meandering along the eastern coasts of Mexico and Texas. The National Hurricane Center has now labelled this as a potential tropical cyclone, and it is expected to reach hurricane status before reaching the Gulf coast of the US. It advises that hurricane and storm surge watches will probably be issued on Monday for coastal parts of Texas and Louisiana, with the impacts expected to be felt from Tuesday night.	https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/weather-tracker-francine-likely-atlantic-hurricane	2024-09-09T01:29:21-07:00	https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24cc1827e84491c0c221ac628bc03071cdb1fd63/0_52_3168_1900/master/3168.jpg?width=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1a9b1687edb0a93e205a820382e25175
