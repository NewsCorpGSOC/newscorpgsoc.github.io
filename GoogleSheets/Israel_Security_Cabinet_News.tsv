IDF Spokesman: *Statement of the IDF Spokesman to foreign media: ...	IDF Spokesman: *Statement of the IDF Spokesman to Foreign Media: "Since the beginning of the war, the terrorist organizations Hamas and Islamic Jihad have been systematically exploiting the population and civilian infrastructure in Gaza for terrorist activities against the State of Israel" *According to various intelligence indications, there is There is a high probability that the commander of the Central Camps Brigade of the GAP terrorist organization, Ashraf Juda, was at the military headquarters at the 'Al-Taba'in' school that was attacked. It is not yet clear whether he was injured in the attack. Attached is the statement of the IDF spokesman, Lt. Col. Daniel Hagari, regarding the attack on the military headquarters at the 'Al-Taba'in' school: https://we.tl/t-g1Lfh272MrTranscript: "Since the beginning of the war, the terrorist organizations Hamas and Islamic Jihad systematically exploit the population and civilian infrastructure in Gaza for terrorist activity against the State of Israel. They do this through a massive network of underground tunnels, which pass under villages, hospitals, mosques, schools and UN facilities, and are used terrorists to command attacks, store weapons and hold Israeli hostages. This also includes hospitals throughout the Gaza Strip, which Hamas and Islamic Jihad have repeatedly infiltrated and used for military purposes, and terrorist tunnel shafts have been found in them. In recent months, Hamas has been focusing on exploiting buildings Safar, which often houses civilians, and uses them as military facilities, command and control centers, to store weapons and carry out terrorist activity. Over the past few weeks, our intelligence has closely followed an active Hamas and Islamic Jihad military facility, where approximately 24 Hamas militants were operating and the Islamic Jihad. Today we published the names of 19 of the terrorists who operated in this compound. We also have intelligence indications that the terrorist Ashraf Juda, commander of the Central Camp Brigade of the Islamic Jihad, was in the compound. This military facility was embedded within the Al-Taba'in school building in Gaza City. After we received clear intelligence information about the threat posed by the terrorists, and in accordance with international law, we took many steps to reduce the risk to civilians, including the use of aerial surveillance before the attack and the choice of very precise weapons, to prevent harm to civilians. Earlier this morning, the IDF carried out a precision strike against the terrorists in one specific building in the compound. In the area where, according to our intelligence, no women and children were present. In the video published by us today, you can see that the compound is still intact, and that there are no significant craters or damage to the main building in the compound. This pattern, of systematic exploitation of schools for military activity by Hamas and Islamic Jihad, is dangerous Both Gazan and Israeli citizens, and it must be condemned by the international community. Following the attack, the government information office in Gaza, run by Hamas, published an unverified casualty count - which has since been shared around the world. These figures do not distinguish between terrorists and civilians, and do not match the information in the hands of the IDF. Yahya Sanwar, the architect of the massacre on October 7, the day when Hamas brutally massacred innocent Israelis and led to this war, and the man appointed last week as the political leader of Hamas, declared himself that: "The number of Gazan deaths is higher , serves Hamas's war aims. Israel considers harming civilians a tragedy, and Hamas sees harming civilians as a strategy. The IDF will continue to act in accordance with international law, with the aim of dismantling Hamas' military capabilities and in order to bring home all 115 of our abductees - men, women , children and old people, who have been held in Gaza for over 300 days, in horrific conditions. We are working to create the conditions to bring them home. We call on the international community to do everything they can to realize this goal.

Remember that this is a different threat than missile fire, but the way to defend against it is the same: enter the protected area and wait 10 minutes, unless another warning is received. If the aircraft changes its position, a warning will be received according to the relevant area where there is danger. Please note - unlike missile fire, an aircraft may pass over several different warning areas and therefore may be intercepted or exploded in a different area from the original area where the first warning was received. This is why you may receive a warning of hostile aircraft intrusion, but not hear the explosion. Obey the directives of the Home Front Command, they save lives.	https://t.me/News_cabinet_news/151757	2024-08-10T10:17:30-07:00
