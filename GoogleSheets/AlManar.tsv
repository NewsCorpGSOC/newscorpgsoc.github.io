Hezbollah: Islamic Resistance Fire at ‘Israel’ Won’t Be Limited t...	The Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance issued a key statement late Tuesday to warn the Zionist enemy that the Resistance leadership's command and control system has returned stronger and more resilient than ever. The Islamic Resistance confirmed the remarks made by Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General, Sheikh Naim Qassem, regarding the readiness of the rocket force to target any location in occupied Palestine as determined by the Resistance leadership through a command and control system that has returned stronger and more resilient than ever. 'The continued aggression of the 'Israeli' enemy against our honorable people in all parts of steadfast Lebanon will make Haifa and elsewhere, for the rockets of the Resistance, akin to Kiryat Shmona, Metula, and other border settlements with Lebanon.' Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem stressed on Tuesday that the Lebanese resistance group’s chain of command is fine and that its military capabilities are solid, as he vowed that the resistance will emerge victorious against the Israeli enemy. Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem in a televised speech via Al-Manar (October 8, 2024). This was evidenced by what the enemy and its settlers witnessed in Haifa and its surroundings today, Tuesday, the statement added. 'The Islamic Resistance sees and hears where this enemy least expects it, and its hand is capable of reaching wherever it desires in occupied Palestine. Its fire directed at the Zionist depth will not be limited to rockets or suicide drones.' Our valiant fighters continue to confront every attempt by the elite Zionist soldiers to advance and occupy some southern villages at the front line with occupied Palestine, in a heroic battle unprecedented in this enemy's wars, the statement confirmed. 'They have even resorted to hiding behind UNIFIL positions and in paths not visible to the Lebanese side, and thus far, they have failed to penetrate our steadfast villages, suffering heavy losses exceeding 35 killed and 200 injured among their elite officers and soldiers.' 'We reiterate what we stated in the early days of this heroic battle: what this enemy witnesses from our fighters is just a glimpse of the firm strength awaiting it wherever it treads in southern Lebanon.' The statement also addressed the resistance supporters with sincere words, underlining the role in emerging victorious from this battle. 'To our honorable people, you are in the hearts of every fighter among us. You are our stronghold that humiliates this enemy, you are the cries of Takbeer in the field, and you are the prayer for victory that we draw closer to Allah with. O our people, you are the secret of our resilience and dignity, and all victories. We know that you are people of patience, sacrifice, and loyalty. From you, we draw all our determination and strength, and with your prayers, we rally our spirits and fight with pride.' Beloved Gaza was further addressed by the Islamic Resistance command which reiterated commitment to the support of the steadfast Palestinian people in Gaza and their valiant and honorable resistance. 'This is the legacy of the Master of Martyrs all the way to Al-Quds (may he be sanctified), and it is a trust upon our shoulders. We are worthy of this trust, with God's permission, until our last breath.' Hezbollah Military Media released a video to mark the first anniversary of the Islamic Resistance battle in support of Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2224917	2024-10-08T13:30:59-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-02313730017284200797.png

Sheikh Qassem: Hezbollah’s Military Capabilities Solid, Will Emer...	Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem stressed on Tuesday that the Lebanese resistance group’s chain of command is fine and that its military capabilities are solid, as he vowed that the resistance will emerge victorious against the Israeli enemy. In a televised speech via Al-Manar on the first anniversary of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, Sheikh Qassem affirmed that Hezbollah is not frightened by the alliance of the Israeli enemy with the United States and some European countries. He addressed Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu who vowed to bring the Zionist settlers back to northern occupied Palestine by saying: 'Many more (settlers) will be displaced.' Sheikh Qassem lashed out at the US for being key partner in the war which is aimed at eliminating the Axis of Resistance and exterminating the Palestinian people. He said that the Operation Al-Aqsa Flood is an exceptional event and the beginning of change in the Middle East. The Hezbollah deputy chief hailed the resistance in Gaza as 'legendary and capable of withstanding more and more'. 'We Are Not Scared' Sheikh Qassem said that the alliance of the Israeli enemy along with the US and some European countries doesn’t frighten the Lebanese resistance. He said that the Zionist entity and the Western countries have been trying to 'put fear' into the Lebanese resistance group after the assassination of Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, 'but it’s not working.' 'We are the sons of Axis of Resistance’s Master of Martyrs Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah,' the Hezbollah deputy chief said, as he praised the martyred S.G. for putting 'fear in the hearts of the Zionists and fighting the criminals of the occupation'. He hailed Operation Al-Aqsa Flood as 'an extraordinary and exceptional event which represents the beginning of change in the Middle East… and the first step for change' towards freedom for the Palestinians.' Sheikh Qassem noted that the Israeli enemy’s goal 'was to completely eliminate the Axis of Resistance and exterminate the Palestinian people,' stressing that the Israeli crimes against Palestinian women, children and elderly are unparalleled in the history. In this regard, he hailed the Palestinian resistance in Gaza as legendary, noting that and 'it’s capable of withstanding more and more.' Sheikh Qassem stressed that the US is a key partner in this aggression, as well as some European countries. He said Lebanon has been under aggression, noting that Netanyahu has repeatedly declared that he wants a 'new Middle East.' Resistance’s Determination Firm Sheikh Qassem said that the Lebanese front 'has exhausted the enemy throughout 11 months and has displaced tens of thousands of Israeli settlers.' 'This war has never and will never affect our determination to confront the Israeli aggression.' He stressed that Hezbollah fighters in the battlefield are solid, and that the command is coherent. Hezbollah fighters carrying out pro-Gaza operations in south Lebanon (April 2024 / image released by Hezbollah Military Media). 'Netanyahu says that the settlers will return to the north and we tell him that many more will be displaced.' Sheikh Qassem warned the Israeli enemy that 'the longer the war continues; the more difficult impasse Israel will face.' 'We are striking the enemy and expanding the range of fire, we will reach any place at the time we decide according to our plan. We are steadfast and we will emerge victorious.' Meanwhile, Sheikh Qassem praised Lebanese Speaker Nabih Berri, stressing that Hezbollah and Amal Movement are 'one heart in good times and bad.' 'We fully trust our 'big brother' Speaker Nabih Berri,' his eminence said. He stressed: 'We are the people of the battlefield and we will never beg for a solution.' 'This war is a war of who screams first and we will not scream, we will continue and we will offer sacrifices, you will hear the enemy screaming, God willing.' Hezbollah Chain of Command Fine On the other hand, Sheikh Qassem reassured that the resistance’s chain of command is fine, noting that there is no vacant position in Hezbollah. 'I tell you that the chain of command is operating strictly regular and we have overcome the painful blows that have been inflicted on us.' 'We don’t have a vacant position, all positions are filled and Hezbollah is working with full readiness and regularity,' he added. He affirmed, meanwhile, that the resistance group 'will elect a new secretary-general and will announce it once it has been done.' 'Everything that the martyred leaders had, their assistants and replacements have copies of,' his eminence reassured. Solid Military Capabilities Sheikh Qassem affirmed that Hezbollah’s ability to resist Israel’s military is intact. 'Our military capabilities are fine. What our enemies say about our fighting capabilities is an illusion. They are lying.' 'Our fighters on the front line are solid. The Israeli plan is to kill Lebanese civilians and empty villages to cause chaos. But I tell them, your efforts are a failure.' He noted that the Israeli ground incursion in southern Lebanon began a week ago, stressing that the Israeli army has yet to advance. The Hezbollah deputy chief stressed that the resistance fighters are fully ready to engage in face-to-face battles with the Israeli enemy forces. 'We will neither abandon our positions, nor hand over our weapons,' stated Sheikh Qassem. Sheikh Qassem's speech is the second since martyrdom of S.G. Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah in a flagrant Israeli strike on Beirut's southern suburb, Dagiyeh, on September 27. On September 30, Sheikh Qassem said that Hezbollah was using the minimum of its capabilities, voicing full readiness for all scenarios.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2224389	2024-10-08T04:44:31-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-01467880017283873124.jpg

A Hezbollah military officer told Al-Mayadeen TV that the Islamic Resistance fighters reported on Sunday monitoring an unusual movement for the Israeli occupation forces behind behind a UNIFIL military site in the outskirts of the border town of Maroun Al-Ras in southern Lebanon. The Islamic Resistance operations chamber asked the fighters to be patient and to avoid attacking the movement in order to preserve the lives of the international forces' soldiers. The Israeli enemy is trying to use the international UNIFIL forces as human shields to cover up its failure to advance towards the village, especially after its repeated failed attempts on more than one axis to advance towards Maroun Al-Ras and the loss of dozens of its soldiers as dead or wounded. Hezbollah’s Islamic Resistance intensified its military operations on the first anniversary of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, targeting Israeli sites along the Lebanese border with occupied Palestine, as well as military bases and settlements deeper within.

Hezbollah Commemorates October 7: Era of Defeats Is Over; Divine ...	Hezbollah asserted that its decision to open a support front on October 8 in solidarity with the Palestinians and their resistance is rooted in truth, justice, and humanity. This choice reflects Hezbollah's commitment to defending Lebanon and its citizens while emphasizing its ability to repel aggression and declaring that the era of defeats is over and victory has arrived. In a statement commemorating the anniversary of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, Hezbollah noted that 'today marks one full year since the heroic Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, which exemplified the will of the Palestinian resistance in confronting Israeli aggression, injustice, and occupation that has afflicted Palestinians since 1948, along with the wars, tragedies, and destruction that followed. 'This operation will have historical repercussions and strategic outcomes on the overall situation in the region until justice is achieved through the elimination of Zionist occupation, allowing Palestinians to reclaim their legitimate rights to their land, from the river to the sea,' the group's statement added. Hezbollah harnessed this occasion to emphasize the 'full right of the Palestinian people to resist occupation by all means necessary to reclaim their legitimate rights and eliminate the occupation.' 'Despite the Israeli brutality, which has led to the martyrdom of tens of thousands of Palestinians and the unprecedented destruction of the Gaza Strip, this unjust and oppressive entity has proven to be weak, unable to survive without US support,' the group affirmed. Hezbollah also highlighted that 'there is no place for this temporary entity in the region or within our social, cultural, and humanitarian fabric; it has always been and will remain a malignant, aggressive tumor that must be removed, no matter how long it takes.' Regarding those who support the Zionist entity worldwide, Hezbollah stressed, 'The United States, along with its allies and agents both globally and in the region, are partners in this occupation, complicit in its aggression and crimes against the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and the peoples of the region. These countries bear full responsibility for the killings, atrocities, injustices, and devastating humanitarian tragedies.' The Islamic Resistance in Lebanon addressed the Palestinian people and their valiant resistance, praising their steadfastness after a year of patience and endurance, marked by tragedy, and affirming that they are 'worthy of victory.' Hezbollah hailed the courageous support fronts, declaring: 'We commend the strength and valor of our fellow fighters in the beloved arenas of Yemen and great Iraq. Furthermore, we recognize the historic decision by the Islamic Republic of Iran to execute a significant missile strike deep within enemy territory. This action will have profound implications and significant outcomes for the nature of this ongoing confrontation with the Zionist enemy. The group emphasized its determination to proceed with its decision to open a support front on October 8 in solidarity with the Palestinian people and their honorable resistance, noting that this choice aligns with truth, justice, and complete humanity. 'This decision also underscores our commitment to defending Lebanon and its people, for which our resistance and populace have paid a heavy price in leadership, military, and material losses, along with the forced displacement of hundreds of thousands of civilians and extensive property destruction. Meanwhile, the enemy persists in its relentless crimes and aggression,' the statement added. Hezbollah wrapped up its statement, reaffirming its confidence in the resistance's ability to repel the aggression and the resilience of its people until this crisis is resolved.

Video | Hezbollah Strikes Haifa, Tiberias in Occupied Palestine	In a resolute defense of Lebanese sovereignty and in retaliation against Israel's continued aggression on both Lebanon and Palestine, Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance launched a missile strike targeting the occupied city of Haifa, deep within northern occupied Palestine. The Islamic Resistance declared that this strike is part of the ongoing 'Khaybar' operations and a direct response to the Zionist enemy's targeting of civilians and the massacres it has committed. Following the rallying cry, 'We are at your service, O' Nasrallah,' Hezbollah fighters unleashed a salvo of Fadi-1 missiles at the Carmel base, located south of Haifa, at precisely 11:20 p.m. on Sunday. Israeli media reported that Rambam Hospital in Haifa received six casualties following the missile strikes on the city. Hebrew Channel 12 announced that schools in parts of the occupied city of Haifa have shifted to remote learning in the wake of Hezbollah's missile strikes on the city. At midnight on Monday, the Islamic Resistance launched a missile barrage targeting the Nimra base, one of the main military bases in the northern region, located west of Tiberias. Israeli media reported that the total number of casualties from the missile strikes launched from Lebanon on Haifa and Tiberias has reached 10, including one in critical condition and several with moderate injuries.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2222739	2024-10-07T02:14:40-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-074245200172829232510.jpg
Iran Cancels Flights Amid Preparations for ‘Strong Response’ Oper...	Iran has reportedly canceled several flights as part of preparations for a major military operation targeting 35 strategic sites in Israeli-occupied Palestine, according to an account linked to Iran's Supreme National Security Council on the social media platform X. The Nournews agency, also on X, stated late Sunday that flight cancellations, which began at 9:00 PM local time and are expected to last until 6:00 AM (0230 GMT) on Monday, are likely tied to preparations for the 'Strong Response' operation. به نظر می رسد توقف پروازها در فرودگاه‌های #ایران تا بامداد دوشنبه، بیش از آن که اقدامی احتیاطی در برابر احتمال شرارت رژیم #اسرائیل باشد، فراهم کردن زمینه های لازم برای اجرای طرح #پاسخ_سخت و در صورت لزوم‌هدف قرار دادن ۳۵ نقطه راهبردی در عمق سرزمین های اشغالی است — نور نیوز (@nournews_ir) October 6, 2024 The cancellations, the report suggests, are not due to concerns over an imminent Israeli attack, as some had speculated. The developments come amid rising tensions following recent ballistic missile strikes by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) on key Israeli targets in Tel Aviv and other areas. The missile attacks, aimed at Israeli military and security installations, were described by Iranian authorities as retaliation for Israel's involvement in regional conflicts and alleged sabotage operations inside Iran. Amid rumors of possible Israeli retaliation, particularly targeting Iran’s energy and economic infrastructure, Iranian officials have warned that any escalation by the Israeli enemy would be met with a 'swift and decisive' response. Earlier on Sunday, an informed source within Iran's armed forces told Tasnim news agency, which is close to the IRGC, that the country had developed a 'Strong Response Plan' to counter any Israeli retaliation. The source added that specific measures had been prepared, and authorities were ready to execute them depending on Israel's actions.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2222497	2024-10-06T14:08:46-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-05110800017280760165.png
Al-Hayya: What We Rejected Yesterday, We Will Not Accept Today – ...	Khalil Al-Hayya, a senior member of Hamas' Political Bureau, reiterated today, Sunday, that the Palestinian resistance remains resolute in its mission to liberate the land and people, declaring that what was rejected in the past will not be accepted today. Marking the first anniversary of the Al-Aqsa Flood operation, Al-Hayya reflected on the ongoing Palestinian struggle, noting that 'a year later, our people continue to write a new chapter of history with their resistance, blood, and steadfastness.' He emphasized that any gains Israel could not achieve through force will not be granted through negotiations. He stressed that the operation shattered the ZIonist entity's perceived military superiority, as fighters from the Al-Qassam Brigades and other factions carried out heroic acts that have changed the balance of power. Al-Hayya further pointed to the increasing resistance in the West Bank, where Palestinians are pushing back against Israeli settlement expansion and Judaization efforts. He highlighted the recent Jaffa operation as one of the latest examples of this ongoing resistance. 'Our objective is clear,' Al-Hayya said. 'We seek the complete liberation of our land and holy sites, the establishment of a sovereign, independent Palestinian state, and the return of refugees to their homeland.' Lebanese Resistance Al-Hayya praised the unwavering support of the Lebanese Islamic Resistance, which has been involved in the struggle since day one. He acknowledged the sacrifices made by the Lebanese, including thousands of martyrs and wounded, noting that Israel's aggression has turned Lebanon into a key front in the conflict. 'We are united in this battle,' he said, addressing the Lebanese people and their resistance fighters. 'Blood is blood, and destruction is destruction. The blood of our leaders, including Ismail Haniyeh and Hasan Nasrallah, has forged a new dawn for our nation with Al-Aqsa at its heart and Al-Quds as its destination.' Hamad Chief Ismail Haniyeh (L) in a meeting with Hezbollah S.G. Sayyed Nasrallah (photo relased by Hezbollah's Media Relations - Tuesday, June 29, 2021). Global Support and Shifting Battlefronts Al-Hayya extended his gratitude to Yemen’s Ansarullah for their steadfast support, both in terms of military action and the millions who have shown solidarity with the Palestinian cause. He noted that the missile and drone strikes launched by Yemen's resistance forces have significantly shifted the battle's dynamics, striking deep into the heart of Israeli territory. He also commended the Islamic Republic of Iran for its support, pointing to recent missile strikes in retaliation for Israel’s targeted killings of Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil. Al-Hayya described Iran’s actions as reshaping the battlefield, likening their missiles to 'meteors filling the skies over occupied Palestine.' Iraq’s contribution to the resistance was also acknowledged, with Al-Hayya highlighting drone and missile strikes from Iraq as a testament to the country's commitment to Palestine. He stressed that Iraq, both in its present and historical role, is deeply embedded in the Palestinian cause. A Call to Action and a Warning to the International Community Al-Hayya called on the Arab and Islamic nations to translate their solidarity into concrete action, saying, 'We appreciate your noble feelings towards our people, but now is the time for roaring resistance from east to west.' In a message to the international community, Al-Hayya urged an end to silence, warning that continued inaction would only allow further Israeli aggression. 'Enough with the silence,' he stated, 'as it only perpetuates the aggression against our people and the Lebanese. Israel is the epicenter of evil and destruction in the region, and the source of its instability.' He concluded by expressing confidence in the future of the Palestinian struggle, stating that past efforts have laid a strong foundation on which Palestinians can build their future. 'What we have previously achieved serves as an important foundation for what comes next,' Al-Hayya affirmed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2222387	2024-10-06T13:21:08-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2017/11/manar-01366360015117824491.jpg
Yemen’s Al-Houthi: Al-Aqsa Flood Revived the Culture of Jihad	Leader of Yemen's Ansarullah movement Sayyed Abdul-Malik Badredine al-Houthi stated that the Operation Al-Aqsa Flood has reignited the culture of jihad in the name of Allah across the Muslim world. Emphasizing that this event has shifted the nature of conflict with the Israeli occupation from rapid, short-term wars to prolonged wars of attrition, Sayyed Houthi said Sunday that this war weakened Israel's capabilities and its supporters. 'The Zionist enemy's ambitions extend far beyond Palestine, its objective is to dominate the entire region, including neighboring Arab countries,' Al-Houthi cautioned. These goals, he explained, are not merely historical aspirations but are active projects being pursued on the ground with significant resources. He pointed to Israel's aggressive wars and occupations as evidence of these expansionist efforts. The Ansarullah leader referenced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s explicit declaration of reshaping the Middle East to serve Israel's interests, noting that Netanyahu aims to shift the balance of power in the region. Al-Houthi elaborated that this involves neutralizing Palestinian resistance, dismantling the Palestinian statehood project, controlling Arab governments, and co-opting their military forces to serve Israeli goals. An Israeli female soldier appears in distress during a military exercise (photo from archive). According to al-Houthi, Netanyahu seeks to ensure the Zionist entity’s survival as the dominant military power in the Middle East, redrawing borders and asserting regional hegemony. He added that the Zionist entity plans to exploit internal divisions within the Arab world, weakening its peoples and redefining the rules of engagement to allow ‘Israel’ to strike any Arab or Islamic nation without resorting to full-scale war. Al-Houthi also pointed out Netanyahu’s efforts to reshape international alliances, strengthening ties with global powers and expanding relations with emerging nations like China and India. This would provide Israel with greater strategic influence on the global stage, enabling it to further its control over the region. In conclusion, al-Houthi warned that 'Israel's' ultimate goal is to become the dominant force in the Middle East with global influence. He called on the Arab and Islamic nations to unite and confront these ambitions before they come to fruition.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2222090	2024-10-06T11:36:09-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-00979760017282396438.jpg

Israeli Aggression Intensifies on Day 13: Heaviest Night of Bomba...	The Israeli enemy pressed forward with its aggression across Lebanon, launching airstrikes early Sunday morning that have been described as the most intense since the onset of aerial aggression on Beirut's southern suburbs over a week ago. Last night's Israeli airstrikes targeted the old airport road, which connects the city center to Beirut International Airport. The strikes resulted in damage to a hotel, residential apartments, commercial establishments, medical clinics, a car wash, and medical and food warehouses. Piles of debris blocked one lane of the airport road, prompting young volunteers to step in and manage traffic, redirecting vehicles toward safer routes. Small explosions were audible throughout the morning, with paramedics indicating that these sounds resulted from burning fuel tanks reacting with materials inside the buildings. Paramedics Hindered Volunteers searching for survivors reported that 'Israeli aircraft are dropping explosives around the targeted buildings in Beirut's southern suburb (Dahiyeh) to hinder the work of civil defense teams.' Military experts believe that the aircraft are deploying missiles loaded with a type of cluster bomb that continues to explode for several hours after the airstrikes end. Israeli drones continuously fly over the southern suburbs, employing armed drones equipped with precision-guided missiles to disrupt search and rescue operations, particularly in the Mreijeh area.

The officer stated that, 'At approximately 10:20 PM on Friday, Islamic Resistance fighters in the Adaisseh axis detected unusual movements by Israeli forces near Border Marker 405, in the outskirts of Adaisseh. Our fighters immediately made the necessary arrangements. Then, at around 10:45 PM, an elite enemy force advanced toward the Adaisseh Municipality building. By 11:00 PM, the infiltrating force reached a pre-prepared ambush, and with the call 'We are at your service, O' Nasrallah,' our fighters opened fire with light and medium machine guns.'

'Approximately 15 soldiers were either killed or wounded, as their cries were clearly heard. Israeli occupation rescue teams, supported by helicopter fire, evacuated their casualties back to the occupied territories,' the Hezbollah officer concluded. Speaking of the Zionist attempts early on Saturday, the officer stated that, 'At approximately 1:50 AM on Saturday, another enemy force attempted to infiltrate through a different route towards the Adaisseh Municipality building. Islamic Resistance fighters confronted them with machine guns and rocket fire. The clashes lasted for more than two hours, during which the enemy suffered casualties among its soldiers and was forced to withdraw.'

Iranian Foreign Minister Arrives in Syria, Pushes for Regional Ce...	Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has landed in Damascus to delve into the latest developments surrounding the ongoing Israeli aggression in Lebanon, while also aiming to strengthen bilateral ties between Iran and Syria. This visit comes on the heels of substantial discussions held in Beirut, where Araghchi highlighted the urgent need for collaborative efforts to address escalating tensions across the region. During his visit, Araghchi emphasized the primary goal: to secure a ceasefire in both Gaza and Lebanon. He revealed that several proposals are under consideration to facilitate this much-needed resolution. 'The Zionist occupation government does not understand any language other than war and force,' Araghchi declared, advocating for international intervention to put an end to the violence that has engulfed these regions. He reassured that Iran is dedicated to the relentless pursuit of a ceasefire, displaying unwavering support for the embattled populations. In his upcoming meetings with Syrian counterpart Bassam Sabbagh, Araghchi is expected to underscore the need for unity among Islamic and Arab nations to combat what he described as Israel's criminal actions. He maintains that these nations must work in concert and mobilize international organizations to coordinate actions against the current onslaught. Further solidifying Iran's commitment, a humanitarian initiative was announced, with the Iranian Foreign Ministry pledging 10 tons of food and medical supplies to Lebanon. 'The whole region should recognize the critical situation Lebanon faces and its dire implications for the future of our nations,' he said.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2220517	2024-10-05T02:25:51-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04987400017281203451.jpg

Iranian Missiles Overwhelmed Israeli Defenses: WSJ	Iran’s barrage of ballistic missiles this week appears to have overwhelmed Israel’s air defenses in some places, The Wall Street Journal quoted independent researchers who examined emerging satellite imagery as saying. The assessment means that any new Iranian strikes against Israel, if launched, could have much more serious consequences if they target civilian infrastructure or heavily populated residential areas,the US paper reported . 'That is an important consideration as Israel contemplates its military response. Tehran has threatened strikes on Israeli power plants and oil refineries if Israel hits Iranian territory in a counterattack expected in the coming days.' 'Unlike April 13, when Iran fired a large number of slower cruise missiles and drones, Tuesday’s barrage was made up exclusively of some 180 much faster ballistic missiles, one of the largest such strikes in the history of warfare. Analysts say that most of these projectiles were Iran’s most modern ballistic missiles, the Fattah-1 and Kheibar Shekan.' 'The faster the missile, the harder it is to intercept it, that’s simple physics,' said Ulrich Kühn, head of research for arms control at the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy in Hamburg, Germany. 'It’s certainly much harder to defend against ballistic missiles, and even more so if there is a bulk of them coming in on a certain target, because then you have the ability to overwhelm the antimissile defenses—which is exactly what happened in Israel.' Satellite images of a target on Tuesday—the Nevatim air base in southern 'Israel', home to its F-35 jet fighters—show that as many as 32 Iranian missiles managed to land within the base’s perimeter, according to analysis by professor Jeffrey Lewis, at the Middlebury Institute for International Studies in Monterey, Calif. 'Thirty-two missiles is a lot of missiles,' Lewis said. 'We have exaggerated ideas about the effectiveness of air defenses. We have this pop-culture idea that missile defenses are much more effective or available than they actually are.' 'While Israel operates the sophisticated Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 missile-defense systems, co-produced with the U.S., the interceptors are limited in quantity and more expensive than the incoming Iranian missiles, Lewis said. It often takes multiple interceptors to try stopping one ballistic target.' It is more complicated to inflict damage on a sprawling and hardened air base in the middle of the desert than to strike infrastructure sites in heavily populated areas, WSJ noted. 'The Israelis would care more about defending Tel Aviv' than defending Nevatim, said Lewis. 'On the other hand, they would ultimately have the same problem there—Iranians could at the end of the day overwhelm the system.' The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps carried out a missile strike against the Israeli occupation entity on Tuesday evening. The IRGC said in a statement that it has targeted 'the heart of the occupied territories' in response to the martyrdom of Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh, Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, and IRGC general Abbas Nilforoushan at the hands of the Zionist regime.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2220088	2024-10-04T14:07:15-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-05110800017280760165.png

‘Israel’ Launches Massive Air Raid on Beirut’s Suburb	Dozens of Israeli air raid targeted residential areas in the southern suburb of Beirut, specifically Mrayjeh, igniting a series of loud explosions that reverberated throughout the city. Witnesses reported that the blasts were so powerful they could be heard as far away as Sidon and Tyre. The strikes occurred in proximity to Beirut International Airport. Notably, the focused site is situated in a densely populated residential neighborhood, raising concerns over civilian safety. Additional bombings were also reported in areas close to residential regions and a school in Hadath, further amplifying fears of collateral damage. As the night wore on, around 3:00 AM local time, media reported flames rising from the location of the airstrikes, while Israeli drones continued to patrol overhead, leaving residents in a state of heightened anxiety. Sources indicate that the targeted locations included hospitals and emergency service facilities, marking one of the most severe assaults in the ongoing conflict. Israeli airstrikes have intensified dramatically in recent days, with reports of nearly 20 bombings occurring within a single day. The Israeli occupation military appears to be conducting these operations in the dead of night, intensifying the terror experienced by civilians in the affected areas. These air raids are part of a broader campaign that has included attempts at incursions into Lebanese border towns. However, the Islamic Resistance group in Lebanon has managed to thwart several of these attempts, inflicting significant losses on Israeli occupation forces; just on Thursday, 17 soldiers were reportedly ambushed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2218779	2024-10-04T00:40:08-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-07017690017280276044.jpg
Watch Hezbollah Missiles Striking Mossad Headquarters in Tel Aviv	Hezbollah Military Media released a video which shows footage of the Islamic Resistance's operation targeting the Galilot Base and the Mossad headquarters north of Tel Aviv as part of the 'Khaibar Operations' series against the 'Israeli' enemy army. Hezbollah fighters have fiercely repelled all Israeli attempts to cross in Lebanon’s territory on Thursday, with Islamic Resistance heroes turning the border area with occupied Palestine into a graveyard for the Zionists. An Islamic Resistance battlefield source told Al-Manar that so far, all Israeli attempts to infiltrate into the Lebanese territory have failed, and that Hezbollah fighters have inflicted heavy losses upon the Zionist troops. 'Hezbollah fighters have repelled all Israeli attempts to advance in several axes in southern Lebanon,' the source told Al-Manar, noting that the resistance fighters have employed different kinds of weapons. 'Resistance’s prepared ambushes are inflicting heavy losses on Israeli soldiers,' according to the source. A field officer in the operations chamber of the Islamic Resistance stated: 'The explosives detonated by the fighters of the Islamic Resistance today, Thursday, October 3, 2024, against the Israeli elite forces that attempted to advance in the outskirts of the towns of Maroun al-Ras and Yaroun resulted in the deaths and injuries of more than 20 officers and soldiers. These explosives were recently planted based on the monitoring and tracking of the enemy’s movements by the fighters, with some being planted just hours before the detonation.' The officer added that the fighters of the Islamic Resistance managed to plant these explosives along potential advance routes of the enemy’s elite soldiers at the Lebanese-Palestinian border. This occurred amid the mobilization and buildup of 'Israeli' enemy forces at their positions and military barracks across the border, alongside the heavy presence of reconnaissance aircraft in the skies over the area.'

Houthi: Israeli Enemy Saw Sayyed Nasrallah as Main Barrier Hinder...	Head of Yemen's Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi addressed 'the great Israeli crime of targeting and killing the martyr of Islam and humanity, the martyr of Jerusalem, Al-Aqsa, and Palestine, His Eminence the Secretary-General of Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah (may Allah be pleased with him).' In a televised speech, Houthi stressed that Sayyed Nasrallah's martyrdom wounds the entire Islamic Umma as His Eminence had a great role, Islamic symbolism, and global, regional, and local significance and impact. Confronting the Zionist enemy and inflicting defeats upon it topped Sayyed Nasrallah's role, Houthi said, adding that for over 40 years, Sayyed Nasrallah had been present in the field of jihad, effectively confronting the Zionist threat with a distinguished stance and great performance. 'Sayyed Nasrallah maintained strong communication with the people, striving to clarify the truths to those he considered the major support in the field and in stance. The impact of Sayyed Nasrallah on the enemy's populace was evident, and the enemy viewed him as possessing high competence in fulfilling his duties and responsibilities.' The Israeli enemy recognized Sayyed Nasrallah as a formidable leader, endowed with courage, faith, insight, wisdom, determination, and steadiness in his stance, Houthi said, adding that the targeting of Sayyed Nasrallah stemmed from an 'Israeli' desire to eliminate what they view as a major barrier to their ambitions in controlling Palestine, Lebanon, and the broader region. 'Sayyed Nasrallah had a significant and pioneering role in thwarting the American and Israeli conspiracy to stir sectarian strife among Muslims. The dangerous destructive project aimed at inciting strife among Muslims and tearing them apart is one of the most serious American and Israeli conspiracies intended to destroy the Ummah.' 'Sayyed Nasrallah paid great attention to fostering friendly and brotherly relations among Muslims, and his efforts in this regard are well-known.' The Israeli enemy's targeting of Sayyed Nasrallah is aimed at undermining Hezbollah's role and the Lebanese front in confronting the Israeli enemy and supporting the Palestinian people, Houthi affirmed. 'The Israeli enemy failed even when targeting specific leaders or prominent figures of Hezbollah or committing mass murder, Houthi noted, 'The conspiracies against the Lebanese front were not carried out by the 'Israelis' alone; the Americans were always involved.' 'Had other Arab armies or entities, without a faithful approach, faced what Hezbollah did, they would have collapsed. Arab regimes and armies have collapsed in days, despite not facing the same level of difficulties as Hezbollah.' 'Hezbollah remains steadfast with a strong public support as well as a powerful and active front that cannot be toppled by storms and hardships.' Houthi maintained that, despite the great loss with the martyrdom of Sayyed Nasrallah, Hezbollah's path remains firm and enduring. Sayyed Nasrallah worked to instill the faithful, fighting, and Husseini spirit in every past stage, as an attitude, thought, awareness, and certainty, according to Houthi, who added that His Eminence worked on building the practical and organizational structure of the resisting Ummah, shaping it into Hezbollah's Ummah. Houthi emphasized that Hezbollah's structure is cohesive, being a faithful and jihadi entity that does not disintegrate or collapse in the face of storms, hardships, and sorrows. 'Hezbollah's supporters are also a strong, cohesive entity, facing challenges and ordeals. Hezbollah's supporters endured the Beirut port explosion, subsequent assassinations, and ongoing wide-scale destruction crimes in recent days.' 'The speech of His Eminence Sheikh Naim Qassem, Deputy Secretary-General of Hezbollah, expressed confidence, cohesion, and continued resilience.' The Israeli enemy resorted to a ground offensive, thinking the conditions were favorable for it and that Hezbollah's structure had collapsed, but it was surprised, maintained Houthi. 'The Israeli enemy was strongly and significantly shocked at Lebanon's borders with occupied Palestine and even within occupied locations.' 'The fighters in Hezbollah now have more motivation and drive after the martyrdom of the Secretary-General than they did before. The condition reflected in the reality of Hezbollah's fighters is not one of collapse, incapacity, failure, or weakness; rather, it is determination, resolve, and a commitment to performing the great honorable duty.' The Islamic Republic of Iran has carried out the largest missile strike the 'Israeli' enemy has faced since it began occupying Palestine, said Houthi, adding that the Iranian missile strikes covered an area spanning across occupied Palestine, reached the vicinity of Ashkelon, focused on military bases and espionage centers. 'The Second True Promise operation was in fulfillment of the Islamic Republic's commitment after the Israeli enemy's assassination of the martyr of the Islamic Ummah, Ismail Haniyeh, and the targeting of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, may Allah's blessings be upon him, and the commander in the Revolutionary Guard.' 'The Second True Promise operation was successful, powerful, and decisive, undeterred by American bases despite repeated claims that they would protect the Israeli enemy.' 'The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has carried out intense operations in recent days and is heading towards further escalation with high effectiveness,' Houthi said, 'The Yafa operation carried out by Al-Qassam Brigades shook the Israeli entity.' 'More American armed reconnaissance drones (MQ-9) were shot down, bringing the total to 11 of such drones this year.' Targeting Hodeidah by the 'Israeli' and American enemy will not stop our operations; our fight continues, Houthi underscored. Yemeni Armed Forces (YAF) have claimed responsibility for a drone operation targeting Tel Aviv, known to its residents as Yafa. Brigadier General Yahya Saree, the spokesperson for the YAF, announced that multiple drones successfully struck important targets within the city without interception from Israeli defense systems.

Empty Promises: Iran’s Pezeshkian Warns of Severe Consequences if...	Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian arrived in Qatar on Wednesday to attend the Asia Cooperation Dialogue summit, focusing on strategies to curtail Israeli aggression in the region. During a meeting with officials from the Hamas Political Bureau, Pezeshkian voiced strong criticism of Western nations, claiming they have repeatedly made empty promises to Iran while urging the country to exercise restraint in the face of ongoing conflict in Gaza. Pezeshkian warned that the relentless Israeli actions could provoke a severe response from Iran, stating, 'If Israel makes the slightest mistake, it should prepare for an even harsher reaction.' He also shared his deep sorrow over the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, highlighting it as one of the most painful events of his tenure, recalling that Haniyeh had been a guest at his inauguration. Pezeshkian criticized Western countries for making empty promises, saying they invited Iran to exercise self-restraint and refrain from giving a response to Israel’s July assassination of Haniyeh. Therefore, 'the continuation of the Zionist regime’s crimes made the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran to give a decisive response,' he added. The Iranian president condemned the atrocities perpetrated by ‘Israel’ in Gaza and Lebanon, and lashed out at the United States and Western countries for pursuing hypocritical approaches, saying they back Israel while claiming to advocate democracy and human rights. These countries are constantly talking about human rights and human dignity, but they have proven that they are completely alien to these concepts as they are supporting the criminal Israeli regime, he said. 'People's lives, especially those of women and children, are of no value to them, and all their claims are lies,' Pezeshkian added. Furthermore, the Iranian president reiterated the need to foster coherence among Muslim nations, emphasizing that the lack of such unity has emboldened the Israeli regime to commit more crimes against the oppressed people of Palestine and Lebanon. He noted that the ongoing developments in the region are the outcome of lack of unity among Muslim states, saying, 'If Muslims had been united, the Zionist regime would not have dared commit such crimes.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2217921	2024-10-03T02:42:27-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-07888060017279485407.jpg

Iran’s President Warns ‘Israel’ of Harsher Response, Urges Islami...	The President of Iran Masoud Pezeshkian said that Iran is not looking for war and instead seeks peace, calling on the Islamic countries to work hand in hand to stop the Zionist regime's atrocities. Pezeshkian made the remarks standing alongside the Emir of Qatar in Doha in a joint press conference on Wednesday afternoon. He called for broadening of bilateral Tehran-Doha ties following talks with Qatari Emir. 'We are looking for the development of relations with the government of Qatar, and the common will of the two countries is to improve the level of cooperation,' he said. He expressed hope that the negotiations between his accompanying Iranian delegation with the Qatari side will result in the expansion of ties in all fields of transportation, culture, tourism, health and treatment, further hoping that 'We will be able to make joint investments.' 'The security of the region is the security of all Muslims. Since I was elected as the president, I have been looking for peace and tranquility.

For his part, Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani called on the international community to stop the Zionist aggression on Lebanon, saying he supports regional and international efforts to reduce tensions and protect peace and security in the region. 'In recent days, we have warned about increasing tensions in Lebanon. The occupying regime must stop its oppressive war on Gaza, the West Bank, and Lebanon. Mediation is our strategic option.'

Addressing the occupiers, Al-Qassam warned, 'In the coming days, death will come to you from various areas of the West Bank at the hands of our determined Mujahideen, the loyal sons of leaders Ismail Haniyeh and Saleh al-Arouri. These brave fighters are preparing to etch new chapters of heroism in the ongoing Battle of the Flood of Al-Aqsa, bringing joy to our people, God willing.'

Iran’s Tolerance Fades Following Assassination of Sayyed Nasralla...	Iran's top military commander stated that Iran had shown restraint following aggressive actions from ‘Israel’ in July but could no longer remain patient after the assassination of Hezbollah Leader Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and a prominent Iranian general. Major General Mohammad Baqeri made this announcement on Wednesday after Operation True Promise II. The regime assassinated Ismail Haniyeh, former chief of the Political Bureau of the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas, during a targeted killing in the Iranian capital Tehran on July 31. 'After Martyr Haniyeh’s assassination, Iran went through a tough period of self-restraint amid repeated requests by the Americans and Europeans, who would ask us to exercise self-restraint so they would establish a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip (where the Israeli regime has been waging a genocidal war),' Bagheri said. 'However, after Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah’s and [Brigadier] General [Abbas] Nilforoushan’s martyrdom, the situation was no longer tolerable,' he added. Hezbollah Leader Sayyed Nasrallah and the Iranian commander were assassinated during intense Israeli airstrikes on the southern suburb of Beirut on Friday. On Tuesday, Iran responded to the triple assassinations as well as the regime’s ongoing deadly aggression against Gaza and Lebanon by launching hundreds of missiles toward the Zionist entity’s military and intelligence bases all over the occupied Palestinian territories. Iranian missiles successfully hit the Israeli regime's Tel Nof Airbase near Tel Aviv. pic.twitter.com/emlmIuXsrt — Mehr News Agency (@MehrnewsCom) October 1, 2024 Flares and missiles were seen in the Tel Aviv sky and explosions could be heard in the occupied al-Quds during the operation dubbed Operation True Promise II, while 'direct hits' were reported in Negev, Sharon, and other locations. According to Bagheri, the targets of the 'heroic' operation that 'served as a response to many of the Zionists’ crimes,' included three of the Israeli regime’s main airbases. He named the bases as the headquarters of the regime’s Mossad spy agency, which he identified as the 'center for terrorism,' the regime’s Nevatim airbase that houses its F-35 warplanes, and the Hatzerim base that was used towards enabling Nasrallah’s assassination. The targets also featured the regime’s strategic radars, the centers housing the regime’s tanks and personnel carriers, and the center accommodating those of the regime’s forces that partake in massacres against Palestinians in Gaza. 'All Israeli infrastructures to be targeted if it repeats its atrocities' The military chief asserted that the Islamic Republic’s Armed Forces were completely prepared to respond to the potential repetition of such atrocities on the part of the regime, describing the forces’ capabilities as 'many times more than' what was displayed during True Promise II. 'If the Zionist regime, which has reached madness, was not controlled by the United States and Europe, and sought to either continue its atrocities or take action against our territorial integrity and sovereignty, tonight’s operation would be repeated with multiple magnitude and all of their infrastructures would be struck.' He, however, hoped that the US would reverse its approach and stop the regime so the region could move towards experiencing calm. The General Staff of Iran’s Armed Forces also commented on the operation in a statement, saying it came in reaction to the regime’s disregard for the legitimate sovereign rights of the Islamic Republic. It praised the response as an instance of the country’s 'making any malicious aggressor, at any level, regret their actions.' The statement, meanwhile, warned the aggressive regime that 'it should expect the widespread and comprehensive destruction of its infrastructure within the occupied Palestinian lands if it responds [to the operation] in kind.' It finally cautioned the regime’s supporters, including the United States, against taking part in direct intervention against the Islamic Republic, saying such interference would warrant 'a powerful and regret-inducing response against their centers and interests across the region.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2215809	2024-10-02T03:00:23-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04726330017278632178.jpg
Yemeni Armed Forces launch Quds-5 cruise missiles deep into ‘Isra...	The missile force of the Yemeni Armed Forces (YAF) has launched a significant attack on military sites deep within the Israeli occupation territory using three Quds-5 cruise missiles, as confirmed by YAF spokesperson Brigadier General Yahya Saree on Wednesday. Saree emphasized that the Israeli occupation authorities have remained silent regarding the outcomes of this operation, which is declared as a show of support for the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and a demonstration of solidarity with their Resistance. In addition, the YAF extended their congratulations on Iran's Operation True Promise 2 against the Israeli occupation entity and expressed their readiness to partake in joint military actions in support of the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples, as well as in response to any Israeli aggression against their support fronts. Furthermore, the spokesperson issued a warning concerning the continued support of, The United States and Britain for ‘Israel’, stating that such support places American and British interests in the region at risk. Brigadier General Saree also underlined the YAF's unwavering determination to escalate their military operations against, ‘Israel’, and its supporters until the aggression on Gaza ceases, the blockade on the Strip is lifted, and the aggression on Lebanon comes to an end. The senior military source highlighted the Quds-5's exceptional features, including its high speed, formidable destructive power, and capability to penetrate all types of air defenses deployed in the region. Moreover, Saree hinted at the element of surprise associated with the Quds-5, drawing a parallel to the previous shock caused by the Quds-3 missile and indicating that further unexpected developments should be expected. This remarkable attack follows closely on the heels of Saree's announcement that the YAF's naval, missile, and UAV forces executed three separate military operations in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. The initial operation targeted the Cordelia Moon British oil tanker in the Red Sea, employing eight ballistic and cruise missiles, a drone, and an uncrewed surface boat, resulting in significant damage to the vessel. The subsequent operations took aim at the Marathopolis tanker in the Indian Ocean, utilizing a cruise missile and a drone to enforce the YAF's maritime ban on ships heading towards the occupied ports of Palestine. The YAF's UAV force had previously struck an Israeli military target in occupied Yafa (Eilat) using a Yafa-type drone, as well as other military targets in occupied Umm al-Rashrash (Eilat) with four Samad-4 drones, all of which achieved their objectives effectively.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2216062	2024-10-02T03:00:10-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/06/manar-00923210017183201212.jpg

Eight Zionists Dead in Jaffa Shooting, Many More Wounded	Six people were murdered and dozens were wounded in a terrorist shooting attack at a light rail station in Jaffa on Tuesday evening. Eight people were taken to Ichilov Medical Center with at least two in critical condition with head wounds and the others moderately to seriously wounded. Twelve wounded, including a child, were transferred to the Wolfson Medical Center; five were in serious condition. Security forces initially believed the incident was criminal because there has been a criminal shooting in the area nearly every day recently due to a well-known criminal living nearby, according to Maariv. Once they heard the shooting and shouts of 'Allahu Akbar,' the authorities arrived on the scene ready for a terror incident. Eyewitnesses described the terror and chaos. 'We were on the light rail when we suddenly heard gunfire from outside,' one witness said. 'At first, we thought it was fireworks, but then we realized it was something much worse. There were many gunshots. We dropped to the floor, and people were crying. I saw someone bleeding on the ground.' A nearby shop owner added, 'I saw crowds of people running and shouting ‘terror attack.’ I quickly closed my shutters and locked up.' The two attackers, Muhammad Chalaf Sahar Rajab and Hassan Muhammad Hassan Tamimi, from Hebron, were shot dead by members of a Tel Aviv-Jaffa Municipality security patrol unit and citizens using personal firearms, according to the police. Chaos in Tel Aviv's light rail Hanan Peretz, head of the local patrol unit, praised his team’s swift response. 'They identified the gunman, took cover without hesitation, and fired at him,' he said. 'It seems the attacker’s weapon malfunctioned during the shooting.' The police and security services are continuing their investigation into the attack, which took place near the Gush Dan Light Rail’s Erlich Station. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Police Commissioner Daniel Levy arrived at the scene, along with Tel Aviv District Commander Haim Sargrof. 'This is a difficult incident,' Sargrof said. 'At around 7 p.m., we received a report that two attackers had boarded the light rail and opened fire. They injured four people, then exited the train and continued shooting at civilians on the street. A light rail security guard, two officers from the municipal Sela Unit, and police officers shot at the attackers and neutralized both of them. We know their origin and are conducting further checks with the Shin Bet [Israel Security Agency]. They are not Israeli citizens.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2215622	2024-10-01T13:21:05-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-09163930017278140366.jpg
Iran’s Ballistic Missiles Strike ‘Israel’	The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps carried out a missile strike against the Israeli occupation entity on Tuesday evening. The IRGC said in a statement that it has targeted 'the heart of the occupied territories' in response to the martyrdom of Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh, Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, and IRGC general Abbas Nilforoushan at the hands of the Zionist regime. The statement said the retaliatory attack has been launched after a period of self-restraint following the violation of Iran’s sovereignty. The IRGC said it has fired tens of ballistic missiles at vital military and security Israeli targets. The IRGC has also warned the Zionist regime that if it intends to react militarily to Iran’s operation which conforms with Tehran’s legitimate rights and the international law, it will have to face subsequent 'crushing and devastating strikes'. Reports suggest that as many as 200 Iranian missiles have been fired during half an hour. Images released by the media outlets show a large number of projectiles over Tel Aviv a number of other cities across the occupied territories. Hamas Hamas Resistance Movement issued a statement to commend the Iranian missile strikes in response to the Zionist aggression against the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples.

The Islamic Resistance Movement - Hamas, expresses its support for the heroic missile launches executed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran, targeting large areas of our occupied lands. These strikes are a response to the ongoing crimes of the Zionist occupation against the peoples of the region and an act of retribution for the blood of our honored martyrs: the martyred fighter Ismail Haniyeh, His Eminence Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, and General Abbas Nilforoushan. We affirm that this honorable Iranian retaliation sends a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government, aiming to deter their continued terrorism. Their persistent violations of international law and humanitarian norms, as well as their crimes and arrogance, have exceeded all bounds. We take pride in our brothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran and deeply appreciate their stance against unchecked Zionist aggression. Their commitment to justice aligns with the struggles of the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and the broader interests of the Islamic Nation, embodied in ending the occupation and curbing the fascist Zionist enemy. We call on all countries, peoples, parties, and forces within the Arab and Islamic Nations to unite in confronting Zionist crimes and their expansionist project, which threatens us all.

Yemeni Armed Forces strike Israeli Targets in Eilat, Tel Aviv	The Yemeni Armed Forces have declared the execution of two drone military operations targeting Tel Aviv (referred to as occupied Jaffa) and Eilat (Umm al-Rashrash). This announcement was made today, Tuesday, with confirmation that both operations successfully achieved their intended objectives.

In his statement, Saree emphasized that these operations represent a 'victory for the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples,' expressing solidarity with the courageous resistances in Palestine and Lebanon. بيان القوات المسلحة اليمنية بشأن تنفيذ عمليتين عسكريتين استهدفت الأولى هدفا عسكريا في يافا المحتلة بطائرة يافا، فيما استهدفت الأخرى أهدافا عسكرية في منطقة أم الرشراش بأربع طائرات مسيرة نوع صماد4. pic.twitter.com/zYk2k5YaEi — العميد يحيى سريع (@army21ye) October 1, 2024 Saree commended the steadfast fighters for their defense against what he termed Israeli-American aggression and its efforts to dominate nations and peoples. The Yemeni Armed Forces reiterated their commitment to supporting the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples until the aggression is repelled and the criminal schemes and expansionist plots are thwarted. Furthermore, the Yemeni Armed Forces called upon all Arab and Islamic nations to break their silence and engage actively in this critical struggle. Saree remarked that the current moment marks the first anniversary of the initiation of this significant battle, asserting that it will persist until the anticipated victory is realized.

Avenging Sayyed Nasrallah’s Blood Requires Achieving Palestine’s ...	The very heavy words about the martyrdom of Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah can never be up to the major challenges it poses. Shrewd plans and adept performance are necessary in order to reach the intended victory. Sayyed Nasrallah's lovers were aggrieved by the loss of the leader and the guide; however, their faith and patience helped them to accept Holy God's will and move on to the stage of consecrating the great martyrs objectives in a general framework to be followed. The main question that is raised in the aftermath of the Zionist massacre is focused on the manner of avenging Sayyed Nasrallah's blood. The Lebanese politician, Nasser Kandil, told Al-Manar TV that avenging Sayyed Nasrallah's blood necessitates working for achieving victory in Palestine through the eradication of the occupation entity. Kandil stressed, in an interview with the Resistance Channel, that observing the requirements of achieving victory is much more important that dealing a loud blow in order to take an emotional revenge. The editor-in-chief of Al-Binaa newspaper called for maintaining trust in the resistance and its choices established by the martyred leader, underlining the loyalty to the Resistance in accordance with the teachings of Sayyed Nasrallah. Deputy Leader Sheikh Naim Qassem assured on Monday that the Lebanese resistance group is strong enough and ready for all scenarios, adding that Hezbollah will go on with its goals and its battle. In this regard, Kandil indicated that all the Israeli aerial attacks and their consequences will fail to achieve any of the enemy's goals, including the return of the northern settlers to their houses. Iran and the regional war The Lebanese politician affirmed that the Palestinian cause needs the operations of the resistance groups who are free of all the state considerations, explaining that state wars always lead to compromises that delay the ultimate victory. The resistance groups can inflict accumulating losses upon the enemy without involving the regional states in devastating wars, he said, recalling Sayyed Nasrallah's notion of achieving victory through scoring successive goals, not dealing not dealing a mortal combat. Kandil noted that Hezbollah has the border advantage of firing heavy missiles from short distances and within a very limited time, and is not in need of any Iranian help to destroy Tel Aviv. The relation between Iran and Hezbollah is not based of servitude, Kandil said, mentioning instances in which Tehran rejected to strike any deal with the United States at the expense of the Lebanese resistance group. Kandil called for trusting the resistance and its choices established by the martyred leader Sayyed Nasrallah, ridiculing all the malicious media attempts to cause strife and sedition among the components of the axis of resistance.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2214390	2024-09-30T14:28:33-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-02397330017277316942.jpeg

A Message to Sayyed Nasrallah from Al-Manar English Website: We S...	Your Eminence, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, our beloved leader, For years, it has been our deepest honor at Al-Manar English Website to translate your speeches. It was not just a duty but a privilege, as we shared your words with the world. We were humbled to bring your guidance to those who sought your wisdom, across lands and languages. Each speech carried with it a weight that we could never fully capture in translation, for your words were filled with a depth and grace beyond any language. Forgive us, Sayyed, if we ever fell short. We labored with utmost care to reflect the true essence of your thoughts, yet we know that no translation could ever truly embody the power of your words. Your eloquence transcended every boundary we tried to cross. We searched dictionaries, deliberated among ourselves, and strove to find the perfect words, yet we were always conscious of the greatness that our efforts could not fully convey. Your words were not just spoken—they were lived, and they breathed life into your beloved ones’ hearts. This past Saturday, as the news of your martyrdom echoed across the land, our hearts shattered. The followers of the resistance felt the weight of Karbala in every tear. Was it possible? Could our leader, who stood with such strength and conviction, truly be gone? The vile enemy gloated, but we could not comprehend a world without you, Sayyed. How do we write these words when our hands tremble with grief? How do we address you now, knowing that you have joined the ranks of the martyrs? Reporting the breaking news of your martyrdom was our hardest task ever. Our fingers were quivering while typing the tragic words. We seek shelter beneath the cloak of Zainab (peace be upon her), for she too faced a grief that words could not describe. We pray, as she did, that God accepts this immense sacrifice. Today, the resistance faces its greatest test: 'If only we were with you, so we could win a great victory.' In our mourning, we recall the final words of Imam Hussein (peace be upon him) as he spoke to Zainab: 'Do not tear your clothes for me, do not slap your cheeks. Protect the children for me.' And so we, too, must stand firm. We are called to endure this test with the strength of those who came before us, and in their example, we find our courage. From the hilltops of Zainabi, the Islamic Resistance looks to the Commander of the Faithful, Imam Ali (peace be upon him), and hears his command: 'Hold fast. Stand firm. Look to the farthest reaches.' The truth is, Sayyed, this is the harshest battle we have faced. Not one fought with weapons, but one that tears at the very core of our being. No words can console us. No voice can calm the pain we feel. But let there be no doubt: Hezbollah's grief does not come from weakness or fear. We are not shaken. The answer to those who question will be found not in words, but in action—on the front lines, where your spirit continues to guide us. A leader like you, Sayyed, never wavered. From the beginning, you knew the cost of this path. You knew the sacrifices it would demand, but you were never afraid. What weighed on your heart was not the risk to yourself, but the lives of your comrades, the people who believed in you and followed your leadership with unwavering trust. Every decision you made was for us, and we can only imagine the burden you carried. And yet, through it all, you found solace in your faith, in your deep connection to God, and in the wisdom of those who guided you, like the Supreme Leader Sayyed Ali Khamenei, who you once turned to in times of overwhelming pressure, and whom we turn to despite all the deceitful schemes against the resistance axis. Sayyed, your martyrdom is a wound that no victory can heal. The resistance could burn 'Israel' to the ground, and still, the loss of you is a grief beyond measure. Yet, as you told us: 'The news is in what you see, not in what you hear.' The struggle continues, and so too does your legacy. You once said that if we were to die a thousand deaths, we would never leave the side of Imam Hussein (peace be upon him). Now, we face this reality with broken hearts, but with our heads held high. You have been martyred, just as Sayyed Abbas al-Moussawi was before you. Your legacy now carries on, burning brightly in the hearts of those who walked with you on this path. In your absence, we at Al-Manar English Website pledge to continue the work you inspired. We shall endure. We will keep spreading your message, translating the resistance words, carrying the light you kindled for us all. We once took pride in every speech you gave, in every stance you took. Now, that pride is mixed with sorrow, but it is also strengthened by our resolve. You were not just our leader, Sayyed. You were our guide, our teacher, our inspiration. Your blood now flows in the hands of the faithful, who will raise it to the sky and ask: 'Are you satisfied, O Lord?'

Imam Khamenei: All Resistance Forces Stand by Hezbollah	Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei stressed that committing massacres against the unarmed people in Lebanon has once again exposed the savage nature of the rabid Zionist dog to everyone and demonstrated the shortsightedness and foolish policy of the leaders of the usurping regime. In a statement, Imam Khamenei indicated that the terrorist gang ruling over the Zionist entity has not learned from their criminal year-long war in Gaza, nor have they realized that the mass killing of women, children, and civilians cannot weaken or overthrow the strong structure of the Resistance. 'Now they are testing the same foolish policy in Lebanon.' The Zionist criminals must know that they are far too insignificant to cause any significant harm to the strong structure of the Lebanese Hezbollah, His Eminence added, all Resistance forces in the region stand by Hezbollah and support it. The fate of this region will be determined by the Resistance forces, with the victorious Hezbollah at the forefront, Imam Khamenei affirmed. 'The people of Lebanon have not forgotten that once upon a time, the military forces of the usurping regime even reached Beirut, and it was Hezbollah that cut their legs off and made Lebanon dignified and proud. Today as well, with the power and might of Allah, Lebanon will make the aggressive, evil, and cowardly enemy regret. It is incumbent upon all Muslims to stand with their capabilities beside the people of Lebanon and the victorious Hezbollah and assist them in confronting this usurping, unjust, and evil regime.'

The Israeli attacks on Syria come in light of a large-scale Israeli aggression on Lebanon, which resulted in hundreds of civilian martyrs and wounded as a result of the intensive raids for about 4 days.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2210738	2024-09-27T03:33:23-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-03237410017258648894.jpg

Hezbollah Mourns Commander Martyred in Dahiyeh Aggression	Hezbollah mourned commander Mohammad Hussein Srour who embraced martyrdom all the way to Al-Quds during an Israeli strike on Beirut’s southern suburb, Dahiyeh, on Thursday. In a statement released late Thursday, Hezbollah’s Military Media said: 'With utmost pride and honor, the Islamic Resistance announces the martyrdom of commander Mohammad Hussein Srour (Abu Saleh), from the southern border town of Ayta Al-Shaab.' The resistance group’s Military Media provided a brief biography that highlights the journey of the martyred commander. Born in Ayta Al-Shaab on July 8, 1973, commander Srour joined the ranks of the Islamic Resistance in 1986. He assumed organizational responsibilities with the Resistance and underwent several high-level leadership training programs. Commander Abu Saleh participated in many Islamic Resistance operations against the Israeli occupation, and was one of the key commanders who confronted the takfiri attacks on Lebanon's eastern borders and in various Syrian provinces. He specialized in various military fields and took over responsibility of Hezbollah’s Air Force since 2020. He led the military operations of Hezbollah Air Force on the Lebanese front supporting Gaza since the start of Al-Aqsa Flood Battle until his blessed martyrdom.

Houthi: Any Israeli Ground Invasion of Lebanon Will Be Doomed to ...	Head of Yemen’s Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Al-Houthi stressed that Hezbollah defeated the Israeli enemy in epochs during which the Resistance group did not possess the capabilities it has now. In his weekly speech, Houthi noted that the Zionist enemy has escalated in Lebanon, relying on its criminal tactics of widespread targeting, killing civilians, and destroying homes, similar to its actions in the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah’s role in supporting Gaza since the beginning of the aggression has been the strongest and most influential among the support fronts, he affirmed. 'Hezbollah plays a fundamental and important role in confronting the enemy, and its heroic record, achievements, and victories prove its pivotal role for Palestine, Lebanon, and the entire nation.' The 'Israeli' goal of escalation in Lebanon is to prevent Hezbollah from supporting Gaza and the Palestinian people, a goal that will not be achieved, Houthi underscored. 'Hezbollah’s stance in supporting Gaza is principled, religious, humanitarian, and ethical, and at the same time, it serves Lebanon’s interests. If the enemy were to achieve its objectives in Palestine and free itself for other fronts, Lebanon would be at the top of its target list.' The enemy had been preparing for aggression against Lebanon and Hezbollah, gathering intelligence, devising targeting plans, and arranging the necessary components for such attacks, Houthi pointed out. 'We observe the strength, resilience, and determination of Hezbollah, despite the scale of the Zionist aggression. The fighters in Lebanon and Palestine are driven by faith, fully aware of their sacred fight duty in standing for the just cause.' The Yemeni leader indicated that the danger facing the Ummah (nation) is not in its movement and raising the banner of fight in the path of Allah to confront its hateful enemies, but in its hesitation, stagnation, surrender, and incapacity. The experience of the fighters in the Gaza Strip has brought about significant victories and inflicted heavy losses on the 'Israeli' enemy, and they have developed a firm, steadfast, and resilient approach in confronting the enemy, according to Houthi. If the 'Israeli' enemy undertakes a ground operation in Lebanon, it will face defeat and will not succeed, he underscored. 'Hezbollah has the military and missile capabilities to reach all parts of occupied Palestine; thus, the enemy will not win this escalation.' Houth emphasized that the Iraqi support front is strong, with significant and impactful operations on the rise from the Jordan Valley to Eilat and towards Haifa and beyond. The Red Sea, Arabian Sea, and Gulf of Aden have become completely prohibited areas for the Israeli, American, and British enemies Houthi recalled. We will never hesitate to support Gaza and Palestine as a whole, as well as Lebanon and Hezbollah, and to cooperate with them, Houthi concluded. The Islamic Resistance continued on Thursday confronting the criminal Israeli aggression on Lebanon, firing dozens of missiles at northern Palestine.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2210265	2024-09-26T13:31:28-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-08909880017273826794.jpg
