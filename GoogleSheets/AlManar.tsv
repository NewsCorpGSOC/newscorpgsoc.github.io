Members of Astana Format Call for Dialogue in Syria: Lavrov	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has affirmed that the guarantor states of the Astana process- Russia, Iran and Turkey- have agreed on facilitating the stopping of military operations in Syria, stressing that steps will be taken on the ground. The states also agreed to call on the Syrian government and the opposition to start dialogue and implement Security Council Resolution 2254. During a press conference on Saturday following a meeting with his Iranian and Turkish counterparts within the Astana format in Doha, Lavrov said 'we agreed to take steps to stop military operations and we will take steps on the ground. As for the de-escalation zone in Idlib, we said that commitments within the framework of Astana platform do not allow support for 'Hay‚Äôat Tahrir al-Sham' and demand separation between the opposition and this terrorist organization. Lavrov also said 'we emphasized Syria‚Äôs sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity, the immediate cessation of hostilities, and refusal to allow terrorists to seize territory in Syria. We agreed also to call on the Syrian government and the opposition to start dialogue and implement UN Resolution 2254, which strongly affirms the unity and sovereignty of Syrian territory and condemns any attempts by terrorists to disrupt the lives of Syrians. The Russian Foreign Minister continued by saying 'according to the information available to us, the advance of 'Hay‚Äôat Tahrir al-Sham' from Idlib to other areas, the capture of the city of Hama, and the approach to Homs were planned in advance, and are an attempt to change the balance of power on the ground. We will oppose and confront this, and we will support the legitimate authorities in Syria. At the same time, we will support and push for the establishment of a dialogue between the government and the opposition in accordance with what was stipulated in UN Resolution 2254.' Lavrov stressed the need to adhere to Astana process outcomes and strictly implement the de-escalation agreements as a main framework for addressing the crisis in Syria. He said 'Russia continues to provide military assistance to the Syrian army through its military base in Hmeimim, and is trying to do everything in its power to combat terrorists in Syria with the aim of eliminating them. Russia will continue to fight terrorist groups in Syria even if they say they are no longer terrorists.' Lavrov stressed that it is unacceptable to use terrorists to achieve geopolitical goals, as is happening in Syria, explaining that 'Hay‚Äôat Tahrir al-Sham' in Syria is a terrorist group, and its leader 'Abu Muhammad al-Julani' is listed on the terrorist lists in Russia and the United States, and despite that, Washington gives him the opportunity to appear and speak on CNN. Regarding reports about Russia withdrawing its ships from Tartous, Lavrov said that this has to do with naval maneuvers taking place in the Mediterranean. For his part, the Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi affirmed in a statement following the meeting that there was consensus among all participants in the Astana meeting in Doha on the necessity of ending the war in Syria and respecting its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Araghchi said 'we held a very good session within the Astana group that brought together the foreign ministers of Iran, Russia and Turkey, and at the end of the session, the UN envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, joined us, and the current and urgent issues in Syria, which are considered extremely dangerous, were discussed, and there was consensus among all participants on the necessity of ending the clashes immediately, respecting the unity and the sovereignty of Syria, and returning to the UN resolutions'. Araghchi went on to say that the meeting emphasized the necessity of starting political talks between the Syrian government and the legitimate opposition groups, and this was the focus of the meeting‚Äôs demands, as it was agreed to consult with the Syrian government on these issues, and the Russian side also agreed to consult with the Syrian government.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2285582	2024-12-07T13:04:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/09/manar-09607150016947106646.jpg

Syrian Army Redeploys in Daraa and Sweida, Restores Control in Ho...	The Syrian Army announced on Saturday that its forces in Daraa and Sweida provinces, in southern Syria, have repositioned and established a robust security perimeter in the area. In a statement, the General Command of the Army and Armed Forces clarified that this redeployment followed attacks by terrorist elements on scattered army checkpoints, aiming to divert the military's focus as it advances against terrorist groups in Homs and Hama provinces. The statement reaffirmed the army's commitment to safeguarding the nation and its citizens, vowing to confront terrorism decisively. While the Syrian Army battles armed groups in Homs and Hama, militants in southern Syria have targeted army positions in Daraa and Sweida. A Syrian military source denied reports by certain media outlets claiming that terrorists had entered the Al-Qaryatayn area, southeast of Homs. The source stressed that Syrian forces remain fully stationed and prepared in the region. Another military source reported that Syrian forces in Hama and Homs carried out heavy artillery and rocket strikes on terrorist strongholds and supply lines, achieving direct hits. In parallel, joint Syrian-Russian airstrikes targeted militant gatherings in northeastern Homs, killing dozens of fighters and destroying their equipment. According to Syrian state television, over 2,500 militants from Jabhat al-Nusra and its affiliates were killed last week during army offensives supported by joint airpower. A military source revealed that some militants resort to entering villages briefly, coercing residents to allow staged videos of their presence to mislead audiences and undermine public morale. In northern Homs, the Syrian Army executed a strategic operation in the Dar al-Kabira‚ÄìTalbiseh‚ÄìRastan axis, eliminating dozens of militants. This triggered widespread panic, disarray, and mass desertion among their ranks. The Syrian Army also dismissed reports circulated by certain media and terrorist-affiliated platforms alleging troop withdrawals from positions around Homs.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2285384	2024-12-07T05:20:13-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-09505150017335770421.jpg

Sheikh Qassem: Victorious Hezbollah Committed to Reconstruction a...	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem stressed on Thursday that the enemy sought to crush the resistance through its aggression but was met with the 'Battle of The Formidable in Might'. In a televised speech, Sheikh Qassem said, 'For 64 days, we endured sacrifices, pain, martyrs, and injuries with patience, resilience, and reliance on Allah.' According to Sheikh Qassem, three key factors contributed to Allah‚Äôs victory for us in this battle: 1. The presence and steadfastness of martyrdom-seeking fighters on the battlefield. 2. The blood of the martyrs, especially that of His Eminence Sayyed Nasrallah, which inspired the fighters to persevere. 3. The restoration of leadership and control structures within the party, enabling effective management of the 'Battle of The Formidable in Might'. Hezbollah Leader hailed the steadfastness of the displaced Lebanese people for their contribution to the victory, detailing Hezbollah plan to fund the reconstruction and thanking the Iranian-Iraqi-Yemeni financial support in this regard. Sheikh Qassem stressed that those whose houses were completely destroyed will receive a 14-thousand-dollar pay in order to purchase a new furniture and rent a house for a year. His eminence also underlined the Lebanese government in raising the debris, treating the infrastructure problems and contributing to the reconstruction project. Sheikh Qassem pointed out that the legendary resilience of the fighters astonished the world, displaying unparalleled courage and bravery on the frontlines. 'We achieved victory because the enemy failed to accomplish its objectives, marking their defeat. Our resistance remains steadfast, will endure, and will shine even brighter.' We agreed to the ceasefire mechanism outlined by Resolution 1701, which is not a new or standalone agreement, he added. Sheikh Qassem noted that Resolution 1701 mandates 'Israel's' withdrawal and prohibits armed presence south of the Litani River, adding that the provisions outlined in Resolution 1701 include mechanisms for Lebanon to reclaim its borders within the specified timeframe. 'Israel has committed over 60 violations of the ceasefire agreement, and the government is responsible for addressing those breaches. The Lebanese state is accountable for monitoring Israeli violations, while the resistance provides an opportunity to ensure the success of the ceasefire agreement.' Sheikh Qassem indicated that 'Israel' has no influence on our internal relationships or our ties with the Lebanese Army, adding that Hezbollah‚Äôs strength stems from supporting the rights of Palestinians and Lebanese to liberate their land.' We will evaluate the crises and war we endured, drawing lessons to improve and advance in all fields, Sheikh Qassem said. His eminence expressed gratitude to those who hosted the displaced, to the various entities offering support, whether governmental or civilian, and to the countries that provided aid. Meanwhile, Sheikh Qassem said that the aggression against Syria is backed by America and 'Israel', adding that the Takfiri groups in Syria were tools serving 'Israel' and America. Hezbollah will stand alongside Syria to thwart this aggression, Sheikh Qassem affirmed. 'We face a dangerous expansionist Israeli project, and I call on you to support the resistance against 'Israel'. Takfiri groups aim to shift Syria from its position of resistance to one that serves the Israeli enemy.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2284394	2024-12-05T10:27:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-09018800017334231657.png

Amnesty International Investigation Concludes ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô Committing...	Amnesty International human rights group has concluded that the Zionist entity‚Äôs war on Gaza meets the legal threshold for genocide, in a report it said it was a 'wake-up call' for the international community. The report, published on Thursday, titled 'You Feel Like You Are Subhuman': Israel‚Äôs Genocide Against Palestinians in Gaza. The London-based rights organization said its findings were based on 'dehumanizing and genocidal statements by Israeli government and military officials', satellite images documenting devastation, fieldwork and ground reports from Gazans. It is the culmination of months of research by Amnesty, including extensive witness interviews, analysis of 'visual and digital evidence', including satellite imagery, and statements made by senior Israeli government and military officials. 'Month after month, Israel has treated Palestinians in Gaza as a subhuman group unworthy of human rights and dignity, demonstrating its intent to physically destroy them,' Amnesty chief Agnes Callamard said in a statement. 'Our damning findings must serve as a wake-up call to the international community: this is genocide. It must stop now,' she added.

'Our research reveals that, for months, Israel has persisted in committing genocidal acts, fully aware of the irreparable harm it was inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza,' Callamard said. 'It continued to do so in defiance of countless warnings about the catastrophic humanitarian situation and of legally binding decisions from the International Court of Justice [ICJ] ordering Israel to take immediate measures to enable the provision of humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza,' she added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2284009	2024-12-05T00:27:14-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-09111270017298671932.jpg

Hezbollah Can Resume Battle against Israeli Enemy with Long-range...	Deputy Chief of Hezbollah Politburo, Hajj Mahmoud Komati, indicated on Wednesday that the mechanism of the implementation of the ceasefire deal in southern Lebanon is vague, adding that the US deliberate leniency gave the Israeli enemy the chance to violate the Lebanese sovereignty. In a TV interview, Komati stressed that the response of the Islamic Resistance came after the Israeli attacks on the Lebanese civilians and violations of the ceasefire. The Islamic Resistance carried out on Monday, December 2, its first attack on Zionist military sites since the ceasefire took into effect last Wednesday, November 27, 2024, targeting Ruwaisat Al-Alam occupation post in KfarShuba Hills area. When Hezbollah realized that the Lebanese and American officials disregarded the Israeli violations, it carried out the attack on the Israeli occupation site, which pushed everyone to move to implement the mechanism of the ceasefire, he said. Komati pointed out that Hezbollah is waiting for and will cooperate with the committee tasked to overlook the truce implementation, but that the developments, in this regard are not satisfactory. Hezbollah will be patient for a period of time, yet can resume the battle against the Israeli enemy with long-range missiles, if needed, Komati added. Regarding the Lebanese presidential elections, Komati reiterated Hezbollah commitment to the nomination of the former minister Sleiman Frangieh, calling on the parliamentary bloc to reach a minimum consensus in this domain.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2283877	2024-12-04T11:29:42-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-027725400166239486010.jpg

Israeli Army Warns 30 Soldiers against Overseas Travel over War C...	The Israeli occupation military warned some 30 soldiers and officers who fought in the Gaza Strip to avoid traveling abroad after pro-Palestinian groups filed complaints against them for war crimes. At least eight of them ‚Äî including troops who had traveled to Cyprus, Slovenia and the Netherlands ‚Äî were told to immediately leave those nations due to fears they could be arrested or questioned, Ynet reported. The military currently does not bar soldiers from traveling abroad, but it does take a 'risk assessment' for troops who served in Gaza before approving their request, the report said. Since the beginning of the war, the army has asked soldiers to not publish footage online of their abuses in Gaza, to avoid it being used against them in a potential criminal investigation in another country. Journalists who have accompanied troops in Gaza have also been asked to blur the faces of soldiers for the same reason.

This comes while two others were injured as a result of bombing in the Khirbet Al-Adas area and a third in the Al-Mawasi area in Rafah city as well. This was preceded by the announcement of the martyrdom of 9 Palestinians in hostile bombing in the eastern part of Rafah city.

The occupation artillery shelled the vicinity of the university college and Street 8 south of Gaza City. Three martyrs were killed, others were injured and others went missing as a result of the occupation's raids on Deir al-Balah and al-Bureij in the central Gaza Strip at dawn today. In addition, a doctor at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital was martyred in the occupation's bombing of Abu Hamisa School, which shelters displaced people in al-Bureij camp in the central Gaza Strip. It is worth noting that for the 61st consecutive day, northern Gaza has been under an Israeli siege and starvation amidst violent aerial and artillery bombardment, and the complete isolation of the northern governorate from Gaza. For the 43rd day, the occupation forces continue to forcibly disrupt the work of civil defense in the northern Gaza Strip due to the ongoing Israeli targeting and aggression, and thousands of citizens there are now without humanitarian and medical care. In turn, UNRWA stated that it was forced to stop delivering food and other supplies to Gaza via the Kerem Abu Salem border crossing due to the looting carried out by 'armed gangs.' Despite being the main corridor for humanitarian aid, the agency made the decision on Sunday after it was informed that trucks carrying food supplies had been 'completely hijacked' after crossing into Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2283558	2024-12-04T03:21:20-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-08604690017306480946.jpg
Norway Wealth Fund Divests from Israeli Telecommunication Company...	Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, announced it has sold all of its shares in an Israeli telecommunications company as it provides telecoms services to the Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. In its recommendation, released late on Tuesday, the fund‚Äôs watchdog said it was divesting from Bezeq, the Zionist entity‚Äôs largest telecoms group. 'The company, through its physical presence and provision of telecom services to Israeli settlements in the West Bank, is helping to facilitate the maintenance and expansion of these settlements, which are illegal under international law,' the recommendation read. 'By doing so the company is itself contributing to the violation of international law,' it added, according to Reuters news agency. The $1.8 trillion fund has been an international leader in the environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment field. It owns 1.5% of the world's listed shares across 8,700 companies, and its size carries influence. The watchdog said it noted that the company had said it was also providing telecoms services to Palestinian areas in the occupied West Bank, but that did not outweigh the fact that it was also providing services to Israeli settlements. The watchdog makes recommendations to the board of the Norwegian Central Bank, which has the final say on divestments. The fund has now sold all its stock in the company. Israeli settler units in the occupied West Bank (photo from archive). Before that, it had cut its stake during the first half of 2024, owning 0.76% of the company's shares valued at $23.7 million at the end of June, down from a holding of 2.2% at the start of the year, fund data showed. The watchdog's new definition of ethical breaches was partly based on the International Court of Justice finding in July that 'the occupation itself, Israel's settlement policy and the way Israel uses the natural resources in the areas are in conflict with international law', according to an August 30 letter it addressed to the finance ministry. Since the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023, the council had been investigating whether more companies fall outside its permitted investment guidelines. Before the announcement to divest, the fund had divested from nine companies operating in the occupied West Bank. Their operations include building roads and homes in Israeli settlements in East Al-Quds (Jerusalem) and the West Bank and providing surveillance systems for an Israeli wall around the occupied West Bank.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2283459	2024-12-04T01:47:32-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-00726770017333054101.jpg
More Israeli Violations of Ceasefire in South Lebanon	The Israeli enemy escalated its attacks on South Lebanon, committing more violations of the ceasefire still holding since last Wednesday. On Nov. 27, a cease-fire agreement took effect, ending a two-month, all-out Israeli war on Lebanon. In this regard, Zionist drones targeted the towns of Beit Leif, Deir Siryan and Shebaa, claiming a shepherd. A heavy gunfire also targeted Majdal Zoun. The Israeli warplanes, in turn, raided the area between Mleikh and Sojod in Iqlim Al-Tuffah in the context of its ongoing aggression. The following photo shows the moment of an Israeli air raid on Kfar Milke town in Sidon district.

PA, Hamas Agree to Form Committee to Run Post-War Gaza: Report	The Palestinian Authority and Hamas have signed a document agreeing to form a joint committee that would run the post-war Gaza Strip, Al-Araby Al-Jadeed Arab news site reported on Tuesday. The report said it has a copy of the document that was signed to formulate the committee, to be made of 10-15 leading Palestinian figures. It comes a day after Egypt‚Äôs foreign minister said that rival Palestinian groups Fatah and Hamas were in Cairo for talks seeking to bring post-war Gaza. The talks are part of Egypt‚Äôs broader mediation efforts to broker a ceasefire between the Zionist entity and the Hamas resistance group and to expand humanitarian access to the enclave. Displaced Palestinians line up to receive food at a distribution center in Gaza's Deir Al-Balah (November 26, 2024). The document laid out six commitments largely designed to unite the West Bank and Gaza under one political entity. They would be responsible for overseeing health and economic services, agriculture and vital infrastructure. Meanwhile on Tuesday, Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar reported that an Israeli delegation is to visit Cairo in the coming days for talks on more details regarding a potential captive and ceasefire deal between Hamas and the Zionist entity.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2282953	2024-12-02T23:27:28-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-02514580017267356425.jpeg
US Says Ceasefire Holding: Washington 'Hasn‚Äôt Determined if Israe...	The US State Department said on Monday that the ceasefire between the Zionist entity and Hezbollah is thus far 'successful, broadly speaking,' adding that Washington has not 'determined' if Tel Aviv violated the ceasefire. 'The ceasefire is holding,' Matthew Miller, the department‚Äôs spokesman, told reporters at the daily press briefing, after the Israeli enemy staged airstrikes on several areas across south Lebanon earlier on Monday. The ceasefire, brokered by the United States and France, has 'been successful in stopping the fighting and getting us on a path where we are not seeing the daily loss of life that we had seen for two months prior,' the spokesman added. Miller said that violations were expected, especially in the opening weeks 'when things are very fragile.' The ceasefire agreement, which took effect on Wednesday (November 27), contains a mechanism for reporting potential violations and for the ways that Washington and Paris will respond to them, he said. That mechanism will become more formalized in the coming days, the spokesman noted. 'When we get reports of potential violations, we have a mechanism that we put in place with the government of France to look at those potential violations, determine if they are in fact, violations, and then engage with the parties to ensure that they aren't repeated,' Miller said. Later on Monday, Miller said that Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, and the two discussed developments in Gaza and Lebanon. Blinken pointed to the 'importance of bringing all of the hostages home and ending the war in Gaza,' while stressing the 'importance' of implementing the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon. .@SecBlinken spoke with Israeli Minister Dermer.

Hezbollah Political Council Deputy Chief Mahmoud Komati underlined the contradiction between the US-Israeli calls for separating Lebanon's and Gaza's dossiers and the current endeavor to link the hostage deal with the Lebanese front. In a TV interview, Komati indicated that Hezbollah's resistance and political activity are very powerful politically, adding that the Resistance is not in need of any military or security action in order to preserve the political participation. Komati mentioned that Hezbollah resorted to silence about the Zionist violations, yet the enemy escalated its attacks, which made the Resistance response very necessary. We clearly said that Hezbollah's commitment to the UN Resolution 1701 is conditioned by the Israeli commitment too, he reiterated. Komati stressed that the Lebanese Army possesses the patriotic will to fight the enemy, yet lacks the weaponry needed for that mission.

In a blatant violation of the ceasefire and the Lebanese sovereignty, the Israeli enemy escalated Monday its attacks on South Lebanon and Bekaa, leaving one martyr, two injuries, and materialistic losses. The Zionist escalation started in South Lebanon with machine gun bursts fired by the Israeli army towards safe houses in the town of Naqoura, in a scene that reflects the persistence in targeting civilians and infrastructure.

US-Israeli Captive Confirmed Dead, IOF Announces	The Israeli occupation military confirmed Monday that an Israeli American soldier, previously believed to have been captured alive by Hamas during its Oct. 7, 2023 attack against the Zionist entity, is now presumed dead. Capt. Omer Neutra, 21, a New York native who enlisted in the Israeli military, was captured when Hamas fighters attacked the occupation settlements in Gaza enclave. It was previously thought he was being held hostage since then, but officials have announced it is thought he was killed on the day of the Hamas attack and his body was then taken into the Gaza Strip. Believing their son to be alive, the soldier's parents, Ronen and Orna Neutra, led a public campaign for over a year, speaking at rallies in both 'Israel' and the U.S., addressing the Republican National Convention, and maintaining contact with the Biden administration in a bid to secure his release. Hamas is still holding approximately 100 hostages inside Gaza, with at least a third believed to be dead. The Biden administration is renewing its push for a ceasefire and the release of the remaining captives after nearly a year of stalled negotiations between 'Israel' and Hamas. The situation remains dire, but diplomats see a glimmer of hope following a recent ceasefire between 'Israel' and Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based resistance group allied with Hamas.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2282568	2024-12-02T06:38:47-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-04473770017331503025.png

Palestinian Resistance Drives Israeli Occupation Troops Out of Na...	In a major setback for the Israeli occupation, its forces were forced to withdraw from the eastern part of Nablus in the northern West Bank after confronting fierce resistance from Palestinian fighters. The al-Quds Brigades and al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, both based in Nablus, claimed responsibility for the clashes that erupted as Israeli occupation troops tried to storm the city. The Palestinian fighters engaged the Israeli forces with heavy gunfire and explosive devices, thwarting their incursion. According to local sources, over 20 Israeli military vehicles, accompanied by bulldozers, had entered Nablus on Sunday evening from the Awarta and Beit Furik checkpoints, apparently to secure access for Israeli settlers to the nearby Joseph's Tomb. However, the determined resistance from the Palestinian factions forced the Israelis to pull out after hours of intense confrontations.

Araghchi Meets Assad: Iran Vows Full-fledged Support for Syria in...	Syrian President Bashar al-Assad met with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Damascus on Sunday to discuss regional developments and the ongoing fight against terrorism. During the meeting, President al-Assad emphasized the broader implications of combating terrorism, stating, 'Confronting terrorism, dismantling its structure, and cutting off its sources not only benefits Syria but also contributes to the stability of the entire region.' He reaffirmed Syria‚Äôs commitment to defeating terrorist organizations, saying, 'The Syrian state, army, and people remain steadfast in their determination to fight terrorism across all its territories.' Minister Araghchi‚Äôs visit marks the start of a regional tour aimed at holding consultations with senior Syrian officials on key regional issues. The Iranian Mehr News Agency reported, 'Araghchi arrived in Damascus on Sunday as the first stop of his regional tour, focusing on recent developments in Syria.' This visit follows increased activity by terrorist groups in northwestern Syria, where advances by these groups have prompted joint military operations by Syrian and Russian forces to repel them and reclaim occupied areas. Before departing Tehran, Araghchi expressed confidence in Syria‚Äôs ability to overcome these challenges, stating, 'The Syrian army will once again triumph over the terrorists.' He further criticized the roles of external actors, asserting, 'The United States, the Zionist entity, and Takfiri groups have shown they are aligned in their objectives, but their actions will ultimately fail, as they have before.' The discussions underscore the close coordination between Syria and Iran in addressing shared security concerns and maintaining regional stability. The Syrian President expressed gratitude for Iran's unwavering support, extending his greetings to Ayatollah Khamenei and Iranian President Pezeshkian, acknowledging the strong bonds between the two nations. President Assad lauded Iran‚Äôs steadfast commitment to regional stability and security, particularly in supporting Syria‚Äôs ongoing battle against terrorism. He emphasized the importance of collective regional efforts to eradicate the scourge of terrorism, noting that its persistence benefits only the enemies of Muslim nations, especially the Israeli regime. Highlighting the significance of Minister Araghchi‚Äôs visit, Assad described it as a meaningful gesture of solidarity under the current sensitive circumstances. He affirmed that the visit reflects Iran‚Äôs strong message of support for the countries in the resistance front as they confront the challenges posed by the Israeli regime. The discussions underscored Syria and Iran‚Äôs shared vision of regional cooperation and their determination to address common threats to stability and security.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2282348	2024-12-01T12:42:41-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-09296260017330855762.jpg
Victorious Return: Resistance Community Rebuild Lives Amid Post-W...	With heads held high, the people of the resistance are triumphantly returning to their homes after the Islamic Resistance secured a significant victory against Israeli forces during 66 days of aggression on Lebanon. The assault left widespread destruction across southern villages, the Bekaa Valley, and Beirut‚Äôs southern suburbs (Dahiyeh). According to the latest statistics released by the Ministry of Health last Thursday, the Israeli aggression claimed the lives of 3,961 people and left 16,520 others injured. Life is gradually resuming in the areas affected by the Israeli occupation aggression as displaced families return after being forcibly uprooted by the brutal Israeli crimes and massacres against unarmed civilians. Businesses, pharmacies, bakeries, and caf√©s are reopening, while specialized teams and municipalities work tirelessly to clear debris and reopen roads. As they return, residents honor the memory of the martyrs, whether fallen in heroic battles or through Israeli occupation bombardments of homes. Many visited cemeteries to recite prayers for the souls of those who gave their lives during the conflict. Beirut's Dahiyeh Alive Again In Beirut‚Äôs southern suburbs (Dahiyeh), the resilience of the resistance community stands in sharp contrast to the disarray within Netanyahu's government, which struggles to encourage settlers to return to northern occupied territories.

Iran Reaffirms Support for Syria as President Urges Blocking Isra...	Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has condemned the atrocities and disasters unfolding in the region, attributing them to the backing of the United States and certain European countries. He called on Islamic nations to prevent the US and Israeli occupation from exploiting the conflict in Syria. Speaking with optimism, President Pezeshkian expressed hope that Islamic countries would step in to resolve the Syrian crisis and not allow external powers to manipulate the situation again. He emphasized the need to address the nation's challenges through strength and expertise. In a separate address to the Iranian Islamic Consultative Assembly on Parliament Day, the president highlighted his administration's efforts to improve foreign relations, particularly with neighboring countries. 'In the short time since the formation of our government, we have engaged in dialogue with our neighbors, sharing our perspectives and policies,' he stated. President Pezeshkian also affirmed that the Islamic Republic has no intention of escalating wars or bloodshed. 'Those who perpetuate war and violence in this region and across the world are the very ones who claim to champion peace, human rights, and humanity,' he asserted. He criticized the hypocrisy of nations capable of leveraging science and technology to bomb children and women in hospitals and schools. 'In this war, over 10,000 innocent children have been martyred. The global community witnesses these atrocities in silence, and this silence is disgraceful,' he added. President Pezeshkian held the United States and European countries responsible for the catastrophes in the region, citing their support for Israel and extremist groups. He reaffirmed that Iran 'has never and will never covet the territory of any nation in the region.' He further noted a positive shift in regional dynamics, highlighting that for the first time, all nations in the region collectively condemned Israeli aggression against Iran. 'We express our gratitude to our neighboring countries for their unified stance,' Pezeshkian concluded. Araghchi Strongly Supports Syria's Government, Army Against Terrorists Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reaffirmed Iran's unwavering support for Syria's government and army in their fight against terrorist groups. Speaking at a Navy Day event, he announced his visit to Damascus to deliver a message of solidarity, emphasizing, 'We strongly back the Syrian government and military.' He equated the Zionist entity with Takfiri terrorists, stating, 'After Israel's failures, the enemy now seeks to destabilize the region through these terrorist groups.' Araghchi expressed confidence in Syria's victory over the militants, as in previous battles. Highlighting the synergy between diplomacy and defense, Araghchi stressed, 'Diplomacy without power is ineffective. As a diplomat, I rely on Iran's internal strengths, including its defensive capabilities.' He concluded, 'Diplomacy is a cost-effective path, but it depends on national power for success.' He also addressed the region's turmoil, accusing Takfiri forces of operating under U.S. leadership in a bid to advance its strategic goals. Baghaei: Iranian Foreign Minister to Tour Regional Countries for Talks on Developments Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ismail Baghaei announced on Saturday evening that Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi will embark on a tour of several regional countries to discuss recent developments. Baghaei stated, 'Minister Abbas Araghchi will soon visit several regional nations to hold discussions on regional issues, particularly the latest developments.'

The Israeli occupation army also demolished residential buildings in the western areas of Jabalia camp and Al-Saftawi neighborhood in northwestern Gaza City. On Sunday morning, airstrikes targeted a home belonging to the Al-Qabt family in Al-Manshiyya neighborhood and shelled Tal Al-Zaatar in Beit Lahia. Civil Defense in Gaza reported intensified strikes on civilian homes in northern Gaza, including a Saturday attack on a shelter housing displaced families from the Al-Araj family in Tal Al-Zaatar.

Since October 7, 2023, the Israeli occupation army, with unwavering US support, has been carrying out a campaign of genocide in Gaza, resulting in over 145,000 Palestinian casualties, primarily women and children, and leaving more than 10,000 people missing. The destruction has led to widespread famine, claiming the lives of countless children and elderly, while the region endures a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2282018	2024-12-01T01:29:30-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-07394750017330449847.jpg

The Syrian military said on Saturday it was preparing for a counterattack against Takfiri militants who entered parts of Aleppo city.

The military said it was now regrouping, redeploying troops to strengthen its defense lines as it prepared a counterattack. 'With the continued flow of terrorists across the northern borders and the intensification of military and technical support for them, terrorist organizations were able, during the past hours, to enter large parts of Aleppo city neighborhoods without being able to establish fixed positions due to our armed forces continuously targeting them with concentrated and strong strikes, until the arrival of military reinforcements is completed and distributed on the fighting fronts in preparation for launching a counterattack,' the statement read. ‚ö°Ô∏èWarplanes target Al Nusra convoys inside Aleppo city pic.twitter.com/b0eR99u3zF ‚Äî War Monitor (@WarMonitors) November 30, 2024 It added that the terrorist groups had launched 'a broad attack from multiple axes on the Aleppo and Idlib fronts', reporting clashes 'over a strip exceeding 100km (60 miles)'.

On Friday, Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem hailed the great victory achieved against the Zionist enemy following a 66-day brutal Israeli war on Lebanon.

Sheikh Qassem: Hezbollah‚Äôs Victory Surpasses That in 2006, Resist...	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem addressed on Friday the nation two days after the ceasefire took into effect and ended a two-month Zionist war on Lebanon, stressing that we are witnessing a major victory. Sheikh Qassem stressed that Hezbollah achieved a victory that is greater than that reached in 2006 despite all the sacrifices made and the Western support to the Israeli enemy, adding that we emerged triumphant because we prevented the enemy from eradicating the Resistance. When we launched the support front, we reiterated that we do not seek war but are ready for it if imposed by the 'Israeli' enemy, Sheikh Qassem said. His eminence added that the occupation built its plans 64 days ago based on eradicating Hezbollah, letting the northern settlers to return home, and establishing a new Middle East, adding that 'Israel' anticipated achieving its objectives in a short time after targeting our leadership system and the capabilities we possessed. Sheikh Qassem indicated that Hezbollah managed to remain steadfast on the frontlines and began striking the enemy's internal front, placing 'Israel' in a significant defensive position, noting that, during this war, the number of displaced in 'Israel' has grown from 70,000 to hundreds of thousands. According to Hezbollah leader, the Resistance has proven its readiness, with the plans set by His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah being effective and accounting for all developments. 'The occupation bet on internal discord with the hosts, but this gamble failed due to cooperation among sects and factions. The legendary and sacrificial [Martyrdom-Seeking] steadfastness of the fighters astonished the world, terrified the Israeli army, and sowed despair among the enemy.' 'We declare that, as a result of the 'The Formidable in Might' battle, we are witnessing a great victory because we prevented the enemy from destroying Hezbollah, weakening the Resistance, and forced the enemy to justify itself to its public,' Sheikh Qassem said. 'The Resistance has endured and will continue; this victory belongs to everyone who contributed to it, whether through bullets, martyrdom, wounds, prayers, words, or support. This victory is for every honorable and free individual who supported the Resistance and condemned the Israeli aggression.' Hezbollah leader affirmed, 'Defeat surrounds the enemy from all sides. A ceasefire and cessation of aggression have been agreed upon. This agreement is not a treaty or a new accord requiring signatures from states; rather, it is a set of procedural implementations of Resolution 1701, focusing on the area south of the Litani River.' Sheikh Qassem stressed that the coordination between the Resistance and the Lebanese Army will be of the highest level to ensure the implementation of this agreement, adding that no one should bet on any disagreement between us and the army; this agreement falls under the framework of Lebanese sovereignty. 'We thank Allah for our victory, and we express gratitude and pride in the Resistance fighters on the ground who humiliated the enemy and confronted it with legendary resilience. We extend our thanks to our great martyrs who paved the way for strength and dignity‚Äîevery one of our martyrs is great because they transcended this world and rejected humiliation.' Hezbollah leader underscored that the central focus of the agreement today is south of the Litani River, affirming the withdrawal of the 'Israeli army' from all areas it has occupied. His eminence voiced gratitude to the Master of the Nation‚Äôs Martyrs for being the spark of victory and paving this path, alongside your companion, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, saluting the wounded, civil defense teams, and heartfelt respect and thanks to our people‚Äîthe most honorable and purest. We honor your sacrifices and the martyrdom of your loved ones in the field of honor, and we deeply appreciate the displaced and those whose homes were destroyed, his eminence said. Sheikh Qassem also thanked the steadfast and resistant political negotiator, Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, Prime Minister Najib Mikati for his efforts, the leadership of the army and security forces, and the honorable media. His eminence expressed gratitude to the Islamic Republic of Iran and its leader, Imam Khamenei, for his guidance, support, and adherence to the path of Imam Khomeini, as well as to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the martyr Hajj Qassem Soleimani, who laid the foundations and contributed significantly, and to the compassionate Iranian people. 'We will work with our people to rebuild and restore, focusing in this phase on dignified shelter. We will also cooperate with the state, all organizations, and countries willing to assist Lebanon in making it even more beautiful than before.' Our national efforts will involve collaboration and dialogue with political forces that believe the homeland belongs to everyone, according to Sheikh Qassem who added, 'We will prioritize completing constitutional institutions, particularly ensuring the timely election of a president.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2281336	2024-11-29T10:50:04-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-05116920017329061932.jpg
Israeli Enemy Violates Ceasefire, Opens Fire at Civilians in Sout...	Since the ceasefire took into effect early Wednesday, the Israeli enemy has been repeatedly violating its stipulations, opening fire at civilians and destroying properties. The Zionist violations have been accompanied by arrogant media publications which try to impose a new reality that contradicts with the Israeli military failure in face of Hezbollah fighters during the war. The Lebanese government that signed the agreement is requested today to put an end to these violations before the enemy goes too far, which entails the Lebanese people to move again in face of the Zionist aggression. In this regard, the Israeli occupation forces opened fire at a funeral in Khiam, pushing its tanks to the western side of the town.

Iranian Foreign Ministry Calls for Decisive Action Against Terror...	The spokesperson for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Esmail Baghaei, issued a stern warning on the resurgence of terrorist and extremist groups in Syria, urging for 'decisive and coordinated measures' to prevent the spread of terrorism across the region. Baghaei described recent movements of terrorist factions in Syria over the past two days as part of a 'sinister plot' orchestrated by the Israeli occupation regime and the United States to destabilize security in West Asia. He emphasized the critical need for vigilance and cooperation among regional countries, particularly Syria's neighbors, to thwart this dangerous conspiracy.

Highlighting existing agreements under the Astana Peace Process, Baghaei noted that areas such as Aleppo‚Äôs countryside and Idlib are designated de-escalation zones by the guarantor states‚ÄîIran, Turkey, and Russia. He condemned recent terrorist attacks in these areas as blatant violations of these agreements, warning that such actions endanger the positive outcomes of the Astana process and pose a serious threat to regional stability.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280962	2024-11-29T05:22:27-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-08000540017328864512.jpg

Terrorist Groups Move in Syria‚Äôs North just after Israeli Failure...	The Syrian army, backed by the Russian air force and allies, have been confronting a major attack launched by the terrorist groups on the territories it controls in Aleppo Countryside since Wednesday. The militant move comes immediately after the ceasefire in South Lebanon took into effect as Israeli invasion due to the fierce resistance of Hezbollah fighters, which raises several questions about the Zionist role in pushing the takfiris to operate in Syria again in an attempt to undermine its support to the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon. Well-informed sources mentioned that the militant offensive was almost repelled, adding that the Syrian military managed even to contain the terrorist move and launch a counterstrike. The terrorist offensive launched by the takfiri groups in Aleppo western countryside represents a major violation of the ceasefire agreement concluded in 2020 in accordance with Astana talks. The Syrian Army announced in a statement that its military units repelled a major attack launched by the terrorist groups in the countryside of Aleppo and Idlib, adding that the militant suffered much losses.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280566	2024-11-28T12:54:49-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-003734500173282726510.jpg
Lebanon Witnesses Political Momentum after Ceasefire: Speaker Ber...	House Speaker Nabih Berri has scheduled a parliament session devoted to electing a president of the republic for Monday, January 9, at the beginning of a parliament session on Thursday. Before starting the session, Berri asked the lawmakers to observe a moment of silence for the martyrs. Commenting on the president election session, Berri said: 'It will be fruitful, and we have given a one-month period to reach consensus among us.' He added that he will invite the ambassadors of states to attend the session.

The House of Parliament on Thursday concluded its general session during which a proposal by Deputy House Speaker, Elias Bou Saab, to extend the term of Army brigadier generals and higher ranks for one year was put to a vote. The proposal received the support of 48 MPs, effectively extending the term of Lebanese Army Commander, General Joseph Aoun. Speaking from the House of Parliament, MP Hassan Fadlallah, emphasized that the decision to wage war is taken by Israel, stating, 'When they attack us, we will resist.' Fadlallah dismissed the notion of conflict between the Lebanese Army and the resistance, describing their relationship as one of 'unity and solidarity.' Moreover, Fadlallah affirmed support for the Army, recognizing its sacrifices alongside the resistance. 'We stand by the Lebanese Army, which has shed blood for this nation,' he said, explaining the bloc's vote to extend the terms of senior officers to avoid leadership vacancies. The lawmaker called for a unified national vision to build a just state, strengthen the Army with advanced weaponry, and confront Israeli violations. MP Hasan Fadlallah After its war on Lebanon failed to achieve any goal, the Israeli enemy accepted a ceasefire proposal submitted by US and France. The Lebanese health ministry reported 3961 martyrs claimed by the Zionist aggression which ended on November 27.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280423	2024-11-28T07:19:02-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-05319670017328071098.jpeg

For the 419th consecutive day, the Israeli occupation military has continued its devastating aaggression on Gaza Strip, killing 22 Palestinians in airstrikes on the central and southern parts of the territory since Thursday morning.

He explained that 'there are 1.1 million children suffering from malnutrition in the Strip.' For the 55th consecutive day, northern Gaza has been under siege and starvation by the occupation amidst violent aerial and artillery bombardment, and the complete isolation of the northern governorate from Gaza. For the 37th day, the occupation forces continue to forcibly disrupt the work of civil defense in the areas of northern Gaza Strip due to the ongoing Israeli targeting and aggression, where thousands of citizens there have become without humanitarian and medical care.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280346	2024-11-28T05:29:08-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-01811800017257986296.png

Such remarks were echoed by the Israeli army radio, which said that the Israeli shelling of the Lebanese border towns aims at driving residents away from the so-called 'restricted area.' For its part, the Lebanese Army called on residents of Taybe to leave the town following the Israeli drone strike.

Egyptian Team Visits ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô to Present ‚ÄòComprehensive Vision‚Äô f...	An Egyptian security delegation is reportedly expected to arrive in Tel Aviv in the coming hours in an effort to reach a Gaza captive and ceasefire deal. According to Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar, the Cairo officials are expected to present a 'comprehensive vision' for an agreement, amid optimism that a deal can be reached in the wake of ceasefire with Lebanon. The report said the plan calls for a truce that will initially last a month or two and will see the gradual release of Israeli captives held in Gaza, with first priority given to older captives or those who are sick. Concurrently, 'broader and longer discussions will take place, without military pressure on the ground,' the report added. Egyptian officials will request that Hamas be given a period of several days after the truce begins in order to provide a list of the living hostages. The plan would also see the Rafah Border Crossing between Egypt and Gaza quickly returned to operation, under the supervision of the Palestinian Authority, with Egyptian oversight. ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô would be given, according to the report, the right to veto those crossing to Egypt, with Cairo guaranteeing it will secure a Palestinian commitment that Hamas will not be allowed to control either the crossing or the Strip 'during the coming period.' The deal would also see an increase in humanitarian aid for Gaza, and medications would enter the Strip for the hostages that need, Al-Akhbar added. The report also said that ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô will initially be permitted to maintain its military positions within Gaza, but without carrying out operations. Israeli media also reported the visit, with Israeli Channel 12 saying a team from the Egyptian intelligence will visit Tel Aviv on Thursday. The Times of Israel also cited Al-Akhbar report, adding that: 'While not mentioned in the report, the potential deal is also assumed to include the release of Palestinian prisoners.' Earlier on Wednesday families of Israeli captives held for over a year in the Gaza Strip temporarily blocked the entrance to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs Knesset office, demanding that he meet with them and promote a hostage deal. Relatives of Israeli captives held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip block the entrance to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Knesset office, in occupied Al-Quds (November 27, 2024). The protesters were removed by Knesset security. They then went down one floor and blocked the stairs leading to the faction wing of the building, where the various political parties hold meetings and press conferences Israeli media reported.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280170	2024-11-28T03:27:49-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-07819070017319274025.jpg
Resistance Unbreakable: Imam Khamenei Declares Israel‚Äôs Doom, Al-...	The Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, has asserted that the Israeli regime is doomed to perish from the West Asia region. Imam Khamenei stated that the ongoing anti-Israeli operations by regional resistance movements cannot be quelled. 'Al-Aqsa Storm cannot be quenched, and the usurping Zionist regime is destined for departure,' Khamenei's official Persian-language account wrote in a post on Wednesday, accompanied by an illustration of an Israeli tank buried half in the ground with a white flag protruding from its cannon. Leader: Israel destined for departure; al-Aqsa Storm can‚Äôt be quenched ‚Äî Press TV üîª (@PressTV) November 28, 2024 The resistance movements, including Hamas from the Gaza Strip, Islamic Jihad, Lebanon's Hezbollah, and their counterparts in Iraq and Yemen, launched the 'Al-Aqsa Storm' operation last October after the Israeli regime began a genocidal war against the coastal enclave. The operation has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israeli troops and officers, as well as the destruction of a considerable amount of their advanced Western-funded equipment. Hezbollah's successful performance in the operation also forced the regime into approving a ceasefire deal with the movement, ending Tel Aviv's 13-month deadly aggression against Lebanon. In a statement, Hezbollah hailed the operation's success, stating that their fighters 'were able to bring down its (the enemy's) goals and defeat its army.' Hamas also praised Hezbollah's prowess, saying the ceasefire deal had shattered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 'illusion' of reshaping West Asia by force. Khamenei's remarks come after he called for the prosecution of all Israeli political and military officials for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and demanded the death sentence for Netanyahu. Regarding the ceasefire agreement, Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Esmail Baghaei announced that Iran welcomed the cessation of Israeli aggression against Lebanon, reiterating its steadfast support for the Lebanese government, people, and Resistance. Baghaei emphasized Iran's commitment to peace in the region and highlighted its ongoing diplomatic efforts to halt hostilities in Gaza and Lebanon over the past 14 months, which have killed tens of thousands and caused widespread destruction of vital infrastructure. 'The result of the warmongering and crimes committed by the Zionist regime, fully supported by the United States and certain European governments, is the martyrdom of 60,000 innocent people, the wounding of 120,000 individuals, and the displacement of over 3.5 million oppressed people in Palestine and Lebanon,' Baghaei said.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280181	2024-11-28T03:25:49-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-081728400173279314410.jpg
Hochstein: Israeli Buffer Zone in Lebanon 'Fantasy that Won‚Äôt Eve...	US special envoy Amos Hochstein dismissed as 'fantasy' the notion that the Zionist entity could have secured a better deal in which it would have been able to maintain a buffer zone inside Lebanon. During a round of interviews hours after the ceasefire came into place, Hochstein was presented with criticism voiced by former prime minister Naftali Bennett, who said the agreement‚Äôs lack of planned buffer zone in Lebanon will allow Hezbollah to rebuild homes along the border that the resistance group can use as a staging point for a future invasion of the northern settlements and as launch pads for the many anti-tank missiles. 'Yes, there are fantasy deals that are utopia where you get a ceasefire agreement with a security zone, but those won‚Äôt ever happen,' Hochstein responded to Channel 12. The senior adviser to US President Joe Biden maintained that a buffer zone would require ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô to remain in Lebanon as an occupying force ‚Äî something that no sovereign country would accept, Israeli media reported. 'If you choose to have a dead zone or a demilitarized zone, then you are there as an occupier, and you are not there in agreement; which means that while you may have two, three, four or five kilometers inside Lebanon, there won‚Äôt be an agreement to stop [Hezbollah from] shooting at Israel from longer ranges,' Hochstein said. Thousands of displaced Lebanese are returning to their homes in the south of the country as the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire agreement takes effect. pic.twitter.com/1eqxWNdGPB ‚Äî Quds News Network (@QudsNen) November 27, 2024 Asked whether ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô should‚Äôve continued in its efforts to degrade Hezbollah militarily following the massive blows, Hochstein told Channel 12, 'At some point, you have to get to a deal itself.' During a briefing with Jewish American community leaders earlier in the day, Hochstein pointed out that the Zionist entity had never established a war aim of fully dismantling Hezbollah. Tel Aviv‚Äôs stated goal for the northern front was to allow the tens of thousands of Israelis to return to northern settlements near the Blue Line, which wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without a deal, he said. Hochstein was pressed on reports that he had also given ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô an 'It‚Äôs now or never' ultimatum that ultimately convinced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a deal.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280071	2024-11-28T02:18:05-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-08746960017327885342.jpg

The chief commander of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) has celebrated the recent ceasefire between Lebanon and ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô as a strategic and humiliating defeat for the occupying regime. Major General Hossein Salami, in a message to Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem, congratulated Lebanon and its Hezbollah resistance movement for successfully imposing the ceasefire on Israel. Salami described the truce as a major setback for the Zionist regime, which he said failed to achieve any of its 'evil goals and ambitions' in the conflict with Hezbollah. IRGC chief: Lebanon truce ‚Äòstrategic, humiliating defeat‚Äô for Israel ‚Äî Press TV üîª (@PressTV) November 28, 2024 The IRGC chief noted that Israel's acceptance of the ceasefire, while under a barrage of Hezbollah missiles targeting its bases and strategic sites, held important lessons for Tel Aviv and its supporters. He emphasized that the 'usurping entity is on the decline' and the crimes it has committed in Gaza and Lebanon will only serve to strengthen the resistance. Salami further stated that Hezbollah's victory, secured through the 'pure blood of martyrs, the patience and resilience of the Lebanese people, and the unwavering courage and sacrifices of the youth,' represents a significant development in the Islamic Ummah's struggle against Zionists in the region. 'Undoubtedly, this great victory, which was secured thanks to the pure blood of martyrs, the patience and resilience of the Lebanese people, and the unwavering courage and sacrifices of the youth and Hezbollah, is considered a major development in the history of the Islamic Ummah's struggle against Zionists in West Asia.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280049	2024-11-28T01:14:39-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/08/manar-05368670017225129456.jpg
Mikati: Return of Displaced Citizens to Southern Villages Demonst...	Caretaker Prime Minister, Najib Mikati, on Wednesday issued a statement following reports of displaced families returning to their homes in various regions of Lebanon, particularly in the south. Mikati emphasized that the sight of these returnees reaffirmed the Lebanese people's attachment to their land, values, and heritage. 'We have been closely monitoring the return of displaced citizens since early this morning, especially in the southern regions. This demonstrates the steadfastness of the Lebanese in holding onto their land and values,' Mikati said. Looking ahead, Mikati expressed confidence that the Lebanese Army's plan to strengthen its presence in the south would enable the gradual return of more displaced citizens to their homes and villages in the coming days. The Prime Minister also urged both returning citizens and those still remaining in their homes to exercise patience and wait for instructions from the Army's leadership to ensure their safety and security. 'We call on all returnees and those who are still steadfast in their homes to refrain from rushing and to follow the guidance of the Army Command for their own safety,' Mikati added. Shortly after the ceasefire with the Israeli enemy took effect in Lebanon on Wednesday, citizens started to return home in their towns and neighborhoods in Bekaa, south Lebanon and Dahiyeh (the southern suburb of Beirut), defying Israeli threats to return, especially to southern villages.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2279862	2024-11-27T14:57:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-04987210017327482264.png
Islamic Resistance Emerged Victorious over Delusional Enemy, Carr...	The Islamic Resistance Operations Room issued on Wednesday a statement which affirmed that, in support of the steadfast Palestinian people as well as their valiant and honorable resistance, and in defense of Lebanon and its resilient people, the Islamic Resistance continues its journey, answering the call of its Secretary-General and supreme martyr, His Eminence Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, may Allah sanctify his soul, and under the banner of his successor, His Eminence Sheikh Naim Qassem, may Allah preserve him. Over more than 13 months, the resistance has maintained its pledge and fight, achieving victory over the delusional enemy that has failed to break its resolve or will, according to the statement which added that it is the battlefield that has spoken, with steadfast fighters relying on Allah to thwart the enemy‚Äôs goals, defeat its army, and pen with their blood epics of resilience and defiance during the battles of Al-Aqsa Flood and The Formidable in Might. On this momentous occasion, the Resistance announced the following: - Since the launch of Al-Aqsa Flood operations on October 8, 2023, the Islamic Resistance has conducted more than 4,637 [announced] military operations over 417 days, averaging 11 operations daily. - Since the start of 'Israeli' enemy aggression on Lebanon and the launch of The Formidable in Might operations on September 17, 2024, the resistance has executed 1,666 diverse military operations, averaging 23 operations daily. These targeted 'Israeli' army sites, barracks, bases, cities, and settlements, ranging from the Lebanese-Palestinian border to beyond Tel Aviv. The operations also included heroic confrontations against ground incursions into Lebanese territories. - Within the framework of The Formidable in Might operations, the resistance conducted 105 military operations under the qualitative Khaibar series. These targeted dozens of strategic military and security bases, many for the first time in the enemy's history, employing qualitative ballistic and qualitative missiles and advanced drones, reaching depths of 150 km into occupied Palestinian territory, beyond Tel Aviv. - Cumulative losses inflicted on the 'Israeli' enemy army since its ground advance into Lebanese territories on October 1, 2024, until the issuance of this statement include: - Over 130 soldiers and officers were killed, with more than 1,250 wounded. - Destruction of 59 Merkava tanks, 11 military bulldozers, 2 Hummers, 2 armored vehicles, and 2 personnel carriers. - Downing of 6 Hermes 450 drones, 2 Hermes 900 drones, and one quadcopter glider. It should be noted that these figures do not include losses at military bases, sites, settlements, and occupied cities. The Islamic Resistance Operations Room emphasized the following: - During the 'Israeli' enemy ground operation into Lebanese territories since October 1, 2024, and due to the steadfastness of our fighters, the invading forces failed to occupy or secure any of the first-tier frontline towns‚Äîdespite continuous aggression since the start of Al-Aqsa Flood. They also failed to establish a military-security buffer zone as they had hoped and were unable to prevent rocket and drone launches into occupied territory. Even on the last day of aggression, our fighters continued targeting the enemy's depth from within border towns. - The second phase of the ground operation was merely a political and media announcement. The enemy failed to advance into second-tier frontline towns, suffering heavy losses in Al-Khiam (which it withdrew from thrice), Ainatha, Tallousa, Bint Jbeil, and Al-Qawzah. The sole attempt to advance into Al-Bayyadah and Shamaa in the western sector turned into a graveyard for the tanks and elite troops of the 'Israeli' enemy army, who were forced to retreat under the resistance's blows. - The resistance's defensive strategy is based on area-specific defense. It has prepared over 300 defensive lines south of the Litani River, each fully equipped in terms of manpower, equipment, and readiness. The outcomes in Al-Bayyadah and Al-Khiam stand as clear proof. - The Islamic Resistance Operations Room reaffirms that its fighters across all military specializations remain fully prepared to confront 'Israeli' enemy ambitions and aggression. Their eyes remain fixed on the movements and withdrawals of enemy forces beyond the borders, with their hands ready on the trigger, in defense of Lebanon's sovereignty and for the honor and dignity of its people. The statement also addressed the Honorable People of the Resistance: O most noble, pure, and honorable of people, our dear and steadfast nation, free sons and daughters of our homeland, who, with your legendary resilience and limitless sacrifices, shattered the enemy‚Äôs illusions. Victory, by Allah‚Äôs grace, has been the ally of the righteous cause you have embraced and carried, returning to your villages and homes with pride and dignity. You roam the world with triumph, bearing the steadfast and elevated banner, rooted in the battlefield and conscience, a banner that will forever resist oppression and aggression. The Islamic Resistance, which has sacrificed its finest leaders and fighters in the path of Allah, in defense of its land and people, and in support of the oppressed in Palestine, addresses you today, as well as all the free people of the world and the fighters in the fields, with a salute of arms, fight, martyrdom, and victory. It pledges, in the name of its fighters and knights, to honor every drop of pure blood and every sacred soul by continuing the path of resistance with even greater determination. It vows to remain steadfast in standing by the oppressed, the vulnerable, and the fighters in Palestine, with its capital, the Sacred Al-Quds, which will remain a symbol and a path for generations yearning for freedom and liberation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2279829	2024-11-27T11:49:58-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-027725400166239486010.jpg
US Pressed Netanyahu to Accept Lebanon Ceasefire due to Israeli M...	Member of Hezbollah Central Council, Sheikh Hasan Al-Baghdadi, indicated that the experience with the Americans and the Israelis confirms that they are one party and have one project, which is to plunder wealth, dominate the region, and launch a new Middle East scheme. 'This was clear from the statements of Netanyahu and others, in addition to what America and some of the West did by bringing fleets to isolate Gaza and prevent aid, issuing threats, and inciting against the Islamic Resistance inside Lebanon through its ambassador. The experience of more than a year and two months of aggression against Gaza and Lebanon proves that the Americans were undoubtedly managing and financing the war and did not want to stop it.' His eminence added: 'What happened was due to the huge difference in capabilities between Hezbollah and the resistance in Palestine, which put the temporary entity in the circle of danger. Therefore, the Americans and others began to pressure Netanyahu‚Äôs government to stop the war out of fear for them and their certainty that the Israeli army is unable to win, not for the sake of Lebanon, as all the killing and destruction here were by American missiles.' Al-Baghdadi affirmed that the Israeli losses were beyond imagination in various security and economic fields, especially in the military establishment that is on the verge of collapse. 'This is understood from the position of the West, American pressure, the Israeli opposition, mayors and competent authorities in the Zionist settlements, and some hypocritical parties in Lebanon who, like their masters, thought that Hezbollah collapsed after the security strikes, and they do not understand that it is an ideological Party that is not linked to individuals, no matter how high their status is.' Shortly after the ceasefire with the Israeli enemy took effect in Lebanon on Wednesday, citizens started to return home in their towns and neighborhoods in Bekaa, south Lebanon and Dahiyeh (the southern suburb of Beirut), defying Israeli threats to return, especially to southern villages.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2279796	2024-11-27T10:56:05-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-02607140017327337595.jpeg

Lebanese parliament Speaker Nabih Berri called for all displaced people, including those abroad, to return home, few hours after the ceasefire between Lebanon and the Zionist entity took effect at dawn. In a televised speech, Speaker Berri saluted the nation‚Äôs martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, whom he said tasked him with the responsibility of the political resistance. 'I call you to come back to your country, come back to your towns and come back to the places where you were born, even if they were in rubble. You should protect the land that saw the blood of all the martyrs,' stated Speaker Berri, who was mandated by Hezbollah to lead negotiations on behalf of Hezbollah and along PM Najib Mikati on behalf of the Lebanese State. 'Come back to your land and bring back life to all the neighborhoods that the Israeli occupation and aggression tried to destroy. The victory of your land relies on you coming back,' he added. Speaker Berri said Lebanon needs 'to elect a president as soon as possible'. 'It should unify all of us. It is a test so that we can protect Lebanon from all the threats including Israeli threats,' the Lebanese Parliament speaker said. 'The only thing which would keep us all together is to protect Lebanon, so we can overcome this challenge and be stronger,' Berri added. 'And also to demonstrate and show to the world that it is a country that can coexist with its different spiritual components, in contradiction with the racism of Israel,' he noted.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2279620	2024-11-27T03:33:32-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-07687950017327071093.jpg
Gaza‚Äôs Islamic Jihad Vows Unity with Hezbollah Until Victory	The secretary-general of the Gaza-based Palestinian resistance movement Islamic Jihad has pledged continued unity with its Lebanese counterpart, Hezbollah, until victory is achieved. In a message to Hezbollah's deputy secretary-general, Sheikh Naim Qassem, Ziad Nakhala declared, 'We will stay united as one front and one Resistance, until victory.' The Palestinian official further commended regional resistance movements for their valiant and successful struggle in the face of the Israeli regime and its allies. 'From Palestine to Lebanon, from the courageous Gaza to the resilient suburbs of Beirut, and from the heroic Palestinian fighters to the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon, we commend your unwavering steadfastness and strength,' he wrote. 'Despite the wounds and the relentless onslaught of enemies, led by the US and its allies, you continue to uphold the banner of resistance with pride and dignity.' Nakhala recalled how the resistance groups had rushed to Palestinians‚Äô defense and support, 'offering your valuable lives, while others were unable to provide even basic relief to the thirsty and hungry people of Palestine.' The comments concerned hundreds of successful retaliatory operations that the movements have been carrying out against the occupied Palestinian territories since last October, when the Israeli regime began bringing the Gaza Strip under a genocidal war. The remarks come after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a ceasefire deal, following a deadly Israeli aggression on Gaza and Lebanon that claimed over 3,700 lives. Hezbollah has responded with hundreds of successful retaliatory strikes, which observers believe forced Israel's hand in accepting the ceasefire. Nakhala praised the resistance movements for rushing to the defense of Palestinians, 'offering your valuable lives, while others were unable to provide even basic relief to the thirsty and hungry people of Palestine.' He expressed confidence that the united front of resistance will continue to 'uphold the banner of resistance with pride and dignity' until victory is achieved.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2279521	2024-11-27T02:26:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/11/manar-09077080017008254086.jpeg

Shortly after the ceasefire with the Israeli enemy took effect in Lebanon on Wednesday, citizens started to return home in their towns and neighborhoods in Bekaa, south Lebanon and Dahiyeh (the southern suburb of Beirut), defying Israeli threats to return, especially to southern villages. Israeli occupation army warned soon after the ceasefire began at 4:00 at dawn that residents of south Lebanon should not approach enemy army positions and villages its forces had ordered to be evacuated. 'With the entry into force of the ceasefire agreement and based on its provisions, the IDF remains deployed in its positions inside southern Lebanon,' enemy army spokesman Avichay Adraee said in a post on X, referring to the Israeli occupation forces. 'You are prohibited from heading towards the villages that the IDF has ordered to be evacuated or towards IDF forces in the area.' However, photos and videos circulated on social media showed streams of cars carrying displaced people heading for southern villages, as the citizens couldn‚Äôt wait more to go to their hometowns after 65 days of brutal Israeli aggression that started on September 23. ÿ™Ÿàÿ´ŸäŸÇ ŸÑÿ≤ÿ≠ŸÖÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ≥Ÿäÿ±.. ÿßŸÑŸÜÿßÿ≤ÿ≠ŸàŸÜ ŸäÿπŸàÿØŸàŸÜ ÿ•ŸÑŸâ ŸÇÿ±ÿßŸáŸÖ ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÜŸàÿ®.#ŸàŸÇÿßÿ¶ÿπ pic.twitter.com/XqouGZS10C ‚Äî ŸàŸÇÿßÿ¶ÿπ (@waqa2e3) November 27, 2024 The hours before the truce took effect were some of the most violent in the war, with the Israeli enemy staging violent raids on the capital Beirut, Dahiyeh, Bekaa and southern Lebanon.

Netanyahu Indirectly Acknowledges Failure of War on Lebanon: We N...	After around two months of war on Lebanon, the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Tel Aviv would approve an indirect ceasefire deal with Lebanon mediated by the United States and France. In a press conference on Tuesday evening, Netanyau claimed that the Israeli approval of the ceasefire came in order to concentrate on the 'Iranian threat', reactivate the army, overcome the restrictions imposed on the arms supplies to 'Israel', and separating the Lebanese and Gaza fronts in order to isolate Hamas were behind the Zionist decision to accept the ceasefire. In an attempt to justify the decision before the Israelis, Netanyahu said that the occupation army would attack whenever it detects violation of the deal, alleging that 'Israel' would prevent Hezbollah from rearming. The Israeli Channel 13 conducted a poll which showed that 61% of the Zionists believe that 'Israel' did not win the war. Netanyahu also faces a harsh criticism from the residents of the northern settlements over the agreement, amid assertions that the displaced settlers would not return home in light of the outcome of the ongoing confrontation. In this regard, the former minister Avigdor Lieberman said that none can prevent Hezbollah from rearming, calling on the displaced settlers to avoid returning to the 'North'.

In a scene of maximum madness, confusion, and fear of Hezbollah entitlements in addition to the national steadfastness in Lebanon, the Israeli enemy attacked the capital Beirut with a number of air raids.

The Zionist insanity was also reflected in targeting a house in Qobayat, Akkar. Sidon and Tyre received their portions from the Israeli grudge with air raid which also targeted towns in South Lebanon, including Khiam on the borders.

Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance demonstrated its might to protect Lebanon's people and territory from the Israeli occupation's continuous aggression. Through meticulous strikes on crucial Israeli positions, extending from the southern borders into occupied areas, the Resistance successfully halted Israeli attempts to advance into border villages and disrupted any major incursions. Notably, Israeli forces were compelled to retreat under the pressure of resistance attacks from Shama and Tayr Harfa, retreating towards Alma Al-Shab, near the occupied Palestinian border. Hezbollah's military media released a series of statements detailing the attacks and their outcomes: The initial statement indicated that at 10:15 AM on Tuesday, November 26, 2024, the Islamic Resistance fighters targeted the Kiryat Shmona settlement with a salvo of qualitative missiles. The second statement declared that at 11:45 AM on Tuesday, Hezbollah fighters targeted a Merkava tank with a guided missile stationed inside the city of Khiam, near the municipality center, destroying it and killing and wounding its crew. Simultaneously at 11:30 AM, the Islamic Resistance fighters targeted gatherings of Israeli enemy forces in the settlements of Al-Manara and Avivim with rocket salvoes, according to the group's third and fourth statements. The fifth statement declared that, early on Tuesday, at 7:20 AM, Islamic Resistance fighters conducted an aerial assault using a squadron of attack drones on the Ma'ale Golani barracks, the headquarters of the 810th Hermon Brigade, delivering precise hits on their targets. Simultaneously at 07:20, the Islamic Resistance fighters launched an air attack with a squadron of suicide drones on the Habushit site (the headquarters of a company affiliated with the 810th Hermon Brigade) on the summit of Mount Hermon in the occupied Syrian Golan and hit their targets accurately. The eighth statement highlighted that at 23:30 on Monday, November 25, 2024, Islamic Resistance fighters launched a salvo of advanced missiles targeting, for the first time, an infantry training camp in Shavei Tzion, south of Nahariyya. Israeli media aired footage of rockets directly hitting the occupied city, reporting multiple settler injuries, including some in critical condition: The ninth statement highlighted that at 14:20 on Tuesday, Islamic Resistance fighters targeted a gathering of Israeli enemy forces in the Al-Manara settlement with a rocket salvo, marking the second attack on this area.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2278322	2024-11-26T05:43:19-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-01652270017326282704.jpg

Imam Khamenei Calls for Netanyahu‚Äôs Execution	Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, the leader of Iran's Islamic Revolution, has demanded that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be sentenced to death, dismissing the International Criminal Court's (ICC) recently issued arrest warrant as an inadequate response to Netanyahu's war crimes in Gaza and Lebanon. Ayatollah Khamenei Urges Capital Punishment for Netanyahu pic.twitter.com/fWnXiKV3DC ‚Äî Tasnim News Agency (@Tasnimnews_EN) November 25, 2024 'The (ICC) arrest warrant is not enough, Netanyahu's death sentence must be ordered,' Imam Khamenei said during a meeting with members of the Iranian Basij volunteer force on Monday, as part of Basij Week celebrations. The ICC has issued arrest warrants against Netanyahu and his former defense minister Yoav Gallant for their roles in the ongoing genocide in Gaza and atrocities committed in Lebanon. The warrants mean the two Israeli leaders risk arrest if they travel to any of the 124 countries that have signed the Rome Statute establishing the ICC. Condemning Israel's aggression in Gaza and Lebanon, Imam Khamenei dismissed the bombing of civilian homes as a crime rather than a victory. The Leader asserted that ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô has failed to win its wars in these regions and will never succeed. The Leader noted that Imam Khomeini, founder of the Islamic Revolution, created Basij volunteer force as a 'bulwark' against threats. Basiji is not intimidated by the US and Israeli propaganda, he asserted, adding that some of the prominent Iranian scientists, who were assassinated by the enemy, were members of the volunteer force. Imam Khamenei further said that Basij will definitely destroy the Zionist regime. Basij, he emphasized, should strengthen, expand and maintain preparedness. The leader said the United States' ideal for the region is either submission or chaos, urging the force to counter US duality of dictator ship and anarchy. Additionally in his remarks, the Leader praised Basij‚Äôs successes in foiling enemies‚Äô plots against the Islamic Revolution. Imam Khamenei touched on a deal around 15 years ago, when the US 'vowed' to deliver uranium with 20 percent purity to Iran to be used for radio pharmaceuticals in return for taking all of the country's 3.5 percent uranium. 'The Americans were cheating, we realized that they were cheating. It (the deal) was stopped,' the Leader said.'Those who disrupted the US's evil conspiracy in the case of 20 percent enriched uranium, which was needed by the country, were Basij members.' 'At the same time, Iran‚Äôs Basiji professors managed to produce the 20 percent enriched uranium inside the country. Americans could not believe this would happen,' the Leader added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2277596	2024-11-25T04:05:35-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-08656070017325363297.jpg
Iraqi Resistance Strikes Back at Israeli Targets in Occupied Terr...
