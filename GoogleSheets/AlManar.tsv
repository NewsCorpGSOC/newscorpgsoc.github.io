Israeli Airstrikes Devastate Northern Gaza, Killing Dozens	The northern Gaza Strip is facing a relentless onslaught by Israeli occupation forces, resulting in catastrophic loss of life and a dire humanitarian crisis. For the 23rd consecutive day, the region has been engulfed in a brutal assault by the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF), which has persisted for over a year.

Qualitative Run-Over Operation Shakes Tel Aviv: Six Killed, 50 In...	Six Israelis were killed and dozens injured in a heroic vehicle-ramming incident at the Glilot junction on the outskirts of Tel Aviv on Sunday. Initial reports indicated that a truck collided with a bus stop near the intersection, leading to investigations into the circumstances of the event. Subsequent coverage revealed that the truck also ran over a significant number of Israeli soldiers near a military base in Giladi, heightening concerns about the scale of the incident. A security news website has confirmed that at least 50 settlers, all of whom were Israeli soldiers, were injured when a truck collided with a group of pedestrians at the Glilot Junction near the Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv. This incident preceded the announcement of at least six fatalities. Israeli media reported that 15 of the injured are in critical condition. Israeli Army Radio corroborated this, citing eyewitness accounts that a significant number of those injured were soldiers en route to their military bases. Additionally, the newspaper 'Yedioth Ahronoth' noted that several individuals were trapped under the truck and were in critical condition. The Israeli ambulance service stated that it 'provided first aid to dozens of people involved in the incident,' underscoring the severity of the situation and the high number of injuries resulting from the attack. As usual, to cover up his failure, Itamar Ben Gvir, the Israeli occupation's Minister of National Security, visited the site of the ramming attack in Tel Aviv. Palestinian Resistance Hails Operation The Resistance Committees declared that the run-over operation in Glilot represents a resounding blow and a sharp rebuke to the crumbling and weakened Zionist security and military system. 'We celebrate the heroic run-over operation in Glilot, viewing it as a natural response to the crimes, terrorism, and Zionist war of extermination in Palestine and Lebanon,' the statement read. 'This operation serves as a clear message to the Zionist public: the image of victory that [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu seeks is nothing more than an illusion and a mirage.' The Islamic Jihad Movement extended its congratulations for the heroic operation in Tel Aviv. 'This attack is a natural response to the massacres perpetrated by the Zionist enemy against our steadfast and resilient people, particularly in light of the recent genocidal crimes in northern Gaza,' the resistance said in a statement. 'The resilience and determination of our people are exemplified in the courageous Tel Aviv operation, demonstrating that the Resistance remains active in the West Bank, Gaza, southern Lebanon, Yemen, and Iraq, consistently inflicting pain on the enemy. This confirms that the Resistance retains the initiative and is always prepared to deliver painful strikes to the occupying forces,' it added. The Islamic Jihad Movement asserts that the Resistance, supported by its steadfast people, will continue to confront the enemy’s schemes throughout the occupied Palestinian territories.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2246620	2024-10-27T03:21:43-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-05216210017300244814.jpg

The source added that the action by the Zionists has been taken from outside the Iranian border and has caused limited damages. 'The reports alleging that 100 Israeli military planes have had a role in the strike are also complete lies, as Israel is seeking to overplay its weak attack,' the source added.

'Flights will return to normal from 9:00 am (0530 GMT) on Saturday,' the spokesperson of the organization said, according to the official IRNA news agency.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2245289	2024-10-26T00:08:26-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04017570017299264829.jpg

Supreme Leader Issues Condolence Statement on Martyrdom of Hezbol...	The Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Imam Khamenei, issued a statement addressing the dear youth of the Resistance Front, praising the personality of His Eminence, the Head of the Executive Council of Hezbollah in Lebanon, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine (May Allah's blessings be upon him). His Eminence emphasized, 'Hezbollah today remains the strongest defender of Lebanon and the firmest shield against the ambitions of the Zionist entity, which has long sought to dismantle Lebanon.' 'The brave and sacrificing fighter, His Eminence Sayyed Hashem Safieddine (May Allah's blessings be upon him), has joined the ranks of the martyrs of the Resistance. The sky of fight in the path of Sacred Al-Quds is now adorned with a new shining star. His Eminence was one of the most prominent figures in Hezbollah, a steadfast supporter and constant companion of His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Thanks to the wisdom and courage of leaders like him, Hezbollah was able to protect Lebanon from the danger of division and collapse once again and thwart the threat posed by the usurping entity, whose cruel and unjust army sometimes trampled the ground all the way to Beirut. His Eminence's chivalry and sacrifice, alongside the other leaders and fighters in the Axis of Nasrallah, eliminated the danger of the occupation of southern Litani, Tyre, and other cities in that region, and their annexation to the usurped and occupied Palestine. They made the souls, properties, and valuable reputation of Hezbollah enter the battlefield to preserve the sovereignty of Lebanon's territories, foiling the plans of the aggressive and criminal Zionist entity.' While it may appear today that leaders like Nasrallah and Safieddine are absent in this life, their souls and leadership remain present in the field, defending Lebanon and its defenseless people, Imam Khamenei underlined. 'Hezbollah today remains the strongest defender of Lebanon and the firmest shield against the ambitions of the Zionist entity, which has long sought to divide Lebanon. The enemy tries to deny Hezbollah's sacrificial role for Lebanon, but those who care must not allow these false claims shouted by their voices to reach people's ears.' 'Hezbollah is alive and growing stronger, fulfilling its historic role. The Islamic Republic, as always, will continue to support the fighters for Al-Quds and the resistors against the occupation by the criminal and usurping gang of Palestine, by Allah's permission.' I offer my congratulations and condolences on the martyrdom of our dear Sayyed Safieddine to his honorable family, his relatives, and his fellow fighters across all Resistance fronts, Imam Khamenei concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2243551	2024-10-24T13:37:06-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/06/manar-089647100168752915110.jpg

Sayyed Houthi: Resistance in Lebanon, Palestine Surprised Enemies	Head of Yemen's Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Al-Houthi tackled in a televised speech on Thursday the latest developments of the Israeli aggression on Gaza and Lebanon, offering Hezbollah condolences on the martyrdom of Sayyed Hashem Safieddine. Sayyed Houthi underlined the great faith and jihadi contributions of the martyred leader Sayyed Safieddine, pointing that the enemy aims at striking the Umma morale by targeting its leaders. Sayyed Houthi indicated that what the Israeli enemy is doing, including committing crimes of genocide and targeting children and women, is not a military achievement. 'From a military perspective, the Israeli enemy has failed, and its failure is evident in Gaza and on the northern front against Lebanon, as well as in all other fronts.' Arabs are targeted by the Israeli enemy more than anyone else, regardless of how some may ignore or turn a blind eye to these established truths, Sayyed Houthi said. The enemy has encountered the solid front of Hezbollah after expecting that by targeting leaders, it would have the opportunity to control Lebanon, he stressed. According to Sayyed Houthi, the Israeli enemy has resorted to criminal behavior by comprehensively targeting civilians in Lebanon and destroying residential neighborhoods and villages. The Israeli enemy, along with the Americans, is attempting to pressure for a change in the political situation and stance of the Lebanese government and its components, Houthi added. 'The enemy is trying to incite everyone against Hezbollah, portraying it as the problem in Lebanon,' he said, 'The real threat to Lebanon's security, safety, independence, and the freedom of the Lebanese people is the Israeli enemy.' 'The enemy aims, at the very least, for part of Lebanon to be under its control, framed as a security belt, like in the past, and to control the sources of rivers. The experience of the Lebanese people rallying around the Islamic Resistance to achieve victory and repel the Israeli enemy is the available and correct solution.' Sayyed Houthi also noted that the enemy seeks to impose options that serve its interests under the guise of 'the second day in Gaza,' with support from some Arab regimes. 'The Palestinian factions and the Palestinian people will not accept options that serve the Israeli enemy and are aware of the American deception since Al-Aqsa Flood operation.' 'The Americans, in collaboration with the Israelis, are preparing for an aggressive operation against the Islamic Republic of Iran, while sending their Secretary of State to speak about peace and stop escalation.' The American approach is part of a tactic to serve the Israeli position, and our Ummah should not be deceived by the American stance, he warned. Al-Qassam Brigades are inflicting heavy losses on the Israeli enemy, and the martyrdom of Sheikh Sinwar has only increased their determination, inspiration, and steadfastness, Houthi emphasized. 'The impact of the martyrdom of Sheikh Sinwar, may Allah have mercy on him, on both the Palestinian and global levels cannot be erased by the Israeli enemy's attempts to distort the heroic and inspiring stance surrounding his sacrifice.' Al-Quds Brigades and other Palestinian factions stand bravely alongside Al-Qassam Brigades, carrying out daily heroic operations, he added. 'The Lebanese front has established the equation of Yafa (Tel Aviv) and turned Haifa into an abandoned city, with the occupiers spending most of their time in shelters.' The significant jihad operation by Hezbollah, which breached the enemy's defense systems and reached the bedroom of the criminal Netanyahu, has instilled fear in the hearts of all Israeli leaders, Houthi stressed. Meanwhile, the support front in Iraq continues to escalate steadily, unconcerned by media attacks, political pressure from the U.S., and its allies, Houthi noted. 'Our front in Yemen, the land of faith and wisdom, remains steadfast and resilient in the battle of the promised opening and the sacred jihad.' Operations at sea and the bombardment of the Israeli enemy with rockets and drones targeting occupied Palestine continue, Sayyed Houthi confirmed. 'The intense popular activities in Yemen are unparalleled anywhere in the world. We are in a practical path, preparing for any level of escalation the Americans and Israelis may resort to.' The banner of jihad in the way of Allah, carried by our Yemeni people, is high, steadfast, and firmly rooted, he stresed. There is no weakness, fatigue, or defeat, only steadfastness and resilience expressed by the Yemeni people through their positions and sacrifices, demonstrated in their weekly million-strong marches, Sayyed Houthi concluded. In continuation of the support of the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and resistance against the Israeli oppression,and retaliation to the American-British aggression against Yemen, the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out a specific military operation targeting a military base belonging to the Israeli occupation east of the occupied Yaffa area with a hypersonic ballistic missile Palestine 2.

Iraqi Resistance Steps up Attacks against Zionist Entity	Iraqi resistance announced on Thursday more strikes against the Israeli occupation regime, a day after it staged five attacks that hit several targets across the Zionist entity. Islamic Resistance in Iraq said its fighters flew drones that attacked a military target in northern occupied territories. In a statement published early on Thursday, the Iraqi resistance group said the drone strike was 'in support of our people in Palestine and Lebanon, and in response to the massacres committed by the occupying entity against civilians including children, women, and the elderly.' It vowed to continue striking strike strongholds of the enemies at an escalating pace. The group published the following video of the operaion. It was written that the target was Ramat David Base in northern occupied Palestine, with the image of Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah appearing in the footage.

Hezbollah Fighters Kill Over 70 Israeli Soldiers, Injure 600 Othe...	The Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance presented a summary for all the military confrontation with the Zionist occupation army, detailing the achievements of all Hezbollah military units. The Islamic Resistance continued to confront the Israeli aggression against Lebanon, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy’s army in terms of personnel and equipment across the fronts, in addition to its positions deep within occupied Palestine, according to the summary which gave the sufficient details, as follows. 1- Ground confrontations: In recent days, the surrounding areas and some neighborhoods of the front-line villages in southern Lebanon along the Lebanese-Palestinian border have witnessed numerous attempts by the 'Israeli' enemy army to advance toward these villages with the aim of occupying and controlling them. The fighters of the Islamic Resistance are resisting these attempts across multiple fronts as follows: - First Front: The area of operations of the enemy's 146th division, extending from Naqoura in the west to Marwahin in the east. Operations in this sector have been limited to infiltration attempts toward the southern neighborhoods of Marwahin, Al-Dhayra, Yarin, and Alma Al-Shaab, with the intention of rigging houses and blowing them up to prevent their use by the fighters. The fighters of the Islamic Resistance have confronted these attempts, targeting the enemy’s gatherings and lines of advance in Ras Naqoura, Hanita, and the vicinity of Al-Dhayra village. - Second Front: The area of operations of the enemy's 36th division, extending from Ramya in the west to Rmeish in the east (including Aita Al-Shaab), and from Rmeish to Aitaroun in the east. Following the heroic confrontations in the triangle of Aita Al-Shaab - Al-Qawzah - Ramya last week, where the enemy suffered heavy losses at the hands of the Resistance fighters, the enemy attempted in recent days to advance toward the 'Abu Al-Laban' height east of Aita Al-Shaab to occupy it and establish control over the town. The fighters of the Islamic Resistance confronted the enemy’s forces, targeting its gatherings and lines of advance in Khallet Wardeh and the vicinity of Aita Al-Shaab, as well as targeting many troops that infiltrated the area around the municipality building, resulting in casualties, including deaths and injuries. The evacuation operations continued for hours due to repeated resistance attacks. Enemy formations are attempting to advance toward the center of Aitaroun from the eastern and western neighborhoods to occupy it and isolate it from its surroundings. Simultaneously, attempts to advance toward the centers of Maroun Al-Ras and Yaroun are being made from the southern neighborhoods of the two towns. The fighters of the Islamic Resistance are targeting the enemy's gatherings and lines of advance with intense and repeated barrages, inflicting significant losses and hindering their movement, forcing them to retreat to less exposed areas. - Third Front: The area of operations of the enemy's 91st division, extending from Blida in the south to Houla in the north. The enemy’s forces advanced in this sector through concealed paths toward some eastern neighborhoods of Mays Al-Jabal, Mhaibib, and Blida, where they rigged and detonated some houses. The enemy is attempting to advance toward the eastern neighborhoods of Hula amid fierce confrontations with the fighters of the Islamic Resistance. It should be noted that the enemy's actions in rigging and exploding houses in Mhaibib come after its failure to establish control over the town and secure its forces out of fear of resistance attacks. - Fourth Front: The area of operations of the enemy's 98th division, extending from Markaba in the south to the occupied Lebanese village of Al-Ghajar in the east. The enemy attempted to infiltrate into the town of Al-Taybeh from the southern and eastern sides, and the fighters of the Islamic Resistance responded with small arms and rockets, resulting in many fatalities and injuries among the infiltrating force. 2- Rocket Force: The Rocket Force of the Islamic Resistance continues to target enemy concentrations in military sites and barracks along the Lebanese-Palestinian border and in the occupied northern cities and settlements. This targeting is progressively escalating day by day, reaching the enemy's military, strategic, and security bases deep within occupied Palestine using various types of missiles, including precision missiles that are being used for the first time. 3- Air Force: The Air Force of the Islamic Resistance is persistently monitoring and targeting enemy military bases from the Lebanese-Palestinian border to the depths of occupied Palestine using various types of drones, including advanced types that are being used for the first time. 4- Air Defense Unit: The fighters of the Islamic Resistance in the air defense units are responding to 'Israeli' aircraft, both reconnaissance and combat, that are violating Lebanese airspace. They have managed to shoot down four drones. According to the summary, the total losses inflicted on the enemy, as recorded by the fighters of the Islamic Resistance, exceed 70 killed and more than 600 wounded among the officers and soldiers of the 'Israeli' enemy army. 'This includes the destruction of 28 Merkava tanks, four military bulldozers, and several armored vehicles and personnel carriers. Additionally, three drones of the 'Hermes 450' model and one of the 'Hermes 900' model have been shot down.' This tally does not include the losses incurred by the Israeli enemy in the military bases and sites in northern and deep occupied Palestine, the summary concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2241912	2024-10-23T12:29:04-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-08559660017297117333.jpg
In-Depth | The Hidden Motives Behind Hochstein’s Visit and the St...	Zoulfikar Daher The first visit of US envoy Amos Hochstein to Beirut since the outbreak of Israel’s large-scale aggression against Lebanon came approximately three weeks after the Israeli enemy expanded its operations across southern Lebanon, the Bekaa, and even the southern suburbs of Beirut and the capital itself. US special envoy Amos Hochstein speaks to reporters after a meeting with Lebanon's Parliament Speaker in Beirut on October 21, 2024. US special envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut on October 21 to meet Lebanon's PM and Speaker of the House Nabih Berri (Photo by AFP) Prior to his visit, speculation arose about its true purpose: Was Hochstein bringing concrete solutions, or was he simply testing the waters and assessing the political landscape? Some questioned whether he was delivering Israeli demands aimed at pressuring Lebanon into submission. Did this move stem from American initiative alone, or was it coordinated with 'Israel' as part of its efforts to impose terms? Alternatively, could it signal Israel’s realization that the conflict with the resistance is proving more difficult than anticipated, given the losses it has suffered along the Lebanese-Palestinian border? There is a view that the Israeli enemy, recognizing the challenge posed by the resistance, is attempting to de-escalate while still hoping to extract some benefit from its tactical strikes. However, these strikes have done little to alter the situation. The resistance remains steadfast, its retaliation capabilities growing and reaching deeper into Israeli territory, while its capacity to manage the conflict remains strong. Fearing that Israel’s 'achievements' on the ground might slip away, the US administration appears to have dispatched Hochstein to reopen negotiations. The strategy follows a familiar pattern: escalate demands to the maximum in hopes of gaining concessions, all while threatening continued aggression. Simultaneously, Israeli attacks intensified in various areas, particularly in the southern suburbs of Beirut (Dahiyeh). The timing of these escalations, paired with Hochstein’s visit, was no coincidence. 'Israel' aimed to showcase its destructive capabilities, resorting to psychological warfare by targeting buildings associated with the Al-Qard Al-Hassan Association, although these were largely unoccupied. This was intended to send a message to the Lebanese leadership receiving the American envoy. The strikes continued the following night, extending to Al-Awzai and areas near Beirut’s governmental hospital. But the question remains: Can these aggressive moves impose Israel’s conditions on Lebanon? Hochstein reportedly presented amendments to UN Resolution 1701, which included: • Expanding the role of international forces and allowing them to operate without restrictions. • Pushing the resistance several kilometers north of the Litani River, with some reports suggesting as far as the Owali River near Sidon. • Assigning oversight of the resolution’s implementation to US, British, or German forces. • Granting 'Israel' unrestricted access to Lebanese airspace for supervision. These terms essentially aim to hand 'Israel' significant control, leaving Lebanon, its army, people, and resistance with little ability to defend national sovereignty. Some media and political voices have described this proposal as nothing less than a 'surrender document.' However, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri reaffirmed Lebanon’s commitment to Resolution 1701, with no amendments. He emphasized that this is the final opportunity for the US to intervene diplomatically and halt the war. Berri made clear that Lebanon stands united on Resolution 1701, and that 'Israel' must respect it. He anticipated that Hochstein would push Israel’s maximum demands but remained confident that nothing could be imposed on Lebanon. 'Israel' has failed to achieve its objectives on the battlefield, and it will not succeed through diplomacy either. Hochstein’s visit, it seems, was primarily a test of Lebanon’s resolve—an attempt to gauge whether the country, particularly the resistance, might offer concessions under pressure. But Lebanon’s leadership, backed by its steadfast resistance, will not yield. Neither the US, nor the Zionist entity, nor their allies can force Lebanon into submission. Contrary to some perceptions, 'Israel' is not in a position of strength. Those following the situation behind the scenes of Hochstein’s visit might believe 'Israel' can impose its will, but the facts tell a different story. For over three weeks, it has faced setbacks along the border with Lebanon, failing to make significant gains or take control of any Lebanese towns. These developments underscore that the US-Israeli pressure campaign is shallow and ineffective against the united front of Lebanon, its resistance, and its people. Ultimately, the outcome of this conflict will be decided on the battlefield, where the resistance, as emphasized by its leader, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah (may he rest in peace), continues to hold the upper hand. The realities on the ground, both day and night, will shape the political and diplomatic consequences, not the other way around. The battlefield will determine the fate of this war, and indeed, the future of the entire region.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2241791	2024-10-23T11:58:49-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-036995100172970991310.png
Sayyed Nasrallah, Sinwar’s Struggle Altered Fate of Region: Supre...	Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has said the struggle and resilience of resistance figures, such as Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Yahya Sinwar, have fundamentally altered the fate of the region. Ayatollah Khamenei made the remarks in a meeting with organizers of the Congress of 15,000 Martyrs of Fars Province on Wednesday. 'If figures like martyr Sinwar had not emerged to fight until the last moment, or if great leaders like martyr Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah had not combined jihad with wisdom, courage, and sacrifice, the fate of the region would have been different,' he stated. Nasrallah, the longtime leader of Hezbollah, was assassinated in a massive Israeli airstrike in southern Beirut on September 27, while Hamas leader Sinwar was martyred by Israeli occupying forces in Gaza on October 16. Ayatollah Khamenei noted that the Israeli regime’s failure to destroy the resistance despite massacring of 50,000 innocent people with Western-provided weapons is a big defeat for the Zionist regime. In the confrontation between the resistance front and the forces of evil, 'victory belongs to the resistance' he said. The Supreme Leader also condemned the Western politicians who remain indifferent to the suffering inflicted upon civilians, stating that their silence in the face of atrocities reveals their hypocrisy and undermines their claims of upholding human rights.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2241736	2024-10-23T10:41:47-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04562420017297050544.jpg

Hezbollah Mourns Head of Executive Council Sayyed Hashem Safieddi...	Hezbollah Military Media issued a statement to mourn the great leader and martyr, Head of Executive Council Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, all the way to Al-Quds. The statement indicated that the martyred leader passed a way with a number of his brethren in a criminal Zionist airstrike, noting that he accompanied the noblest and most precious martyr, Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah as Abu Fadl Al-Abbas joined Imam Hussein (A.S.) till martyrdom. 'The martyrdom of the great Islamic fighting leader, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, represents the pinnacle of sacrifice and a beacon for generations to continue on the path of resistance, the path walked by the great martyr leader His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, martyr leader Ismail Haniyeh, great leader Yahya Sinwar, and leaders Fouad Shukr, Ali Karaki, Ibrahim Aqil, Saleh Al-Arouri, Raafat Abu Hilal (Abu al-Abed), and thousands of martyrs who preceded him. It is a confirmation that the criminal Zionist enemy understands nothing but the language of resistance and confrontation. The path of compromise has only led to increased aggression, arrogance, and terrorism by the enemy, spilling the blood of the Lebanese and Palestinian people in the most brutal and heinous war of extermination in the full view of the world.' The statement affirmed that Sayyed Safieddine devoted most of his life to serve Hezbollah and the Islamic Resistance as well as its society, administering through long years of his noble life the Party's institutions and maintaining strong ties with the mujahidin (fighters) till Holy God blessed him with martyrdom. Hezbollah offered deep condolences to Imam Mahdi (A.S.), Imam Khamenei, blessed seminaries, as well as the martyr's resistance brethren and noble family, asking Holy God to grant them patience as well as the bless of this life and the hereafter. Finally, Hezbollah promised the great martyr and his martyred brethren to continue the path of resistance and jihad until achieving its goals of freedom and victory.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2241538	2024-10-23T09:06:28-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-09155640017296995768.jpeg

Hezbollah Strikes Tel Aviv Anew, Targets Israelis in Northern and...	Hezbollah on Wednesday kept up its attacks against Israeli sites and gatherings across the Zionist entity, with Tel Aviv being a routine and daily target to the Lebanese resistance group. Hezbollah Military Media announced the strikes, stressing that the operations are 'in support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and backing their courageous and honorable Resistance, and in defense of Lebanon and its people.' The resistance group declared a qualitative missile strike targeting the Glilot Base of the 8200 Israeli military intelligence unit in Tel Aviv, according to the first statement. 'With the call ‘Labbayk Ya Nasrallah’ and as part of Khaybar operations, the Islamic Resistance fighters bombarded at 08:00 AM on Wednesday, 23-10-2024, the Glilot Base, affiliated with Unit 8200 of the military intelligence, in the outskirts of Tel Aviv with a precision rocket barrage,' the statement read. At 9:20 and 9:30 AM, Hezbollah fighters targeted Israeli gatherings at Adaisseh and the area between Adaisseh and Rub Al-Thalatheen with salvos of rockets, the second and third statements read. Later at 11:00 AM, the Islamic Resistance fighters fired a barrage of rockets targeting an Israeli gathering in the area between Misgav Am, Rub Al-Thalatheen and Markaba, according to the fourth statement. The fifth and sixth statements mentioned that Hezbollah fighters targeted Israeli gatherings at Adaisseh anew and at the area between Adaisseh-Rub AL-Thalatheen and Markaba at 11:30 AM and 12:00 PM, employing rockets. Meanwhile on Wednesday, Israeli media reported rockets being launched from Lebanon at Acre and Kraot, north of Haifa. Videos circulated on social media showed a rocket impact at an industrial zone near Acre. Earlier on Tuesday, Hezbollah hit record by waging 39 operations against Israeli targets. The strikes included rocket attacks against Israeli gatherings at the border, downing of Israeli drones and rocket launch against Israeli targets in the Zionist entity's north and center, including Tel Aviv.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2241076	2024-10-23T04:06:40-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-05803820017296813641.jpeg

With calm and measured movements, Ibrahim Haidar, known as 'Karrar Al-Chyah', is seen switching between his machine gun and RPG to inflict casualties on the invading Zionist forces. With unwavering resolute, and despite bullets raining on him and flying close to his head, Haidar did not falter, until he met his end by an Israeli airstrike. The footage exposes the Israeli cowardice, as the Zionist invaders are incapable of facing men of God directly, so they call in airstrikes to get them. The video echoes senior Hezbollah commander Hajj Imad Mughniyeh, who once said about the resistance fighters: 'Our soul which fights.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2241021	2024-10-23T03:24:21-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04865890017296789499.jpg
Islamic Resistance in Iraq Strikes Israeli Targets in Dawn Assaul...	The Islamic Resistance in Iraq reported the execution of three drone strikes targeting key locations in Israeli-occupied territories during the early hours of Wednesday. The Resistant group confirmed that one of the strikes was directed at a crucial site in the Golan Heights, while two additional drone attacks were launched against targets in Eilat, referred to as Umm al-Rashrash in Palestinian discourse. Subsequently, the Resistance announced further drone operations aimed at a vital target in central occupied Palestine, alongside another strike in the Golan Heights. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq announced that these operations come in the context of the ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip and amid the ongoing war against Lebanon. The Resistance reaffirmed its stance against the Israeli occupation and in solidarity with the people of Palestine and Lebanon, stressing that these strikes were also a response to the massacres committed by 'Israel' against civilians, including children, women, and the elderly. The Iraqi Resistance said its fighters launched at dawn Tuesday a drone attack at a vital target in occupied Tabarayya. Its Military Media unit then published footage of the operation.

Sheikh Al-Khatib to Al-Manar: Resistance Defending Entire Lebanon...	Diaa Abu Taam Deputy Head of the Higher Islamic Shia Council in Lebanon, Sheikh Ali Al-Khatib, stressed that the Resistance is assuming its responsibilities and defending the entire country against the Zionist aggression amid the reluctance of the Lebanese government in this regard since 1947. In an interview with Al-Manar Channel held at the historical headquarters of the Shia Council in Hazmieh, Sheikh Al-Khatib affirmed that some Lebanese parties blame the Resistance, despite all its sacrifices for the sake of Lebanon, and provide the Zionist war with a political coverage whether intentionally or unintentionally. Those parties always reflect defeat and weakness because they know the Israeli ambitions in Lebanon, yet ignore them, his eminence said, advising them to support the Resistance which would emerge from the battlefield victorious. The interview, conducted by the Director of Al-Manar Website Diaa Abu Taam, also tackled the spiritual summit that was held at the headquarters of the Maronite Patriarchate in Bkirki as Sheikh Khatib indicated that the summit reflected the national solidarity and support for the resistance. Sheikh Khatib emphasized that holding the presidential elections amid the Zionist war in Lebanon would debilitate the legitimacy of the new president and expose him to future suspicions. The resistance movements in Lebanon and Palestine managed to expose the failures of the international regime, underlining the inability of the international organizations amid the US support for the Zionist entity, according to Sheikh Khatib. Sheikh Khatib hailed the unprecedented steadfastness of the people displaced from their homes due to the Zionist aggression, appreciating the role of the Lebanese community which hosted them. On the 30th day of its relentless assault on Lebanon, the Israeli enemy escalated its brutal aggression with a series of intense airstrikes targeting multiple regions, including southern towns, the Bekaa Valley, and Beirut’s southern suburbs (Dahiyeh).	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2240394	2024-10-22T12:27:10-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-02375120017296252198.jpg

Hezbollah Claims Drone Attack on Netanyahu Residence: Resistance ...	Hezbollah Media Relations Officer Mohammad Afif confirmed the Islamic Resistance full and exclusive responsibility for the drone attack on the residence of the war criminal and the head of the fascist Zionism, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Caesarea. In a press conference held at Al-Hawraa Zainab (A.S.) in Ghobeiry, Beirut's Dahiyeh, Afif stressed that the Islamic Resistance fighters are chasing Netanyahu, and that days, nights and the battlefield will tell. Afif indicated that the supply lines of the Resistance have returned to their normal case, adding that the command and control systems are operating with the best performance. The human and military capabilities of the Islamic Resistance are more than sufficient for the battle requirements, according to Afif who added that the number of Hezbollah attacks is increasing steadily. Afif indicated that the enemy losses, pertaining to the soldiers and tanks are enormous, especially in Aita Al-Shaab confrontations. Afif noted that Hezbollah is still bombing the Israeli barracks, camps and gatherings, while the enemy responds by targeting civilians. Hezbollah official denounced the bias of MBC and all the similar platforms, stressing that the Israeli Channel 12 could have broadcast a juster report about the martyr Yahya Sinwar. Afif hailed the Iraqi public move against MBC office, calling for taking measures against the Channel's office in Lebanon. Afif stressed that freedom of media does not give the media platforms to provoke the enemy against the civilians and their institutions, like Al-Qard Al-Hasan Association. In this regard, Afif emphasized that Al-Qard Al-Hasan Association is a civil institution that will will do everything necessary and required to fulfill its obligations towards depositors and beneficiaries. Hezbollah official affirmed that the bright reality of the Resistance and its field achievements will not be concealed by the pro-enemy media coverage. The United States is a full partner in the Zionist aggression against Lebanon, supplies the Israeli enemy with weapons, and bears primary responsibility for the horrific massacre, according to Hezbollah official. Afif responded to the Zionist defense minister who threatened that the negotiations would be held under fire, vowing 'fire for fire, blood for blood, and iron for iron.' Hezbollah official held the Israeli enemy accountable for the safety of the Islamic Resistance prisoners, calling on the International Red Cross to check the Zionists observe this criterion. Hezbollah fighters were about to kidnap Israeli soldiers few days ago, according to Afif who affirmed that the Islamic Resistance would capture Zionist troops in order to hold an indirect swap deal after the war. Finally, Afif stressed that the Zionist massacres only reflect the enemy's lust for murder and destruction, condemning the remarks of the German FM which justified the enemy's crimes against the civilians.

Blinken Visits Occupied Palestinian Territories, Seeking Ceasefir...	US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in the occupied Palestinian territories on Tuesday as part of efforts to broker a ceasefire and recover prisoners in the Gaza Strip. Blinken's regional tour comes just two weeks before the US presidential elections. During his visit, Blinken is set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials. This follows the recent assassination of Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas' political bureau, which 'Israel' claimed would weaken the group's negotiating position. Since October 7, 2023, the Israeli occupation army, supported by Washington, has continued its aggression on the Gaza Strip, as its aircraft bomb the vicinity of hospitals, buildings, towers and homes of Palestinian civilians and destroy them over the heads of their residents. The Israeli enemy is also launching a brutal aggression on Lebanon, targeting civilians and their homes on a daily basis across Lebanese territory, causing a large number of martyrs. It has also been trying for more than two weeks inside the border villages in southern Lebanon, which constitutes a blatant violation of Lebanese sovereignty in full view of the world. New Proposal The Israeli Broadcasting Authority reported that the so-called head of the General Security Service (Shabak) Ronen Bar presented to the cabinet (the inner cabinet) the day before yesterday, Sunday, a proposal for a deal 'that includes a limited ceasefire in exchange for the release of detainees without the withdrawal of the army from the Gaza Strip,' which is completely rejected by the Palestinian resistance factions, most notably the Hamas movement, which the enemy has not succeeded in undermining after a year of unprecedented barbaric aggression, and which continues to inflict losses in lives and equipment on it in the Strip to this day. It continued by saying that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent the head of the Shabak to Cairo on Sunday to discuss the proposal with the Egyptian side. In turn, the Hebrew website 'Walla' reported that 'the head of the Shabak presented a proposal he received from the head of Egyptian intelligence, Hassan Rashad, to reactivate negotiations regarding the kidnapped deal.' According to 'Walla,' the head of Egyptian intelligence presented Bar with 'the broad outlines of a small deal with Hamas, which would reactivate negotiations towards a larger deal.' For its part, the newspaper 'Israel Today' said that 'the cabinet decided to assign Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer to formulate a more detailed and in-depth strategy on this issue	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2239888	2024-10-22T05:55:13-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-05276450017296016359.jpg
Israeli Aggression on Lebanon Enters Day 30: Intense Bombardments...	On the 30th day of its relentless assault on Lebanon, the Israeli enemy escalated its brutal aggression with a series of intense airstrikes targeting multiple regions, including southern towns, the Bekaa Valley, and Beirut’s southern suburbs (Dahiyeh). South Lebanon Israeli warplanes launched airstrikes on the southern towns of Khiyam and Yuhmur Al-Shkif early this morning. Additionally, the Israeli occupation forces conducted extensive sweeping operations using machine guns directed toward the town of Kfar Kila. The outskirts of the towns of Aita Al-Shaab and Al-Qouzah were subjected to fire from the enemy's machine guns, which also targeted nearby forests along the international border. An Israeli drone struck the area between Saksakiya and Sarafand while warplanes targeted a house in the town of Al-Shaaitiyeh, reportedly resulting in casualties. Moreover, IOF warplanes carried out an airstrike between the towns of Yater and Kfarra, following earlier strikes on the towns of Tayr Harfa and Al-Jebbain. The aerial assault on the Kfarjouz area in Nabatiyeh resulted in the complete destruction of three residential buildings and the Badreddine villa, reducing a residential block to rubble and causing extensive material damage in the vicinity.

Siege and Burning of Hospital as Israeli Occupation Escalates Att...	The Israeli occupation continues its genocidal war on the Gaza Strip, especially in the northern areas that have witnessed Israeli massacres since the beginning of the war a year ago. The occupation renews its brutal aggression in the northern Gaza Strip as part of a systematic plan to displace its residents and destroy all aspects of life and infrastructure, which has led to the deaths of hundreds of martyrs in recent days. Burning the 'Indonesian' Hospital The Israeli occupation forces burned the Indonesian Hospital, and the Palestinian Ministry of Health directly condemned the targeting of the hospital. The Palestinian ministry reiterated its demand that the United Nations and international institutions and all concerned parties protect health facilities and staff from the brutality and crimes of the occupation, especially in the northern besieged Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to genocide for the seventeenth consecutive day. Media reports also confirmed the death of 10 martyrs and the injury of 30 others in an Israeli artillery shelling that targeted a shelter center affiliated with 'UNRWA' in Jabalia camp, and 3 martyrs were also killed and others were injured as a result of an Israeli shelling that targeted Al-Shawa School, which shelters the displaced in the town of Beit Hanoun. 🧵This is not military base!

A number of people were killed and others were injured as a result of Israeli bombing that targeted a house in Jabalia Al-Balad, in an Israeli bombing that targeted a house near Abu Sharar roundabout in Jabalia camp. Israeli Occupation Besieges Northern Gaza In addition to targeting hospitals and shelters, the occupation continues its war of starvation against the northern areas of the Gaza Strip, where it prevents the entry of humanitarian aid. In this context, the Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, said that 'Israel' is preventing humanitarian missions carrying vital supplies, including medicine and food, from reaching the north and the people under siege. Lazzarini considered the occupation's refusal to allow aid in and its use as a weapon a sign of the decline of the moral compass, demanding that humanitarian agencies, including 'UNRWA', be granted access to northern Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2239426	2024-10-22T00:40:43-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-01592310017295825714.png
Israeli Air Raid Targets Beirut Hospital Vicinity after Enemy Iss...	In an attempt to intimidate the Lebanese by recalling the targeting of Gaza hospitals, the Israeli enemy concentrated its grudge on the medical sector in Lebanon. The Israeli military spokesman introduced the new aggression round by claiming that, under one of Haret Hreik hospitals, there is tunnel. The Zionist enemy, then, issued evacuation warnings which identify a number of buildings to be targeted. In a deceptive manner, the Zionist war jets targeted late Monday the vicinity of Rafik Hariri Hospital in Beirut, damaging buildings and leaving casualties. The targeted was a residential area whose inhabitants did not evacuate it for thinking it is safe. Moreover, over seven air raids targeted Haret Hreik, Bourj Al-Barajneh and Al-Hadath areas in Beirut's Dahiyeh and cause a massive damage. The Israeli enemy stepped up its aggression on Lebanon with violent raids targeting several areas across the country including branches belonging to the financial network of Al-Qard Al-Hasan.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2239338	2024-10-21T13:47:23-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-01641350017295435515.png

Member of Loyalty to Resistance parliamentary bloc, MP Ibrahim Al-Moussawi, indicated that the US presidential envoy Amos Hochstein talked baldly about the amendment of the UN Resolution 1701. In a TV interview, MP Moussawi stressed that Hezbollah is concerned only with the battle field and has commissioned House Speaker to handle the negotiations file. Speaker Berri sent the correct message to Hoschstein, Moussawi said. 'What Speaker said about the priority of the ceasefire is a basic principle.' MP Moussawi affirmed that the Israeli enemy cannot dictate its terms on Hezbollah, adding that the leaked conditions give a false impression that the Zionists have emerged victorious. The battle is still in its early stages, MP Moussawi added, noting that Hezbollah fighters and missile will have their say. MP Moussawi emphasized that the Israeli enemy would be surprised by Hezbollah military capabilities. Those who are betting on Hezbollah defeat will realize that the Resistance Party is firmer than their plans, MP Moussawi concluded. The Islamic Resistance has continued confronting the Zionist war on Lebanon, inflicting more losses on the enemy troops.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2239217	2024-10-21T11:19:15-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/12/manar-00559380016384313172.png

Berri to Hochstein: No Changes to 1701, No Presidential Elections...	US special envoy Amos Hochstein stated on Monday that 'the situation in Lebanon has spiraled out of control, and linking the country's future to regional conflicts is not in the best interest of the Lebanese people.' After meeting with Speaker Nabih Berri in Ain Al-Tineh, Hochstein emphasized that 'the failure to implement Resolution 1701 is the main reason for the escalation and continuation of this conflict.' 'We are committed to resolving the conflict in Lebanon based on Resolution 1701, but the commitment of both sides alone is not enough. The Lebanese government needs support, and Washington is committed to providing the necessary assistance,' the US special envoy added. Hochstein also highlighted that 'the international community is dedicated to reconstruction efforts and supporting the Lebanese Army.' 'I will not engage in discussions about amending Resolution 1701 but will instead focus on its implementation. President Joe Biden's administration is determined to ensure that this is Lebanon's last conflict for generations to come,' Hochstein clarified. During his visit to Beirut, Hochstein is meeting with various Lebanese officials. At the same time, Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit also arrived in Beirut. His brief visit includes meetings with Speaker Nabih Berri, Prime Minister Najib Mikati, and Army Commander General Joseph Aoun. Subtext of Hochstein's Visit: Pressure and Promises Earlier today, Al-Akhbar Lebanese daily reported that US envoy Amos Hochstein is returning to Beirut, carrying what he claims is a 'final offer' ahead of the U.S. elections on November 5 to establish a political-security framework to end the war. However, according to MP Jamil Al-Sayyed, Hochstein’s real goal is to see if Israeli aggression has pressured Lebanon into accepting US and Israeli occupation demands to amend Resolution 1701, putting Lebanon under military, security, and political control. The paper highlighted that the Israeli enemy prepared for Hochstein’s visit with a night of intense bombing on Dahiyeh. Al-Akhbar also noted that in a recent interview with Al-Jadeed TV, Hochstein said his plan centers on reinforcing UN Resolution 1701 as the basis for a permanent ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel but stressed that 'modifications and additions' are necessary for its full implementation. In response, Speaker Nabih Berri firmly rejected any changes to Resolution 1701, emphasizing Lebanon's united stance on maintaining it without amendments. Speaker Berri also told Al-Arabiya TV that Hochstein's visit is the US's 'last chance' to secure a solution, reaffirming that Hezbollah has supported 1701 since 2006. He outlined his plan to save Lebanon and said the U.S. is keen on achieving a ceasefire before its elections, dismissing claims that Iran is blocking his efforts. In essence, Al-Akhbar reported that Speaker Berri made Lebanon’s position clear: no amendments to Resolution 1701 and no presidential election while the country is at war. Al-Akhbar reported that Prime Minister Najib Mikati confirmed Hezbollah's support for Resolution 1701 and emphasized Lebanon's commitment to it for stability. He reiterated that 'a diplomatic solution is still possible' and called for deploying the Lebanese Army south of the Litani River to fully implement the resolution and avoid further violence. Al-Akhbar added that Hochstein’s visit, his first since the Israeli aggression began in September, and possibly his last due to career changes, has caused concern among political circles. His visits often coincide with major regional developments, raising fears that his arrival signals new Israeli actions, given the link between US diplomacy and Israeli escalation. The newspaper suggested that Hochstein’s main goal is to assess whether Israeli attacks have pressured Lebanon into compliance and to push for concessions benefiting US and Israeli interests in southern Lebanon and other internal issues. 'Western sources suggest that Hochstein may ask Lebanon to declare a unilateral ceasefire to end the aggression, while French sources revealed that Paris has revised its initiative on Resolution 1701, with Lebanon’s Foreign Ministry receiving the updated proposal for discussion,' Al-Akhbar added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2238832	2024-10-21T06:04:03-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-03110550017295157225.jpg

Few hours after it was announced that the US presidential envoy Amos Hochstein would visit Beirut on Monday to meet Lebanon's senior officials, House Speaker Nabih Berri reiterated rejection of amending any of the items of the UN Resolution 1701.

Hurting Enemy' in the Making: Drone Targets Netanyahu House, Roc...	For the first time since the start of the war, a drone launched from Lebanon on Saturday targeted the house of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Meanwhile, some 100 rockets were fired at areas in Haifa Bay, Acre and Western Galilee, killing or injuring a number of Israeli settlers. Israeli media reported that a drone was fired from Lebanon and exploded in the central seaside town of Caesarea. Netanyahu’s office said the drone targeted the Israeli premier’s private home, claiming that Netanyahu and his wife 'were not present and no injuries were reported.' The short statement from Netanyahu’s office came after the Israeli occupation military said that 'a building had been hit' in Caesarea. Footage posted to social media appeared to show Israeli attack helicopters in the air that were apparently hunting the drone further to the north. Israeli media reported large explosion heard in the Zionist entity’s center, but added that no warning sirens were sounded in Caesarea ahead of the drone impact and explosion. Meanwhile, however, sirens sounded in Glilot north of Tel Aviv, which houses a major IDF intelligence base and the Mossad headquarters. Israeli Channel 12 quoted an Israeli settler who resides in Caesarea as saying: 'We heard helicopters above us and there was a feeling that there was some sort of incident but there were no sirens so we were not too worried.' 'But then suddenly a large explosion was heard and it was not clear to us if it was from an interception or a drone impact — but it was clear that it was a real incident with no prior warning,' the settler added as he described the attack as 'very worrying.' The drone attack on Caesarea comes a day after Hezbollah’s Islamic Resistance Operations Room announced it was entering a new phase in the fight against the Israeli enemy, adding that it had introduced time, over the past few days, new types of precision-guided missiles and explosive drones for the first time. Earlier on Tuesday (October 15), Hezbollah Deputy Secretary Sheikh Naim Qassem said the Lebanese resistance group has imposed a new equation on the Zionist entity. 'We impose on Israel a new equation of ‘harming the enemy’ as rockets reached Haifa, Tel Aviv last few days', Sheikh Qassem said in a televised speech via Al-Manar. Rocket Impacts Kill, Injure Israelis Meanwhile on Saturday, an Israeli settler has been pronounced dead from critical injuries sustained in a rocket attack near Acre, The Times of Israeli quoted Israeli medics as saying. Earlier, Israeli media quoted Megan David Adom as saying that at least Israeli were hurt as dozens of rockets targeted the Haifa area and Western Galilee this morning.

He ascended as a heroic martyr, advancing and not retreating, brandishing his weapon, engaging and confronting the occupation army at the forefront of the ranks, moving between all the combat positions, steadfast and firm on the land of proud Gaza, defending the land of Palestine and its sanctities, and inspiring in kindling the spirit of steadfastness, patience, and resistance, the statement added. The statement also drew some of the aspects of Sinwar biography: The martyr leader Yahya Al-Sinwar lived as a fighter for the sake of Allah, and made his way in the Hamas movement since he was a young man involved in its jihadi activities; then during the 23 years of captivity, he defeated the Zionist jailer, and after he was released from prison in the Wafaa’ al-Ahrar deal, he continued his dedication, planning, and jihad until his eyes were filled with joy on October 7, 2023; the day of the great flood that shook the depths of the Zionist entity and exposed the fragility of its alleged security. This was followed by epics of legendary steadfastness of our people and the valor of our victorious resistance, until he attained the most honorable position and the highest medal and ascended to be beside his Lord as a martyred witness satisfied with what he had offered in jihad and activities on the ground. The martyred leader Yahya Al-Sinwar was a continuation of the caravan of great martyr leaders following the footsteps of the martyr founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, Dr. Abdul Aziz Al-Rantisi, Al-Muqaadmah, Abu Shanab, Jamal Mansour, Jamal Saleem, the martyr leader Ismail Haniyeh and his deputy Sheikh Saleh Al-Arouri, in addition to the caravan of martyrs from all the leaders and sons of our people and nation. We affirm that this blood will continue to enlighten our way and constitute an incentive for more steadfastness and perseverance, and that the Hamas movement is continuing with the covenant of the founding leaders and martyrs until the aspirations of our people are achieved for comprehensive liberation, return, and the establishment of the Palestinian state on the entire Palestinian national soil with Jerusalem as its capital, God willing, and it will turn into a curse on the invading occupiers who have invaded this land.' Hama reiterated that the prisoners of the occupation held by the resistance will not return except by stopping the aggression on Gaza, withdrawing from it, and releasing the heroic prisoners from the prisons of the occupation. Hamas concluded it would continue to move forward, and the spirit of the Al-Aqsa Flood would remain shining brightly, pulsating with life in the souls of our people. 'We are committed to your covenant, Abu Ibrahim, and your banner will not fall, but will remain fluttering high.' Hezbollah Statement Hezbollah Command released a statement in which it offered deep condolences to Palestinian people, Hamas Movement, Arab and Islamic Ummas, all the liberals in the world, and the family of the leader Yahya Al-Sinwar on his martyrdom. The statement indicated that the martyr was entrusted to be the heir of the martyred Ismail Haniyeh in order to follow the path of confronting the US schemes and the Israeli occupation till gaining martyrdom. Hezbollah Command reiterated standing by the Palestinian people, voicing trust in the divine promise of support for the believers.

UNIFIL: ‘Israel’ Deliberately Attacked our Forces, White Phosphor...	UNIFIL spokesperson Andrea Tenenti said on Friday that the Israeli army has repeatedly and deliberately attacked the UN peacekeepers in south Lebanon. In remarks carried by Lebanese media, the UN mission spokesman said that the Israeli army targeted the UNIFIL forces five times deliberately. Meanwhile, he noted that the Israeli occupation army has used phosphorus munitions. 'We found evidence of possible use of white phosphorus several months ago near one of our posts' in south Lebanon. UNIFIL spokesman Andrea Tenenti during an interview with Reuters in Beirut (October 2024). He added that the destruction inflicted upon the Lebanese border town due to Israeli bombardment was 'shocking.' However, Tenenti underlined the need for the international forces to stay in Lebanon, stressing that their morale is high. Asked about the possibility of resorting to self-defense against the Israeli occupation army, the spokesman said: 'It can be resorted to, but the priority now is for de-escalation.'

Hezbollah Military Command Announces Moving to an Escalated Phase...	The Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance issued early Friday a statement to announce the escalation of the military confrontation with the Zionist enemy. The statement indicated that the Islamic Resistance has continued to confront the Israeli aggression against Lebanon, inflicting heavy losses on the Israeli enemy army in terms of personnel and equipment, along the front lines in southern Lebanon, extending to their positions deep within occupied Palestine. Since the beginning of ground operations near the Lebanese-Palestinian border, the Israeli enemy has deployed five military divisions comprising over 70,000 officers and soldiers, along with hundreds of tanks and military vehicles. In contrast, hundreds of fighters from the Islamic Resistance have been fully prepared to counter any Israeli ground incursion into southern Lebanese villages. The statement explained the feats of the each unit of the Islamic Resistance: 1. Ground Engagements: The beginning of this week witnessed an escalation in the heroic confrontations between the fighters of the Islamic Resistance and the 'Israeli' enemy's officers and soldiers advancing through several routes in the eastern and western sectors towards the villages of Al-Odaisseh, Rab El Thalathin, Blida, Markaba, Al-Qawzah, Aita al-Shaab, and Ramya, under heavy artillery and air cover targeting the mentioned villages and their surroundings. According to pre-prepared field plans, the fighters of the Islamic Resistance engaged the enemy forces in and around some villages by targeting their advance routes and luring them into ambushes within some border villages. Violent clashes took place with the enemy at close range, especially in the towns of Al-Qawzah and Rab El Thalathin, resulting in 10 enemy fatalities and over 150 injuries, as well as the destruction of 9 'Merkava' tanks and 4 military bulldozers. 2. Rocket Force: The rocket force of the Islamic Resistance continues to escalate day by day, targeting 'Israeli' enemy concentrations in military sites and barracks along the Lebanese-Palestinian border, as well as settlements and cities in the north, reaching their military bases deep within occupied Palestine, using various types of missiles, including precision-guided ones that are being deployed for the first time. 3. Air Force: The air force of the Islamic Resistance continues to escalate day by day, targeting enemy military bases from the Lebanese-Palestinian border to deep within occupied Palestine, utilizing various types of attack drones, including advanced ones being used for the first time, in addition to reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering missions. 4. Air Defense Unit: Fighters of the Islamic Resistance in the air defense unit have successfully engaged 'Israeli' military aircraft that violate Lebanese airspace, both reconnaissance and combat. They managed to shoot down two reconnaissance aircraft of the type 'Hermes 450.' 'According to observations from the fighters of the Islamic Resistance, the enemy's losses have reached approximately 55 deaths and over 500 injuries among Israeli officers and soldiers, in addition to the destruction of 20 Merkava tanks, 4 military bulldozers, an armored vehicle, and a troop carrier, along with the downing of two 'Hermes 450&#8243; drones.' This tally does not include the losses of the Israeli enemy in military bases and barracks along the Lebanese-Palestinian border extending into occupied Palestine, according to the statement. Based on the directives of the Resistance Command, the Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance announces a transition to a new and escalatory phase in the confrontation with the Israeli enemy, which will be reflected in the developments and events of the coming days.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2235642	2024-10-17T14:54:45-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-02707250017292020287.png
Israeli Enemy Commits Massacre in Jabalia, Continues Besieging No...	The Zionist occupation forces continued, for the 13th consecutive day, the bloody aggression on northern Gaza, amidst an escalation of bombardment, killing, destruction, and attempts to displace residents and empty the governorate of its inhabitants. The occupation forces committed on Thursday a massacre in Jabalia, north of the Gaza Strip, where they targeted a school housing displaced people, which led to the martyrdom of at least 25 of them, and the injury of at least 150 of others, most of whom were women and children. The occupation aircraft bombed the 'Abu Hussein Elementary School' affiliated with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), and fires broke out in the tents of the displaced within the school campus as a result of the occupation bombing. Some of the martyrs and wounded were transferred to Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda hospitals in the northern Gaza Strip, as the ambulance crews were unable to reach the rest in the targeted school, and the hospitals in the northern Gaza Strip were unable to provide services to the wounded in light of the strict siege imposed by the occupation. The occupation forces have continued their ground, maritime and aerial aggression on the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, which has resulted in the martyrdom of 42,438 citizens and the injury of 99,246 others, the majority of whom are children and women according to an incomplete toll, as thousands of missing people are still under the rubble. Hamas Movement denounced in a statement, Jabalia massacre, holding the Zionist enemy accountable for its consequences. In turn, Al-Qassam Brigades released a video which shows its fighters detonating a tunnel opening against an Israeli engineering force on October 17, 2024.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2235543	2024-10-17T13:51:32-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04607990017291978246.jpg
Houthi: None Excluded from US-Israeli 'New Middle East' Scheme	Head of Yemen’s Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Al-Houthi stressed on Thursday that the Israeli enemy is committing crimes against Lebanon similar to those it has been committing Gaza for more than one year. In a televised speech, Sayyed Houthi indicated that Muslims, in particular, and humanity in general, need to reach a high level of awareness about the reality of what is happening and what the enemies are aiming for. 'Arabs, as the primary targets, must be especially aware of the enemies' intentions.' Houthi added that the horrific crimes committed by the 'Israeli' enemy, along with the accompanying international and regional positions, should create a heightened level of awareness and insight. The U.S. is a partner in every sense of the word in the crimes and tyranny of the 'Israeli' enemy, he noted. 'Without American support and partnership, the Israeli enemy would not have been able to sustain its aggression for this long and at this intensity. Both the American and Israeli agendas aim to achieve a common goal, with similar backgrounds and beliefs, and a unified vision regarding the Arabs.' The American goal is to empower the 'Israeli' enemy to control the region directly or politically and economically, fully dominating it, Houthi said, adding that the objective is to keep the peoples of our nation without freedom, independence, or dignity, denying them the right to an independent civilization based on their religion and Islamic identity. 'It has become clear to all that neither the United Nations nor the Security Council nor international organizations or courts can counter the threat of the enemy except through the awakening of the nation itself.' Houthi underlined the 'fruits of steadfastness among the fighters in Gaza and Lebanon, who continue to inflict damage on the enemy despite the immense betrayal and complicity of some in the Arab and Islamic circles'. According to the Yemeni leader, the Israeli enemy resorts to mass killings and assassinations when it fails in the battlefield. 'The Israeli enemy poses a real threat to Lebanon since the establishment of the occupation entity. The brave fighters of Hezbollah and their supporters played a pivotal role in expelling the Israeli enemy from Lebanon.' Houthi addressed those who think they are safe from the enemy: 'No one in this entire region is safe from Israeli conspiracies.' 'The ambitions and goals of the Israelis are clear, and when the criminal Netanyahu speaks of changing the Middle East, he is targeting you as well.' Houthi underscored that the Yemeni fight would continue, and the number of targeted Israeli-US-UK ships has reached 196. 'Support continues with rockets and drones to occupied Palestine, and operations this week were carried out using 25 ballistic and cruise missiles as well as drones.' Houthi called upon the Yemenis to participate tomorrow in a million-man march in honor of fight for the sake of Allah and in support of the Palestinian and Lebanese people in the capital, Sanaa, and other governorates. The US and the UK carried out a series of air strikes on Yemen late on Wednesday, in a new aggression on the Arab impoverished country over its stance in support of the oppressed people of Gaza.

Hezbollah Fighters Turned the Tables on Netanyahu: MP	Member of the Loyalty to the Resistance parliamentary bloc, Hasan Fadlallah, asserted that the Israeli enemy has failed to achieve its objectives of repopulating the north with settlers and displacing resistance fighters, as the Islamic Resistance fighters on the ground have turned the tables on Netanyahu. In a press conference held at the Lebanese parliament on Thursday, MP Fadlallah addressed the ongoing Israeli aggression on the country, noting that despite the extensive airstrikes, the occupation has not been able to capture any villages. He underscored that 'the resistance on the ground knows how to confront the enemy effectively,' stating that 'the matter of a ceasefire is in the hands of Speaker of the House Nabih Berri, in collaboration with caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati.' Speaking of Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's foolish idea of the so-called 'new Middle East,' Hezbollah MP said that 'the image that Netanyahu painted for his project is changing; what he thought would be a swift victory to eliminate Hezbollah and restructure Lebanon and the region has turned out to be the rashness of an arrogant leader.' 'Netanyahu believed that by assassinating our leader and his fellow martyrs and committing horrific massacres against our people, he could fully achieve his objectives. However, the brave resistance fighters along the border reversed the narrative and entered a new phase dedicated to confronting the aggression against Lebanon and defending the nation,' Fadlallah added. Hezbollah's Fadlallah stated that 'the Israeli occupation has adopted a scorched-earth policy, systematically destroying villages and towns, particularly in the south along the border, to implement its long-standing project of establishing what it calls a 'buffer zone'. 'This plan began in 1978 and culminated in the 2006 war, aiming to make the area south of the Litani River part of its entity, as openly stated by some of its officials. However, the strength of the resistance fighters and the resilience of our people will undoubtedly thwart it,' Fadlallah affirmed. Hezbollah MP Hasan Fadlallah stated that efforts are being extended on three main fronts: 'First, on the battlefield, where brave fighters have successfully maintained control and are determined to prevent the Israeli enemy from achieving its declared objectives, such as repopulating the north and occupying southern Lebanon.' 'Despite heavy Israeli strikes and the deployment of elite troops, resistance fighters—many of whom are from local villages—defend their land with remarkable courage. Thousands of fighters stand ready to join the front lines, eager to fulfill the late leader’s wish to destroy the enemy forces in the south,' Fadlallah said. Regarding the political front, MP Fadlallah mentioned that Speaker Nabih Berri and the Lebanese government have been negotiating with international envoys since the establishment of the support front a year ago to reach a ceasefire. They are currently focused on achieving a ceasefire, with close coordination between Hezbollah leadership and Speaker Berri’s office. However, Fadlallah declared that 'details of these negotiations remain confidential.' Concerning displacement, Fadlallah stated that 'Hezbollah and the Amal Movement are maximizing their efforts to alleviate the suffering of displaced people while appreciating the national unity and various initiatives aimed at managing the crisis.' 'Both groups emphasize the need for humanitarian cooperation and assert that the reconstruction efforts are in trustworthy hands. The return of displaced individuals to their homes, from the southern border to the Bekaa Valley and the Dahiyeh, remains a solemn promise from the resistance to their steadfast people,' Fadlallah stressed. MP Hasan Fadlallah concluded by addressing the steadfast Lebanese families, saying: 'You pay a heavy price in blood to defend our land, dignity, and sovereignty. To the families of martyrs and the wounded, your sacrifices purify our homeland and pave the way for a future of freedom. To the brave men along the borders, you protect our people's dignity against enemy fire.' 'This is your destined day to honor Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah’s legacy by defending Lebanon’s honor and safeguarding its land,' Fadlallah said.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2235136	2024-10-17T06:36:53-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-06043330017291721311.jpg
Day 25 of Israeli Aggression on Lebanon: Zionist Enemy Intensifie...	The Israeli occupation's assault on Lebanon entered its 25th day, following a bloody night for Israeli forces at the Aita Al-Shaab-Al-Qouzah-Ramiyeh triangle. Resistance fighters fiercely repelled the occupation’s attempt to capture Al-Karmel Hill in Al-Qouzah. The Israeli military, still withholding details about the 'severe incident' in the north, responded with heavy air and artillery strikes to cover up its substantial losses. These same brutal tactics are repeatedly used against Lebanese civilians, destroying homes and livelihoods under the guise of targeting resistance positions, underscoring the cowardly and imbalanced nature of the conflict. Amid this ongoing aggression, Lebanon’s Ministry of Health announced on Wednesday that 17 people had been martyred and 182 wounded in the last 24 hours alone, raising the total toll since the start of the conflict on October 8, 2023, to 2,367 martyrs and 11,106 injured.

The Israeli brutal aggression against Lebanon persists for the 24th consecutive day, relentlessly targeting civilians and infrastructure while perpetrating further atrocities. This escalation has claimed the lives of over 2,000 martyrs and left more than 10,000 injured. Israeli occupation aircraft launched on Wednesday morning an assault on Al-Shoura Street in the Hara Hreik area of the southern suburbs of Beirut (Dahiyeh). This attack starkly illustrates the brutality of the occupation forces, who have demonstrated a complete disregard for civilians, their homes, and commercial centers. Israeli occupation army spokesperson Avichay Adraee announced that occupation warplanes from the Air Force carried out strikes based on 'precise intelligence from military intelligence,' targeting what they alleged were 'strategic weapon storage facilities belonging to Hezbollah located in an underground warehouse in the southern suburbs.' In retaliation, Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance continues to strike key Israeli sites, responding to the Israeli aggression on Lebanon and defending its people. Nabatieh Massacre Speaking of Israeli atrocities in south Lebanon, the occupation warplanes unleashed a relentless barrage on the city of Nabatieh today, conducting over 10 airstrikes across various neighborhoods, particularly targeting the neighborhoods of Al-Rahbat, the Al-Maslakh, the city's market, and the municipality building. The Public Health Emergency Operations Center (PHEOC), part of the Ministry of Public Health, issued a statement confirming that 'the Israeli strike on the municipality and its federation resulted, in initial reports, in the martyrdom of five individuals.' 'Rescue teams are still working to clear the rubble at the site, attempting to locate survivors or additional victims,' the statement noted. The Israeli airstrikes targeted the municipality building while the mayor, Ahmad Kahil, and several members were present, resulting in the martyrdom of Mayor Kahil. ⚡️ The mayor of Nabatieh, Dr. Ahmad Kahil, was martyred in the enemy strike on the municipality building pic.twitter.com/owGHOm1qQU — War Monitor (@WarMonitors) October 16, 2024 According to media sources, Israeli aircraft carried out a fierce aerial assault on the town of Nabatieh Al-Tahta, launching more than 7 strikes aimed at the crisis cell within the municipality, where Kahil and dozens of staff members were located. In addition, the General Directorate of Civil Defense in the Ministry of Interior announced the martyrdom of 'an operational employee from the Nabatieh Regional Center this morning due to the Israeli airstrike on the municipality building, where he was with colleagues fulfilling their duties.' Director General Brigadier Raymond Khattar extended condolences to the martyr's family and team, praying for their patience. He commended the sacrifices made by Civil Defense personnel during these tragic times, reaffirming their commitment to their humanitarian mission. The Lebanese Ministry of Health reported that six people were martyred and 43 others were injured in the Israeli airstrike on the municipality building in Nabatieh. PM Mikati Condemns Israeli Aggression on Nabatieh Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the new Israeli aggression against civilians in Nabatieh, which deliberately targeted a municipal council meeting intended to discuss the city's service and humanitarian conditions. PM Mikati stated, 'This new aggression, in addition to the ongoing crimes against civilians, occurs amid a deliberate global silence regarding the atrocities committed by the occupier, which encourages the Israeli enemy to persist in its actions.' 'If all the countries of the world are unable to deter this blatant aggression against the Lebanese people, how effective will it be to turn to the Security Council for a ceasefire? What can restrain the enemy from its crimes, especially after targeting peacekeeping forces in the south? And what solutions can be hoped for in this reality?' Mikati further added. Israeli Airstrikes on Qana: One Martyr and 30 Injured Earlier on Tuesday evening, the Ministry of Public Health's PHEOC announced in a statement that 'the continuous Israeli airstrikes on the town of Qana have resulted in the martyrdom of one person and injuries to thirty others, with debris removal operations still ongoing.' The intense Israeli bombardment on Qana in southern Lebanon has caused significant destruction to residential buildings, with many reduced to rubble, as search operations for missing persons continue for the second consecutive day. Reports indicate that Civil Defense teams from the Islamic Al-Risala Scouts are still searching through the rubble in Qana and the nearby town of Al-Majadel for individuals who remain unaccounted for following last night’s and this morning’s repeated airstrikes. The Western armed Zionist regime carried out a major massacre in the village of Qana in southern Lebanon yesterday in revenge for defeats on the battlefield against Hezbollah. These are the fruits of 'Western civilization.' pic.twitter.com/iK37kNj4w8 — Seyed Mohammad Marandi (@s_m_marandi) October 16, 2024 The scene in Qana, Nabatieh, and all over Lebanon starkly reflects the brutality of the occupation, which has not spared civilians, homes, or businesses.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2233431	2024-10-16T05:51:19-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-05328840017290825118.jpg

Hamdan condemned the 'Generals' Plan' - the latest Israeli military offensive in northern Gaza - which has killed and displaced civilians for 11 consecutive days. He described the assault as a 'complete genocide,' with occupation forces bombarding residential homes, civilian infrastructure like streets, bakeries, hospitals, and water wells. The Hamas leader emphasized the urgent need to address this 'ongoing Israeli massacre against civilians' and called for active engagement 'in mobilizing the community to confront Zionist aggression and US support for it.' He warned that the 'Generals' Plan' is 'doomed to failure' in the face of united resistance.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2233442	2024-10-16T05:27:08-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/07/manar-08474550017211428969.jpeg

Fierce Clashes in Jenin: Palestinian Fighters Ambush and Kill Isr...	Palestinian resistance fighters in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin engaged Israeli occupation forces, killing and injuring several Israeli troops, according to reports. The confrontation began after Israeli occupation forces invaded Jenin and several other towns in the region, including Nablus and Ramallah. In Jenin, the Israeli occupation troops were ambushed by fighters from the Al-Quds Brigades - Jenin Brigade, who detonated improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and opened fire on the invading forces. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades also participated in the clashes, targeting an undercover Israeli unit that had entered the Jenin refugee camp. The fierce fighting resulted in the deaths and injuries of multiple Israeli soldiers. Following the confrontation, the Israeli occupation forces withdrew from Jenin late on Tuesday. However, they did manage to abduct the body of 20-year-old Karim Samer Jabarin, whom they had allegedly assassinated in the Jenin refugee camp. The clashes in Jenin were part of a larger Israeli military operation across the occupied West Bank, with forces also invading the towns of Kfar Jammal in Tulkarm, Dura in Hebron, Al-Mazraa Al-Qibilya in Ramallah, and the Aaskar refugee camp in Nablus. In Nablus, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades engaged the Israeli occupation troops in fierce confrontations, using automatic weapons and explosives.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2233013	2024-10-16T01:09:47-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-08975160017047103214.jpg
Iraqi Resistance Strikes Vital Target in Occupied Palestine	The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has announced that its fighters launched an attack on Tuesday evening against a vital target in central occupied Palestine. The attack was carried out using an advanced-capability aircraft. In a statement, the Islamic Resistance emphasized that these operations are part of its 'steadfast approach in resisting the occupation, in support of our people in Palestine and Lebanon, and in response to the massacres committed by the usurping entity against civilians, including children, women, and the elderly.' The group also affirmed the continuation of its operations 'to strike enemy strongholds with increasing intensity.' This comes after the Iraqi Resistance said on October 15 that it had targeted a vital location in the northern part of Israeli-occupied territories using drones. Footage was also published showing the fighters launching drones towards a vital target in occupied Tabaraya. The head of the Iraqi Hezbollah Brigades' Security Bureau, Abu Ali al-Askari, warned that the Iraqi Resistance's response to any targeting of the country or use of its territory or airspace to strike Iran will not be limited to 'Israel' but will extend to US bases and interests in Iraq and the region. Al-Askari also indicated that if an 'energy war' were to break out, the world would lose 12 million barrels per day, which the Iraqi Resistance will ensure. This development comes as the Israeli occupation regime has threatened to respond to Iran's Operation True Promise II, which saw the Islamic Republic launching at least 200 ballistic missiles against Israeli military and intelligence facilities across the occupied Palestinian territories. The operation was in retaliation for the Israeli assassination of Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, and Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and IRGC General Abbas Nilforoushan in the Southern Suburb of Beirut.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2232991	2024-10-16T00:06:30-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/04/manar-01043040017122111854.jpg

Hezbollah called on relevant parties in Lebanon and international human rights and humanitarian organizations to condemn this heinous crime by all standards, particularly due to its long-term negative impacts on civilians.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2232782	2024-10-15T09:44:04-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-04165050017056142612.png
Sheikh Qassem: Hezbollah Will Hold Reins of Israeli Beast and Ret...	Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem addressed the nation on Tuesday, vowing victory over the US-backed Israeli war and schemes. Sheikh Qassem started his address by reiterating that the martyred leader, Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, has always guided the resistance. 'Your positions are our constitution, your words are the light of our path, and your discourse is the foundation of our journey.' 'Your enemies fear your presence and see you in every fighter and supporter,' Sheikh Qassem addressed Martyr Sayyed Nasrallah. Tackling the latest developments, Sheikh Qassem stressed that 'Israel' is an occupation entity that poses a real threat to the region and the world. ''Israel' is an expansionist occupation that does not confine itself to Palestine.' 'Israel' bets on the crimes that intimidate others and enjoys absolute support from America, his eminence added. Sheikh Qassem maintained that Lebanon, or even the region, cannot be separated from Palestine, adding that Al-Aqsa Flood Operation came after 75 years of occupation. Sheikh Qassem underlined that Lebanon is part of the Israeli expansionist project. 'Our support for the Palestinians is support for justice, as the Palestinians are rightful owners.' Sheikh Qassem warned that America seeks a new Middle East. 'If it weren't for America, the Great Satan, 'Israel' would not have been able to maintain its current control.' Foreign ambassadors were communicating with Hezbollah's leadership to urge it to stop supporting Gaza, Sheikh Qassem said. We are facing the threat of a new Middle East in the Israeli-American style, his eminence noted. 'We are not facing an Iranian project; rather, we are witnessing a Palestinian project supported by Iranians and the free people of this region.' Supporting Palestine is a source of pride for Iran, which is exerting all efforts to strengthen and empower the Palestinians, his eminence added. If we do not confront 'Israel', it will achieve its goals, Sheikh Qassem warned. Those who harm Lebanon are not those who defend the people, but those who kill them, Sheikh Qassem maintained. 'We fight as a resistance with conditions and target the occupation army while it kills brutally and cowardly, targeting children, women, and the elderly.' When we bear sacrifices and cause pain to 'Israel', we protect generations for decades and centuries to come, his eminence pointed out. Hezbollah Deputy Chief warned that the 'Israeli' project is destructive and aims to eliminate the resistance and its people. 'It is true that the strike on leadership, especially the Secretary-General, is significant and harsh; they attempted to undermine our capabilities, but, thank God, they could not surpass the first step.' The path to restore the land requires the steadfastness of the resistance and the support of its people, his eminence affirmed. 'We are facing a raging beast that cannot tolerate being hindered by the resistance from achieving its goals, and I assure you that we will hold its reins and return it to the pen.' Since September 17, we are in a new phase called confronting the 'Israeli' aggression and war on Lebanon, and we are no longer in a phase of mere support, his eminence clarified. 'Honestly, what the brothers have accomplished in the field over the past two weeks has been greater and better than they expected. The mission of the resistance is to pursue the army and conduct operations against it wherever it advances. The youth (fighters) are waiting to engage more and more; note that in the first week on the front line, there were 25 dead and 150 injured.' 'Since last week, we have established a new equation called the equation of inflicting pain on the enemy, and missiles will reach Haifa and beyond as desired by the leader.' Since the enemy has targeted all of Lebanon, we have the right, from a defensive position, to target any point within the enemy entity, Sheikh Qassem underscored. 'We can target any point in the Israeli entity, and we will choose the appropriate point.' Hezbollah Deputy S.G. addressed the Zionist 'home' front: 'The solution is a ceasefire, and after the ceasefire, according to the indirect agreement, the settlers will return to the north.' As the war continues, more Zionist settlements will be evacuated, and hundreds of thousands, even more than two million settlers, will be in danger, Sheikh Qassem threatened. 'The resistance will not be defeated because it is the rightful owner of the land, and its fighters are martyrs who accept nothing less than a life of dignity; your army is now defeated and will be defeated further.' Hezbollah is strong despite the harsh blows after the communication devices attack and the aftermath, Sheikh Qasssem confirmed. 'The party is strong with its fighters, its capabilities, and the solidarity of Hezbollah and Amal Movement, with a community that works together with strength and determination.' Sheikh Qassem emphasized that 'Israel' is the one disrupting all the lives of the Lebanese, and national unity today enhances their cohesion. 'Together, we will stand strong, and no one should bet on investing outside this framework.' Sheikh Qassem concluded his televised speech by addressing the Lebanese people who were displaced due to the Zionist war, 'Your are the noblest of people, and we are all in the same boat.' 'Victory comes with patience, but I recall our Secretary General's promise: you will return to your homes, which we will rebuild to be more beautiful than they were, and we have already begun preparations for this.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2232639	2024-10-15T07:57:53-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-01460760017290041622.png
