Israeli Occupation Forces Intensify Ceasefire Violations in Leban...	Israeli occupation forces persist in violating the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon, conducting excavation and sabotage operations in villages they failed to penetrate during their recent aggression. These incursions are seen as attempts to compensate for setbacks faced due to Hezbollah's steadfast resistance, which forced Israeli forces to retreat in several areas. Today, Israeli enemy troops, including two Merkava tanks and additional military vehicles, advanced from their positions near the border town of Adaisseh towards Al-Taybeh and Deir Siryan, causing damage in those areas. The Lebanese Army maintained its deployment in the region, while Israeli forces reportedly warned UNIFIL against operating in the vicinity, subtly threatening the safety of international peacekeepers. UNIFIL's Stance and International Concerns Candice Ardell, Deputy Director of UNIFIL’s Public Information Office, emphasized that the safety of peacekeeping forces is a top priority. She reiterated the Israeli enemy's obligations under Resolution 1701 to ensure the freedom of movement and safety of UNIFIL personnel across southern Lebanon. Despite these assurances, the Israeli occupation forces conducted movements in both eastern and western sectors of southern Lebanon, including between Al-Naqoura and Alma al-Shaab. This follows recent Israeli gunfire over Naqoura and controlled detonations in nearby villages. Additionally, Israeli enemy aircraft breached Lebanon's airspace multiple times. Expert Analysis: A Strategic Shift? Lebanese military expert Brigadier General Dr. Hasan Jouni views these violations as attempts by the Israeli enemy to project power following its inability to claim victory during its aggression on Lebanon. Jouni suggested that Israel might be leveraging reported US guarantees granting it operational freedom in Lebanon, although such arrangements hold no legitimacy for the Lebanese state. Three Scenarios Ahead In a press interview, retired Brigadier General and military expert Mounir Shehadeh outlined potential scenarios in light of the ongoing Israeli enemy's violations and the responses from the resistance and international actors to this escalation. According to Shahadeh, military projections indicate three possible scenarios by the end of the 60-day review period: Retired Brigadier General Mounir Shahadeh outlined three potential scenarios as tensions continue: Israel’s withdrawal and cessation of violations. Israel’s withdrawal with continued sporadic violations. Escalation, with no withdrawal and sustained aggression. Shehadeh warned that if violations persist, Hezbollah might resort to force, underscoring that political and international measures have been insufficient to deter Israeli aggression.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2301070	2024-12-29T07:38:52-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-05168890017354867693.jpg
Israeli Enemy Justifies Haniyeh Assassination Over Alleged Role i...	The Israeli Channel 12 report claims that documents found in Gaza tunnels early in the war implicated Martyr Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas' political bureau, in orchestrating the October 7 'Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.' The report alleges that Martyr Haniyeh’s involvement placed him at the top of Israel's assassination list. Planning and Surveillance in Tehran According to the report, Mossad prepared extensively for the operation, tracking Martyr Haniyeh’s movements and identifying his residence in a heavily guarded facility belonging to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Tehran. Former Israeli occupation military intelligence chief Tamir Hayman described Martyr Haniyeh as a symbolic political figure whose targeting marks a shift in the Israeli occupation's approach. 'Previously, Haniyeh was seen as a public figure, with military leaders Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif being primary targets,' Hayman stated. Alleged Coordination and Tehran Operation Ronen Bergman, a Zionist intelligence analyst for the 'Yedioth Ahronoth' daily, claimed that captured documents revealed deep military coordination between Martyr Haniyeh and Hamas leadership in Gaza. Martyr Haniyeh, who had been based in Doha, reportedly traveled frequently to Istanbul, Moscow, and Tehran. Mossad decided to act in Tehran, avoiding potential diplomatic fallout with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan or Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. The report alleges Mossad identified Martyr Haniyeh's specific room in the IRGC facility, planting a large explosive device that was detonated at 1:30 AM on July 31, 2024. Hamas Rejects Allegations Meanwhile, the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has denied the Israeli enemy's claims surrounding the assassination of its political bureau chief, martyr Ismail Haniya. In a statement issued Sunday, Hamas refuted these claims, emphasizing that investigations conducted by a joint committee comprising its security apparatus and Iranian counterparts concluded the assassination was executed with a guided missile. The missile, weighing 7.5 kilograms of explosives, reportedly targeted Martyr Haniya’s mobile phone directly. Condemnation of Violations The group described the Israeli enemy's allegations as a desperate attempt to divert attention from what it termed a 'compound crime,' involving the violation of Iran’s sovereignty through the use of a missile to strike an official site within the country. Details of the Incident Martyr Haniya and his aide, Waseem Abu Shaaban, were martyred in late July in Tehran after attending the inauguration of Iran's new president. The strike targeted Haniya at his location in the Iranian capital. Israeli Enemy Admits Last Monday, Zionist War Minister Yisrael Katz publicly admitted for the first time to the Israeli enemy's role in Martyr Haniya’s assassination. Speaking during a broadcast by the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation, Katz also issued threats against leaders of the Yemeni Ansar Allah movement.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2300982	2024-12-29T07:13:50-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/07/manar-02916120017223999614.jpg
Hospital Attacks Escalate on Day 450 of Israeli Aggression on Gaz...	For 450 consecutive days, Israeli occupation forces have carried out systematic atrocities in Gaza’s northern regions of Jabalia, Beit Hanoun, and Beit Lahia. Since last October 5, over 80,000 Palestinians remain trapped, facing relentless bombardment, forced displacement, and starvation. The attacks have claimed more than 4,000 lives, with over 12,000 wounded and 1,750 detained. Health Sector in Crisis The latest assault saw the destruction of Kamal Adwan Hospital, rendering northern Gaza devoid of operational medical facilities. Today, an airstrike targeted Al-Wafa Rehabilitation Hospital in Gaza City, killing seven Palestinians. Additionally, the Al-Ma'amadani Hospital in eastern Gaza was shelled, highlighting the Israeli occupation's ongoing campaign against the health sector. Seven innocent civilians were killed and others were injured this morning when an Israeli airstrike targeted Al-Wafa Hospital in central Gaza City. pic.twitter.com/kaErysydXg — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) December 29, 2024 Ceasefire Prospects Dwindle The Israeli enemy's actions undermine any potential for a ceasefire or prisoner exchange. Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office dismissed reports of a 'mini-deal' before US President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. Meanwhile, Zionist hostage families issue an urgent plea to US President-elect Donald Trump, accusing Netanyahu of 'deception' and urging him to push for a comprehensive deal. Israeli media quoted Yehuda Cohen, father of hostage soldier Nimrod Cohen, saying in his message to Trump: 'Netanyahu is trying to deceive you. You might be the last hope to pressure him. Do not agree to a partial deal—it would be a death sentence for the remaining hostages.'

In northern areas, besieged residents report continuous and indiscriminate shelling, with stray dogs scavenging bodies left in the streets. Food supplies are critically low, raising fears of starvation. Ongoing Strikes and Casualties Israeli occupation drones struck a civilian vehicle near Al-Sawarha Cemetery in central Gaza, killing one and injuring others. Aerial assaults targeted houses in Khan Younis and Rafah, leaving multiple casualties. Medical sources confirmed the martyrdom of Hani Abu Khater, 38, from wounds sustained in a previous strike. Recently released prisoners from Israeli detention were transferred to Gaza hospitals for treatment, many having been arrested during the ongoing military campaign. Director of Gaza’s health services, Dr. Mounir Al-Barsh, condemned Israel’s justification for targeting medical facilities, describing them as baseless and inhumane. This unrelenting aggression highlights the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, as international calls for a halt to the Israeli occupation’s brutality grow louder.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2300883	2024-12-29T04:24:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-09818920017354787144.jpg
Russia’s Sergey Lavrov Warns NATO and US of 'Decisive Response' t...	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has issued a stern warning to the United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), stating that Moscow will respond decisively with 'military-technical countermeasures' if new missile threats are posed to Russia. Prepared for Any Scenario In an interview with the RIA Novosti news agency, Lavrov emphasized that Russia is ready for any eventuality, noting that any actions taken will aim to establish conditions conducive to balanced dialogue. He underscored Moscow's focus on comprehensive measures to reduce the risk of conflict while addressing the root causes of fundamental security contradictions. 'We are prepared for any scenario while considering measures to create acceptable conditions for equal dialogue,' Lavrov stated. NATO Expansion: A Persistent Threat Lavrov highlighted NATO's eastward expansion as a longstanding and critical factor in the current security crisis. 'This very issue largely triggered the Ukrainian crisis and continues to pose a direct threat to Russia’s security,' he said. He suggested that arms control discussions could be on the table but only as part of a broader agenda to address security concerns comprehensively. Revisiting NATO’s Double-Track Decision When asked about the possibility of NATO repeating its 'double-track decision,' Lavrov refrained from speculation. The double-track decision, made in the late 1970s, involved deploying US medium-range missiles in Europe while negotiating disarmament with the Soviet Union. Lavrov pointed out that Russia might abandon its unilateral moratorium on deploying ground-based intermediate- and short-range missiles. 'This decision has become practically untenable despite still being in effect,' he remarked. US Ignoring Warnings Lavrov accused the United States of disregarding warnings from Russia and China and proceeding to deploy such weapons globally. 'The US has arrogantly ignored Russia’s and China’s warnings and is actively deploying weapons of this type in various parts of the world,' he said. ❗️LAVROV: US AND NATO WILL BE REBUFFED IF THEY THREATEN RUSSIA WITH MISSILES 🧵 The US and NATO will receive a decisive rebuff in the form of military-technical countermeasures from Moscow if they create new missile threats for Russia, Russian FM Sergey Lavrov told RIA Novosti. pic.twitter.com/pddzrgTQ4E — Sputnik (@SputnikInt) December 29, 2024 Oreshnik Missile Test Highlights Russian Resolve Lavrov concluded by referencing the recent successful test of Russia’s advanced 'Oreshnik' medium-range hypersonic missile system. 'This test, conducted under combat conditions, convincingly demonstrated our capabilities and determination to implement necessary measures. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also emphasized that any response to these developments will be proportional and resolute, solidifying Russia's stance in the face of escalating global tensions,' he affirmed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2300828	2024-12-29T03:41:20-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/09/manar-09607150016947106646.jpg

Palestinian Resistance in Gaza Launches Missile Attack on Israeli...	The Palestinian resistance on Saturday launched from northern Gaza Strip two long-range missiles at the Zionist settlements in Al-Quds. Sirens sounded in Beit Shemesh and numerous surrounding settlements as well as in several occupied territories near Gaza amid the attack, according to the Zionist media. Meanwhile, the chief of military staff Herzi Halevi ordered the expansion of the aggression on Gaza as the occupation forces started a massive aggression on Beit Hanoun. Earlier, Al-Qassam Brigades announced that its fighters stormed a Zionist military position in eastern Jabalia, clashing with the enemy soldiers and killing a number of them. The Israeli media described the incident as hard, adding that helicopters carried casualties from Gaza to Soroka Hospital. Around 40 martyrs were claimed on Saturday by the Zionist aggression on Gaza ongoing for the 449th day. Ceasefire Talks The Qatari foreign ministry announced on Saturday that the premier and foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani held a meeting in Doha with Hamas delegation, led by Khalil Al-Hayya, to discussed Gaza ceasefire. Meanwhile, the families of the Israeli captives in Gaza continued their protests in Tel Aviv, demanding a swift prisoner swap deal. Netanyahu's press office denied reports about a partial deal that liberates the American captives to honor the US administration. Leader of the Israeli Democrats Party, Yair Golan said that Netanyahu's government is sacrificing the captives and soldiers in Gaza and does not want to end the war. Israeli Channel 12 claimed, quoting sources attending Doha talks, that Hamas may approve a 'limited' deal as a symbolic step before the inauguration of the US President-elect Donald Trump. However, Axios website mentioned that the reports about Hamas approval.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2300641	2024-12-28T15:28:37-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-03108060017354282186.jpg

UN Envoy Voices Concern over Rising Violence in Syria, Calls for ...	United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen expressed serious concerns about intensifying violence in several Syrian regions, stressing the necessity for upholding Syria's sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity. During a closed session of the UN Security Council reiterated the Security Council Resolution 2254 as a 'framework for moving forward', Associate Spokesperson for the UN Secretary General Stephanie Tremblay stated in a press conference on Saturday. 'The key principles of Security Council Resolution 2254 have wide consensus,' Tremblay said. 'The transition there should be Syrian-led and owned, and ensuring inclusive, non-sectarian governance, including also constitutional reform, the holding of free and fair elections, and the meaningful women's participation,' the statement added. Last week, Pedersen urged for 'free and fair elections' to coincide with the end of the transitional period in Syria, expected in about three months. He also expressed hope for a political solution that would include the Kurdish self-administration. During a press conference in Syria, Pedersen underlined the urgent need for humanitarian assistance while highlighting long-term goals. UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher urged for a massive aid boost by donor countries to respond to 'this moment of hope' for Syria. 'Across the country, the needs are huge. Seven in 10 people are needing support right now,' Fletcher told AFP in a telephone interview as he visited Syria. Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) leader Abu Mohammad Al-Joulani, now referred to as commander of military operations in Syria Ahmad Al-Sharaa, urged Pedersen to review UN Resolution 2254.

Saree confirmed the missile successfully reached its target despite enemy attempts to conceal it, resulting in casualties and the suspension of airport operations. The YAF's Unmanned Air Force also conducted a military operation targeting a vital Israeli site in the occupied Yafa region using a drone, which Saree said achieved its objective successfully. These latest strikes followed wide-scale Israeli bombardment of Yemeni civilian infrastructure, including the Sanaa Airport, ports, and power stations, which claimed the lives of six citizens and injured another 40.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2300157	2024-12-28T01:24:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-03922030017353778582.jpg

Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, stressed that Kama Adwan Hospital has been exposed to a massacre since 75 days, confirming that there are no fighters inside the medical center. In a TV interview, Hamdan added that the Israeli plots to end all manifestations of civilian steadfastness in northern Gaza. On the 448th day of the Israeli aggression on Gaza, the Palestinian resistance has struck back against the Israeli occupation forces, even as the latter continue their brutal attacks on hospitals and civilians in the besieged territory. Hamdan noted that Hamas had proposed a deal which stipulates a complete ceasefire, gradual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and a full prisoner swap. 'However, Netanyahu's government rejected the proposal.' The Palestinian resistance continued on Friday attacking the Zionist occupation forces in Gaza. A Qassam fighter managed to blow himself up with an explosive belt in a Zionist force of 5 soldiers, killing and wounding them.

Lebanese Brigadier General Warns of New Status Quo as Israeli Ene...	Brigadier General Mounir Shehadeh, former Lebanese government coordinator with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), has raised concerns over ongoing Israeli enemy violations since the ceasefire was declared. He warned that these actions reflect Israeli efforts to impose a new status quo on Lebanon and its resistance. Exploiting International Cover In an interview with Al-Manar Website, Shehadeh explained that the Israeli enemy is leveraging international cover provided by a US-led committee to consolidate its control and achieve objectives it failed to secure during the war. He highlighted that the Zionist enemy continues its military maneuvers, including airstrikes on Lebanese territory and ground incursions, without facing any effective deterrent. 'The international committee has shown no effectiveness in curbing these serious violations or pressuring the Israeli occupation to halt its repeated aggressions,' Shehadeh stressed. Critical Violations Undermine the Ceasefire Brig. Shehadeh pointed to a particularly alarming incident last Wednesday when Israeli occupation forces advanced near the southern town of Al-Naqoura while the international committee was holding a meeting in the area. Simultaneously, Israeli enemy troops destroyed homes in nearby villages. Additionally, settlers have set up tents in the Maroun Al-Ras region, signaling clear aggressive and expansionist intentions. The brigadier general also described a recent provocation in Wadi Al-Hjeir, where Israeli forces built an earthen barrier separating it from Wadi Al-Slouki. This action aims to alter the geographical landscape, pursuing what the Israeli enemy could not achieve during the war. Video shows Israeli occupation bulldozers plow and destroy the main road in Wadi Al-Hjeir and Al-Slpouki during withdrawal (Dec 26, 2024) Hezbollah Maintains Ceasefire Commitment Despite these provocations, Shehadeh confirmed that Lebanon’s resistance remains committed to the ceasefire agreement, giving the international committee a chance to fulfill its role. However, the Israeli enemy continues its blatant violations by bombing southern villages and targeting areas deep into the Bekaa Valley, disregarding international resolutions. The Israeli occupation forces bomb Kfar Kila and Taybeh, south Lebanon (Dec 22, 2024) Regional Developments Fuel Israeli Aggression Brigadier Shehadeh noted that the regional situation, including Syria’s destabilization, has emboldened the Israeli enemy to push its northern frontiers closer to Lebanon. 'Israel’s advance to just 12 kilometers from the Masnaa crossing on the Lebanese-Syrian border, near Damascus, marks a seismic shift in the region’s dynamics,' he said. The Israeli occupation is exploiting this turmoil to evade international agreements and maintain unrestricted military activity in southern Lebanon, expanding its violations. Resistance Offers International Community a Chance 'Despite these developments, the resistance continues to adhere to the ceasefire agreement, granting the international community a chance to pressure Israel into compliance,' Shehadeh explained. However, with the 60-day ceasefire window still active, doubts remain about the international committee's and Lebanese authorities' ability to enforce the Israeli enemy's commitments. Brigadier General Mounir Shehadeh concluded by referencing a report in Israeli Haaretz, which stated that the Israeli army plans to remain in southern Lebanon even after the ceasefire deadline expires. This stance underscores the Israeli enemy’s determination to pursue its aggressive policies, reaffirming that only resistance and strength can effectively counter its ambitions.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2299717	2024-12-27T06:17:53-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-07888840017353086731.png
‘Israel’ Burns Kamal Adwan Hospital, Resistance Strikes Back in t...	on the 448th day of the Israeli aggression on Gaza, the Palestinian resistance has struck back against the Israeli occupation forces, even as the latter continue their brutal attacks on hospitals and civilians in the besieged territory. Israeli occupation forces stormed Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza, once again on Friday morning, forcing patients, the wounded, and medical staff to leave and arresting others. Here’s what happened. — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) December 27, 2024 The Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, announced that one of its fighters carried out a suicide bombing against an enemy force of 5 Israeli soldiers east of Jabalia camp in northern Gaza, killing and wounding them. The Al-Qassam Brigades also reported sniping two soldiers from the rescue force that advanced towards Tel al-Zaatar and showering them with Israeli-made hand grenades. Concurrently, the Al-Quds Brigades, the military wing of the Islamic Jihad Movement, announced that it had destroyed an enemy military vehicle with a barrel bomb during its incursion south of the Al-Awda Towers in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza. The Martyr Omar Al-Qassem Forces also reported shelling an occupation army command and control headquarters in the Netzarim axis in central Gaza with mortar shells. These qualitative strikes by the resistance come as the occupation continues its brutal aggression and siege in the north, with the latest development being the burning of the Kamal Adwan Hospital by the Israeli occupation forces.

Yemen: Targeting Ben Gurion Airport in A Specific Operation	The Yemeni Armed Forces announced the launch of a 'qualitative military operation' targeting Ben Gurion Airport in the occupied Jaffa area. This attack involved the use of a hypersonic ballistic missile of the 'Palestine 2' type. Additionally, the Yemeni drone air force carried out a separate operation, successfully striking a 'vital target of the Israeli enemy' in the occupied Jaffa region. The Yemeni forces also targeted the Santa Ursula ship in the Arabian Sea east of Socotra Island, with a direct hit from multiple drones. According to the Yemeni military statement, these operations were in response to the 'Israeli aggression on civilian facilities in Sana'a and Hodeidah.' The statement warned that the attacks would continue until the 'aggression on Gaza stops and the siege on it is lifted.' بيان القوات المسلحة اليمنية بشأن استهداف مطار بن جوريون بصاروخ فرط صوتي وهدفا حيويا في منطقة يافا المحتلة بطائرة مسيرة واستهداف سفينة (Santa Ursula) بعدد من الطائرات المسيرة - 27-12-2024م pic.twitter.com/oz2dfJGahr — أمين حيان Ameen Hayyan (@AmeenHa2024yan) December 27, 2024 The missile strike on Tel Aviv resulted in a stampede that left 18 Israelis injured as they rushed to seek shelter.

The Israeli military claimed to have intercepted the missile from Yemen, but sirens still sounded across central occupied Palestine, causing the temporary halt of aircraft landings at Ben Gurion Airport before operations resumed. The World Health Organization Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was about to board a plane at the Yemeni airport when it was attacked, with one of the crew members sustaining injuries.

Commander of Sayyed Nasrallah’s Guard Unit Martyr Ibrahim Jezzine...	It was a very reassuring and joyful experience for the guard unit's commander of the former Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, Martyr Ibrahim Jezzine (Hajj Nabil), to be told that His Eminence was satisfied with his performance. Martyr Jezzine was always haunted by the fear that the measures surrounding the Master of the Resistance were bothering His Eminence. Martyr Sayyed Nasrallah once told a close associate, 'I hope the day, when I manage to reward Hajj Nabil.' Hezbollah Military Commander Hajj Imad Mughniyeh tasked Martyr Jezzine to guard Sayyed Nasrallah in 1994, The measures taken by Hajj Nabil used to prevent Sayyed Nasrallah from appearing in person in public occasions, the experience which His Eminence used to be always eager for. Martyr Jezzine used to spend days and nights preparing for Sayyed Nasralla's public appearances which were a source of worries for the loyal guardian. Hajj Nabil used to keep with Sayyed Nasrallah as his shadow, and the harmony between them was remarkable as they shared numerous experiences during their common jihadi journey. The confidentiality of Martyr Jezzine was permanent and constant to the extent that he did not even grant his own family the chance to meet with His Eminence. It would be a loftier case when we encounter the 'international leader with the Imam-Ali-like appearance,' a description that Hajj Jazini nodded his head in agreement with its accuracy, and as the 'guardian' has devoted his life out of love, passion and voluntarily to the Secretary-General of Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, 'out of complete belief in the doctrine of Wilaya.: Martyr Jezzine used to develop and foster his skills pertaining the guardianship and security skills. Hajj Nabil used to always talk about the Ahl Al-Bayt trait possessed by Sayyed Nasrallah, which is firmness and leniency of the leader who is always concerned about tackling the people's issues. Hajj Nabil used to miss Sayyed Nasrallah when he, ordered by His Eminence, used to accompany Hajj Qassem Suleimani in Syria. Without Sayyed Nasrallah, life would be void of beauty and goodness, Hajj Nabil used to reiterate always, asking Holy God to let him embrace martyrdom when His Eminence does. This was the main wish of Martyr Jezzine that came true on September 27, 2024. This was Sayyed Nasrallah's greatest gift to Hajj Nabil, a close associate concluded.

Hezbollah Reaffirms Full Solidarity with Yemeni People against Is...	Hezbollah strongly condemned on Thursday the large-scale Israeli aggression on Dear Yemen with American-British involvement, which targeted civilian, economic and vital facilities. In a statement, Hezbollah considered that the Zionist campaign is a blatant violation of international and humanitarian laws, an attempt to pursue its arrogance as well brutality, and persistence on its open wars against the peoples of our Arab and Islamic region, especially in Palestine, Lebanon and Syria. This new aggression on Yemeni territory came as a result of the enemy’s failure to confront the Yemeni military strikes, the steadfastness of the Yemeni position courageously supporting the Palestinian people’s cause and right to their land and freedom, and the Yemenis insistence on supporting and standing by steadfast Gaza, according to the statement. 'Hezbollah reaffirms its full solidarity and stands by the dear and steadfast Yemeni people, who continue their resilience and steadfastness in this cause. We reaffirm our confidence in this resistant people, who continue the path of endurance and dignity with their wise and courageous leadership to confront this aggression.' Hezbollah called on all free people of the world and all honest and resistance forces in our Arab and Islamic region to unite in facing this aggression, raising their voices loudly in face of the international community's silence and its institutions that are helpless and submissive to American will. 'We emphasize that in the face of this Zionist enemy and its supporters, our peoples have no choice but to continue with more steadfastness and resistance.' Multiple Israeli air raids on Yemen targeted on Thursday Sanaa and Hodeidah governorates, according to Yemeni media outlets. Meanwhile, the Zionist reports indicated that the enemy attacked certain targets in Yemen.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2298859	2024-12-26T10:10:14-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-027725400166239486010.jpg
Video| Large-scale Israeli Aggression Targets Yemen, Sayyed Houth...	Multiple Israeli air raids on Yemen targeted on Thursday Sanaa and Hodeidah governorates, according to Yemeni media outlets. Meanwhile, the Zionist reports indicated that the enemy attacked certain targets in Yemen. The airport in the capital, Sanaa, and the adjacent Al-Dailami Air Base were targeted on Thursday along with a power plant in the port city of Hodeidah, media reports mentioned. The Israeli news website, Walla, reported that dozens of war jets participated in the campaign, demanding what he called as 'Israel's allies' to help it prepare a target bank in Yemen. Menahwile, Head of Yemen’s Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi stressed that the Israeli enemy is frustrated by the Yemeni drone and missile attacks, underlining its failure to intercept them. Sayyed Al-Houthi stressed that the Israeli deterrence and air defense systems have failed to confront the Yemeni power, confirming that the Yemeni strikes would never stop before the end of the Zionist war on Gaza despite all threats and temptations. Houthi underlined that the Zionist entity is perplexed with the Yemeni strikes, highlighting the economic losses of the enemy, including the decline of the value of the stock market. Houthi maintained that the Yemeni attack on the US aircraft carrier is unprecedented since the World War II, adding that it lasted for several hours. Sayyyed Houthi warned against the Israeli plots in Syria, adding that the Zionist enemy is trying to fabricate a victory in Lebanon after its failure to eradicate Hezbollah. What the Israeli enemy is committing in Lebanon highlights the important role of the resistance, he affirmed. On Wednesday, the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out three drone and missile attacks on Israeli targets in Tel Aviv and Ashkelon, according to the spokesman for the Yemeni military General Yahya Saree,	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2298771	2024-12-26T08:53:31-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-012929700173523200410.png
Lebanon: Double Standards Emerge among Resistance Critics amid Co...	The debate over Lebanon's resistance has resurfaced as critics, including politicians, media figures, and activists, accuse it of pursuing foreign agendas contrary to national interests. This rhetoric, amplified during times of conflict, contrasts sharply with the same critics' tolerance of western influence in Lebanon’s political affairs, particularly the selection of its new president. Critics argue that the resistance undermines Lebanon’s sovereignty, yet many of them openly engage with American and Arab envoys who impose specific candidates or criteria for the presidency. This obvious double standard has drawn scrutiny, as it suggests a willingness to accommodate western pressures while rejecting a homegrown defense strategy against Israeli aggression. Historically, opposition to the resistance has been consistent, spanning from its early days before Hezbollah’s establishment in the 1980s through key milestones such as the liberation of southern Lebanon in 2000, the 2006 July War, and the 2024 Israeli aggression as well as the ongoing Zionist violations that followed it. Critics have frequently targeted the resistance’s weapons, calling for their removal even as Israeli violations of the ceasefire agreement persist. Dr. Zakaria Hamoudan, director of the Lebanese National Institute for Studies and Statistics, highlighted this tension during an interview with Al-Manar, stating that 'during Israeli attacks, some Lebanese factions have sought to undermine the resistance rather than support its efforts to defend the country'. He emphasized that the resistance’s arsenal has consistently served as a deterrent, preventing deeper Israeli incursions and safeguarding Lebanon’s sovereignty. director of the Lebanese National Institute for Studies and Statistics Zakaria Hamoudan in an interview with Al-Manar (image from August 2022). Hamoudan warned that efforts to weaken the resistance align with broader regional projects favoring Zionist interests, such as economic exploitation and normalization deals that have impoverished nations like Egypt and undermined Jordan’s sovereignty. He argued that dismantling the resistance would leave Lebanon vulnerable to similar outcomes. Amid these challenges, Hamoudan underscored the importance of the 'people, army, and resistance' equation, a strategy credited with shielding Lebanon from numerous threats. He called for preserving this integrated approach, which has proven effective against Israeli aggression and remains a cornerstone of Lebanon's defense. As Lebanon navigates this historic phase of regional tension, the debate over the resistance's role and its weapons continues to reflect deeper questions about true sovereignty, national security, and the country’s path forward.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2298782	2024-12-26T08:48:02-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-00419630017352316554.jpg
Zionist Settlers in Occupied Territories Rally Against Surging Li...	A new campaign led by Lucille Blackerman has emerged in response to skyrocketing prices and a rise in value-added tax (VAT) across the occupied territories. During an interview with the Hebrew Ynet, Blackerman encouraged fellow Zionist settlers to stock up on essentials by the end of the year and boycott supermarkets during the first two weeks of 2025. Campaign Gains Momentum Amid Economic Struggles The campaign, launched a few days ago and running until December 31, comes at a time when prices across all sectors are rising sharply. The cost of goods is expected to increase further following the VAT hike, which will make essential products even more expensive. Blackerman, the Zionist protest leader, expressed the collective frustration felt by many, stating, 'There is a sense of despair in the country.' However, she acknowledged receiving skepticism from settlers, many of whom believe her initiative will not succeed. In a statement, Blackerman addressed importers and major corporations directly, highlighting the internal economic crisis: 'I understand that there is an ongoing war, but the real battle is within. The projected 2025 prices, coupled with the VAT increase and soaring water and electricity bills, are simply unsustainable.' Protest ad distributed on social media Rent Prices Continue to Climb Adding to the economic strain, the Hebrew-language daily evening financial newspaper Globes recently reported a significant rise in rental costs across the occupied territories. The average rent for a four-room apartment now ranges from $822 to $2,330, depending on the city, further exacerbating financial pressures on residents. This dual challenge of rising living costs and taxation has fueled widespread discontent, with campaigns like Blackerman’s striving to make a statement against what many view as unsustainable economic policies.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2298540	2024-12-26T05:38:00-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-03844360017352202523.jpeg
‘Israel’ Continues to Violate Ceasefire Agreement in Southern Leb...	‘Israel’ continues to violate the ceasefire agreement in southern Lebanon, with incursions into the areas of Qantara, Adshit al-Qusayr and Wadi al-Hujayr, according to reports from the region. The Israeli enemy has not stopped violating the ceasefire every day since the agreement on November 27, demonstrating their arrogance and impudence, which the resistance says can only be deterred by force. On Thursday morning, Israeli occupation forces penetrated the town of Qantara, reaching the spring of Wadi al-Hujayr, and cut off the road leading to Wadi al-Saluqi, which connects to the district of Bint Jbeil. This prompted some residents of Qantara to flee to the nearby towns of al-Ghandouriya and Srifa. The Lebanese army has strengthened its deployment in the affected areas and is coordinating with UNIFIL, the UN peacekeeping force, to monitor the situation. The Majdal Selm Municipality has warned citizens not to use the Salouqi-Hajeir road due to the 'new security conditions.' In the morning, the Lebanese army closed the road leading to Wadi al-Hajeir, while 'Merkava' tanks patrolled the valley and conducted intensive searches of the surrounding forests. Reconnaissance aircraft and drones from the Israeli enemy were also reported flying over the central and western sectors of southern Lebanon, including the airspace of Naqoura, Bint Habil, Taloussa, Qantara, Wadi al-Hajeir and Salouqi. On the other hand, the 'National News Agency' reported that enemy reconnaissance aircraft and drones were flying in the airspace of the central and western sectors, especially over Naqoura in the south and up to the airspace of Bint Habil, reaching the Taloussa, Qantara, Wadi al-Hajeir and Salouqi in the east.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2298397	2024-12-26T02:52:19-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-00015080017352099987.jpg
IRGC: Yemeni Attacks Shift Israel’s Calculations Amid Syria Turmo...	In a major development, a spokesman for Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) has stated that recent 'prompt' missile attacks by Yemen's Ansarullah resistance movement have significantly altered Israel's strategic calculations. This comes as the Israeli regime was previously buoyed by the situation in Syria. Brigadier General Ali Mohammad Naeini, who heads the IRGC's Public Relations Department, made these remarks on Thursday amidst Israel's ongoing aggression against Syria and Yemen's sustained missile barrages targeting the occupied territories. بيان القوات المسلحة اليمنية بشأن تنفيذ سلاح الجو المسير عمليتين عسكريتين بطائرتين مسيرتين الأولى استهدفت هدفا حيوياً حساساً للعدو الإسرائيلي في منطقة يافا المحتلة، والأخرى استهدفت المنطقة الصناعية للعدو الإسرائيلي في منطقة عسقلان جنوبي فلسطين المحتلة. pic.twitter.com/6kCgJxOGSY — أمين حيان Ameen Hayyan (@AmeenHa2024yan) December 25, 2024 'The powerful measures by Yemen's Ansarullah movement showed that the resistance front is self-reliant and independent in various fields, and enjoys unparalleled capabilities to respond to the crimes of the Zionist regime,' Naeini stated. The IRGC commander further emphasized that global media outlets are actively targeting the resistance movement and disseminating propaganda in an effort to silence its voice. He stressed the need to form a broad media front to confront those opposing the resistance in an innovative manner. Yemenis have openly declared their support for Palestine's struggle against the Israeli occupation since the regime launched its devastating war on Gaza on October 7, 2023, which has so far claimed the lives of at least 45,361 Palestinians, mostly women and children. Ansarullah has also been targeting ships linked to ‘Israel’, the United States, and the United Kingdom in a bid to force an end to Tel Aviv's ongoing aggression against Gaza. The Yemeni Armed Forces have vowed to continue their attacks until Israel's ground and aerial aggression in Gaza come to an end.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2298375	2024-12-26T02:16:27-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/11/manar-00920140016988726696.jpg
Mossad Chief Warns against Escalating Yemen Attacks, Push for Ira...	Mossad chief David Barnea has been reportedly pushing the Israeli leadership to concentrate on attacking Iran as a way to stem attacks from Yemen. According to the Haaretz newspaper, Barnea raised the option during a series of discussions on the lack of results from three earlier rounds of strikes in Yemen. The report stated that the Mossad chief believes it would be more effective to go after Iran, which the Israeli officials claim it funds and arms the revolutionary group in Yemen. 'We need to go head-on against Iran,' he told security officials, according to Israeli Channel 13. 'If we only attack the Houthis, it’s not certain that we’ll be able to stop them.' A mock missile bearing a portrait of former Hezbollah S.G. Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah during a pro-Gaza rally in Sanaa (December 25, 2024). The stance reportedly adopted by Barnea contrasts the opinion of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz, who prefer to keep carrying out strikes against Yemen rather than against Iran. The reports by Haarets and Channel 13 cited unnamed sources with knowledge of the discussions. Netanyahu, according to Channel 13, disagreed with Barnea’s assessment, and instead surmised that Iran was 'a different issue, which will be dealt with at the appropriate time.' Netanyahu’s estimation was shared by senior members of the security establishment, Channel 13 reported, without providing further details.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2298298	2024-12-26T00:42:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-00400420017352022666.jpg

Palestinian resistance groups in Gaza wracked up on Wednesday new successes in their long list of operations targeting Israeli occupation forces invading the besieged strip. Al Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s military wing, announced four different operations via their social media platforms.

For its part, Al-Quds Brigades, the Islamic Jihad’s armed wing, released a video of a drone that the resistance fighters seized control of while conducting surveillance mission over Khan Younis. سرايا القدس تعرض مشاهد لطائرات صهيونية بدون طيار سيطرت عليها خلال تنفيذها مهام استخبارية في سماء مدينة خانيونس.#اليمن #العراق #ترامب #طهران #لبنان#السعوديه_اليمن pic.twitter.com/1HyI20RqKU — ياسر الفاضلي🇵🇸🇾🇪 (@Yasser222200) December 25, 2024 Earlier on Tuesday, Al-Quds Brigades reported on multiple points of engagement with the Zionist enemy on the Northern Gaza front specifically in Beit Hanoun. In a statement shared through their social media platforms Al-Quds Brigades said, 'after our Mujahideen returned from the frontlines in the northern Gaza Strip, they reported that, on Sunday evening, they had caught a Zionist infantry force of 12 soldiers in an ambush, blowing up a house - in which they had barricaded themselves - in the Al-Izba area, west of Beit Hanoun'. The statement mentioned that the house had been booby-trapped in advance with a number of anti-personnel explosives. Al-Quds added that they also targeted a Merkava tank crew who were on their way to reinforce the first group of 12 with a 'Thaqib' anti-tank explosive. The resistance group’s fighters also reported heavy infantry clashes with the Zionist enemy in a house in the 'Abdul Dayem' area, west of Beit Hanoun. The ongoing developments underscore the resilience and tactical capabilities of Gaza's resistance groups, who continue to engage Zionist forces across multiple fronts despite the escalating intensity of the conflict.

Hamas: New Israeli Terms Delayed Gaza Ceasefire Agreement	Islamic Resistance Movement - Hamas issued on Wednesday a statement which indicated that the negotiations for a ceasefire and captive exchange were underway in Doha with Qatari and Egyptian mediation in a serious manner. The movement has shown responsibility and flexibility, the statement added. 'However, the occupation has introduced new issues and conditions related to withdrawal, ceasefire, captives, and the return of displaced persons, which has delayed reaching the agreement that was previously possible.' The Israeli enemy's premier Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly hindered the conclusion of a ceasefire agreement in Gaza over political interests and considerations. The Zionist security agencies' chiefs have always blamed Netanyahu for the delay which, according to them, endangers the lives of the Israeli captives held by the Palestinian Resistance in the Strip facing the 15th month of the enemy's all-out war. Dozens of Palestinians were martyred or injured on Wednesday due to the Israeli continuous bombardment of the residential and civilian targets in the various cities of Gaza. Since early Wednesday, over 14 martyrs were claimed by the Zionist aggression, starving the northern sector of the Strip for the 82nd consecutive day. The overall toll of the Zionist aggression on Gaza since October 7, 2023, has reached 45,338 martyrs and 107,764 injuries.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2297792	2024-12-25T05:25:53-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-09459540016632347435.jpg

‘Israel’ Struggles to Deter Threat by Yemen’s Ansarullah	Facing the escalating challenges from Yemen's Ansarullah revolutionary group, the Zionist entity weighs its options, with no clear resolution yet to the significant threat posed by the intensified actions in support of Gaza over the past year. Zionist officials and experts are deliberating strategies to counter these threats, with recent military responses proving ineffective at best, Al-Akhbar Lebanese newspaper reported on Monday. Ansaruallah, having pledged its support to the Palestinian resistance, has disrupted maritime activity by targeting commercial ships heading to Israeli ports through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, the Gulf of Aden, and the Arabian Sea. This strategy aims to pressure Israel to stop its genocidal war on Gaza. Israel initially relied on US intervention, citing limited resources due to the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) spreading themselves thin across the northern and southern fronts. However, US responses have remained tactical, with strikes limited to retaliation for disruptions to trade and supplies, their insufficiency as deterrence is highlighted by a recent friendly fire incident that destroyed one of their own jets. Remarking on the US aggression, Yemen’s Defense Minister Mohammed Nasser Al-Atifi warned Washington that the country was capable of sinking the US’s naval fleets, and was in possession of weapons yet to be revealed. Despite Israeli airstrikes on Yemen, analysts agree these efforts have failed to deter Ansarullah, Al-Akhbar’s Yahya Dbouk wrote. The group has intensified its operations, reiterating its support for Gaza and vowing further action unless ‘Israel’ halts its genocide against Palestinians. Israeli experts suggest alternative strategies, including targeting Yemeni leadership in Sanaa, weapon production facilities, and economic hubs such as ports and energy sites, as well as bombing Saada for its symbolism in the Yemeni public’s consciousness according to Dbouk, who added that proposals to strike Sanaa and Saada aim to weaken Ansarullah's influence and mobilize opposition forces within Yemen.

However, doubts remain about its feasibility, given the previous failures of the coalition to secure a military victory during the war waged by the Saudi-led coalition on the Arab impoverished country since March 2015, according to the author. Another debated approach involves targeting Iran, viewed as Ansarullah’s so-called 'primary supporter', Dbouk reported, noting that this strategy, however, raises questions about the Zionist entity’s capacity to address broader regional threats in wartime. On the other hand, a ceasefire in Gaza has been proposed as a potential solution to ease Yemeni attacks. Ansarullah themselves have said on multiple occasions that as long as the war on Gaza continues, so will the attacks from Yemen and the maritime trade disruptions. Such option 'seems likely to break quickly, due to a possible failure in the second phase of a potential swap deal between Gaza and ‘Israel’, which is widely believed in Tel Aviv will never see the light,' Dbouk wrote. The Zionist entity continues to weigh its options, with no clear resolution yet to the significant threat posed by Ansarullah and its broader implications for regional security.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2297132	2024-12-24T02:47:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-08337000017350371954.jpg

The operation led to several key outcomes: Firstly, the Yemeni forces shot down an F-18 aircraft, while enemy destroyers attempted to confront the Yemeni drones and missiles launched against the aircraft carrier USS Harry Truman. Secondly, most of the hostile aircraft retreated from Yemeni airspace to international waters in the Red Sea in an effort to defend the USS Truman, which was being targeted. Thirdly, the attack launched by the coalition on Yemeni territory failed, marking a crucial defeat for the aggressors. Fourthly, the USS Truman, after being subjected to multiple attacks, withdrew from its previous location in the Red Sea towards the northern waters. The Yemeni Armed Forces reaffirmed their readiness to confront any further American-British-Israeli provocations, warning the 'Israeli and American enemy' against aggression on Yemen and vowing to support the Palestinian people until the aggression against Gaza stops and the siege is lifted. Separately, a violent explosion rocked the Yemeni capital Sanaa on Saturday evening, with reports of intensive fighter jet activity. Yemen's state news agency reported that American-British warplanes carried out the aggression, targeting the Attan area south of the city. While Israeli media quickly denied any involvement, tensions between Israel and Yemen have been escalating amid Yemen's continued support for Palestine and its resistance. The US Central Command (CENTCOM) later confirmed the aggression, claiming it targeted Ansar Allah's 'missile storage facility and a command-and-control facility.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2296329	2024-12-23T04:14:22-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/06/manar-00923210017183201212.jpg
IRGC Chief says Resistance Front’s Self-Reliance	The chief commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) has highlighted the independence and resilience of the Resistance Front, asserting that regional resistance warriors rely on their own strength rather than that of the Islamic Republic. Speaking aboard the Shahid Rudaki naval vessel during a nationwide IRGC prayer conference in Bandar Abbas on Monday, Major General Hossein Salami emphasized that even though Iran supports the Resistance Front, they build their own weapons independently. 'Iran has not lost its arms,' he said, echoing remarks made a day earlier by Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei. IRGC chief: Resistance Front relies on its own strength pic.twitter.com/lSPhNNUbEN — IRNA News Agency (@IrnaEnglish) December 23, 2024 Salami made it clear that while Iran provides maximum spiritual and political support to the Resistance Front, each resistance movement operates based on its own interests within its land. 'Everyone fights with their own capabilities. No one relies on anyone else,' he stated. The IRGC chief's comments come in the wake of Imam's dismissal of claims that the Islamic Republic has been cut off from its 'proxy forces' in the region. 'The Islamic Republic does not have proxy forces,' the Supreme Leader asserted in a meeting with a group of elegists and eulogists on Sunday. Salami also warned adversaries against any miscalculations, as Iran's expanding influence and enduring capabilities remain a formidable force. 'Our enemies must recognize the magnitude of this power; a single misstep could be their last,' he asserted. The IRGC chief praised the guardians of Iran's sovereignty in the Persian Gulf, emphasizing their unwavering defense against adversaries. He noted that no global power could overpower the IRGC due to its connection to divine inspiration and moral principles, as well as the blessing of the enlightened mind of the late founder of the Islamic Republic, Imam Khomeini, and the wisdom, far-reaching vision, and elevated perspective of Supreme Leader Sayyed Khamenei.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2296219	2024-12-23T03:01:45-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/08/manar-05368670017225129456.jpg

Imam Khamenei: Iran Has No Proxy Forces in Region	In a defiant message to the United States and its allies, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, has firmly rejected claims that Iran has lost its 'proxy forces' in the region. Addressing a gathering of religious eulogists, Khamenei asserted that the Islamic Republic neither has nor needs such forces to achieve its objectives. 'The Islamic Republic does not have any proxy forces,' Khamenei said, dismissing the notion that Iran's support for groups like Lebanon's Hezbollah and the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad is a form of proxy warfare. Instead, the Leader explained that the resistance fighters in these movements are driven by their own 'beliefs and convictions, not on our behalf.' Ayatollah Khamenei: Iran has no proxies in West Asia — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) December 22, 2024 Khamenei also warned that should Iran ever decide to take action, it would not require a proxy force to do so. 'The Iranian nation will trample under its strong feet anyone who assumes a mercenary role for the US in this matter,' he said, in a clear message to those who might consider aligning themselves with Washington's interests. Addressing the situation in Syria, the Leader expressed confidence in the emergence of a 'strong and honorable establishment,' rejecting the US plot to dominate the country through 'establishing a dictatorship or fomenting chaos and riots.' Imam's remarks come in response to recent comments from a US official that appeared to promise support for anyone inciting unrest in Iran. The Leader dismissed these statements as 'absurd,' asserting that the 'Americans, the Zionist regime, and their allies mistakenly believe they have emerged victorious.' The Islamic Revolution Leader's unequivocal stance underscores Iran's unwavering commitment to its principles and its refusal to be cowed by external pressure or interference. The message is clear: Iran will not be deterred from pursuing its objectives, and any attempts to undermine its regional influence or incite instability within the country will be met with a resolute and crushing response.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2295713	2024-12-22T03:49:35-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-09275780017348681601.jpg

US-British Aggression Target Attan area in the Yemeni capital	A violent explosion rocked the Yemeni capital of Sanaa on Saturday evening, with reports of intensive fighter jet activity in the skies. Media reports confirmed that two airstrikes targeted Mount Attan, located south of the city. According to Yemen's state news agency SABA, the airstrikes were carried out by American-British warplanes in an act of aggression against Sanaa's Attan area. However, Israeli media quickly denied any involvement, despite the escalating tensions between Israel and Yemen. These tensions have been further fueled by Israel's increasing threats against Sanaa, particularly in light of Yemen's continued support for Palestine and its resistance movement. In a statement, the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) claimed responsibility for the airstrikes, stating that they targeted an Ansar Allah 'missile storage facility and a command-and-control facility.' CENTCOM asserted that the attack aimed 'to disrupt and degrade Houthi operations, such as attacks against U.S. Navy warships and merchant vessels in the Southern Red Sea, Bab al-Mandeb, and Gulf of Aden.'

In response, Sanaa's Information Minister Hashem Sharaf al-Din commented that Washington has 'learned from [past] mistakes,' but added that the US will continue to be 'humiliated' by the Yemeni people. Meanwhile, Sanaa's Foreign Minister Jamal Ahmad Amer warned that any state assisting Israeli aggression on Yemen would be considered a partner in the aggression.

Israeli Defenses Failure in Face of Yemeni Ballistic Missiles Pos...	In less than two days, Yemeni missiles succeeded in reaching the heart of the occupation entity, bypassing its advanced air defenses and achieving direct and qualitative hits, which reflects the importance of this front and its impact on the security of the entity, despite all the strikes launched by the latter against Sanaa with American and British participation. Millions rushed to shelters in the Zionist entity’s center early on Saturday as the Israeli air defenses failed to intercept a hypersonic ballistic missile fired from Yemen. The UAV force of the Yemeni Armed Forces targeted a military target of the Israeli enemy in the occupied Yaffa area with a drone, the military spokesman General Yahya Sarea announced Thursday evening. Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper mentioned that the Yemeni missiles have managed to surpass all the Zionist defenses, adding that they carry warheads capable of maneuvering in order to evade the defenses. The Zionist paper added that the Israeli defenses will never be capable of intercepting the Yemeni missiles, calling on the Israeli officials to acknowledge this fact. Zionist affairs expert at Al-Manar TV, Hasan Hejazi, underlined the case of chaos and disturbance in the Zionist entity because of the Yemeni missile strikes, despite the Israeli claims about possessing sophisticated systems. Minister of Transportation and Public Works in the Sanaa government, Mohammed Ayyash Qahim, announced on Saturday the resumption of work at the ports of Hodeidah and Salif in western Yemen. Qahim, during a press conference from the port of Hodeidah, warned of the consequences of the occupation's insistence on targeting the port of Hodeidah, threatening to target its vital and military headquarters, saying, 'They will regret it.' A series of Israeli strikes had targeted Sanaa, and a port city in Yemen early on Thursday, shortly after a missile was fired from the Arab country at Tel Aviv.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2295471	2024-12-21T13:04:14-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-03917190017348150068.jpg

He emphasized that all movements of hostile groups are under the surveillance and decisive action will be taken with judicial support when necessary. Feizi urged the public to report any suspicious activities to authorities. Sarpol-e Zahab has a population of over 90,000 and shares more than 48 kilometers of border with Iraq. Takfiri groups have historically been active in the area.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2295372	2024-12-21T08:59:03-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/11/manar-084450100166766656210.jpg
Gaza Ceasefire Deal Faces Quagmire of Political Hurdles	Numerous sources over the past week have reported en masse a cautious optimism over the finalization of a ceasefire deal in Gaza, putting a final end to the ruthless 14-month Israeli genocidal war waged on the strip after the heroic 'Al-Aqsa Flood' operation on the 7th of October, 2023. This would not, however, be the first time the deal approached finalization only for hopes to vanish over varying disagreements or political pressure. This current round of negotiations faces similar and new obstacles as well. According to the ‘Israeli’ Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, estimates from sources familiar with negotiation details said that the deal in Gaza is close, but 'it is not a matter of days, but of weeks,' and there is still controversy between the parties about the identity and number of captives held with Hamas, their classification, and the identity of Palestinian prisoners set to be released as part of the swap deal. An Israeli official familiar with the negotiations told the newspaper on Friday: 'Israel and Hamas are closer than ever to a deal, and both sides are working seriously, or pretending to be, but they are working under a deadline, which is (US President-elect Donald) Trump’s entry into the White House (on January 20). Whether it is a matter of real or imaginary pressure, the common denominator among all parties involved seems to be that the time has come, and this must be finished.' The official explained that despite these understandings, there are still some 'mediocre disagreements' related mainly to the identity and number of those released, among those detained by Hamas, or Palestinian prisoners in occupation prisons. The Israeli paper also described the controversy regarding the designation of releasing Israeli captives under 'humanitarian' justifications, which prioritizes the sick, elderly, women and children to be released first as part of the deal. The controversy lies in the ambiguity surrounding the medical state of the captives and who of them are sick, healthy, or even could be counted among the sick, and what this could mean for the release of detained soldiers. High-Profile Palestinian Prisoners The second obstacle, which is causing massive rifts in the Zionist political wings, is the issue of the Palestinian prisoners, the total number to be released, and their identities. The Associated Press (AP) reported on Thursday that Hamas’ demands for prisoner release include high-profile names such as Marwan Barghouti. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing coalition includes hardliners who oppose such releases, with some even pledging to quit the government if too many concessions are made. Many of these hardliners point to the 2011 prisoner release which included the freeing of Martyr Yahya Al-Sinwar, who is believed to be the architect of the 'Al-Aqsa Flood' attack. Two-phase Deal For its part, Hebrew newspaper 'Haaretz' reported that a weak point of the deal lies in the likely intention to divide it into two stages, adding that the mediators believe they will succeed in applying pressure on Netanyahu’s coalition, meaning that once implementation of the first stage begins, Netanyahu will find it difficult to retrace his steps or go back on his word. The Israeli coalition cannot afford for the deal to fall apart during the transitional period between the two phases, which will lead to renewing the war and leaving the remaining detainees in captivity in the Gaza Strip, according to the Israeli daily. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu leading a cabinet meeting in occupied Al-Quds (October 7, 2024). The Israeli government will not be able to withstand the pressure that will be exerted on it, whether from abroad or from within Israeli society, it added. Haaretz remarked, through the words of its military analyst Amos Harel, that the failure of the negotiations in the second part lies in understanding the considerations of the negotiating parties. The decisive matter for Hamas is an end to the war and a complete withdrawal of the occupation army forces from the Gaza Strip, but it may agree to concede in the first phase, and accept a partial presence of the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip in the first phase, during which the designated captives (the sick, women, children, and the elderly) among others will be released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. 'But Netanyahu,' Harel continued, 'and certainly his far-right partners in the government, do not want the war to end and may find it difficult to pay the high price that Hamas will demand for the release of the remaining soldiers and civilians (along with the return of the dead captives’ bodies).' For the families of the remaining abductees, this would be a disaster,' Harel said. 'It is no secret that the prime minister depends, for his political survival, on his right-wing partners, and their opposition to concessions over the past year has been the main obstacle to the deal in Gaza.' Under these circumstances, it is expected that negotiations may reach another dead end and the war will resume, the Israeli analyst concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2295317	2024-12-21T06:11:54-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/07/manar-08474550017211428969.jpeg

‘Israel’ Expands Occupation, Controls Water Resources in Southern...	In a blatant violation of international law, Israeli occupation forces have expanded their presence in southern Syria, seizing control of three vital water bodies and additional territory in the region. According to reports, the Israeli occupation forces have advanced approximately 9 kilometers eastward of the town of Sayda, occupying the Saharan al-Julan Dam and two other crucial water sources in southwestern Syria. Several nearby villages, including Arab al-Sudi, Shabraq, Sihyun, and Nofa, have also fallen under the control of the Israeli occupation. Furthermore, the buffer zone to the east of the occupied Golan Heights has been completely seized by the Israeli regime, as well as the mountaintop of Mount Hermon. In total, Israeli media outlets have confirmed that over 370 square kilometers of Syrian territory have been occupied in recent days. This land grab comes amidst a series of unprovoked aerial assaults by ‘Israel’, which have significantly degraded Syria's strategic military capabilities, including its air defense systems and missiles. The Israeli attacks were launched following the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad by armed opposition groups on December 8th.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2293700	2024-12-19T00:00:10-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-00777770017338147474.jpg

Palestinian Resistance Heroically Kills Number of Israeli Soldier...	On the 439th day of the barbaric Zionist war on the besieged Gaza Strip, the Palestinian Resistance fighters are still showing unprecedented valor, bravery, and steadfastness in the battlefield.

Al-Qassam Brigades also detonated a Zionist troop carrier with a 'Shawaz' explosive device near the Martyr Imad Aql Mosque east of Jabalia camp, in northern Gaza. Moreover, one of Al-Qassam fighters managed to kill an Israeli soldier next to a Merkava tank, seize his weapon, and throw two hand grenades into the tank west of Beit Lahia, north of the Gaza Strip. For its part, the military wing of the Islamic Jihad Movement, Al-Quds Brigades, announced bombarding the Israeli soldiers and vehicles in central Jabalia camp with mortar shells. Al-Quds Brigades also announced seizing a Zionist reconnaissance drone during its intelligence mission over Rafah city in the southern Gaza Strip.

The commander, who refused to disclose his name, said in a statement on Wednesday that 'the indirect negotiations in Doha resolved the thorny points in the file of Palestinian prisoners with high sentences who are scheduled to be included in the exchange deal,' noting that '90% of this file has been resolved and there are still some simple notes.' Hamas commander pointed out that 'it can be said that we are about to announce reaching a real agreement unless any new demands or notes are added by the Israeli occupation government,' noting that 'the discussion of the proposed vision has been completed and understandings have been reached regarding all of its provisions.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2293469	2024-12-18T15:35:40-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-03760560017345649197.png
Iran FM Calls for Israel’s Immediate Withdrawal from Occupied Ter...	Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has called for an immediate withdrawal of the Israeli regime from the occupied territories in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria. Addressing a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Developing Eight Organization for Economic Cooperation (D-8) in Cairo on Wednesday, Araghchi reiterated Iran’s position on Israeli acts of aggression in the region. He also said in his speech that Iran would support any initiative that improves the economic sustainability in D-8 countries and helps their people cope with shocks caused by regional and international developments. 'The D-8 Special Summit on Situation in Palestine and the Lebanon here tomorrow will be the latest testament of our brotherly countries to our continued joint commitment to fraternity, peace, dialogue, justice and rule of law across the region and the world, as envisaged in the D-8 Charter.' 'The international community has embarrassingly failed to stop acts of aggression, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide by the Zionist regime,' he added, 'This is largely attributed to the political, military, intelligence and financial support by the US administration to Israel.' 'The Special D-8 Summit tomorrow will hopefully send a strong message to the world that the Israeli aggressions and violations in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria shall be ended immediately; the Zionist regime and its allies shall be held accountable for their acts; a permanent ceasefire shall be established in Gaza to allow unhindered access of People of Gaza to humanitarian assistance; the Palestine Cause and the right of Palestinians to self-determination shall be realized; any attempt for land annexation by Israel shall be prevented; the Israeli forces shall immediately withdraw from occupied territories in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria; and last but not the least, that D-8 countries are prepared to support Palestine and Lebanon to address economic and related challenges and problems resulted from the current situation.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2293381	2024-12-18T11:06:14-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-00152650017345487513.jpg
Ceasefire Monitoring Committee Fails to Stop Israeli Blatant Viol...	The committee tasked to monitor the ceasefire in South Lebanon held on Wednesday, December 18, its second meeting at the UNIFIL headquarters in Naqoura town. Representatives of the Lebanese Army, US, France, UNIFIL and the Zionist enemy convened to discuss the blatant Israeli violations of the truce which took into effect on November 27. 'UNIFIL hosted the meeting, with the United States serving as chair, assisted by France, and joined by the LAF and IOF,' the U.S. and French embassies and UNIFIL said in a joint statement after the meeting, adding that 'the committee will continue to meet in this format regularly and coordinate closely to support implementation of the ceasefire agreement and UNSCR 1701.' The statement failed to highlight the ongoing Israeli violations of the ceasefire, disregarding any practical steps to stop them. In this context, the Israeli occupation forces continued wiping out houses in Naqoura town hosting the meeting of the committee, which underlines the enemy's insistence on the violations. For the third consecutive day, Israeli bulldozers continued the operations of demolishing houses and scraping houses in the town of Naqoura in southern Lebanon, where they have deliberately damaged the infrastructure in the southern village on the border with occupied Palestine. الجرافات الاسرائيلية المعادية تواصل عمليات التجريف و الهدم في بلدة الناقورة لليوم الثالث على التوالي pic.twitter.com/Ei4zOxNqhm — قناة المنار (@TVManar1) December 18, 2024 The Israeli enemy also detonated several houses and destroyed forests in Kfarkila border town, demolishing a house and a Mosque in Bani Hayyan town.

'Not yet, but not much time has passed since our request for an agreement was sent,' he noted.

This information has not yet been officially confirmed.

‘Israel’ Eyes Open-ended Occupation of Syrian Territory	It seems that the Zionist entity, whose appetite for expansionism has risen, is planning for an open-ended occupation in Syria, with Zionist officials making remarks on long-term military control of the territory seized by the occupation army just after the fall of former president Bashar Al-Assad’s government in Syria. Meanwhile, the Israeli occupation military carried out more incursions on Wednesday in the country’s south, outside the buffer zone, which was established in 1974. Syrian media reported on Wednesday that the Israeli occupation forces raided the towns of Saida Al-Golan and Saida Al-Hanout south of Quneitra in the occupied Golan. دبابات وآليات إسرائيلية تدخل قرية صيدا بالجولان#الجزيرة_سوريا pic.twitter.com/6iqr73RmzF — قناة الجزيرة (@AJArabic) December 18, 2024 After deploying more forces and vehicles in the area, the occupation forces raided houses in these two towns and carried out inspections, according to local media.

Israeli Channel 12 reported that the 'Israeli army received orders from PM Netanyahu to stay in Mount Hermon till the end of 2025.' Earlier on Tuesday, Netanyahu said ‘Israel’ would remain inside the buffer zone, 'until another arrangement can be found that guarantees Israel’s security'. 'We will stay &#8230; until another arrangement is found that ensures Israel’s security,' said Netanyahu who had traveled to the buffer zone on Tuesday with Defense Minister Israel Katz. Netanyahu made the comments from the summit of Mount Hermon — the highest peak in the area — inside Syria, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border with the Israel-held Golan Heights. The Israeli premier said he had been on the same mountaintop 53 years ago as a soldier. An Israeli army vehicle transports soldiers into the buffer zone in the occupied Golan Heights (December 18, 2024 / image by AFP). Israel seized a swath of southern Syria along the border with the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights days after Assad was ousted by rebels last week. Israel’s capture of the buffer zone, a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) demilitarized area in Syrian territory, has sparked condemnation, with critics accusing Israel of violating a 1974 ceasefire and possibly exploiting the chaos in Syria in the wake of new events in Syria to make a land grab. The buffer zone between Syria and the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights was created by the U.N. after the 1973 Mideast war. A UN force of about 1,100 troops had patrolled the area since then.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2293194	2024-12-18T06:34:31-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-091914000173453238010.jpg

Imam Khamenei: It’s ‘Israel’ That Will Be Eradicated, Not the Res...	Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei has dismissed the belief held by the US, the Zionist regime, and a few of their allies that resistance will cease, stating that the one who will be eradicated is Israel. Addressing a meeting with a group of Iranian women on Tuesday, five days before the birth anniversary of Lady Fatimah (AS), the daughter of prophet Mohammad (PBUH), which marks Mother's Day in Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei stressed the importance of fighting the temptations, mischievous measures and soft war of the enemies planned deviate women from the values. He emphasized that issues related to women are among the critical concerns that Muslims should address. The enemies of Iran have not remained idle and are busy hatching plots, he said, adding that they soon realized that the Islamic Revolution could not be defeated with hardware methods, so they resorted to software methods. The soft methods of the enemies included temptations and dishonesty in their slogans, such as defending women and starting riots under the pretext of defending a group of women or a woman in a country, he stated. Referring to the recent developments in Syria and the continuation of the Zionist regime's crimes in Gaza and Lebanon, he said that the the path of the martyrs of the resistance continues and the people of Gaza and Lebanon are standing against the Zionists' daily attacks. The Israeli regime is trying to besiege and eradicate Hezbollah forces through Syria, but the one who will be eradicated is Israel, he added. Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and Yahya Sinwar lost their bodies, but their thoughts remain, and their path continues. Gaza is under attack on a daily basis, and people are being martyred. But they stand firm and keep resisting. Lebanon continues to resist, the Supreme Leader said. Commenting on the different views on the issue of women in the world, he said that by having the effective media, capitalism and its politicians hypocritically hide their criminal and corrupt motives to interfere with the affairs of the women globally and acquire illegitimate benefits under the guise of philosophical and humanitarian theories. He said that it was necessary for the Islamic charter on women affairs to be explained for the general public to have a better understanding of the logic of Islam in this regard. The Supreme Leader termed the issue of marriage as the first important principle in the charter of women in Islam, adding that according to several verses of Holy Qur'an, a man and a woman are equal and complete each other. Saying that Islam has emphasis on 'hijab, chastity, and outfit', he commented that today's indecencies in the West are relatively new, and the descriptions of European women in the literary works of two or three centuries ago show that there were very careful in this regard in the West as well. Iranian women have been able to protect the identity, culture and historical traditions of the country with their modesty, and chastity, he said. Ayatollah Khamenei criticized the claim of defending women by starting a disturbance in a country as an example of the false slogans of ill-wishers. He urged girls, women, professors, students and the entire society of women to stand against the temptations, insidious methods, and soft war tactics of ill-wishers aimed at deviation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2292765	2024-12-17T10:25:19-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-036430900173445991210.jpg

Iran Says Reopening of Damascus Embassy on Agenda	Iran is considering plans to reopen its embassy in Damascus, the spokesperson for the Iranian Foreign Ministry said, without giving a precise date. In comments at a press conference on Tuesday, Esmaeil Baqaei said Iran has put plans to reopen its embassy in Damascus on the agenda.

Iran closed its embassy in Damascus after it was stormed by armed militants last week following the fall of the government of Bashar al-Assad.

Iran was not seeking to expand its boundaries or revive the past empires by acting in Syria, Baqaei added, noting that Iran was only trying to assist Syria in protecting the security of its people against terrorism. 'We were not in Syria to support a specific person or group. What mattered to us to the very last moments (before the fall of Assad) was to help maintain Syria’s territorial integrity. We believe that the security of regional countries will guarantee security in West Asia,' he added.

Trump Blasts Biden’s Permission to Use US Weapons for Strikes ins...	US President-elect Donald Trump attacked the current US leader Joe Biden's move to allow deeper missile strikes inside Russia as wrong and stupid. 'I don't think they should have allowed missiles to be shot 200 miles into Russia. I think that was a bad thing,' he said at his first news conference since the election win. 'That did a lot of bad things.' 'I don't think that should have been allowed,' Trump went on to say, speaking at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. 'Certainly not just weeks before I take over.' 'I thought it was a very stupid thing to do,' he continued. The president-elect said he wasn’t asked to weigh in on the decision. Trump said he would have acted differently and could reconsider the decision when he takes office.. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov earlier said Trump's statement about the peril of using US long-range ATACMS missiles for deeper strikes inside Russia is fully in line with Moscow's position. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on November 21 that the US and its NATO allies had announced authorizing the use of longer-range weapons. Following the announcement, US and UK missiles attacked Russian targets in the Kursk and Bryansk regions, according to the president. Russia responded by firing its newest Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile with a non-nuclear warhead at a Ukrainian defense industry plant called Yuzhmash in the city of Dnepr, Putin said. The Russian president said the West could bring upon itself heavy consequences, should its inflammatory policies prompt further escalation of the conflict.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2292116	2024-12-16T13:21:31-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/08/manar-00172640016292705974.jpg
Prisoner Swap Deal with Hamas Closer than Ever: Katz	Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz stated on Monday that 'Israel' is closer than ever to reaching a prisoner swap deal with Hamas. In his remarks, Katz confirmed that 'the potential exchange deal is expected to gain majority support in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.' A Hamas official noted 'unprecedented progress in the negotiations regarding the Gaza ceasefire and prisoner release. However, the final decision rests with Netanyahu,' as reported by the Israeli news site Ynet. 'Despite the progress, disagreements remain over the number of prisoners to be released as part of the deal,' the official revealed, noting that 'both sides have yet to agree on which prisoners will be freed.' This issue has seen multiple rounds of mediation over the months, involving Qatar, Egypt, and the United States, raising hopes for an agreement to end the conflict in the Gaza Strip. However, these hopes have since faded. The occupation's insistence on maintaining a military presence in the enclave has been a major obstacle to the mediators' efforts and has impeded the progress of talks. As of now, approximately 100 Israeli prisoners remain held in Gaza since October 7, 2023, with Israeli estimates suggesting that half of them have perished. Meanwhile, thousands of Palestinians have been held in Zionist prisons for years.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2292050	2024-12-16T10:41:47-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-05414040017322736387.jpg

Bashar Al-Assad Says Remained in Damascus Until Last Moment, Cont...	In his first statement following the opposition's takeover of Syria, the former Syrian president, Bashar Al-Assad, clarified that his departure from the country was never planned, nor did he leave during the final hours of combat. He remained in Damascus, fulfilling his duties until the early hours of Sunday, December 8, 2024. 'As terrorism expanded within Damascus, Al-Assad coordinated with Russian allies to relocate to Latakia to oversee military operations. Upon reaching Hmeimim base, he found all frontlines abandoned and the last military positions lost, with escalating attacks on the Russian base itself,' the statement declared. Al-Assad stressed that he never sought personal power but saw himself as leading a national project backed by people who believed in him. He rejected any offers for personal escape, instead standing with his troops on the front lines, facing the enemy directly in the most intense and dangerous combat zones. He maintained that during these events, neither resignation nor refuge was ever an option—only continued resistance against the terrorist assault. He also addressed the international rumors regarding his fate, stating that amidst the terrorist expansion in Syria, false narratives were spread, further fueling the international process of designating the violence as a 'Syrian liberation revolution.' 'In such a critical historical moment for the nation, the truth must have its place. There are important matters that need clarification through a brief statement, but due to the circumstances and the subsequent complete communication breakdown for security reasons, it was not possible to deliver it. These key points do not replace a full account of everything that transpired, which will be shared when the opportunity arises,' Al-Assad concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2291786	2024-12-16T05:57:23-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/03/manar-08822480016802582891-e1680258322831.jpg
Israeli Occupation Forces Exploit Ceasefire to Advance in Naqoura...	In a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement, the border town of Naqoura in southern Lebanon witnessed a series of alarming developments early this morning. Israeli occupation forces carried out successive explosions targeting homes, coupled with a ground incursion into the area. The National News Agency reported that Israeli enemy forces launched demolition operations starting at midnight, targeting homes and key infrastructure in Naqoura. The incursion was accompanied by the use of tanks and heavy weaponry, with residential neighborhoods coming under intense fire from machine guns during the advance. According to Al-Manar correspondent Ali Shoeib, Israeli forces are exploiting the ceasefire to penetrate areas of Naqoura that had previously been inaccessible due to fierce resistance by Hezbollah. This strategy mirrors their earlier expansionist actions in the town of Khiam, aiming to impose new territorial realities on the ground. ⚡️ The scene of exploiting the ceasefire in Al-Khiyam repeats today in Nakoura.Israeli forces are infiltrating neighborhoods they couldn’t enter during clashes, using bombs and machine guns.

Yemeni Official Warns US: Escalation in Yemen Will Open the Gates...	A high-ranking member of Yemen's Ansarullah resistance movement has issued a stern warning to the United States, stating that any escalation of tensions in Yemen will result in the US 'opening the gates of hell' on itself. According to Abdulrahman al-Ahnoumi, the Acting Director of the Yemeni General Corporation for Radio and Television, the US embassy in Aden has 'lined up its mercenaries for war against the Yemeni people,' with the aim of stopping operations supporting Palestinians in Gaza. 'We will target whatever American interests and bases we can, even if they are located somewhere in Africa and the Persian Gulf. Yemen has long made all the necessary preparations for such a purpose,' Ahnoumi said in a post published on his X account. The Ansarullah official emphasized that just as the US previously paid a heavy price for turning its ships and vessels into 'legitimate targets' for the Yemeni Armed Forces due to acts of aggression, it will have to bear a considerable cost if tensions heighten further. Ahnoumi's warning comes as the US and Britain conducted a joint airstrike on targets in Yemen's northern province of Hajjah, amid the Arab country's ongoing maritime operations against vessels linked to ‘Israel’ in the Red Sea. Details on potential casualties or damage from the strikes have not been disclosed. The Yemeni Armed Forces have also targeted locations in the strategic western province of Hudaydah, as the country continues to voice its support for Palestine's struggle against the Israeli occupation. So far, the Israeli regime has killed at least 43,603 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured 102,929 others in Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2291500	2024-12-16T03:50:09-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-02168500017050333731.jpg
