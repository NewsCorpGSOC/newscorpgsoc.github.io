Gaza Under Siege: Israel’s Relentless Assault on Palestinian Live...	As the Israeli military's aggression against the besieged Gaza Strip continues unabated, a devastating toll is being extracted on the Palestinian people. In the central Gaza region, five Palestinians were martyred and many more were injured in the latest Israeli bombardment of several homes in the Nuseirat refugee camp. Palestinian media outlets reported the arrival of three martyrs and a number of wounded individuals at the al-Awda Hospital after the Israeli occupation forces shelled the Al-Assar family's residence in Nuseirat's Camp 5.

Simultaneously, Israeli airstrikes pounded the northwestern area of the camp. Further east, in the town of Deir al-Balah, an Israeli airstrike targeted the Wadi al-Salqa area. The onslaught also claimed the life of a woman in the al-Rahma neighborhood, to the west of the new camp in Nuseirat, as rescue teams were unable to reach her due to Israeli obstruction. lsraeli occupation forces force a Palestinian woman to evacuate her house in Northern Gaza Strip and then shoot her in the legs. pic.twitter.com/K5mPZV2GSB — TIMES OF GAZA (@Timesofgaza) November 2, 2024 The cruelty of the Israeli occupation forces knows no bounds, as they even deliberately targeted emergency medical crews who were in the process of recovering the bodies of those killed and treating the injured in the northern area of the Nuseirat camp.

A recent large-scale attack on the Beit Lahia project claimed the lives of 117 Palestinians, the majority of whom were women and children.

Further south, the Resistance also targeted sites in the occupied Umm al-Rashrash, or Eilat, region along the Red Sea coast. The final two operations struck at the heart of the central occupied territories, demonstrating the Resistance's ability to reach deep into the enemy's strongholds.

Leader: US and ‘Israel’ Will Receive Jaw-Breaking Response	The Leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, has issued a stark warning to the United States and ‘Israel’, declaring that they will 'definitely receive a teeth-breaking response' for their atrocities. 'The enemies, both the US and the Zionist regime, should know that they will definitely receive a teeth-breaking response for what they are doing against Iran and the resistance front,' he said in a meeting with students on Saturday. 📸 Meeting with students Imam Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, met with a group of students of all ages including university students from across the country in the Imam Khomeini Hussainiyah on Nov. 2, 2024. 🔽 pic.twitter.com/40Ujedtz7t — Khamenei Media (@Khamenei_m) November 2, 2024 Iranian officials have pledged to avenge Israel’s act of aggression targeting two Iranian border cities, Ilam and Khuzestan, as well as central Tehran in the early hours of October 26. 'This is not merely a matter of revenge but a logical action—an approach aligned with religion, ethics, and the Sharia, in accordance with international regulations,' Ayatollah Khamenei said. The Leader made the statements during the occasion to mark the US embassy takeover by Iranian students on November 4, 1979, known as the National Day of the Fight against Global Arrogance. 'We are certainly doing everything necessary to prepare the Iranian nation to stand against arrogance, whether in terms of military readiness, armaments, or political actions, and thank God, our officials are currently engaged in this,' the Leader said. The overall movement of the Iranian people and the country’s officials, he said, is 'definitely and justly aimed at confronting global arrogance and the criminal apparatus that rules today’s world order. Rest assured, there will be no negligence in this regard.' 'The Iranian people and the country’s officials will not hesitate or neglect this course. Rest assured.' He also referenced the US embassy takeover, saying it was not merely a site for diplomatic and intelligence activity, but rather the headquarters of plotting to destroy the Islamic Revolution. Iranian students took over the embassy in Tehran, also known in Iran as the 'Den of Espionage,' less than a year after the Islamic Revolution toppled the US-backed Pahlavi dictatorship in 1979. Every year on the 13th day of the Iranian month of Aban, the Iranian nation, particularly the students, commemorate the event by staging rallies across the country, calling on all Muslims and freedom-seeking nations to resist against arrogant powers and not to succumb to their bullying. 'For the Iranian nation, inspired by Islamic teachings, standing up against oppression is a duty. Confronting arrogance is a duty. Arrogance means comprehensive economic, military, and cultural domination and the humiliation of nations,' Ayatollah Khamenei noted. He added that the Iranian people had been humiliated for years and, therefore, will certainly continue their struggle against global arrogance. Imam Khamenei emphasized that the Iranian nation's rational, wise, and logical movement, aligned with human, Islamic, and international principles in confronting arrogance, must continue. 'The continuation of the Iranian nation’s path in confronting arrogance requires knowledge, thought, technology, and a roadmap,' the Leader said. Imam Khamenei also touched on longstanding US enmities toward the Iranian nation, saying, 'The effort of historians who distort facts is to claim that the conflict between Iran and the United States began on November 4, 1979. This is a lie. The Americans clashed with the Iranian nation from the very start of the Revolution, even from years before, doing everything they could against Iranian nation.' 'American involvement and efforts in Iran were extensive, even before August 19, 1953,' he said, referring to a CIA-orchestrated coup in Iran that overthrew the democratically elected government of Dr. Mohammad Mosaddeq. 'However, the clearest evidence was on August 19. A national, popular government was in power in Iran, but the Americans entered the field, betraying the trust of a government that had naively trusted them. They overthrew that government and established the oppressive rule of the Shah. For many years, the Iranian nation directly experienced America’s enmity.' He said that the Americans staged a coup in Iran, set up SAVAK in the 1950s, and established a center of torture and pressure on fighters and freedom-seekers. So many young people, faithful individuals, and freedom-lovers were either killed, mutilated, or tortured by SAVAK’s criminal agents—the so-called Shah’s intelligence agency, he added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2253880	2024-11-02T04:08:02-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-01044380017305456783.jpg
New Scandal Engulfs Netanyahu after Close Aide Arrested for Alleg...	An aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is one of several suspects arrested for an alleged security breach that involved leaking top secret intelligence, Israeli officials said. The arrests are at the center of what is likely to be the biggest scandal inside the Israeli government since the beginning of the war in Gaza, Axios reported. Whether Netanyahu knew or was involved in the leaks, which appear to be intended to influence Israeli public opinion to support Netanyahu's hardline position about a deal to release hostages being held by Hamas and establish a ceasefire in Gaza. The episode was under a gag order for several days until a judge released some details on Friday. Israeli officials said that a few weeks ago the Israel Army asked the Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency, to open an investigation after a top secret raw intelligence report was leaked to the German tabloid, Bild. The Bild published a story in early September that referred to a document that was allegedly drafted by Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and contained Hamas' strategy about the hostage and ceasefire deal negotiations. A joint investigation by the Shin Bet, the Israeli police and the IOF has led to the arrest of several suspects. The investigation focused on a 'concern of a security breach due to the unlawful provision of classified information' that has put at risk 'sensitive information and intelligence sources, as well as harmed the efforts of achieving the goals of the war in the Gaza Strip,' according to information the judge released for publication on Friday. Netanyahu denied his office was involved. 'No one from the Prime Minister's Office was questioned or arrested,' he said in a statement. He added that there was no leak from the Prime Minister's Office and accused other government bodies, which he didn't name, of leaking classified information. 'Nobody else was questioned. I wonder why,' Netanyahu said. Israeli officials said one of the suspects is Netanyahu's closest aides. The Israeli public broadcaster Kan reported the aide, who worked closely with Netanyahu since the beginning of the war, participated in sensitive security meetings and was exposed to highly classified information even though he failed has security background check. As a result, he didn't have the security clearance needed to work at the Prime Minister's Office and wasn't officially hired by the office. At the same time, he actively advised Netanyahu. According to Axios, the scandal will likely deepen the mistrust and tension between Netanyahu and the IOF and intelligence services, which has been growing since the security failures around the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on 'Israel'. 'It also comes as Netanyahu battles Israel's legal system and the attorney general. In just a few weeks the prime minister is expected to take the stand for the first time in his corruption trial.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2253473	2024-11-01T14:52:13-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2016/09/manar-03504870014730944247.jpg
Iran Fully Capable of Building Nuclear Weapons: Official	Head of Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations Kamal Kharrazi says that the country is fully capable of building nuclear weapons and the only thing preventing this issue is the fatwa issued by the Leader. In an exclusive interview for Al Mayadeen, Kharrazi articulated Iran's stance on regional tensions, emphasizing the nation’s preparedness to respond to any escalation while expressing a desire to avoid further war. He highlighted Iran's military capabilities and the potential for changes in its nuclear policy in response to perceived 'existential threats,' framing the discussion within the broader context of Iran’s geopolitical stance and its commitment to national sovereignty. In this context, Kharrazi emphasized that Iran has showcased its deterrence capabilities through Operation True Promise II, during which it launched hundreds of ballistic missiles on Israel, noting that in the time being, it is up to the Zionists; if they choose to continue their hostile actions, Iran will respond accordingly. In response to questions about potential changes to Iran's nuclear doctrine, Kharrazi indicated that such changes are possible, especially if Iran encounters an 'existential threat'. He asserted that Iran has the technical capabilities to produce nuclear weapons and encounters no significant obstacles in this regard. However, he emphasized that the Fatwa issued by the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei serves as the sole constraint preventing Iran from pursuing nuclear armament. The Iranian official also mentioned that policy changes would apply to projectiles. Kharrazi noted that Iran's missile capabilities are well-known, having been demonstrated in various operations. He stated that the current focus is on the ranges of the missiles used thus far, in which they [the Iranians] have considered the concerns of Western countries. However, Kharrazi maintained that, if Western nations do not acknowledge Iran's concerns, particularly regarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity, Iran then will disregard the concerns of Western countries. Therefore, it is likely that Iran will develop and extend the range of its missiles. Kharrazi addressed the 'unequal' war in the region, telling Al Mayadeen that it is 'led by Israel, which perpetrates ethnic cleansing and the extermination of people,' and is fighting those who are defending their lives, existence, and land. He expressed hope that the war would come to a swift conclusion, asserting that Israel is engaging in 'horrific ethnic cleansing' while mistakenly believing it has achieved victory. Kharrazi emphasized that such actions cannot be perceived as a true victory but rather as a profound violation of human rights. He also highlighted Israel's recent actions in blocking the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) from delivering essential supplies, stating that the agency 'wants to provide water and food to the besieged people of Gaza, but they have been blocked from doing so.' He emphasized that this move represents 'the climax of anti-humanitarian values.' He called on the international community to 'wake up and exert pressure on Israel,' adding, 'Unfortunately, we still see the West, including European countries and the United States, continue to support such a brutal and criminal entity and defend its actions by funding it and sending weapons.' Kharrazi concluded that the implications of the situation and its eventual outcome are evident: the will of the people and their Resistance cannot be suppressed. He asserted that both the Palestinians and Lebanese are steadfast in their determination to resist, endure this oppression, and confront these atrocities until victory is achieved. Within the context of ceasefire negotiations, Kharrazi emphasized that Iran does not intervene, asserting that it is the Lebanese and Palestinians' right to negotiate and reach a ceasefire deal. Moreover, he affirmed his country's support for any decision the countries make. The Iranian official added that Iran remains committed to its previous agreements, provided that the other party also upholds its commitments. He expressed disappointment that the opposing side has not adhered to their obligations and, instead of engaging in negotiations, continues to impose sanctions on the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Iranian official also discussed Iranian-Russian relations and broader regional dynamics, telling Al Mayadeen that Russia and China are 'seeking to build a new international system to free themselves of Western dominance,' an objective Iran upholds. He emphasized that emerging powers, including Iran, should play a prominent role in shaping a new world order that promotes more democratic governance, away from Western colonialism. Kharrazi clarified that the steps taken so far within the frameworks of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BRICS, and the New Development Bank all align with this vision. He pointed out that Iran is a member of these organizations and is actively working toward establishing a new world order. He also highlighted that the agreement between Iran and the Russian Federation is ready and it encompasses all aspects of bilateral relations and cooperation. Kharrazi noted that the agreement was originally scheduled to be signed during the recent BRICS meeting in Kazan, Russia, but the Russians preferred to finalize it during a bilateral visit to emphasize its significance, which will occur soon. Kharrazi explained that all neighboring countries are aware of Iran's strategic policy and are currently moving in that direction. He acknowledged that those who may not be pleased with this approach may resort to disseminating biased media narratives that do not serve regional interests.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2253451	2024-11-01T12:21:00-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2018/01/manar-06632340015163625584.jpg
Speaker Berri: ‘Israel’ Rejected Lebanon’s Ceasefire Roadmap, Gaz...	The Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri indicated that the Israeli enemy's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the ceasefire roadmap adopted by the Lebanese government in agreement with the US presidential envoy Amos Hochstein. Netanyahu obliterated the latest ceasefire opportunity in Lebanon, Speaker Berri said in an interview with the Saudi newspaper, Asharq Al-Awsat. Speaker Berri noted that the political endeavor aimed at concluding a ceasefire in Lebanon had been postponed till after the US presidential elections, adding that the battlefield would have its say and voicing its concerns and fears of Gaza scenario recurrence in Lebanon. Hochstein promised to contact us in case of observing positive indications during his meetings in Tel Aviv, Speaker Berri said, adding that the US envoy left without telling us about the results of his visit to the occupation entity. Speaker Berri reiterated Lebanon's commitment to the implementation of the UN Resolution 1701 without any amendment. Meeting with Force Commander of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), Major General Aroldo Lazaro, Speaker Berri stressed that 'Israel' has wasted, at least since last September, more than one tangible opportunity to cease fire, implement Resolution 1701, restore calm and return the displaced persons on both sides of the border.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2253264	2024-11-01T10:45:59-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-00377440017304830087.jpg

Mikati: ‘Israel’ Rejects Ceasefire, Evacuation Warnings Additiona...	Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati accused the Zionist entity on Friday of rejecting any ceasefire with Lebanon or any commitment to the UN Resolution 1701. In a meeting with UNIFIL Head of Mission and Force Commander Lt. Gen. Aroldo Lázaro at the Grand Serail, the acting Lebanese premier condemned the expansion of Israeli attacks, saying they signaled a Tel Aviv’s refusal to engage in truce efforts. 'The Israeli enemy's renewed expansion&#8230; and its renewed targeting of Beirut’s Dahiyeh with destructive raids are all stark indicators that confirm the Israeli enemy's rejection of all efforts being made to secure a ceasefire,' he said. Lebanon PM Najib Mikati in a meeting with UNIFIL's Lt. Gen. Aroldo Lázaro at the Grand Serail (November 1, 2024) Mikati denounced the Israeli regime’s evacuation warnings for Baalbek and the southern city of Tyre as an additional war crime. Meanwhile, he condemned the Israeli assaults on UNIFIL and the threats directed at its personnel, commending 'the determination of many friendly nations to support the continuation of UNIFIL’s work in south Lebanon.' Mikati insisted on the need to preserve the tasks and operational protocols assigned to UNIFIL, which are executed in close cooperation with the Lebanese Army. The Lebanese PM further reaffirmed Lebanon's ongoing commitment to the United Nations resolution and its provisions, asserting that 'Israeli statements and the diplomatic signals received by Lebanon reflect the enemy's obstinacy in rejecting proposed solutions and its insistence on a path of killing and destruction. This places the entire international community before its historical and moral responsibilities to stop this aggression.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2252923	2024-11-01T04:58:37-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-07260790017286522724.jpg

Daring Drone Strikes: Iraqi Resistance Attacks 6 Israeli Targets ...	The Islamic Resistance in Iraq announced that its fighters conducted seven long-range drone attacks on Israeli targets across occupied territories on Thursday. The operations, carried out from dawn until midnight, utilized one-way attack drones to strike vital infrastructure in the occupied Syrian Golan as well as targets in northern, central, and southern Israeli-occupied areas. Two of the attacks targeted strategic sites in the occupied Golan, while the remaining strikes were spread throughout the occupied Palestinian and Lebanese territories. The northern attacks reportedly hit areas in al-Jalil, while the southern strikes focused on the occupied town of Umm al-Rashrash (Eilat) on the Red Sea coast. The Iraqi Resistance factions vowed to continue these operations in support of Palestine and Lebanon, promising that the attacks will only continue to escalate. In a follow-up announcement on Friday, the Resistance reported launching three additional drone strikes on vital targets in southern occupied Palestine, as well as two more attacks in the Golan region, in the wake of increased Israeli air defenses over Eilat overnight.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2252692	2024-11-01T02:03:15-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-03950240017304517901.jpg
Islamic Resistance Operations Room: Fronts Are Being Securely Sup...	The Islamic Resistance Operations Room issued a statement which summarizes the latest developments of the battle against the Israeli occupation army, confirming inflicting heavy losses upon the enemy troops in the border villages and within the occupied Palestinian territories. Regarding that the ground confrontation, the statement indicated that the Israeli occupation forces tried to advance into several positions, yet faced a firm resistance. The Israeli military units attempted to advance into Shihin and Al-Jebbin villages as well as Wadi Hamoul area as the Resistance fighters repelled them and forced them to withdraw into Labbouneh area, according to the field summary. The statement added that the Resistance fighters bombed the IOF gatherings in Ramya-Aita Shaab-Aitaroun axis, amid Zionist attempts to advance towards central Aitaroun and Aita Al-Shaab. The Israeli enemy refrained from advancing in the area between Blida and Houla due to the heavy losses inflicted by the Resistance upon its occupation soldiers last week, according to the statement. The Islamic Resistance also confronted an Israeli attempt to advance troops from Kfar Kila towards Tal Al-Nahas, killing or injuring a number of Israeli officer and soldiers, the statement read. The statement pointed out that the resistance fighters confronted Zionist attempts to advance towards the outskirts of Kfarchouba area in order to control the heights, repelling an attempt to advance troops into the southeastern sides of Khiam town. The rocketry force of the Resistance continued bombarding the Israeli border sites and barracks as well as the bases in the northern cities of occupied Palestine with various types of missiles and ranges which reach Tel Aviv suburbs, carrying out 655 launch operations so far, including 63 during the past 3 days, according to the statement. The statement noted that the Islamic Resistance has launched more than 170 drones since September 17, 2024, hitting various targets, including the southern suburbs of Tel Aviv. According to the statement, the Islamic Resistance has fired 20 surface-to-air missiles at Zionist war jets and drones since September 17, 2024. The statement highlighted that, since the beginning of the 'ground maneuver', has lost 95 soldiers and officers, adding that more than 900 of others were injured. The Operations Room highlighted that the Islamic Resistance has so far destroyed 42 Merkava tanks, 4 military bulldozers, 2 Hummer vehicles, an armored vehicle, and an armored personnel carrier and downed 3 Hermes 450 and one Hermes 900 drones. The statement noted that the above-mentioned losses do not include those inflicted upon the Zionist settlements, bases, barracks, and sites within occupied Palestine. Finally, the statement noted that: The enemy forces avoid moving and positioning within the fields of vision of the Resistance fighters for fear of being targeted. They create invisible crossings and paths and rely on infiltrating at night into the border villages and withdrawing from them after destroying civilians' homes and sabotaging the infrastructure. The supply lines to the front and the axes of engagement have not been disrupted since the beginning of the aggression on Lebanon, and the fronts are still being supplied with weapons and the necessary equipment according to the plans prepared in advance. Despite the enemy's full intelligence control of the skies of the south, the resistance fighters are still able to position, arm and launch hundreds of rocket barrages towards enemy soldiers' positions deep inside the entity on a daily and continuous basis, round the clock. This is confirmed by the videos published by the war media. The enemy has not been able to thwart any launching operation from Lebanese territory. The Islamic Resistance continued on Thursday heroically fighting the elite units of the Israeli occupation army near Lebanon border, inflicting heavy losses upon the enemy troops.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2252527	2024-10-31T16:31:31-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-01168670017304174405.jpg
Sayyed Houthi: Hezbollah Resilience Shocked Israeli Enemy	Head of Yemen's Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Houthi stressed Thursday that over a month of ground aggression on southern Lebanon has revealed the tremendous resilience of the Lebanese Resistance, contrary to the enemy’s expectation of an easy conquest. In a televised speech, Sayyed Houthi maintained that the Israeli enemy is shocked by the resilience of Hezbollah fighters and has suffered significant losses and repeated defeats. 'The Israeli enemy, in its ground aggression on Lebanon, is defeated in every aspect, suffering around a thousand casualties, though they keep this concealed.' Houthi added that, despite heavy firepower, the Israeli enemy has clearly failed to achieve any field breakthroughs in its ground aggression on Lebanon, noting that the enemy finds itself in a genuine dilemma in its ground assault on Lebanon. The enemy attempted to modify its tactics f used in the July 2006 aggression by using infiltration forces and few armored vehicles, but failed, he stressed. Any tactic the Israeli enemy employs in the ground aggression on Lebanon results in significant losses and ends in failure, he added. 'The ground battle in southern Lebanon presents a true opportunity, as the enemy relied on air force to kill from a distance and then flee.' Houthi maintained that the operation targeting the criminal Netanyahu in his bedroom was impactful and effective, adding tha Hezbollah’s operations have forced millions of occupying Zionists to spend most of their time in shelters, living in fear and terror without enjoying a normal life. 'The Leader congratulated Sheikh Naim Qassem upon his appointment as Secretary-General of Hezbollah, describing him as a distinguished leader and one of the party's prominent founders. We in Yemen stand by Sheikh Naim Qassem, alongside our brothers in Hezbollah and the Lebanese people, with all that we can.' 'The increasing performance of our dear brothers, the fighters in Iraq, is noticeable, bringing pride and posing a significant threat to the Israeli enemy,' Houthi said. Yemen’s operations at sea to target ships linked to the 'Israeli,' American, and British enemies continue, with limited movement in the Red Sea, he added. In continuation of the support of the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and resistance against the Israeli oppression, and retaliation to the American-British aggression against Yemen, the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out three military operations as part of the continuation of imposing a naval blockade on the Israeli enemy. 'The targeting of four ships this week was highly significant, and we are working to increase pressure, tracking them to the far east of the Arabian Sea and into the Indian Ocean, God willing. For the first time, Israeli enemy interests have been targeted this way in the Red Sea and Bab El-Mandab over an extended period of more than a year.' Despite their frustration, the Americans are trying to stop the maritime operations through their continuous aggression, Houthi noted. 'The Americans carry out weekly airstrikes and maintain political and economic pressure on our country. The Americans consistently attempt to involve others, particularly the Saudi-Emirati coalition, in escalation to serve the Israeli enemy’s interests.' We continuously monitor American activity against our country and nation, and we are always preparing for any level of escalation, he stressed. The Saudis and others know that their involvement in Yemen and direct alliance with the Americans to support the 'Israeli' enemy would bring disgrace and shame, Houthi affirmed. No one will be able to halt our operations until the aggression is stopped, the siege on Gaza is lifted, and the assault on Lebanon ends, Houthi confirmed. 'The Security Council is a council for the security of the oppressors, not for the weak and oppressed. The so-called courts of justice and criminal courts have done nothing for our nation.' Organizations and institutions claimed to represent our nation have, in reality, caused more harm to our people and forces than they have to the enemy, Sayyed Houthi stressed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2252439	2024-10-31T13:16:32-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-00573720017304057817.jpg

Declaring that they would rather die than enlist in the Israeli military, dozens of ultra-Orthodox demonstrators protest at a military induction center in an attempt to disrupt the drafting of a number of yeshiva students to the occupation army. Israeli occupation security forces work to remove members of the extremist Jerusalem Faction, some of whom tried to lie down in front of buses at the Tel Hashomer base, the Ynet news site reports. 🏴‍☠⚔🏴‍☠ Haredi settlers demonstrate in front of the recruitment headquarters in Tel Hashomer, rejecting their compulsory recruitment and saying: We will die rather than enlist pic.twitter.com/E3x1rUQ4BX — Military Observer (@MilitaryObs2222) October 31, 2024 The protest comes against the backdrop of bitter disagreements in the Knesset over the issue of Haredi enlistment to the Israeli army, after the High Court of Justice ruled in June that there was no longer any legal framework allowing the state to refrain from drafting ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students into compulsory service. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly reassured his ultra-Orthodox coalition partners that his government will advance a bill facilitating sweeping exemptions for Haredi men from mandatory military service. The dispute over the ultra-Orthodox community serving in the military is one of the most contentious in the Zionist entity, with decades of governmental and judicial attempts to settle the issue never achieving a stable resolution. The issue has grown in urgency as the occupation military suffers from a lack of troops and pressure on reservists increases over the past year of war. Ultra-Orthodox Jews protest against the draft (September 29, 2024). A group of Israeli army reservists recently sent on Wednesday a letter to Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi criticizing the continued failure to draft members of the ultra-Orthodox community, a move that they said would have helped reduce the large number of days they have been required to serve since the start of the war in Gaza over a year ago. The letter accused the Israeli military of having 'failed' its reserve soldiers who are frustrated and burnt-out after multiple stints in Gaza, on the northern border, and now in southern Lebanon amid the ongoing ground offensive there. Earlier on Saturday (October 28), Israeli army radio reported that less than four percent of the 3,000 Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) Israelis who received recruitment orders since July to join the military have done so.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2252065	2024-10-31T03:13:12-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-05825860017303694772.jpg

Iran Denies Report on Breach of Iran’s Airspace by Israeli Jets	Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Aziz Nasirzadeh has vehemently rejected media reports that Israeli warplanes violated Iran's airspace during a recent military attack. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, General Nasirzadeh dismissed the rumors, stating that no Israeli fighter jets had entered Iranian airspace on October 26. 'According to the United Nations Charter, whenever the airspace of a country is violated, that country will be entitled to respond to the violation and act of aggression,' the defense minister declared, warning that Iran would not hesitate to retaliate. Nasirzadeh also dismissed reports that a military site in Iran's northern city of Shahrud had been damaged in an alleged Israeli strike from the country's northern borders. He insisted that while the enemy had attempted to target Iran's defense systems, their efforts had failed as Iran had made the necessary civil defense arrangements in advance.

The Islamic Resistance fighters have confronted these attempts across multiple fronts as follows: • First Front: Area of operations of the enemy's 146th Division, extending from Al-Naqoura in the west to Marwahin in the east. The enemy forces made several attempts to infiltrate towards the southern neighborhoods of the villages of Marwahin, Dhayra, Yarin, and Al-Matmura, aiming to rig houses with explosives and destroy them for fear they might be used by the fighters. They also set fire to the forests between the towns of Alma Al-Shaab and Dhayra.

Qualitative Run-Over Operation Shakes Tel Aviv: Six Killed, 50 In...	Six Israelis were killed and dozens injured in a heroic vehicle-ramming incident at the Glilot junction on the outskirts of Tel Aviv on Sunday. Initial reports indicated that a truck collided with a bus stop near the intersection, leading to investigations into the circumstances of the event. Subsequent coverage revealed that the truck also ran over a significant number of Israeli soldiers near a military base in Giladi, heightening concerns about the scale of the incident. A security news website has confirmed that at least 50 settlers, all of whom were Israeli soldiers, were injured when a truck collided with a group of pedestrians at the Glilot Junction near the Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv. This incident preceded the announcement of at least six fatalities. Israeli media reported that 15 of the injured are in critical condition. Israeli Army Radio corroborated this, citing eyewitness accounts that a significant number of those injured were soldiers en route to their military bases. Additionally, the newspaper 'Yedioth Ahronoth' noted that several individuals were trapped under the truck and were in critical condition. The Israeli ambulance service stated that it 'provided first aid to dozens of people involved in the incident,' underscoring the severity of the situation and the high number of injuries resulting from the attack. As usual, to cover up his failure, Itamar Ben Gvir, the Israeli occupation's Minister of National Security, visited the site of the ramming attack in Tel Aviv. Palestinian Resistance Hails Operation The Resistance Committees declared that the run-over operation in Glilot represents a resounding blow and a sharp rebuke to the crumbling and weakened Zionist security and military system. 'We celebrate the heroic run-over operation in Glilot, viewing it as a natural response to the crimes, terrorism, and Zionist war of extermination in Palestine and Lebanon,' the statement read. 'This operation serves as a clear message to the Zionist public: the image of victory that [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu seeks is nothing more than an illusion and a mirage.' The Islamic Jihad Movement extended its congratulations for the heroic operation in Tel Aviv. 'This attack is a natural response to the massacres perpetrated by the Zionist enemy against our steadfast and resilient people, particularly in light of the recent genocidal crimes in northern Gaza,' the resistance said in a statement. 'The resilience and determination of our people are exemplified in the courageous Tel Aviv operation, demonstrating that the Resistance remains active in the West Bank, Gaza, southern Lebanon, Yemen, and Iraq, consistently inflicting pain on the enemy. This confirms that the Resistance retains the initiative and is always prepared to deliver painful strikes to the occupying forces,' it added. The Islamic Jihad Movement asserts that the Resistance, supported by its steadfast people, will continue to confront the enemy’s schemes throughout the occupied Palestinian territories.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2246620	2024-10-27T03:21:43-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-05216210017300244814.jpg

Iran Successfully Confronts Israeli Attack, Says Damage Minimal	Iran’s Air Defense Base declared on Saturday that the Islamic Resistance’s air defenses have successfully confronted Israeli strikes on several targets across three provinces, saying that that the damage inflicted from the attacks was minimal. 'The criminal, illegitimate and fake regime of Israel in a move to escalate tensions launched attacks on some military sites in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam in the early hours of Saturday,' the Iranian Air Defense Base said in a statement. Iran’s air defenses intercepted and successfully confronted the acts of aggression, it said, adding that some limited damage was caused in some areas, the dimensions of which are being investigated. The statement urged the Iranian nation to 'maintain unity and calm and ignore rumors spread by the enemy media.' Loud sounds were heard by some people in the vicinity of Tehran in the wee hours of Saturday, which Iranian security sources said were due to the activation of air defense systems. According to reports, Iranian air defenses successfully shot down adversarial targets in the airspace around Tehran province.

The source added that the action by the Zionists has been taken from outside the Iranian border and has caused limited damages. 'The reports alleging that 100 Israeli military planes have had a role in the strike are also complete lies, as Israel is seeking to overplay its weak attack,' the source added. On the other hand, Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization has announced the resumption of flights after a brief suspension following the Israeli attack. 'Flights will return to normal from 9:00 am (0530 GMT) on Saturday,' the spokesperson of the organization said, according to the official IRNA news agency.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2245289	2024-10-26T00:08:26-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04017570017299264829.jpg

Supreme Leader Issues Condolence Statement on Martyrdom of Hezbol...	The Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Imam Khamenei, issued a statement addressing the dear youth of the Resistance Front, praising the personality of His Eminence, the Head of the Executive Council of Hezbollah in Lebanon, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine (May Allah's blessings be upon him). His Eminence emphasized, 'Hezbollah today remains the strongest defender of Lebanon and the firmest shield against the ambitions of the Zionist entity, which has long sought to dismantle Lebanon.' 'The brave and sacrificing fighter, His Eminence Sayyed Hashem Safieddine (May Allah's blessings be upon him), has joined the ranks of the martyrs of the Resistance. The sky of fight in the path of Sacred Al-Quds is now adorned with a new shining star. His Eminence was one of the most prominent figures in Hezbollah, a steadfast supporter and constant companion of His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Thanks to the wisdom and courage of leaders like him, Hezbollah was able to protect Lebanon from the danger of division and collapse once again and thwart the threat posed by the usurping entity, whose cruel and unjust army sometimes trampled the ground all the way to Beirut. His Eminence's chivalry and sacrifice, alongside the other leaders and fighters in the Axis of Nasrallah, eliminated the danger of the occupation of southern Litani, Tyre, and other cities in that region, and their annexation to the usurped and occupied Palestine. They made the souls, properties, and valuable reputation of Hezbollah enter the battlefield to preserve the sovereignty of Lebanon's territories, foiling the plans of the aggressive and criminal Zionist entity.' While it may appear today that leaders like Nasrallah and Safieddine are absent in this life, their souls and leadership remain present in the field, defending Lebanon and its defenseless people, Imam Khamenei underlined. 'Hezbollah today remains the strongest defender of Lebanon and the firmest shield against the ambitions of the Zionist entity, which has long sought to divide Lebanon. The enemy tries to deny Hezbollah's sacrificial role for Lebanon, but those who care must not allow these false claims shouted by their voices to reach people's ears.' 'Hezbollah is alive and growing stronger, fulfilling its historic role. The Islamic Republic, as always, will continue to support the fighters for Al-Quds and the resistors against the occupation by the criminal and usurping gang of Palestine, by Allah's permission.' I offer my congratulations and condolences on the martyrdom of our dear Sayyed Safieddine to his honorable family, his relatives, and his fellow fighters across all Resistance fronts, Imam Khamenei concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2243551	2024-10-24T13:37:06-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/06/manar-089647100168752915110.jpg

Sayyed Houthi: Resistance in Lebanon, Palestine Surprised Enemies	Head of Yemen's Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Al-Houthi tackled in a televised speech on Thursday the latest developments of the Israeli aggression on Gaza and Lebanon, offering Hezbollah condolences on the martyrdom of Sayyed Hashem Safieddine. Sayyed Houthi underlined the great faith and jihadi contributions of the martyred leader Sayyed Safieddine, pointing that the enemy aims at striking the Umma morale by targeting its leaders. Sayyed Houthi indicated that what the Israeli enemy is doing, including committing crimes of genocide and targeting children and women, is not a military achievement. 'From a military perspective, the Israeli enemy has failed, and its failure is evident in Gaza and on the northern front against Lebanon, as well as in all other fronts.' Arabs are targeted by the Israeli enemy more than anyone else, regardless of how some may ignore or turn a blind eye to these established truths, Sayyed Houthi said. The enemy has encountered the solid front of Hezbollah after expecting that by targeting leaders, it would have the opportunity to control Lebanon, he stressed. According to Sayyed Houthi, the Israeli enemy has resorted to criminal behavior by comprehensively targeting civilians in Lebanon and destroying residential neighborhoods and villages. The Israeli enemy, along with the Americans, is attempting to pressure for a change in the political situation and stance of the Lebanese government and its components, Houthi added. 'The enemy is trying to incite everyone against Hezbollah, portraying it as the problem in Lebanon,' he said, 'The real threat to Lebanon's security, safety, independence, and the freedom of the Lebanese people is the Israeli enemy.' 'The enemy aims, at the very least, for part of Lebanon to be under its control, framed as a security belt, like in the past, and to control the sources of rivers. The experience of the Lebanese people rallying around the Islamic Resistance to achieve victory and repel the Israeli enemy is the available and correct solution.' Sayyed Houthi also noted that the enemy seeks to impose options that serve its interests under the guise of 'the second day in Gaza,' with support from some Arab regimes. 'The Palestinian factions and the Palestinian people will not accept options that serve the Israeli enemy and are aware of the American deception since Al-Aqsa Flood operation.' 'The Americans, in collaboration with the Israelis, are preparing for an aggressive operation against the Islamic Republic of Iran, while sending their Secretary of State to speak about peace and stop escalation.' The American approach is part of a tactic to serve the Israeli position, and our Ummah should not be deceived by the American stance, he warned. Al-Qassam Brigades are inflicting heavy losses on the Israeli enemy, and the martyrdom of Sheikh Sinwar has only increased their determination, inspiration, and steadfastness, Houthi emphasized. 'The impact of the martyrdom of Sheikh Sinwar, may Allah have mercy on him, on both the Palestinian and global levels cannot be erased by the Israeli enemy's attempts to distort the heroic and inspiring stance surrounding his sacrifice.' Al-Quds Brigades and other Palestinian factions stand bravely alongside Al-Qassam Brigades, carrying out daily heroic operations, he added. 'The Lebanese front has established the equation of Yafa (Tel Aviv) and turned Haifa into an abandoned city, with the occupiers spending most of their time in shelters.' The significant jihad operation by Hezbollah, which breached the enemy's defense systems and reached the bedroom of the criminal Netanyahu, has instilled fear in the hearts of all Israeli leaders, Houthi stressed. Meanwhile, the support front in Iraq continues to escalate steadily, unconcerned by media attacks, political pressure from the U.S., and its allies, Houthi noted. 'Our front in Yemen, the land of faith and wisdom, remains steadfast and resilient in the battle of the promised opening and the sacred jihad.' Operations at sea and the bombardment of the Israeli enemy with rockets and drones targeting occupied Palestine continue, Sayyed Houthi confirmed. 'The intense popular activities in Yemen are unparalleled anywhere in the world. We are in a practical path, preparing for any level of escalation the Americans and Israelis may resort to.' The banner of jihad in the way of Allah, carried by our Yemeni people, is high, steadfast, and firmly rooted, he stresed. There is no weakness, fatigue, or defeat, only steadfastness and resilience expressed by the Yemeni people through their positions and sacrifices, demonstrated in their weekly million-strong marches, Sayyed Houthi concluded. In continuation of the support of the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and resistance against the Israeli oppression,and retaliation to the American-British aggression against Yemen, the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out a specific military operation targeting a military base belonging to the Israeli occupation east of the occupied Yaffa area with a hypersonic ballistic missile Palestine 2.

Iraqi Resistance Steps up Attacks against Zionist Entity	Iraqi resistance announced on Thursday more strikes against the Israeli occupation regime, a day after it staged five attacks that hit several targets across the Zionist entity. Islamic Resistance in Iraq said its fighters flew drones that attacked a military target in northern occupied territories. In a statement published early on Thursday, the Iraqi resistance group said the drone strike was 'in support of our people in Palestine and Lebanon, and in response to the massacres committed by the occupying entity against civilians including children, women, and the elderly.' It vowed to continue striking strike strongholds of the enemies at an escalating pace. The group published the following video of the operaion. It was written that the target was Ramat David Base in northern occupied Palestine, with the image of Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah appearing in the footage.

Hezbollah Fighters Kill Over 70 Israeli Soldiers, Injure 600 Othe...	The Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance presented a summary for all the military confrontation with the Zionist occupation army, detailing the achievements of all Hezbollah military units. The Islamic Resistance continued to confront the Israeli aggression against Lebanon, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy’s army in terms of personnel and equipment across the fronts, in addition to its positions deep within occupied Palestine, according to the summary which gave the sufficient details, as follows. 1- Ground confrontations: In recent days, the surrounding areas and some neighborhoods of the front-line villages in southern Lebanon along the Lebanese-Palestinian border have witnessed numerous attempts by the 'Israeli' enemy army to advance toward these villages with the aim of occupying and controlling them. The fighters of the Islamic Resistance are resisting these attempts across multiple fronts as follows: - First Front: The area of operations of the enemy's 146th division, extending from Naqoura in the west to Marwahin in the east. Operations in this sector have been limited to infiltration attempts toward the southern neighborhoods of Marwahin, Al-Dhayra, Yarin, and Alma Al-Shaab, with the intention of rigging houses and blowing them up to prevent their use by the fighters. The fighters of the Islamic Resistance have confronted these attempts, targeting the enemy’s gatherings and lines of advance in Ras Naqoura, Hanita, and the vicinity of Al-Dhayra village. - Second Front: The area of operations of the enemy's 36th division, extending from Ramya in the west to Rmeish in the east (including Aita Al-Shaab), and from Rmeish to Aitaroun in the east. Following the heroic confrontations in the triangle of Aita Al-Shaab - Al-Qawzah - Ramya last week, where the enemy suffered heavy losses at the hands of the Resistance fighters, the enemy attempted in recent days to advance toward the 'Abu Al-Laban' height east of Aita Al-Shaab to occupy it and establish control over the town. The fighters of the Islamic Resistance confronted the enemy’s forces, targeting its gatherings and lines of advance in Khallet Wardeh and the vicinity of Aita Al-Shaab, as well as targeting many troops that infiltrated the area around the municipality building, resulting in casualties, including deaths and injuries. The evacuation operations continued for hours due to repeated resistance attacks. Enemy formations are attempting to advance toward the center of Aitaroun from the eastern and western neighborhoods to occupy it and isolate it from its surroundings. Simultaneously, attempts to advance toward the centers of Maroun Al-Ras and Yaroun are being made from the southern neighborhoods of the two towns. The fighters of the Islamic Resistance are targeting the enemy's gatherings and lines of advance with intense and repeated barrages, inflicting significant losses and hindering their movement, forcing them to retreat to less exposed areas. - Third Front: The area of operations of the enemy's 91st division, extending from Blida in the south to Houla in the north. The enemy’s forces advanced in this sector through concealed paths toward some eastern neighborhoods of Mays Al-Jabal, Mhaibib, and Blida, where they rigged and detonated some houses. The enemy is attempting to advance toward the eastern neighborhoods of Hula amid fierce confrontations with the fighters of the Islamic Resistance. It should be noted that the enemy's actions in rigging and exploding houses in Mhaibib come after its failure to establish control over the town and secure its forces out of fear of resistance attacks. - Fourth Front: The area of operations of the enemy's 98th division, extending from Markaba in the south to the occupied Lebanese village of Al-Ghajar in the east. The enemy attempted to infiltrate into the town of Al-Taybeh from the southern and eastern sides, and the fighters of the Islamic Resistance responded with small arms and rockets, resulting in many fatalities and injuries among the infiltrating force. 2- Rocket Force: The Rocket Force of the Islamic Resistance continues to target enemy concentrations in military sites and barracks along the Lebanese-Palestinian border and in the occupied northern cities and settlements. This targeting is progressively escalating day by day, reaching the enemy's military, strategic, and security bases deep within occupied Palestine using various types of missiles, including precision missiles that are being used for the first time. 3- Air Force: The Air Force of the Islamic Resistance is persistently monitoring and targeting enemy military bases from the Lebanese-Palestinian border to the depths of occupied Palestine using various types of drones, including advanced types that are being used for the first time. 4- Air Defense Unit: The fighters of the Islamic Resistance in the air defense units are responding to 'Israeli' aircraft, both reconnaissance and combat, that are violating Lebanese airspace. They have managed to shoot down four drones. According to the summary, the total losses inflicted on the enemy, as recorded by the fighters of the Islamic Resistance, exceed 70 killed and more than 600 wounded among the officers and soldiers of the 'Israeli' enemy army. 'This includes the destruction of 28 Merkava tanks, four military bulldozers, and several armored vehicles and personnel carriers. Additionally, three drones of the 'Hermes 450' model and one of the 'Hermes 900' model have been shot down.' This tally does not include the losses incurred by the Israeli enemy in the military bases and sites in northern and deep occupied Palestine, the summary concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2241912	2024-10-23T12:29:04-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-08559660017297117333.jpg
In-Depth | The Hidden Motives Behind Hochstein’s Visit and the St...	Zoulfikar Daher The first visit of US envoy Amos Hochstein to Beirut since the outbreak of Israel’s large-scale aggression against Lebanon came approximately three weeks after the Israeli enemy expanded its operations across southern Lebanon, the Bekaa, and even the southern suburbs of Beirut and the capital itself. US special envoy Amos Hochstein speaks to reporters after a meeting with Lebanon's Parliament Speaker in Beirut on October 21, 2024. US special envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut on October 21 to meet Lebanon's PM and Speaker of the House Nabih Berri (Photo by AFP) Prior to his visit, speculation arose about its true purpose: Was Hochstein bringing concrete solutions, or was he simply testing the waters and assessing the political landscape? Some questioned whether he was delivering Israeli demands aimed at pressuring Lebanon into submission. Did this move stem from American initiative alone, or was it coordinated with 'Israel' as part of its efforts to impose terms? Alternatively, could it signal Israel’s realization that the conflict with the resistance is proving more difficult than anticipated, given the losses it has suffered along the Lebanese-Palestinian border? There is a view that the Israeli enemy, recognizing the challenge posed by the resistance, is attempting to de-escalate while still hoping to extract some benefit from its tactical strikes. However, these strikes have done little to alter the situation. The resistance remains steadfast, its retaliation capabilities growing and reaching deeper into Israeli territory, while its capacity to manage the conflict remains strong. Fearing that Israel’s 'achievements' on the ground might slip away, the US administration appears to have dispatched Hochstein to reopen negotiations. The strategy follows a familiar pattern: escalate demands to the maximum in hopes of gaining concessions, all while threatening continued aggression. Simultaneously, Israeli attacks intensified in various areas, particularly in the southern suburbs of Beirut (Dahiyeh). The timing of these escalations, paired with Hochstein’s visit, was no coincidence. 'Israel' aimed to showcase its destructive capabilities, resorting to psychological warfare by targeting buildings associated with the Al-Qard Al-Hassan Association, although these were largely unoccupied. This was intended to send a message to the Lebanese leadership receiving the American envoy. The strikes continued the following night, extending to Al-Awzai and areas near Beirut’s governmental hospital. But the question remains: Can these aggressive moves impose Israel’s conditions on Lebanon? Hochstein reportedly presented amendments to UN Resolution 1701, which included: • Expanding the role of international forces and allowing them to operate without restrictions. • Pushing the resistance several kilometers north of the Litani River, with some reports suggesting as far as the Owali River near Sidon. • Assigning oversight of the resolution’s implementation to US, British, or German forces. • Granting 'Israel' unrestricted access to Lebanese airspace for supervision. These terms essentially aim to hand 'Israel' significant control, leaving Lebanon, its army, people, and resistance with little ability to defend national sovereignty. Some media and political voices have described this proposal as nothing less than a 'surrender document.' However, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri reaffirmed Lebanon’s commitment to Resolution 1701, with no amendments. He emphasized that this is the final opportunity for the US to intervene diplomatically and halt the war. Berri made clear that Lebanon stands united on Resolution 1701, and that 'Israel' must respect it. He anticipated that Hochstein would push Israel’s maximum demands but remained confident that nothing could be imposed on Lebanon. 'Israel' has failed to achieve its objectives on the battlefield, and it will not succeed through diplomacy either. Hochstein’s visit, it seems, was primarily a test of Lebanon’s resolve—an attempt to gauge whether the country, particularly the resistance, might offer concessions under pressure. But Lebanon’s leadership, backed by its steadfast resistance, will not yield. Neither the US, nor the Zionist entity, nor their allies can force Lebanon into submission. Contrary to some perceptions, 'Israel' is not in a position of strength. Those following the situation behind the scenes of Hochstein’s visit might believe 'Israel' can impose its will, but the facts tell a different story. For over three weeks, it has faced setbacks along the border with Lebanon, failing to make significant gains or take control of any Lebanese towns. These developments underscore that the US-Israeli pressure campaign is shallow and ineffective against the united front of Lebanon, its resistance, and its people. Ultimately, the outcome of this conflict will be decided on the battlefield, where the resistance, as emphasized by its leader, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah (may he rest in peace), continues to hold the upper hand. The realities on the ground, both day and night, will shape the political and diplomatic consequences, not the other way around. The battlefield will determine the fate of this war, and indeed, the future of the entire region.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2241791	2024-10-23T11:58:49-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-036995100172970991310.png
Sayyed Nasrallah, Sinwar’s Struggle Altered Fate of Region: Supre...	Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has said the struggle and resilience of resistance figures, such as Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Yahya Sinwar, have fundamentally altered the fate of the region. Ayatollah Khamenei made the remarks in a meeting with organizers of the Congress of 15,000 Martyrs of Fars Province on Wednesday. 'If figures like martyr Sinwar had not emerged to fight until the last moment, or if great leaders like martyr Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah had not combined jihad with wisdom, courage, and sacrifice, the fate of the region would have been different,' he stated. Nasrallah, the longtime leader of Hezbollah, was assassinated in a massive Israeli airstrike in southern Beirut on September 27, while Hamas leader Sinwar was martyred by Israeli occupying forces in Gaza on October 16. Ayatollah Khamenei noted that the Israeli regime’s failure to destroy the resistance despite massacring of 50,000 innocent people with Western-provided weapons is a big defeat for the Zionist regime. In the confrontation between the resistance front and the forces of evil, 'victory belongs to the resistance' he said. The Supreme Leader also condemned the Western politicians who remain indifferent to the suffering inflicted upon civilians, stating that their silence in the face of atrocities reveals their hypocrisy and undermines their claims of upholding human rights.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2241736	2024-10-23T10:41:47-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04562420017297050544.jpg

Hezbollah Mourns Head of Executive Council Sayyed Hashem Safieddi...	Hezbollah Military Media issued a statement to mourn the great leader and martyr, Head of Executive Council Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, all the way to Al-Quds. The statement indicated that the martyred leader passed a way with a number of his brethren in a criminal Zionist airstrike, noting that he accompanied the noblest and most precious martyr, Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah as Abu Fadl Al-Abbas joined Imam Hussein (A.S.) till martyrdom. 'The martyrdom of the great Islamic fighting leader, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, represents the pinnacle of sacrifice and a beacon for generations to continue on the path of resistance, the path walked by the great martyr leader His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, martyr leader Ismail Haniyeh, great leader Yahya Sinwar, and leaders Fouad Shukr, Ali Karaki, Ibrahim Aqil, Saleh Al-Arouri, Raafat Abu Hilal (Abu al-Abed), and thousands of martyrs who preceded him. It is a confirmation that the criminal Zionist enemy understands nothing but the language of resistance and confrontation. The path of compromise has only led to increased aggression, arrogance, and terrorism by the enemy, spilling the blood of the Lebanese and Palestinian people in the most brutal and heinous war of extermination in the full view of the world.' The statement affirmed that Sayyed Safieddine devoted most of his life to serve Hezbollah and the Islamic Resistance as well as its society, administering through long years of his noble life the Party's institutions and maintaining strong ties with the mujahidin (fighters) till Holy God blessed him with martyrdom. Hezbollah offered deep condolences to Imam Mahdi (A.S.), Imam Khamenei, blessed seminaries, as well as the martyr's resistance brethren and noble family, asking Holy God to grant them patience as well as the bless of this life and the hereafter. Finally, Hezbollah promised the great martyr and his martyred brethren to continue the path of resistance and jihad until achieving its goals of freedom and victory.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2241538	2024-10-23T09:06:28-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-09155640017296995768.jpeg

Hezbollah Strikes Tel Aviv Anew, Targets Israelis in Northern and...	Hezbollah on Wednesday kept up its attacks against Israeli sites and gatherings across the Zionist entity, with Tel Aviv being a routine and daily target to the Lebanese resistance group. Hezbollah Military Media announced the strikes, stressing that the operations are 'in support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and backing their courageous and honorable Resistance, and in defense of Lebanon and its people.' The resistance group declared a qualitative missile strike targeting the Glilot Base of the 8200 Israeli military intelligence unit in Tel Aviv, according to the first statement. 'With the call ‘Labbayk Ya Nasrallah’ and as part of Khaybar operations, the Islamic Resistance fighters bombarded at 08:00 AM on Wednesday, 23-10-2024, the Glilot Base, affiliated with Unit 8200 of the military intelligence, in the outskirts of Tel Aviv with a precision rocket barrage,' the statement read. At 9:20 and 9:30 AM, Hezbollah fighters targeted Israeli gatherings at Adaisseh and the area between Adaisseh and Rub Al-Thalatheen with salvos of rockets, the second and third statements read. Later at 11:00 AM, the Islamic Resistance fighters fired a barrage of rockets targeting an Israeli gathering in the area between Misgav Am, Rub Al-Thalatheen and Markaba, according to the fourth statement.

Watch Hezbollah Man Steadily Fighting Israelis: 'Our Soul Which F...	Israeli media released on Tuesday a video showing Hezbollah fighter valiantly combating the enemy troops in southern Lebanon. With calm and measured movements, Ibrahim Haidar, known as 'Karrar Al-Chyah', is seen switching between his machine gun and RPG to inflict casualties on the invading Zionist forces. With unwavering resolute, and despite bullets raining on him and flying close to his head, Haidar did not falter, until he met his end by an Israeli airstrike. The footage exposes the Israeli cowardice, as the Zionist invaders are incapable of facing men of God directly, so they call in airstrikes to get them. The video echoes senior Hezbollah commander Hajj Imad Mughniyeh, who once said about the resistance fighters: 'Our soul which fights.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2241021	2024-10-23T03:24:21-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04865890017296789499.jpg
Islamic Resistance in Iraq Strikes Israeli Targets in Dawn Assaul...	The Islamic Resistance in Iraq reported the execution of three drone strikes targeting key locations in Israeli-occupied territories during the early hours of Wednesday. The Resistant group confirmed that one of the strikes was directed at a crucial site in the Golan Heights, while two additional drone attacks were launched against targets in Eilat, referred to as Umm al-Rashrash in Palestinian discourse. Subsequently, the Resistance announced further drone operations aimed at a vital target in central occupied Palestine, alongside another strike in the Golan Heights. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq announced that these operations come in the context of the ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip and amid the ongoing war against Lebanon. The Resistance reaffirmed its stance against the Israeli occupation and in solidarity with the people of Palestine and Lebanon, stressing that these strikes were also a response to the massacres committed by 'Israel' against civilians, including children, women, and the elderly. The Iraqi Resistance said its fighters launched at dawn Tuesday a drone attack at a vital target in occupied Tabarayya. Its Military Media unit then published footage of the operation.

Sheikh Al-Khatib to Al-Manar: Resistance Defending Entire Lebanon...	Diaa Abu Taam Deputy Head of the Higher Islamic Shia Council in Lebanon, Sheikh Ali Al-Khatib, stressed that the Resistance is assuming its responsibilities and defending the entire country against the Zionist aggression amid the reluctance of the Lebanese government in this regard since 1947. In an interview with Al-Manar Channel held at the historical headquarters of the Shia Council in Hazmieh, Sheikh Al-Khatib affirmed that some Lebanese parties blame the Resistance, despite all its sacrifices for the sake of Lebanon, and provide the Zionist war with a political coverage whether intentionally or unintentionally. Those parties always reflect defeat and weakness because they know the Israeli ambitions in Lebanon, yet ignore them, his eminence said, advising them to support the Resistance which would emerge from the battlefield victorious. The interview, conducted by the Director of Al-Manar Website Diaa Abu Taam, also tackled the spiritual summit that was held at the headquarters of the Maronite Patriarchate in Bkirki as Sheikh Khatib indicated that the summit reflected the national solidarity and support for the resistance. Sheikh Khatib emphasized that holding the presidential elections amid the Zionist war in Lebanon would debilitate the legitimacy of the new president and expose him to future suspicions. The resistance movements in Lebanon and Palestine managed to expose the failures of the international regime, underlining the inability of the international organizations amid the US support for the Zionist entity, according to Sheikh Khatib. Sheikh Khatib hailed the unprecedented steadfastness of the people displaced from their homes due to the Zionist aggression, appreciating the role of the Lebanese community which hosted them. On the 30th day of its relentless assault on Lebanon, the Israeli enemy escalated its brutal aggression with a series of intense airstrikes targeting multiple regions, including southern towns, the Bekaa Valley, and Beirut’s southern suburbs (Dahiyeh).	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2240394	2024-10-22T12:27:10-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-02375120017296252198.jpg

Hezbollah Claims Drone Attack on Netanyahu Residence: Resistance ...	Hezbollah Media Relations Officer Mohammad Afif confirmed the Islamic Resistance full and exclusive responsibility for the drone attack on the residence of the war criminal and the head of the fascist Zionism, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Caesarea. In a press conference held at Al-Hawraa Zainab (A.S.) in Ghobeiry, Beirut's Dahiyeh, Afif stressed that the Islamic Resistance fighters are chasing Netanyahu, and that days, nights and the battlefield will tell. Afif indicated that the supply lines of the Resistance have returned to their normal case, adding that the command and control systems are operating with the best performance. The human and military capabilities of the Islamic Resistance are more than sufficient for the battle requirements, according to Afif who added that the number of Hezbollah attacks is increasing steadily. Afif indicated that the enemy losses, pertaining to the soldiers and tanks are enormous, especially in Aita Al-Shaab confrontations. Afif noted that Hezbollah is still bombing the Israeli barracks, camps and gatherings, while the enemy responds by targeting civilians. Hezbollah official denounced the bias of MBC and all the similar platforms, stressing that the Israeli Channel 12 could have broadcast a juster report about the martyr Yahya Sinwar. Afif hailed the Iraqi public move against MBC office, calling for taking measures against the Channel's office in Lebanon. Afif stressed that freedom of media does not give the media platforms to provoke the enemy against the civilians and their institutions, like Al-Qard Al-Hasan Association. In this regard, Afif emphasized that Al-Qard Al-Hasan Association is a civil institution that will will do everything necessary and required to fulfill its obligations towards depositors and beneficiaries. Hezbollah official affirmed that the bright reality of the Resistance and its field achievements will not be concealed by the pro-enemy media coverage. The United States is a full partner in the Zionist aggression against Lebanon, supplies the Israeli enemy with weapons, and bears primary responsibility for the horrific massacre, according to Hezbollah official. Afif responded to the Zionist defense minister who threatened that the negotiations would be held under fire, vowing 'fire for fire, blood for blood, and iron for iron.' Hezbollah official held the Israeli enemy accountable for the safety of the Islamic Resistance prisoners, calling on the International Red Cross to check the Zionists observe this criterion. Hezbollah fighters were about to kidnap Israeli soldiers few days ago, according to Afif who affirmed that the Islamic Resistance would capture Zionist troops in order to hold an indirect swap deal after the war. Finally, Afif stressed that the Zionist massacres only reflect the enemy's lust for murder and destruction, condemning the remarks of the German FM which justified the enemy's crimes against the civilians.

Blinken Visits Occupied Palestinian Territories, Seeking Ceasefir...	US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in the occupied Palestinian territories on Tuesday as part of efforts to broker a ceasefire and recover prisoners in the Gaza Strip. Blinken's regional tour comes just two weeks before the US presidential elections. During his visit, Blinken is set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials. This follows the recent assassination of Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas' political bureau, which 'Israel' claimed would weaken the group's negotiating position. Since October 7, 2023, the Israeli occupation army, supported by Washington, has continued its aggression on the Gaza Strip, as its aircraft bomb the vicinity of hospitals, buildings, towers and homes of Palestinian civilians and destroy them over the heads of their residents. The Israeli enemy is also launching a brutal aggression on Lebanon, targeting civilians and their homes on a daily basis across Lebanese territory, causing a large number of martyrs. It has also been trying for more than two weeks inside the border villages in southern Lebanon, which constitutes a blatant violation of Lebanese sovereignty in full view of the world. New Proposal The Israeli Broadcasting Authority reported that the so-called head of the General Security Service (Shabak) Ronen Bar presented to the cabinet (the inner cabinet) the day before yesterday, Sunday, a proposal for a deal 'that includes a limited ceasefire in exchange for the release of detainees without the withdrawal of the army from the Gaza Strip,' which is completely rejected by the Palestinian resistance factions, most notably the Hamas movement, which the enemy has not succeeded in undermining after a year of unprecedented barbaric aggression, and which continues to inflict losses in lives and equipment on it in the Strip to this day. It continued by saying that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent the head of the Shabak to Cairo on Sunday to discuss the proposal with the Egyptian side. In turn, the Hebrew website 'Walla' reported that 'the head of the Shabak presented a proposal he received from the head of Egyptian intelligence, Hassan Rashad, to reactivate negotiations regarding the kidnapped deal.' According to 'Walla,' the head of Egyptian intelligence presented Bar with 'the broad outlines of a small deal with Hamas, which would reactivate negotiations towards a larger deal.' For its part, the newspaper 'Israel Today' said that 'the cabinet decided to assign Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer to formulate a more detailed and in-depth strategy on this issue	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2239888	2024-10-22T05:55:13-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-05276450017296016359.jpg

Siege and Burning of Hospital as Israeli Occupation Escalates Att...	The Israeli occupation continues its genocidal war on the Gaza Strip, especially in the northern areas that have witnessed Israeli massacres since the beginning of the war a year ago. The occupation renews its brutal aggression in the northern Gaza Strip as part of a systematic plan to displace its residents and destroy all aspects of life and infrastructure, which has led to the deaths of hundreds of martyrs in recent days. Burning the 'Indonesian' Hospital The Israeli occupation forces burned the Indonesian Hospital, and the Palestinian Ministry of Health directly condemned the targeting of the hospital. The Palestinian ministry reiterated its demand that the United Nations and international institutions and all concerned parties protect health facilities and staff from the brutality and crimes of the occupation, especially in the northern besieged Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to genocide for the seventeenth consecutive day. Media reports also confirmed the death of 10 martyrs and the injury of 30 others in an Israeli artillery shelling that targeted a shelter center affiliated with 'UNRWA' in Jabalia camp, and 3 martyrs were also killed and others were injured as a result of an Israeli shelling that targeted Al-Shawa School, which shelters the displaced in the town of Beit Hanoun. 🧵This is not military base!

A number of people were killed and others were injured as a result of Israeli bombing that targeted a house in Jabalia Al-Balad, in an Israeli bombing that targeted a house near Abu Sharar roundabout in Jabalia camp. Israeli Occupation Besieges Northern Gaza In addition to targeting hospitals and shelters, the occupation continues its war of starvation against the northern areas of the Gaza Strip, where it prevents the entry of humanitarian aid. In this context, the Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, said that 'Israel' is preventing humanitarian missions carrying vital supplies, including medicine and food, from reaching the north and the people under siege. Lazzarini considered the occupation's refusal to allow aid in and its use as a weapon a sign of the decline of the moral compass, demanding that humanitarian agencies, including 'UNRWA', be granted access to northern Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2239426	2024-10-22T00:40:43-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-01592310017295825714.png
Israeli Air Raid Targets Beirut Hospital Vicinity after Enemy Iss...	In an attempt to intimidate the Lebanese by recalling the targeting of Gaza hospitals, the Israeli enemy concentrated its grudge on the medical sector in Lebanon. The Israeli military spokesman introduced the new aggression round by claiming that, under one of Haret Hreik hospitals, there is tunnel. The Zionist enemy, then, issued evacuation warnings which identify a number of buildings to be targeted. In a deceptive manner, the Zionist war jets targeted late Monday the vicinity of Rafik Hariri Hospital in Beirut, damaging buildings and leaving casualties. The targeted was a residential area whose inhabitants did not evacuate it for thinking it is safe. Moreover, over seven air raids targeted Haret Hreik, Bourj Al-Barajneh and Al-Hadath areas in Beirut's Dahiyeh and cause a massive damage. The Israeli enemy stepped up its aggression on Lebanon with violent raids targeting several areas across the country including branches belonging to the financial network of Al-Qard Al-Hasan.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2239338	2024-10-21T13:47:23-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-01641350017295435515.png

Member of Loyalty to Resistance parliamentary bloc, MP Ibrahim Al-Moussawi, indicated that the US presidential envoy Amos Hochstein talked baldly about the amendment of the UN Resolution 1701. In a TV interview, MP Moussawi stressed that Hezbollah is concerned only with the battle field and has commissioned House Speaker to handle the negotiations file. Speaker Berri sent the correct message to Hoschstein, Moussawi said. 'What Speaker said about the priority of the ceasefire is a basic principle.' MP Moussawi affirmed that the Israeli enemy cannot dictate its terms on Hezbollah, adding that the leaked conditions give a false impression that the Zionists have emerged victorious. The battle is still in its early stages, MP Moussawi added, noting that Hezbollah fighters and missile will have their say. MP Moussawi emphasized that the Israeli enemy would be surprised by Hezbollah military capabilities. Those who are betting on Hezbollah defeat will realize that the Resistance Party is firmer than their plans, MP Moussawi concluded.

Berri to Hochstein: No Changes to 1701, No Presidential Elections...	US special envoy Amos Hochstein stated on Monday that 'the situation in Lebanon has spiraled out of control, and linking the country's future to regional conflicts is not in the best interest of the Lebanese people.' After meeting with Speaker Nabih Berri in Ain Al-Tineh, Hochstein emphasized that 'the failure to implement Resolution 1701 is the main reason for the escalation and continuation of this conflict.' 'We are committed to resolving the conflict in Lebanon based on Resolution 1701, but the commitment of both sides alone is not enough. The Lebanese government needs support, and Washington is committed to providing the necessary assistance,' the US special envoy added. Hochstein also highlighted that 'the international community is dedicated to reconstruction efforts and supporting the Lebanese Army.' 'I will not engage in discussions about amending Resolution 1701 but will instead focus on its implementation. President Joe Biden's administration is determined to ensure that this is Lebanon's last conflict for generations to come,' Hochstein clarified. During his visit to Beirut, Hochstein is meeting with various Lebanese officials. At the same time, Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit also arrived in Beirut. His brief visit includes meetings with Speaker Nabih Berri, Prime Minister Najib Mikati, and Army Commander General Joseph Aoun. Subtext of Hochstein's Visit: Pressure and Promises Earlier today, Al-Akhbar Lebanese daily reported that US envoy Amos Hochstein is returning to Beirut, carrying what he claims is a 'final offer' ahead of the U.S. elections on November 5 to establish a political-security framework to end the war. However, according to MP Jamil Al-Sayyed, Hochstein’s real goal is to see if Israeli aggression has pressured Lebanon into accepting US and Israeli occupation demands to amend Resolution 1701, putting Lebanon under military, security, and political control. The paper highlighted that the Israeli enemy prepared for Hochstein’s visit with a night of intense bombing on Dahiyeh. Al-Akhbar also noted that in a recent interview with Al-Jadeed TV, Hochstein said his plan centers on reinforcing UN Resolution 1701 as the basis for a permanent ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel but stressed that 'modifications and additions' are necessary for its full implementation. In response, Speaker Nabih Berri firmly rejected any changes to Resolution 1701, emphasizing Lebanon's united stance on maintaining it without amendments. Speaker Berri also told Al-Arabiya TV that Hochstein's visit is the US's 'last chance' to secure a solution, reaffirming that Hezbollah has supported 1701 since 2006. He outlined his plan to save Lebanon and said the U.S. is keen on achieving a ceasefire before its elections, dismissing claims that Iran is blocking his efforts. In essence, Al-Akhbar reported that Speaker Berri made Lebanon’s position clear: no amendments to Resolution 1701 and no presidential election while the country is at war. Al-Akhbar reported that Prime Minister Najib Mikati confirmed Hezbollah's support for Resolution 1701 and emphasized Lebanon's commitment to it for stability. He reiterated that 'a diplomatic solution is still possible' and called for deploying the Lebanese Army south of the Litani River to fully implement the resolution and avoid further violence. Al-Akhbar added that Hochstein’s visit, his first since the Israeli aggression began in September, and possibly his last due to career changes, has caused concern among political circles. His visits often coincide with major regional developments, raising fears that his arrival signals new Israeli actions, given the link between US diplomacy and Israeli escalation. The newspaper suggested that Hochstein’s main goal is to assess whether Israeli attacks have pressured Lebanon into compliance and to push for concessions benefiting US and Israeli interests in southern Lebanon and other internal issues. 'Western sources suggest that Hochstein may ask Lebanon to declare a unilateral ceasefire to end the aggression, while French sources revealed that Paris has revised its initiative on Resolution 1701, with Lebanon’s Foreign Ministry receiving the updated proposal for discussion,' Al-Akhbar added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2238832	2024-10-21T06:04:03-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-03110550017295157225.jpg

Speaker Berri Affirms Lebanon’s Commitment to Current Version of ...	Few hours after it was announced that the US presidential envoy Amos Hochstein would visit Beirut on Monday to meet Lebanon's senior officials, House Speaker Nabih Berri reiterated rejection of amending any of the items of the UN Resolution 1701. In a TV interview, Speaker Berri stressed that Hochstein's visit tomorrow would be the US last chance to reach a solution, adding that there is a US desire to reach a ceasefire before the presidential elections (November 5, 2024). Speaker Berri reiterated that Hezbollah had commissioned him since 2006, adding that the Resistance Party had agreed to implement 1701.
