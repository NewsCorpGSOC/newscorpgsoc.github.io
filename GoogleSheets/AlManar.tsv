Zionist MK Itamar Ben Gvir Resigns Over Prisoner Exchange Deal an...	Israeli so-called 'National Security' Minister Itamar Ben Gvir officially resigned from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government on Sunday, along with his three party ministers, following his earlier threats to withdraw if the controversial prisoner exchange deal and ceasefire agreement with Hamas were approved. The ceasefire took effect Sunday morning. Ben Gvir's party, Otzma Yehudit, announced its withdrawal from the governing coalition in a strongly worded statement, condemning the agreement as a 'shameful capitulation' to Hamas. The party criticized the deal for including the release of 'hundreds of murderers,' some of whom will return to the occupied city of Jerusalem and the West Bank. It also decried the ceasefire, claiming it undermined the military gains achieved during the recent conflict, marked by the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces from Gaza. In the statement, Otzma Yehudit accused the government of 'surrendering to Hamas' and formally declared that Ben Gvir, along with Ministers Yitzhak Wasserlauf and Amichai Eliyahu, submitted their resignations to Netanyahu.

Israeli Supreme Court Rejects Petitions Against Prisoner Exchange In a related development, the Israeli enemy’s Supreme Court dismissed petitions filed against the prisoner exchange agreement with Hamas, part of the ceasefire deal. The petitions, submitted by organizations Bechirot BeChayim and Almagor, as well as families of Zionists, sought to prevent the release of Palestinian prisoners. The court ruled it could not intervene, citing a lack of legal grounds, as reported by the Zionist public broadcaster KAN. The petitioners had argued that releasing security prisoners, many of whom were involved in past attacks, could harm the Israeli occupation security and enable their return to armed resistance. Under the terms of the agreement, the Israeli occupation will release 1,904 Palestinian prisoners, including 737 detainees held in Israeli prisons and 1,167 from Gaza detained during recent ground operations. In return, 33 of the 98 Zionist captives held by Gaza resistance factions will be freed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2316822	2025-01-19T03:37:05-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/06/manar-03423360016866602357-e1686660305798.jpg
Aoun to Guterres: Lebanon Insists on Israeli Withdrawal from Sout...	President of the Republic, General Joseph Aoun, informed UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during their meeting this morning at Baabda Palace that 'Lebanon is committed to the need for Israeli forces’ withdrawal from its occupied territories in the south within the deadline set by the agreement reached on November 27.' President Aoun underlined that 'the continued Israeli land and air violations, particularly in bombarding houses and destroying border villages, completely contradict with the ceasefire agreement and is considered a continued breach of Lebanese sovereignty and the will of the international community to restore stability to southern Lebanon.' Aoun considered Guterres' visit to Lebanon a week after his election as President of the Republic 'a message of hope to the Lebanese,' thanking the United Nations organizations for the support provided to Lebanon in all fields, hailing the role of the international peacekeeping forces operating in the south and the steadfastness of its members in the face of the Israeli attacks that targeted its centers, saluting the souls of the 'UNIFIL' martyrs and stressing full coordination with the Lebanese army. Additionally, President Aoun raised the issue of Israel's burning of agricultural lands in the south, aspiring for the help of the United Nations especially the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), for farmers to restore the investment status of their lands once again. Aoun also touched on the readiness of the Lebanese army to replace the Israelis immediately after their withdrawal, and requested the assistance of the United Nations to secure the return of displaced Syrians to their country, now that the political and security reasons that led to their displacement are no longer in place. Israeli Violations The Israeli occupation forces continued on Saturday violating the ceasefire in South Lebanon, delaying their withdrawal from the area and the deployment of the Lebanese military units in the border towns. In this regard, the Zionist occupation forces advanced into Bint Jbeil outskirts, Wadli Slouki, Houla, Mais Al-Jabal and Al-Khiam barrens, bulldozing lands, opening fire, detonating houses and looting collectibles. من عمليات التوغل العدوانية التي نفذتها قوات الاحتلال في حي 'الدبش' في أطراف مدينة بنت جبيل استغلالا لقرار وقف اطلاق النار . pic.twitter.com/Hl1bF6h8Aw — شعيب 🇱🇧 (@cheib1970) January 18, 2025	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2316448	2025-01-18T12:23:10-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-03311400017372317791.png

Countdown to Gaza Ceasefire: Hope Amidst Devastation	The countdown to the ceasefire, set to take effect on Sunday, is filled with a mix of anticipation and fear for Gaza's residents. As airstrikes by the occupation forces continue relentlessly, many fear becoming the conflict's final casualties. Al-Akhbar War Journalist Youssef Fares reports the details from Gaza. Talks of post-ceasefire plans dominate conversations. In northern Gaza, displaced residents, forced from their homes over 100 days ago, are preparing to return to areas ravaged by bombing. Mohammad Salha, displaced from Tal Al-Zaatar, expressed his priorities: 'The first thing I will do is search for my relatives, whom I haven’t been able to contact for 60 days. If they have been martyred, we will honor them and bury their bodies, and then we will check on the state of our homes, if nothing is left then we’ll have to look for shelter again.' Many displaced families face an uncertain future. Ahed Ali, who is staying with relatives in southern Gaza, shared his concerns: 'We are happy, by God, that the war is over, but our concerns are great. My family and I are staying in the home of our displaced relatives in the south. When the ceasefire takes effect, we will have to search for a new shelter. Our house in Jabalia is destroyed, and we must leave the house to its owners, may God bless them for having us.' Others, like Samah Hijazi, are focused on finding loved ones. 'The first thing I will do immediately after the ceasefire begins is to search for the body of my brother Mohammad, then honor him by burying him to calm his grieving mother’s heart,' she said. Sources told Al-Akhbar that hundreds of bodies still lie in the streets of northern Gaza. Palestinian Civil Defense and medical teams are coordinating efforts to recover them and clear unexploded ordnance left behind by the Israeli occupation before residents return to their neighborhoods. Meanwhile, the violence continues. Journalist Amer Sultan's family home in Jabalia Al-Balad was bombed by 'Israel' on Friday, killing his family, including his wife, children, and parents. Rescue efforts were delayed until the next afternoon. Palestinian journalist Amer al-Sultan lost 9 members of his family: his mother, his brothers, and his sisters in an Israeli strike that targeted their family home in the northern #Gaza Strip.

In a statement released on Saturday, the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas declared that the recent war with ‘Israel’, referred to as 'Operation Al-Aqsa Flood,' has exemplified the unity and triumphant resistance of the Palestinian people. Hamas stated that this battle has 'brought us closer to the demise of the occupation, liberation, and return, God willing.' The group asserted that ‘Israel’ 'failed to achieve its aggressive goals and succeeded only in committing war crimes that disgrace humanity.' According to the statement, Hamas 'forced the occupation to halt its aggression against our people and withdraw, despite Netanyahu's attempts to prolong the war and commit more massacres.' The group vowed that the blood of the martyrs who died during the conflict 'will not be in vain,' and that 'the enemy's leaders and soldiers will be pursued and held accountable for these crimes, no matter how long it takes.' 'The occupation failed to achieve its aggressive goals, and only succeeded in committing war crimes that would make humanity blush.' Looking ahead, Hamas emphasized that the immediate priority is the lifting of the Israeli siege on Gaza, providing relief to the Palestinian people, facilitating the return of the displaced, and initiating the reconstruction of the devastated enclave. The group indicated that this has been a focus of their leadership since the start of the conflict. Regarding the humanitarian aid protocol agreed upon under the supervision of mediators, Hamas noted that it ensures the implementation of relief, shelter, and reconstruction measures for the people of Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2316217	2025-01-18T05:13:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/05/manar-081753800171534147910.jpg

He urged the families of Israeli captives to demand that the Israeli occupation military refrain from heavy airstrikes in the remaining hours before a ceasefire takes effect. Abu Hamza cautioned that such airstrikes could 'result in the killing of your sons while the resistance makes final field arrangements for their release.' He emphasized that the families of the enemy's captives must demand the Zionist army halt the intense bombardment of the final hours, as it could lead to the death of the hostages while the resistance completes arrangements for their release.

Sheikh Qassem Hails Gaza Legendry Steadfastness, Calls on ‘Israel...	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem congratulated Gaza, its people and resistance over the ceasefire deal with the Zionist entity, hailing them over their epic steadfastness in face of the Israeli genocide. In a televised speech addressing an international conference in support of Gaza entitled: 'Gaza Icon of Resistance,' Sheikh Qassem stressed that the resistance in Lebanon is persistent stressing that any scheme to exclude Hezbollah from the political scene in Lebanon is doomed to fail. He stressed that the Israeli violations to the ceasefire in Lebanon 'can’t go on,' calling on the Israeli enemy 'not to test our patience.' Al-Aqsa Flood and Gaza Ceasefire Sheikh Qaasem stressed that Op. Al-Aqsa Flood restored momentum to the Palestinian cause. In this context, he pointed to major shift in the international stance towards Palestine, citing the mass protests across the world, especially the West in support of Gaza. 'The war on Gaza is a US-Israeli genocidal scheme aimed at wiping out Palestine of the map,' the Hezbollah S.G. said. Palestinian resistance fighters near a rocket launcher in Gaza (photo from archive). However, the Palestinian resistance has foiled this dangerous plan, his eminence stressed, in remarks carried by Al-Manar. 'The great sacrifices along with the legendary steadfastness prove that the great people of Palestine are worthful of regaining their land and they are capable of doing so. Steadfastness now is the foundation of the future.' He stressed that the people in Gaza came out glorious and the resistance hasn’t laid down its arms, hailing Hamas, the Islamic Jihad and other Palestinian resistance groups over their epic steadfastness. 'Congratulations to the Palestinian people, to the people of Gaza and to the resistance fighters, for this agreement that has not changed from what was proposed in May 2024. This indicates the steadfastness of the resistance, and that it achieved its demands while the Israeli enemy was not able to impose its terms.' Isolation of ‘Israel’ and Support Fronts Meanwhile, Sheikh Qassem pointed to the isolation which the Zionist entity have been witnessing in the latest months. 'Israel is now an international pariah; its image is bleak. The condemnation of the International Criminal Court is enough to know the extent of this great impact that the resistance of the Palestinian people has had and how it has exposed this Israeli entity. The Israelis won’t embrace stability in occupied Palestine. Wait for the coming days and months to see the repercussions. As for the internal disputes within the Zionist entity, they will increase, God willing, and there is no solution except for Palestine to return to its people.' The Hezbollah S.G. then hailed all those who stood by Gaza and Palestine, specifically naming the Islamic Republic of Iran, led by the Supreme Leader Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei. 'History will record, as the field did, those who supported Gaza with sacrifices and contributed to foiling the Israeli enemy’s project. The most prominent contributors are the Islamic Republic of Iran, led by Imam Khamenei who has not missed an opportunity to emphasize standing with the Palestinian people to liberate it from the sea to the river, and has provided all kinds of military, moral, material and political support.' Sheikh Qassem also praised the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran IRGC and its external branch Al-Quds along with the arm’s former head Hajj Qassem Suleimani who was 'truly the martyr of Al-Quds.' Iran has been punished for decades because it directed its compass towards liberating,' his eminence said, saluting the Iranian nation for supporting Palestine. 'Lebanon Offered Master of the Nation’s Martyrs' As for Lebanon, Sheikh Qassem stressed that the country has offered 'its all' via Hezbollah, Amal Movement and the Lebanese people during the last Israeli war. 'Lebanon and Hezbollah offered the master of the nation’s martyrs Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah along with the Hashemite cleric Sayyed Hashem Safeiddine and many other leaders, commanders, fighters, martyrs and injured people.' 'The confrontations against Hezbollah in Lebanon contributed to the victory of Gaza. The resistance fighters stood as an impregnable barrier against the Israeli advance on the front in legendary battles, and their honorable families protected, supported and backed them. Hezbollah and the resistance fighters have thwarted the Israeli goal of ending the resistance in Lebanon, which emerged proud and with its head held high.' 'Hezbollah Won’t Be Excluded from the Political Scene' On the other hand, Sheikh Qassem stressed that Hezbollah won’t be excluded from the political scene in Lebanon. 'The resistance in Lebanon will remain resistant to the American-Israeli project. It is persistent, strong and ready to preserve the blood of the martyrs in a bid to liberate the land and to liberate Palestine.'

'Right after the terrorist act, an attempt was made to arrest the gunman, who then quickly committed suicide,' the judiciary's statement read. The statement said an investigation had been launched to identify and arrest those behind the assassinations. Over the past year, the Iranian judiciary has taken measures to prosecute agents and elements affiliated with Israel, the U.S. and terrorist groups.

The Lebanese President Joseph Aoun hosted, on Friday at Baabda Palace, his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron who had arrived earlier in Beirut. 'I hope you will bear witness to the entire world that the Lebanese people's trust in their country and state has been restored, and that the world's confidence in Lebanon must fully return because the true and genuine Lebanon has revived,' Aoun told Macron. President Aoun also underlined the importance of maintaining the ceasefire deal and the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon, underscoring the liberation of the prisoners and the reconstruction project. President Aoun hoped that Macron 'instruct Total to return to continue oil exploration operations in the offshore oil blocks.' For his part, Macron affirmed France’s steadfast support for Lebanon, commending Aoun's efforts in ending the political vacuum and steering Lebanon toward recovery. 'France has stood by the Lebanese people over the past years,' Macron said, highlighting his country’s commitment to Lebanon’s stability and sovereignty. Moreover, Macron underscored the importance of Lebanon remaining immune to foreign interference, describing it as a vital condition for the continued implementation of the ceasefire. Macron further reiterated France’s support for the Lebanese Army, particularly in their deployment in southern Lebanon. 'We will continue to support the army to ensure it can extend its presence and maintain security in the south,' Macron stated. Additionally, the French President expressed France’s readiness to collaborate with Lebanon in demarcating its borders along the Blue Line. Later on, House Speaker Nabih Berri and the caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati arrived at Baabda Palace, where a bilateral meeting was held between and Berri. President Aoun also met with Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam at the Baabda Presidential Palace to tackle the cabinet formation. The two statesmen agreed on a speedy process and a preliminary lineup. Salam also stated that he informed Macron that any delay of the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon threatens the regional stability.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2315667	2025-01-17T10:02:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-033762800173713692410.jpg

After the meeting, Salam stated, 'Speaker Berri and I are on the same page, following the constitution. I will remain in contact with him until the government is formed,' adding that parliamentary consultations did not conclude yesterday. 'I am continuing them today. There is a consensus among parliamentary blocs on the urgent need to revive the country and work toward its recovery, and I pledge to achieve this,' Salam noted, affirming there is no alternative to dialogue and understanding. 'No one will obstruct or be allowed to obstruct the government formation process,' asserted Salam, revealing an initial plan to present to the President. 'There are no hurdles hindering the government formation,' Salam concluded, pledging to ensure its success. In turn, Speaker Berri commented briefly, describing the meeting with the PM-designate as 'promising'. Salam was designated on Monday by President Joseph Aoun on the basis of binding parliamentary consultations. However, lack of coordination among the parliamentary blocs pushed the 'Loyalty to Resistance' and 'Development and Liberation' to boycott the non-binding parliamentary consultations held by the PM-designate. The latest political contacts eased the tensions and led to Berri-Salam meeting which would enhance the new government formation on the basis of national consensus.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2315535	2025-01-17T07:07:56-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-00419080017371264665.png

The coalition also bombed the Hizyaz power station in Sanhan District with eight airstrikes, severely damaging vital infrastructure. These attacks are a direct response to Yemen’s unwavering solidarity with Gaza in its fight against Israeli genocide. Since November 2023, the Yemeni Armed Forces have successfully targeted Israeli-linked vessels in the Red Sea using missiles and drones, as well as striking vital Israeli targets in occupied territory. In response, Washington and London began airstrikes on Yemen in early 2024. Backed by the US, the Israeli enemy’s genocidal campaign in Gaza since October 7, 2023, has killed or injured over 157,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, with 11,000 missing. The atrocities have caused mass destruction, famine, and one of the worst humanitarian crises in modern history.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2315183	2025-01-17T00:55:18-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-09107490017371039398.jpg
Yemen’s Ansarullah Leader Warns: Gaza Ceasefire Hinges on Israeli...	The leader of Yemen’s Ansarullah movement, Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi, outlined Yemen’s stance on the Gaza ceasefire agreement, asserting that military operations will continue if Zionist violations persist. Speaking on Thursday evening, Sayyed Al-Houthi stressed that Yemen’s position aligns with that of Palestinian resistance factions and will remain steadfast throughout the implementation of the ceasefire. Al-Houthi stated that Yemen’s support for Gaza is unwavering, warning that any Israeli regression or massacres will prompt renewed military action in solidarity with the Palestinian people. He further emphasized Yemen’s commitment to enhancing military capabilities for more effective support of the Palestinian cause, reiterating that 'the path to supporting Palestine remains ongoing.' Yemen’s Military Strikes Shake Israeli Enemy Defense Discussing Yemen’s role in Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, Al-Houthi highlighted the remarkable impact of Yemen’s resistance, which surprised the world with powerful strikes against the Israeli enemy and its US and British allies. Despite the challenging conditions facing the Yemeni people, Ansarullah forces carried out 1,255 operations, including ballistic missile launches, drone attacks, and naval operations. Aftermath of a Yemeni drone strike targeting Yavne in occupied Palestine, Monday, December 11, 2024. Al-Houthi praised the success of Yemeni Armed Forces in undermining the effectiveness of US naval fleets, rendering them incapable of safeguarding Israeli shipping routes. He noted that the Israeli occupation now faces significant challenges in intercepting Yemeni attacks, which have exposed vulnerabilities in its defense systems. Escalating Impact on Zionist Economy The Ansarullah leader emphasized the escalating military operations' profound impact on the Israeli enemy, particularly in aviation and economic sectors. Yemeni strikes on Israeli vessels have led to disrupted trade routes, forcing airlines to reconsider using Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport. He pointed to the Israeli enemy’s failure to achieve its objectives, with Yemeni operations severely affecting the morale of Israeli forces and its economy. These setbacks have compelled the Israeli enemy to explore political solutions after exhausting military options. Criticism of Arab Inaction, International Complicity Al-Houthi condemned the lack of Arab action in supporting the Palestinian cause, noting that this inaction has emboldened the Israeli enemy's crimes against Palestinians. He also criticized the complicity of some Arab regimes and highlighted the United Nations' failure to hold the Israeli occupation entity accountable despite claims of neutrality. Hezbollah’s Role and Regional Resistance Sayyed Al-Houthi commended Hezbollah for its significant contributions to supporting the Palestinian resistance, acknowledging its sacrifices and pivotal role in confronting the Zionist enemy. He also praised the Iraqi resistance's involvement, noting its support for the Palestinian cause through various means. Call for Mass Mobilization The Ansarullah leader called on the Yemeni people to participate in a massive demonstration planned for Friday, emphasizing its importance as a culmination of continuous public mobilization over the past 15 months. He stressed that such displays of solidarity underscore Yemen’s unwavering support for Palestine and readiness to confront any Israeli escalation. Al-Houthi concluded by highlighting Yemen’s sacrifices, with 106 martyrs and 328 injured, as a testament to the nation’s steadfast commitment to defending Palestinian rights. Yemen’s support, he said, transcends rhetoric and includes military, political, and popular dimensions, rooted in the country’s deep faith and principles.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2315029	2025-01-16T12:42:32-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-01108620017291797507.png
Starbucks Shuts Down Second Beirut Branch Amid Boycott Pressure, ...	Starbucks Corporation, the renowned American multinational coffeehouse chain, has closed its branch in Beirut's Raouche area, following the earlier shutdown of its location at ABC Verdun Mall. These closures, which leave both key areas without a Starbucks presence, highlight a noticeable decline in the company’s footprint in the Lebanese market. A security officer at the Raouche branch confirmed that the space will soon be occupied by a new coffee brand. Starbucks ABC Verdun Mall branch (April 2024) Global Decline and Financial Struggles The closures come amidst a global downturn in Starbucks' sales, despite efforts to implement administrative changes aimed at improving performance. Similarly, Americana Restaurants, a major food service operator, announced a 48.2% drop in profits over the past year, reflecting broader financial difficulties faced by companies that have been the target of popular boycott campaigns.

Speaking to Al-Manar, she stated, 'Our opposition to colonialism is a principled stance and an ongoing battle that will only end with the eradication of this colonial entity.' Mrs. Karaki referenced recent Israeli economic reports warning of a 'spiral collapse,' citing the exit of over 40,000 companies from the market and the suspension of numerous projects. She argued that continued global corporate support for the Zionist economy amounts to 'artificial life support for a dying system.' 'Boycotts are not merely an economic tool; they embody widespread popular rejection of any form of normalization or support for the occupation,' she added. Tangible Results of Boycott Campaigns Mrs. Karaki highlighted the tangible impact of global economic boycotts in reducing support for the occupation. For example, she noted that Puma ended its sponsorship of the Israeli Football Association after sustained boycott efforts. She also reassured that local economies can remain resilient, as domestic investors are capable of finding alternatives that strengthen local markets without supporting entities complicit in violence and oppression. Call to Intensify Boycott Efforts Mrs. Karaki concluded by urging greater efforts to support boycott campaigns. She emphasized that 'boycotts are a vital form of resistance, no less important than any other form of struggle.' She called for heightened public awareness and stronger community support to challenge systems and corporations that directly or indirectly enable the occupation.

Israeli Ceasefire Violations Escalate Along Lebanon Border: Milit...	In an alarming escalation of violations, Israeli occupation forces have conducted a series of military incursions along the Lebanon border. These include tank deployments, explosions in border villages such as Aita Al-Shaab, Maroun Al-Ras, and Al-Taybeh, as well as extensive drone activity and deforestation. The developments come amid a prolonged delay in the Lebanese army’s deployment to border areas due to the Israeli enemy's refusal to withdraw. Explosions and Military Incursions On Thursday afternoon, Aita Al-Shaab witnessed its fourth explosion of the day, carried out by Israeli enemy forces. Between morning and 1:15 PM, a heavily armed convoy of three tanks, an armored vehicle, and a personnel carrier advanced toward the northern outskirts of Maroun al-Ras, extending to the northeast near Bint Jbeil. The Zionist military reportedly targeted homes, destroying gates and firing at private properties. Additionally, Israeli occupation forces pushed into Al-Taybeh, firing weapons along the town’s edges toward Deir Seryan. Explosions rocked Al-Taybeh as Zionist soldiers set fire to several homes. Similar violations were reported in Hula, where heavy gunfire echoed across the area, and near Mays Al-Jabal, where Israeli troops conducted extensive searches. Since early morning, armed drones have been flying extensively across the border area at various altitudes, reminiscent of wartime operations. Al-Manar correspondent captured footage of Israeli tank, personnel carrier, and infantry movements in Houla, accompanied by heavy machine gun fire throughout the day. In Beirut's southern suburbs (Dahiyeh), Israeli enemy drones were flying at low altitude throughout the entire day. Lebanese Army Deployment Delayed Despite scheduled plans to enter border villages like Yaroun, Ayta Al-Shaab, Maroun Al-Ras, Blida, Mays Al-Jabal, and Adaisseh, the Lebanese army has yet to deploy. For over ten days, Israeli enemy forces’ refusal to withdraw has prevented the army from assuming control, leaving the area vulnerable to ongoing violations. Deforestation and Time Exploitation Israeli occupation forces continue to exploit the stalled situation by carrying out explosions and large-scale deforestation in border regions. In recent days, ancient trees in the Yaroun forest near the occupied Palestinian border have been uprooted. Today, Israeli bulldozers persisted in leveling the forest, causing irreversible environmental damage.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2314820	2025-01-16T11:07:43-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-07897610017370541879.jpg
From Netanyahu’s 'Absolute Victory' to Hamas Ceasefire Terms: Bit...	When the mighty fighters of Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas military wing, launched their attack on the Gaza envelop settlements on October 7, 2023, the Zionist entity was dealt the most powerful blow since its emergence. Experts, analysts, scholars, historians, academics, and journalists do know that the strike changed the course of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and even the Arab-Zionist one. The Zionist entity had either to 'digest' the new reality in which the settlements may be invaded by the 'enemies' or take a certain action that alters the dark facts of 'Al-Aqsa Flood'. Since the Zionist government is formed of a group of extremists, the second choice certainly turns to be the Israeli long-term strategy. PM Benjamin Netanyahu immediately occupied the scene and heralded his war aimed at achieving the 'absolute victory'of crushing Hamas, liberating the prisoners by force, displacing the Gazans into various countries, and establishing Zionist settlements in the Strip. The Zionist army was commanded to commit the worst war crime throughout the human history. The order was that achieving the 'absolute victory' justifies all forms of criminality and barbarism, despite the public opinion condemnation and the legal agencies convictions. Around 450 days, hundreds of thousands of war criminals armed by the most sophisticated and lethal weaponry in the world, failed to achieve any of the strategic Israeli targets. The Israeli prisoners have remained held by the Palestinian resistance; Hamas and all the factions are still operating powerfully in the Strip; the displaced Gazans will return to their houses; the Zionists have failed to establish any settlement in Gaza. Nevertheless, the Zionist nose has been rubbed in the dirt of Gaza whose negotiators imposed their terms on the Israeli side. An honorable prisoner swap will accompany the ceasefire and Israeli withdrawal from the Strip. In details, the agreement will be implemented in three stages. The first phase will last for 42 days and include a temporary stop of hostilities, IOF withdrawal from the residential areas, reopening of Rafah crossing to let 600 aid trucks into the Strip, and release of 2000 Palestinian prisoners in return for 33 Zionist captives. In the second and third phases, the reconstruction of Gaza and the announcement of the permanent truce will take place. In brief, none of the Zionist conditions were observed in the deal, which reflects the outcomes of the battle. The Zionists managed only to kill, injure, capture, and destroy, but in vain. The Zionist media has reflected the case of frustration in the entity because of the strategic Israeli failure in the war. Israeli Channel 12 considered that the return of the Zionist settlers to northern Gaza highlights the Israeli failure and Palestinian victory. The Channel even went on to say that the Palestinian prisoners, to be freed, are expected to be the new leaders of the Palestinians, describing them as educated and powerful. -	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2314710	2025-01-16T09:19:15-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2017/02/manar-02792890014872330091.jpg

Over the past 10 years, despite the fact that pirates were making international waterways unsafe, these naval fleets have been the ones that have helped 'our commercial and oil vessels safely pass through dangerous areas' more than hundreds of times, he added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2314556	2025-01-16T06:40:10-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/05/manar-00891400016855293234.jpg
President Aoun: Ongoing Israeli Violations in South Lebanon Under...	President of the Republic, Joseph Aoun, on Thursday welcomed a fresh ceasefire agreement in Gaza, hoping that the deal will 'end the tragic reality' the battered Strip, and appreciating the international efforts in that respect. President Aoun reiterated the right of the Palestinians to establish their sovereign state under the international legitimacy resolutions. Regarding the situation in South Lebanon, President Aoun said, 'Israel’s serious commitment to the clauses of the agreement requires a follow-up by the sponsoring states and the United Nations, because the Israeli enemy has always evaded its commitments and ignored the international resolutions.' Al-Manar reporter Ali Shoeib affirmed that the Israeli occupation forces carried out two operations of blowing up houses in Aita Al-Shaab town, adding that Zionist tanks advanced from Maron Al-Ras town into the outskirts of Bint Jbeil City and raided houses there. The Zionist occupation troops also stormed houses in Taybeh town for the sake of vandalizing detonating them. The reporter noted that such violations have been behind the delay of the deployment of the Lebanese military units in the border villages, including Aitaroun and Mais Al-Jabal. The Israeli drones also flew at a low altitude over Beirut's Dahiyeh.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2314490	2025-01-16T02:55:33-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-018448300173643361510.jpeg

Following his meeting on Tuesday with President of the Republic, Joseph Aoun, and House Speaker, Nabih Berri, at Baabda Presidential Palace, Prime Minister-Designate, Judge Nawaf Salam, expressed gratitude to Lebanese citizens for their trust, pledging to tackle the challenging mission of serving Lebanon. 'It is time to embark on a new chapter rooted in justice, security, progress, and equal opportunities, making Lebanon a nation of free individuals with equal rights and responsibilities,' Salam stated. The PM-Designate highlighted the dire need for reconstruction efforts, emphasizing the plight of citizens in the Bekaa, the south, and Beirut whose homes and institutions remain devastated. 'Rebuilding is not just a promise but a commitment,' Salam affirmed. The PM then called for extending the authority of the Lebanese state across all its territories and urged the government to implement a comprehensive plan to build a productive economy and create job opportunities for future generations. Advocating for the adoption of expanded administrative decentralization, Salam stressed the importance of reforming Lebanon’s patronage-based administration and achieving justice for the victims of the Beirut Port explosion, as well as fairness for depositors who lost their savings. 'I am not for exclusion but for unity, not for marginalization but for national partnership,' Salam declared, extending his hands to all parties to initiate reforms and ensure that no citizen feels sidelined.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2313478	2025-01-14T09:19:33-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-06402000017368751614.png
Israeli Procrastination Delays Lebanese Army Deployment in South ...	The Lebanese Army delayed the deployment of the military units in the border villages of Aitaroun, Mais Al-Jabal and Houla because of the ongoing Israeli procrastination represented by more ceasefire violations. In this regard, the Israeli enemy executed more explosions in Aitaroun, Mais Al-Jabal, and Aita Al-Shaab towns, destroying and incinerating more houses. According to Al-Manar reporter, the occupation forces stormed the villages and fired gunshots, shells, and grenades at the houses, delaying the deployment of the Lebanese Army. The same Zionist scheme occurred in Hamames Hill area where the Lebanese Army intended to deploy troops, but the Zionist violations prevented the move. It is worth noting that the Israeli drones flew on Tuesday at a low altitude over Beirut's Dahiyeh.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2313445	2025-01-14T09:16:10-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-04113150017368749649.jpeg
Critical Hours Ahead for Gaza Ceasefire Negotiations: What to exp...	As the Israeli enemy's war on Gaza enters its 466th day, the besieged enclave stands as a symbol of resilience against an unprecedented campaign of destruction and genocide, carried out with global complicity and silence. Despite relentless attacks, Gaza has refused to surrender. The Palestinian resistance has engaged the Israeli occupation forces at close range, inflicting heavy losses and proving that its resolve cannot be broken. Over 46,000 Palestinians—children, women, men, and fighters—have been martyred, yet the resistance continues to strike back. Every time Israeli occupation forces believe they've secured a foothold, new resistance emerges, keeping them locked in a costly cycle of attrition. Northern Gaza: A Testament to Failure In northern Gaza, the Israeli enemy’s aim of 'zero confrontation' through systematic genocide and forced displacement has also faltered. Last week in Beit Hanoun, the Israeli occupation forces faced significant setbacks, acknowledging their failure even as they tried to regroup their forces. The Question of Prisoners One of the Israeli enemy’s primary objectives has been the retrieval of its captives. However, its strategy of annihilation has failed to achieve this. Any resolution remains contingent on agreements dictated by the Palestinian resistance, which, despite enduring immense hardship, has maintained its strength and thwarted Israel’s attempts to establish full control, even over small areas of the enclave. Ceasefire Talks Spark Internal Tensions As reports emerge of a potential ceasefire agreement in the coming hours or days, tensions within the Zionist government are boiling over. Far-right ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich are threatening to resign if the agreement moves forward. Ben Gvir criticized the deal as a 'surrender,' urging Smotrich to join him in pressuring Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Meanwhile, Israeli Channel 12 reported that Smotrich is consulting with senior rabbis over the prisoner exchange deal. The right-wing minister, who previously called the agreement a 'disaster for Israel’s national security,' hinted at issuing an ultimatum to Netanyahu in the coming hours. He condemned the proposed terms, which reportedly involve releasing high-profile Palestinian prisoners, ending the war, and nullifying Israel's so-called achievements. Admission of Defeat Through the voices of its leaders, the Zionist entity has effectively acknowledged its failure. The narrative of invincibility is crumbling as the war shifts from conquest to survival for an occupation increasingly entangled in its miscalculations. Positive Progress in Doha Negotiations Spokesman for the Qatari Foreign Ministry, Majed bin Mohammad Al-Ansari, announced today that discussions in Doha have entered the final stages. He described the talks as 'productive and positive,' focusing on the last remaining details, and hinted that an official announcement of the agreement is imminent. 'We have overcome the primary obstacles in the disagreements between the parties,' Al-Ansari stated, adding, 'When the agreement is announced, it will also mark the start of the ceasefire implementation.' He further noted that draft agreements have been submitted, and negotiations are now centered on resolving the final details regarding the Gaza ceasefire. Urging both sides to finalize the deal, Al-Ansari emphasized the need to end the humanitarian tragedy in Gaza. Latest Developments in Negotiation Talks Amid these updates, US President-elect Donald Trump, in an interview with Newsmax, expressed optimism, saying he believes a deal on hostages and a Gaza ceasefire could be finalized by the weekend. Observers have noted that the negotiations are now entering critical hours. ISRAEL, HAMAS NEAR HOSTAGE DEAL?: 'We are very close to getting it done,' President-elect Donald Trump tells 'Rob Schmitt Tonight.' 'There's been a handshake.' pic.twitter.com/lRO9Ul1zHh — NEWSMAX (@NEWSMAX) January 14, 2025 Additionally, the deputy foreign minister of the Israeli occupation entity confirmed that Trump has pushed for the agreement to be concluded before his inauguration on January 20. 'I cannot disclose details of the deal, as we want to avoid statements that could affect the morale of the hostages’ families,' she said. A Closer Look at the Proposed Gaza Ceasefire Agreement According to leaks from Israeli enemy sources, the initial phase of the agreement will see the release of 33 Zionist prisoners, including women, children, and the wounded. In exchange, Palestinian prisoners will be freed according to a specific mechanism, and a ceasefire in Gaza will be enacted. Second Phase to Begin After 16 Days An official from the Israeli occupation revealed that, 16 days after the agreement is implemented, negotiations will begin for the second phase. This will include the release of remaining live hostages—male soldiers and men of military age—along with the return of the bodies of those who died during captivity. Gradual Israeli Withdrawal and Security Arrangements The agreement outlines a gradual Israeli withdrawal, though forces will remain near the border. It also includes security arrangements for the 'Philadelphi Corridor' (Salah Al-Din) on the southern edge of Gaza, with Israeli enemy withdrawal from parts of the area within days of the agreement's enactment. Return of Civilians and Restrictions Civilians from northern Gaza will be allowed to return, with mechanisms in place to prevent weapon transfers. The Israeli enemy will also withdraw from the 'Netzarim' area in central Gaza, which had previously been rejected in negotiations. Prisoner Release Details The deal includes the release of Palestinians convicted of killings or attacks resulting in death, although the number will depend on the number of remaining live hostages—still unknown. However, prisoners involved in the Operation Al-Aqsa Flood on October 7, 2023, will not be included in the release list. This marks a significant victory for the resistance, as the Israeli occupation had previously refused to release those it categorized as 'convicted murderers' or sentenced to life imprisonment. Progress Towards Final Agreement These developments coincide with reports from inside Gaza that Zionist forces have begun dismantling some of their positions in the Netzarim area. Sources from the 'Jerusalem Post' suggest that, barring last-minute changes, an announcement on the deal could come today. Recent Diplomatic Efforts Earlier on Monday, Axios reported that Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had agreed to concessions regarding withdrawals from the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors and new terms for releasing Palestinian prisoners. This comes as Netanyahu consults with security leaders. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden spoke with Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, reaffirming that a deal is imminent. Qatar's emir also met with a Hamas delegation, who expressed their positive stance on the ongoing negotiations in Doha. Palestinian Resistance: No Compromise on Red Lines A Hamas official told CNN on Monday that several points of contention remain in the ongoing negotiations. Key issues include Hamas’s demand for the Israeli occupation’s withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor and a call for a permanent ceasefire instead of a temporary halt to military operations. Qatar Presents Final Draft An informed source involved in the prisoner swap negotiations in Doha stated that Qatar has delivered a 'final draft' of the ceasefire and prisoner release agreement aimed at ending the war. According to Reuters, a breakthrough occurred in Doha after midnight, following talks between Israeli intelligence chiefs, US President-elect Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witztkopf, and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. The coming hours will be crucial in determining the outcome of the discussions. Resistance forces emphasize that the final agreement must reflect the sacrifices and resilience of Gaza's people.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2313390	2025-01-14T06:52:43-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-01552600017307483156.jpg
Iran Unveils Cutting-Edge Zagros Destroyer, Showcasing Naval Prow...	The Iranian Navy is set to receive a new state-of-the-art indigenous destroyer, the Zagros. The announcement was made by Iranian Navy Commander Rear Admiral Shahram Irani, who hailed the vessel as a 'unique' and 'distinctive' addition to the country's naval forces. 'This week, a unique military vessel called Zagros, [which is developed] with Iranian knowledge and capabilities and [enjoys] distinctive features, will be launched into the water to start operating in the region,' Irani said on Monday. He described the Zagros as the 'newest and the most state-of-the-art destroyer' in the Iranian Navy, designed for both combat and intelligence missions.

He praised the high quality of Iran's vessel manufacturing industry, noting that the '86th fleet of Iran's Navy' has showcased the country's maritime capabilities to the world. Highlighting Iran's self-sufficiency in surface and sub-surface vessel production, Irani said the country's naval forces have increased their presence in international waters to protect naval routes and provide security for merchant vessels and tankers. He also mentioned the Iranian Navy's participation in joint military drills with countries like Russia, China, and Pakistan in recent years, aimed at enhancing combat readiness. Irani's remarks reflect Iran's determination to bolster its naval prowess and demonstrate its technological advancements to the international community. The introduction of the Zagros destroyer is seen as a significant step in Iran's efforts to enhance its maritime capabilities and assert its presence in the region and beyond. The Iranian naval forces have also staged several military drills with different countries, including Russia, China and Pakistan, over the past years to promote combat readiness. They have also been involved in joint efforts aimed at countering piracy and maritime terrorism, exchanging information in naval rescue and relief operations as well as sharing operational and tactical experience to enhance the security and stability of international maritime trade.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2313258	2025-01-14T03:33:53-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-02244100017368544197.jpg

Yemeni Armed Forces Earlier on Tuesday, Israeli media reported that a missile launched from Yemen disrupted air traffic at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv. In recent weeks, the Yemeni Armed Forces have intensified their pro-Palestinian operations, targeting Israeli military sites in the occupied territories with advanced hypersonic ballistic missiles. In response, the United States and United Kingdom have conducted indiscriminate airstrikes on Yemen to counter these operations and support the Israeli enemy military. Despite these sustained attacks, Yemeni forces have remained steadfast, continuing to target vessels linked to Israel in the Red Sea. Since the war began in October 2023, Israeli actions have killed at least 46,584 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured over 109,731 others in Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2313236	2025-01-14T03:31:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-04186610017330712743.jpg

West Bank | Palestinian Authority Clashes in Jenin as IOF Conduct...	The Palestinian Authority's security forces continue their 40-day siege of Jenin Camp in the occupied West Bank, collaborating with the Israeli occupation against resistance fighters who are bravely defending against both. On Monday morning and at dawn, Israeli occupation forces launched a series of raids and incursions across the West Bank, resulting in arrests in various areas. Israeli enemy bulldozers also demolished a house, two commercial structures, and an agricultural room while also tearing down walls and stone fences in Hazma, northeast of occupied Jerusalem. A house and an agricultural facility were also destroyed in Qalqilya under the pretext of unlicensed construction. BREAKING: Palestinian Authority (PA) forces have besieged the house of a Palestinian resistance activist in the town of Tubas, north of the occupied West Bank, seeking his detention. The latter, however, was not present at the house at the time of the attack. pic.twitter.com/UErrJw3BL7 — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) January 13, 2025 Clashes Erupt in Jenin Clashes erupted today between Palestinian Authority security forces and resistance fighters near Jenin camp. A child was injured by shrapnel in the foot, and intense gunfire broke out on Mahyoub Street. This followed the PA's failed attempt the previous night to infiltrate the camp through the Al-Damj neighborhood. Resistance fighters successfully targeted a military armored vehicle belonging to PA forces in the Al-Damj area, causing it to catch fire and forcing the occupants to flee. The PA's aggression also led to power outages in the Al-Damj area and widespread damage to surrounding streets and houses. In the past two days, PA security forces intensified their use of grenades and RPGs, which hit homes in the camp, injuring several residents. The Jenin Brigade confirmed that resistance in the camp remains unified, with no distinction between Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, all standing as one. Arrests and Ongoing Raids In the latest wave of raids and arrests, PA forces detained Abu Diyaa Salama, the father of a martyr, while he was being transferred by an ambulance to Jenin Government Hospital after being shot in the foot. The PA also arrested Majdi Al-Saydali from Jenin and brothers Aseed and Hamouda Al-Hamshari from Jenin camp while they were en route to Tulkarem. Additionally, Israeli occupation forces arrested five Palestinians during their raids on Nablus city and Ein camp. The forces entered the city’s Al-Ta'awon Street, raiding multiple homes, searching them, and tampering with their contents, resulting in the arrest of two individuals. In Ein Camp, west of Nablus, Israeli enemy forces blocked traffic from nearby streets, raided several homes, and arrested three Palestinians. During the raid on Ein camp, a Zionist soldier reportedly beat a young man, according to a Red Crescent medic. In Salfit province, Zionist forces detained dozens of Palestinians from the town of Deir Istiya. The Prisoners’ Club reported that around 70 Palestinians, including elderly individuals with chronic illnesses, were arrested after their homes were raided. The Israeli occupation forces have also blocked the main entrance to Deir Istiya with dirt mounds for several days, preventing entry and exit from the town. Military checkpoints have been tightened around the area, and frequent incursions continue. Clashes and Raids in Hebron In Hebron province, Israeli enemy forces carried out several incursions across various areas, simultaneously setting up military checkpoints and harassing Palestinians. They raided the city of Halhul early on Monday, storming dozens of homes, ransacking them, and conducting hours-long field interrogations with residents. Additionally, a military checkpoint was set up under the Beit Kahil bridge, where Israeli forces began inspecting Palestinian vehicles. Ground troops also raided 'Jabal Al-Rahma' in Hebron city, deploying sound bombs in the area. Israeli enemy forces also stormed the town of Dura, firing sound bombs and toxic gas canisters, though no injuries or arrests were reported. Demolition Operations and Arrests in Jerusalem Israeli occupation forces continued their demolition operations, targeting the foundation of a house belonging to the Abdul Salam Faza’ Al-Omari family, a carpentry workshop owned by the Mohammad Khaled Al-Khati family, and an agricultural room. The forces also demolished walls and stone fences in the town of Al-Eizariya, east of Jerusalem, and distributed threatening leaflets to local residents.

Additionally, three Palestinians were arrested during the operation. The detainees include 15-year-old Zain Amer and young men Hassan Sayel al-Khatib and Muadh Abdul Rahman al-Khatib, all of whom were taken from their homes. In 2024, demolition operations in the occupied Jerusalem Governorate reached approximately 380, including 92 instances of forced self-demolition, 259 demolitions carried out by Israeli enemy bulldozers, and 29 land leveling operations. Additionally, the IOF demolished a house under construction, an agricultural facility, and leveled farmland in the eastern area of Qalqilya in the occupied West Bank today. Military reinforcements stormed the village of Al-Funduq, where they demolished a 150-square-meter house under construction belonging to the Hamouda Muhaysen family, citing lack of building permits. The Zionist forces also destroyed an agricultural facility that included a shed, a greenhouse, and a water tank, belonging to the Mohammed Amin Tayem family. The facility, located on approximately four dunams of land, incurred significant material losses. Recently, Israeli occupation forces established an iron gate at the entrance of the village, connecting the cities of Qalqilya and Nablus, causing severe disruptions to Palestinian movement.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2312697	2025-01-13T05:41:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-02688310017367756402.jpg
Iranian Army Bolsters Defenses with 1,000 Advanced Drones	The Iranian Army has integrated as many as 1,000 strategic, stealth, and anti-fortification drones into its Combat Organization. The delivery of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) was overseen by top military commanders on Monday. The drone integration was ordered by Army Chief Commander Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi and supervised by Defense Minister Brigadier General Aziz Nasirzadeh, along with commanders of the Ground Forces, Air Defense Forces, Air Forces, and Navy. The new drones of the Iranian army able to land on the sea Addressing the ceremony to add 1,000 strategic drones to the army, Iran's Defense Minister said that the new drones which are used in defense and hybrid missions have the ability to land and take off in the sea. pic.twitter.com/Kbu0vJCwWp — IRNA News Agency (@IrnaEnglish) January 13, 2025 'These drones can fly over 2,000 kilometers, have immense destructive power, and can penetrate enemy defenses thanks to their low radar profiles,' said Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari, the Army's Deputy Chief for Coordination. The new drones boast long endurance and autonomous capabilities, allowing them to carry out missions without the need for constant navigation or control. Military officials say the drones will enhance Iran's special operations, surveillance, border control, and long-range strike capabilities. Jointly developed by military scientists, the Ministry of Defense, and knowledge-based companies, these UAVs are produced in the Army's drone manufacturing facilities and will be deployed to necessary bases and regions. The Iranian Army's fleet was expanded in January of last year with a large number of homegrown unmanned aerial vehicles suitable for various military operations. The UAVs, designed by Defense Ministry experts, include multipurpose strategic Ababil-4 and Ababil-5 drones that can be used for reconnaissance, patrol missions, electronic warfare, data collection, and aerial combat. The Army has also received new Arash drones, which can carry out long-range suicide missions with pinpoint accuracy. The drone deployment comes just a day after the Iranian Army unveiled a new laser-based air defense system, dubbed 'Seraj (Light),' during military exercises near the Fordow uranium enrichment facility. Authorities described the system as one layer of the site's multilayered air defenses.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2312664	2025-01-13T04:46:13-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-06005010017367723565.jpg
Gaza’s Hospitals Turned into ‘Mass Graves’ Amid Hellish Israeli O...	Gaza's health ministry has described the situation in the northern Gaza Strip as 'literally like hell,' as ‘Israel's’ ongoing ground offensive and siege have turned hospitals into 'mass graves.' 'The situation is literally like hell,' said Munir al-Barsh, the director general of the Ministry of Health in Gaza, on Sunday. He said daily Israeli attacks and the regime's ban on food deliveries to medical staff trapped in the north's hospitals have created a dire humanitarian crisis. Several civilians were injured early this morning in an Israeli airstrike targeting a house in the Shujaiya neighborhood of Gaza City, according to local sources. pic.twitter.com/EATlg1zs1f — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) January 13, 2025 'Hospitals in northern Gaza have turned into mass graves,' al-Barsh added, noting that the offensive and the destruction of hospitals, infrastructure, and any sign of life in the north are aimed at emptying the region of its residents. According to al-Barsh, 5,000 people have been killed or gone missing, while 9,500 others have been injured since the start of Israel's offensive on the north of Gaza in early October 2024. The regime's forces have also abducted about 2,300 people, including 65 medical staff, during the ongoing Israeli agression. Another morning of grief and tears in Gaza as Israel's genocide campaign continues for the sixteenth month in a row. pic.twitter.com/TKgXZxn9bl — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) January 13, 2025 Al-Barsh slammed the 'disgraceful' silence of the international community on 'Israel's' atrocities, which he said have 'deepened the suffering of innocent civilians.' ‘Israel’ launched a brutal war on Gaza on October 7, 2023, after the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas waged the surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Flood against the occupying entity in response to the Israeli regime's decades-long campaign of bloodletting and devastation against Palestinians. The regime's bloody onslaught on Gaza has so far killed at least 46,565 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured more than 109,660 others. Thousands more are also missing and presumed dead under rubble, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Despite talks of a ceasefire agreement around the corner, Israel continues to perpetrate massacres against innocent civilians in Gaza. This was the scene a couple of minutes ago following an Israeli airstrike on the al-Daraj neighborhood of Gaza City. pic.twitter.com/2QrEgipc4u — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) January 13, 2025 However, a study by the UK's Lancet medical journal estimates the actual number of deaths in the war is much higher than the official toll, suggesting the ministry's figures likely undercounted the death toll by 41 percent in the first nine months of the conflict as Gaza's healthcare infrastructure unraveled.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2312631	2025-01-13T04:34:59-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-09111270017298671932.jpg
Lebanese President Aoun Kicks Off Parliamentary Consultations to ...	Lebanon’s new president, Joseph Aoun, has initiated binding parliamentary consultations to nominate a prime minister-designate for the next government. The consultations began at 8:00 AM on Monday at Baabda Palace, where President Aoun is holding successive meetings with parliamentary blocs. The name of the prime minister-designate will be announced at the conclusion of these discussions. A significant number of MPs backed Judge Nawaf Salam. Among his supporters were Adib Abdul Massih, Osama Saad, Michel Daher, Charbel Massaad, Paula Yacoubian, Ibrahim Mneimneh, Cynthia Zarazir, Melhem Khalaf, Halima Kaakour, Najat Saliba, Elias Jaradeh, and Firas Hamdan. Mneimneh emphasized the strategic importance of Salam’s nomination to foster consensus and seize a rare opportunity. Zarazir and Khalaf underscored Salam’s independence and the need for fresh leadership outside the traditional political class. Najib Mikati also garnered notable support. MPs Jean Talouzian, Abdul Rahman Bizri, Jihad Al-Samad, Bilal Al-Hashimi, Ghassan Skaff, Haidar Nasser, and Abdul Karim Kabbara endorsed him, with many citing his role in ensuring stability and continuity. Skaff described Mikati as the ideal figure to lead the first government under the new presidential term. MP Elias Bou Saab refrained from naming any candidate, expressing concerns about escalating political divisions. Meanwhile, Jamil Al-Sayyed adopted a conditional stance, stating he would vote for Mikati only if his tally matched Nawaf Salam's; otherwise, he would abstain. The first round of these binding parliamentary consultations concluded with Nawaf Salam receiving 12 votes, while Najib Mikati secured 8 votes, including the vote from MP Jamil Al-Sayyed. One vote cast was recorded for 'no one.' The second and final phase will begin at 2:00 PM Beirut time.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2312576	2025-01-13T03:44:37-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-05305120017367686389.jpg

The strikes on Sunday were followed by further violations on Monday morning, with occupation forces combing the southern town of Khiam with medium and heavy weapons, National news Agency reported. Earlier on Sunday more Israeli violations were reported across south Lebanon, as the Lebanese Army deployed in the South’s Western Sector. On Sunday, Israeli and Lebanese media reported that the US Special Envoy Amos Hochstein told Lebanon during a visit last week that the United States guarantees full Israeli withdrawal before the end of the 60-day deadline of the ceasefire.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2312191	2025-01-12T22:44:10-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-02919560017367505996.jpg
Israeli Cyberwarfare Targets Lebanese Netizens	Since cyberwarfare has become a major aspect of the military confrontations in the world, the Israeli enemy has been using social media in order pervade misleading ideas and carrying out spy missions against individuals and groups. Lebanon's Internal Security Forces warned a few days ago about one of the new accounts, and warned against entering and browsing an account via the 'X' application named (@payameabi), which contains posts in Persian supporting the Israeli enemy A post was published in Arabic addressed the Lebanese people, calling on them to disclose information pertaining to Hezbollah. This account is managed by Israeli intelligence with the aim of recruiting agents, and its center is Tel Aviv. Legal experts spoke to Al-Manar about the penalties in Lebanon for dealing with the enemy, which depend mainly on the type of crime and its severity, but the most prominent penalties include: - Execution: in the case of espionage or providing sensitive information to the enemy. - Life imprisonment: in the case of cooperation with the enemy without causing direct harm that threatens security. - Imprisonment for a specified period: in cases limited to providing non-sensitive information or less important threats. In the event of a war with the enemy, the penalties may become more severe, as anyone proven to have dealt with the enemy will be treated as a 'traitor' to the homeland. Since the ceasefire took into effect on November 27, 2024, the Israeli enemy carried out an invasion of the Lebanese cuber system, sending messages, dialing phone numbers and publishing posts with fake job offers. The Lebanese security agencies warned the citizens against interacting with such posts and messages, wowing a serious confrontation with the enemy's cyber invasion.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2312048	2025-01-12T09:44:18-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-05134760017367038508.jpg
Intensified Diplomatic Efforts Seek Gaza Deal as ‘Israel’ Admits ...	Israeli media reported that an agreement on a prisoner swap between Israel and Hamas is nearly finalized. In this regard, Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported, based on political sources, that 90% of the details have been agreed upon. Neither Hamas nor the mediating countries, Egypt, Qatar and the US, have made an official statement confirming the agreement. The main point of disagreement is said to be Hamas' demand for guarantees from 'Israel' regarding the implementation of the second phase of the agreement related to the halt of the Zionist war. Although the exact details of the first and second phases of a potential agreement have not been fully disclosed, sources from the newspaper suggested that the first phase involves the release of elderly and sick prisoners for humanitarian reasons, while the second involves the release of military personnel. Following progress in negotiations, Steven Witkoff, a representative of US President-elect Donald Trump, is reported to have made a surprise visit Saturday to 'Israel', where he met Netanyahu. Witkoff expressed optimism to Netanyahu, saying they believe a deal could be reached soon. Israel's state television, KAN, citing foreign sources, reported Friday that Tel Aviv agreed to advance negotiations on the second phase of the agreement while the first phase is being implemented, to ensure the continuation of the process until all prisoners are released. The prisoner swap and cease-fire talks, mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the US have been interrupted several times due to new conditions imposed by Netanyahu. Families of prisoners in 'Israel' accuse Netanyahu of obstructing the cease-fire and prisoner swap agreement. Israeli military attacks on Gaza, meanwhile, continue without pause. Health Ministry in Gaza updated the toll of Israeli war since October 7, 2023, recording 46,565 martyrs and 109,660 injuries. The Zionist military reports indicated that 835 officers and soldiers have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the war, including 400 since the beginning of the ground offensive, as the Palestinian resistance continues to confront the occupation forces, targeting them in the various cities and towns of the Strip. The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants in November for Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. 'Israel' also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2311938	2025-01-12T05:13:48-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-04707930017366876232.jpg

At least 16 people were now confirmed dead from fires that have ripped through the city, leaving communities in ruins and testing the mettle of thousands of firefighters — and millions of California residents.

'Critical fire-weather conditions will unfortunately ramp up again today for southern California and last through at least early next week,' the National Weather Service said. 'This may lead to the spread of ongoing fires as well as the development of new ones.' Row The Palisades fire was 11 percent contained Saturday but had grown to 23,600 acres (9,500 hectares), while the Eaton Fire was at 14,000 acres and 15 percent contained. Official figures show more than 12,000 structures burned, but Cal Fire's Todd Hopkins said not all were homes, and the number would also include outbuildings, recreational vehicles and sheds.

One Year of US-UK Failure: Yemen’s Resilience and Support for Gaz...	It has now been a year since the US and UK launched their aggression against Yemen on January 12 of the previous year, aiming to secure Israeli shipping in the Red Sea. However, the operation has ended in failure. The primary goal of the US and UK's direct involvement was to deter Yemen and halt its support for Gaza. Over time, however, the aggression became a significant burden for Washington, as Yemeni strikes targeted US and UK warships, naval vessels, and commercial ships across the Red Sea, Arabian Sea, and Indian Ocean. The outcome of this year-long aggression has transformed Yemen into a formidable military power, partially breaking America’s naval dominance. US aircraft carriers, warships, and destroyers were forced to retreat from the Red Sea while Yemen asserted control over its turbulent waters. Yemenis stand on the beach as the Galaxy Leader commercial ship, seized by Yemen’s revolutionaries in November, is anchored off the coast of Al-Salif, Yemen (photo by Reuters). Yemen’s Support for Gaza In support of Gaza, Yemen’s armed forces began targeting vessels associated with the Israeli enemy in the Red Sea. This intervention comes as Gaza faces an Israeli-led genocide and an unprecedented siege. Yemen set one condition for halting its operations: the cessation of aggression and the lifting of the blockade on Gaza. In a historic speech three days after Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, Abdulmalik Al-Houthi declared that Yemen would not remain passive in the face of Gaza's suffering. He famously stated, 'You are not alone,' reaffirming Yemen’s commitment to defend Gaza if the US backed the Israeli occupation entity. What a GREAT Yemen! Hezbollah leader praises Yemeni resistance against the Israeli regime, comparing the impoverished Arab country to the wealthy Arab states for their inaction in the face of Israeli genocide. pic.twitter.com/eC8XKYajp4 — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) January 4, 2025 Israeli Concerns Over the US-UK Aggression Against Yemen Many within Zionist circles have expressed concern over the failure of the joint US-UK aggression against Yemen. They have called for reigniting Yemen’s internal conflict to distract the country from supporting Palestinians. Could the US-UK Alliance Turn the Tide for the Israeli Enemy? This crucial question has circulated among Zionist officials following the recent aggression against Yemen. Most responses have cautioned against relying on this alliance to break Yemen’s resolve or force its retreat. This uncertainty led the Israel enemy to place its air defense systems on high alert, anticipating a Yemeni response that would expose the failure of Israeli expectations. Zionist experts have reviewed the nature of the recent aggression, focusing on how the coalition partners shared roles in the operation. They emphasized the message the Israeli occupation hoped to send during the large Palestinian solidarity protests in Sanaa's Tahrir Square. Moreover, these experts have reiterated the importance of provoking internal conflict in Yemen, hoping factions within the country would resume fighting against the Yemeni government in Sanaa, thus diverting attention from Yemen’s external support for Palestine. Yemeni Armed Forces Target Key Site in Occupied Jaffa with Hypersonic Missile 'Palestine-2' United States' Strategic Missteps Washington should have focused on halting the war and lifting the Israeli siege on Gaza rather than rallying nations to attack Yemen, a country legally justified under international law to intervene in support of Gaza. The United States likely hoped that forming this alliance would intimidate Yemen into ceasing its support for Gaza, leaving the Arab world as passive spectators to the US-Israeli genocide in Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2311674	2025-01-11T11:10:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-02168500017050333731.jpg
Lebanese Army Deploys Across Southern Lebanon Amid Ongoing Israel...	The Lebanese Army has initiated deployment in towns across southern Lebanon, including Al-Qouzah, Yater, Beit Lif, and the outskirts of Ramya in the Bint Jbeil district, following the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces. Units also moved into Al-Naqoura and Al-Bayyada in the Tyre district, establishing a presence in these areas. The army announced on January 7th its deployment across several southern locations, such as Ras Al-Naqoura, Alma Al-Shaab, Tayr Harfa—Tyre, Beit Lif—Bint Jbeil, and other towns in the western and central sectors, reclaiming territory vacated by Zionist forces. In Al-Naqoura, specialized units continue operations to clear unexploded ordnance, remove debris, and reopen roads. These efforts are being conducted in coordination with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the five-nation committee overseeing the ceasefire agreement. Despite the ceasefire agreement, Israeli occupation forces launched stun grenades toward the town of Ayta Al-Shaab, attempting to intimidate civilians entering the area. The Lebanese Army had previously warned residents to wait for military clearance operations to be completed before returning. In the eastern sector, the army's planned deployment to the Al-Hammams Hill site faced delays due to Israeli enemy stalling. Meanwhile, Israeli occupation military vehicles were observed moving along the Abu Zainab-Tal Al-Nahhas road toward the Metula settlement, signaling ongoing activity in the area. Al-Manar correspondent toured the Wadi Al-Oyoun area, reaching the town of Hanin to assess its condition and the damage caused by Israeli aggression. Circulating video shows Lebanese Army vehicles entering Ramya town amid widespread destruction caused by Israeli attacks Israeli Violations Persist in Southern Lebanon Israeli occupation forces continue their violations in southern Lebanon, as reported by Al-Manar’s correspondent. The Zionist army carried out an explosion near the outskirts of Alma Al-Shaab and constructed additional earthworks along a newly established military road connecting the Al-Dhaira site to a new position west of the town. In the eastern sector, Israeli occupation forces were observed moving vehicles from Al-Hamames Hill towards the Metula area. While there had been discussions regarding the Lebanese Army repositioning at Al-Hamames Hill near Khiyam, Israeli delays have hindered progress. Drone Surveillance Intensifies IOF drones, including the Hermes 450 and Hermes 900 models, resumed high-altitude surveillance over border areas, coinciding with the ongoing deployment of Lebanese Army units along the southern border. Lebanese Army Deployment Progresses The Lebanese Army is set to establish military checkpoints as part of its initial deployment phase. This will restrict civilian access due to significant damage from recent Israeli airstrikes and bulldozer operations, as well as the presence of unexploded ordnance. Army engineering units will conduct thorough sweeps to secure the areas before civilians are allowed to return. تستكمل وحدات الجيش الانتشار في رأس الناقورة – صور وبلدات في القطاع الغربي علما الشعب، الضهيرة، عيترون، بنت جبيل، طيرحرفا، مجدل زون، الصالحني والقوزح بعد انسحاب العدو الإسرائيلي، وتعمل على تعزيز التمركز وتأمين النقاط المهمة، بالتنسيق مع قوة الأمم المتحدة المؤقتة في لبنان –… pic.twitter.com/61q04Sw5zS — الجيش اللبناني (@LebarmyOfficial) January 11, 2025 The deployment will expand to other villages, including Blida and Mays Al-Jabal, and will eventually cover the entire eastern sector.

Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najb Mikati arrived in Damascus on Saturday for talks with Syria's de facto leader, Ahmed Al-Sharaa, marking the first visit by a sitting Lebanese premier to Syria in over a decade. Mikati, accompanied by a senior delegation including Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib and top security officials, landed at Damascus International Airport aboard a Lebanese commercial flight. The visit follows a formal invitation from Al-Sharaa, extended during a phone call last week. In a joint press conference, Al-Sharaa stated, 'We are giving ourselves a chance to build a positive relationship in the upcoming stages based on the sovereignty of both Lebanon and Syria. We will maintain neutrality towards all parties in Lebanon and will try to resolve issues.'

In response to a question, Al-Sharaa added: 'We also raised the issue of border demarcation between the two countries.' Mikati, in turn, expressed optimism, stating, 'We affirmed that the good neighborly relations and mutual respect between our two peoples govern our relationship. It is our duty to activate these relations on the basis of national sovereignty for both countries and to work on preventing anything that might harm this relationship.' He also stressed the importance of addressing the refugee crisis, saying, 'It has become urgent for the benefit of both countries to address the issue of refugees' return to Syria, especially as this issue is putting significant pressure on Lebanon as a whole. I sensed understanding on this matter.' The leaders also focused on border security, ensuring that both countries remain safe from any harmful activities. Mikati concluded, 'This visit marks a positive start, and what I have sensed from Mr. Al-Sharaa regarding the relationship between the two countries reassures me.' The visit comes two days after Lebanese lawmakers elected the country’s army chief Joseph Aoun as president, ending a more than two-year vacancy.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2311443	2025-01-11T06:25:13-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-01921560017366051821.jpg
Gaza Endures 463rd Day of Zionist Occupation Crimes	The Israeli occupation forces have continued their crimes against the people of Gaza, carrying out a brutal and unrelenting assault for the 463rd consecutive day. This ongoing campaign of violence has resulted in a catastrophic humanitarian situation in the besieged Gaza Strip. The Palestinian Information Center reported that the occupation's aircraft and artillery have maintained a barrage of airstrikes and shelling, targeting civilian homes, gatherings of displaced persons, and streets across Gaza. This has led to the martyrdom of dozens of Palestinians, with many more injured, in a continuation of the occupation's campaign of terror.

This has resulted in horrific massacres and the demolition of citizens' homes in the Jabalia refugee camp. Hundreds of martyrs have fallen as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens.

This has exacerbated the suffering of the population, as the ongoing violent bombing campaign continues to disrupt the work of the Civil Defense, leaving thousands without access to critical humanitarian and medical care. According to Palestinian sources, the occupation's forces have continued to target civilian infrastructure and populations, with drone strikes, airstrikes, and artillery shelling hitting residential areas and claiming more lives. The bodies of martyrs and wounded have been pulled from the rubble, as the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. The Government Media Office in Gaza has confirmed that the Zionist occupation has completely wiped out 1,600 Palestinian families, killing all of their members, as part of the ongoing genocide that has plagued the Gaza Strip for 15 months. This has resulted in the martyrdom of more than 5,600 Palestinians from these families, in addition to the annihilation of 3,471 other families, with only one person remaining in each. The total death toll from these atrocities has exceeded 9,000 martyrs.

The toll of the Israeli military aggression continues to rise, with the number of martyrs exceeding 46,000 since October 7, 2023, and the number of wounded reaching more than 109,000, including many very serious cases.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2311377	2025-01-11T04:26:33-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-06215470017359053815.jpeg
Hochstein Told Lebanon US Guarantees Full Israeli Withdrawal befo...	US envoy Amos Hochstein reportedly said Washington guarantees that the Israeli enemy will fully withdraw from southern Lebanon before the 60-day deadline stipulated in the November 27 ceasefire, both Lebanese and Israeli media reported. According to the Lebanon-based Al-Akhbar newspaper, Hochstein made the promise when he was in Beirut earlier this week. The US envoy was also reportedly updated on an agreement between the Lebanese army and on Hezbollah pulling its forces north of the Litani River — about 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the border — and dismantling any remaining military infrastructure in the south, as stipulated by the ceasefire agreement.

Under the terms of the deal that Hochstein helped to broker, the Lebanese army is to deploy alongside United Nations peacekeepers in the south as the Israeli occupation army withdraws. For its part, Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation, Kan in Hebrew, also reported that the United States had guaranteed a complete withdrawal of the Israeli army from southern Lebanon before the end of the 60-day ceasefire. The Israeli occupation army have been going ahead with its violation to the ceasefire since it took effect earlier on November 27. On Friday, 6 Lebanese people were martyred and wounded at least two others in an Israeli strike on a van n the southern town of Teir Dibba.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2311311	2025-01-11T03:24:07-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-00451270017320075923.jpg
Iran Unveils ‘Dormant Volcano’ of Missile Power	The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has unveiled one of its newest and most sophisticated underground missile bases, described as a sprawling 'missile city' deep within Iran's mountainous terrain. The subterranean facility, broadcast on state television, showcases Iran's advanced missile capabilities, including the liquid-fueled Emad, Qadr, and Qiam projectiles. IRGC Commander Major General Hossein Salami and Aerospace Force Chief Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh led the tour, highlighting the base's strategic location and firepower. 'The volcano lying under these mountains can erupt in the shortest time possible,' the state TV report ominously noted, likening the hidden missile complex to a 'dormant volcano' ready to unleash its fury. ‘Dormant volcano’: IRGC unveils new subterranean missile facility — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) January 11, 2025 Salami boasted that Iran's missile production and capabilities continue to grow daily, dismissing claims that previous Israeli attacks had weakened the country's armed forces. He promised the IRGC would unveil even more new missiles and facilities in the near future. During the tour of the missile facility, Salami praised the IRGC forces involved in the two anti-Israel attacks and rejected the enemy’s mistaken belief that Iran’s capability to produce missiles had been harmed. 'Every day, the number of systems and missiles is augmented in the far corners of this land. Maybe the enemy thought that our production power has stagnated, but the growth rate of our missile power is up to date,' the IRGC chief said. 'All components of our power are improving, but missiles, their capacity and capability are increasing and improving every day both in quantity and quality and in efficiency and design.' Earlier in the day, Salami asserted that the Islamic Republic has more missiles than it can store, dismissing the enemy’s propaganda about the weakening of Iran’s armed forces following attacks by Israel on Iran and its regional allies. Salami added that the IRGC Aerospace Force would unveil more new missiles and missile facilities in the near future. The Armed Forces, including the IRGC and the country’s Army, have been continuously enhancing their military hardware and combat readiness in line with the directives of Leader of the Islamic Revolution Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei. The forces have vowed to defend the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of the threats by the Iranian nation’s enemies. The Islamic Republic launched some 200 missiles towards the Israeli entity’s military, and espionage and intelligence bases all over the occupied territories on October 1 as part of Operation True Promise II. The operation came in response to the regime’s assassinations of senior leaders of the Palestinian and Lebanese resistance and a senior IRGC commander.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2311234	2025-01-11T02:00:32-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-05448040017365896276.jpg
Israeli Air Raid on South Lebanon Town Claims 6 Martyrs in Worst ...	An Israeli air raid on a car and a van in Teir Dibba town, South Lebanon, claimed six martyrs and two injuries. NNA reported that Red Cross and Civil Defense ambulances moved the injured into Tyre hospitals, while the Lebanese Army cordoned off the scene. Teir Dibba municipality issued, in coordination with the Lebanese Army Intelligence, a statement that calls on the civilians to avoid attending the area targeted by the raid due to the presence of unexploded ordnance to be removed by the military tomorrow (Friday). The raid is considered the most blatant violation of the ceasefire in South Lebanon, which took into effect on November 27, 2024, with respect to the number of the martyrs and the location of the targeted area which is far away from the borders where most of the enemy's breaches used to take place in the past stage. Moreover, the Israeli occupation forces incurred into Taybeh town, opening fire at houses and incinerating a number of them. The Zionist artillery shells targeted Aita Shaab town which also witnessed a new hostile operation of blowing up houses. The Israeli enemy also executed major explosions in Kfar Kila town. Meanwhile, the Lebanese Army units continued deploying at Teir Harfa - Al-Jebbain as well as Al-Qawzah-Ramya-Aita Al-Shaab Triangles. The Army units also advanced into Aitaroun border town, reopening its main road which had been blocked by the enemy.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2310926	2025-01-10T11:25:33-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-07288010017365371281.jpg
US-British Air Raids Target Al-Sabeen Square during Million-man R...	The Zionist-American-British aggression launched a series of airraids on the capital, Sanaa, on Friday afternoon, coinciding with the weekly million-person march in support of Gaza. Yemeni media reported that the aggression targeted the vicinity of Al-Sabeen Square in the capital, coinciding with the mass turnout to participate in the weekly million-person marches in support of Gaza. In addition, the sources explained that the Israeli-American-British aggression targeted the Haiz Central Power Station in Sanhan District with eight raids. They reported that a worker at the Haiz Central Power Station was injured and citizens' homes were damaged as a result of the bombing of the power station by the American-Israeli-British aggression. Meanwhile, the million-man rally in Sanaa was not frightened by the US-UK-Zionist aggression. The protesters insisted on voicing their support for Gaza and the Armed Forces' actions in face of any aggression on Yemen. The participants held banners which affirm commitment to the path of supporting the Palestinian cause and facing the US-UK aggression on Yemen, challenging the air raids on the capital, Sanaa. The spokesman for the Yemeni Armed Forces, Brigadier General Yahya Sarea announced several military operations during the past 48 hours. The Yemeni Armed Forces, with the help of Allah Almighty, carried out several military operations during the past 48 hours, the most prominent of which was targeting the American aircraft carrier 'USS Harry S. Truman' and a number of its warships in the northern Red Sea region with a number of cruise missiles and drones, General Sarea said. The operation was carried out by the missile force and the air force, and the operation succeeded in thwarting a new air attack against our country from that carrier, which was forced with its warships to leave the northern Red Sea region, he added. 'Yesterday, the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out a targeting operation against a number of targets belonging to the Israeli enemy in the occupied area of Yaffa with three drones, and they were able to reach their targets successfully, thanks to Allah.' The operations came in context of triumphing for the oppression of the Palestinian people and their Mujahideen and response to the massacres against our people in Gaza, and within the fifth stage of the supportive stages in the battle of the Promised Conquest and the Holy Jihad, he noted. 'The Yemeni Armed Forces reiterate that they will continue to perform their duties towards the oppressed Palestinian people and that their operations will not stop until the aggression stops and the siege on the Gaza Strip is lifted.' Brigadier General Yahya Saree, spokesman of the Yemeni Armed Forces during a mass rally in support of Gaza in Sanaa (Friday, December 20, 2024).	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2310882	2025-01-10T09:21:18-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-09370640017365296719.png

Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades: Most Zionist Prisoners in Gaza’s North...	A senior official from Hamas' military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, stated in an interview with Al-Jazeera that most Israeli prisoners in the northern Gaza area are now considered missing due to ongoing Israeli enemy aggression. The official emphasized that the brigades had repeatedly warned about the consequences of Israeli occupation actions in Gaza. Al-Qassam Brigades Hold Zionist Government Responsible for Prisoners' Fate The Al-Qassam official criticized Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli occupation military, accusing them of avoiding accountability for the fate of their soldiers. He reaffirmed that the brigades hold the Israeli enemy government and military fully responsible for the lives of the prisoners. For the 98th consecutive day, northern Gaza remains under a severe Israeli siege, with continuous air and artillery bombardment isolating the region from the rest of Gaza. Zionist Families Urge Swift Negotiations The warnings from a senior Al-Qassam leader come at a time when the families of Zionist prisoners in Gaza issued a statement saying, 'It would have been possible to return Youssef and Hamza Al-Zayadna alive if an agreement had been reached earlier.' This follows the Israeli occupation army's announcement that, 'After completing the identification process at the forensic institute, the Zayadna family was informed of the death of their son, Hamza, in Gaza, two days after the body of his father was discovered.' In the same context, Zionist enemy army spokesperson Daniel Hagari stated that 'forces from the army and Shin Bet managed to recover the body of Israeli soldier Youssef Al-Zayadna after locating it inside a tunnel in the Rafah area.' The families of the prisoners have urged Netanyahu and decision-makers to 'accelerate negotiations to immediately return all hostages,' adding, 'We have a historic opportunity to secure the release of the captives, and we should not squander it. Poll Shows 88% of Zionists Support Prisoner Swap Deal A recent survey by Maariv reveals that 88% of Zionists are in favor of reaching a prisoner swap deal. The poll also highlights a significant shift in political support, with the Likud party losing two seats this week while the opposition bloc gains 61 seats due to the ongoing war in Gaza. According to the poll, if elections were held today, Netanyahu's coalition would secure 49 seats, while the opposition would gain 61 seats, without relying on the Arab parties. Support for a Comprehensive Prisoner Swap The survey also found that 52% of Zionists support a comprehensive prisoner exchange deal, while 36% back a partial deal. Only 6% of respondents oppose the idea. Interestingly, 51% of coalition supporters favor a full swap, while 14% oppose it, with no opposition among supporters of the opposition bloc.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2310739	2025-01-10T05:27:18-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-07819070017319274025.jpg
Israeli Occupation Forces Escalate West Bank Raids, Resistance Cl...	Israeli occupation forces escalated their military campaign across various parts of occupied Palestine's West Bank late Thursday and early Friday, carrying out violent raids in Hebron and launching tear gas attacks during clashes in Beita, south of Nablus. Settlers also torched Palestinian-owned properties near Ramallah, further exacerbating tensions in the region. The fires that the West doesn't want to talk about.

Troops raided the town of Qabatiya near Jenin, searching the home of a man alleged to be connected to the attack. According to Israeli occupation officials cited by Israel Hayom, there are calls within the military to escalate operations in the West Bank, including deploying tanks, to confront Palestinian resistance groups. Meanwhile, Palestinian factions have pushed back against Israeli aggression. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in Jenin announced they had identified and engaged an undercover Israeli unit near Qabatiya, resulting in intense gun battles. Videos shared on Palestinian platforms showed Israeli military vehicles storming the town. At least eight Palestinians, including a woman, were arrested during Israeli raids in Qabatiyah. Similar operations were reported in Talluza and Bazan, north of Nablus, and the Jalazone refugee camp near Ramallah. In Ni'lin, west of Ramallah, a young Palestinian man was injured by live fire. Settler Violence and More Raids In Abu Falah, northeast of Ramallah, settlers set fire to a property, as documented by Palestinian media. Meanwhile, Israeli occupation forces conducted raids in Deir Istiya in Salfit and arrested several young men in Asira Al-Shamaliya near Nablus. In Hebron’s old city, two Palestinians suffered injuries after being attacked by Israeli soldiers on Thursday night. Israeli Forces Target Families of Prisoners Israeli occupation forces demolished two Palestinian homes in Tulkarm and Qalqilya on Friday, one of them for the second time. The first home, located in the Tulkarm refugee camp, belonged to the family of Mahmoud Sleit 'Abu Hanoud,' a Palestinian prisoner accused of involvement in the twin operations at Beit Lid and Bal’a in November 2023. This house had previously been partially demolished in September 2024.

The family was forced to evacuate before the explosion, which caused significant structural damage to the house and destroyed its contents. A vehicle belonging to the Badran family was also damaged in the blast. Expanding Settlements and Military Presence Hebron, another hotbed of Israeli enemy brutality, continues to see the proliferation of settlements. Approximately 500 settlers reside in the heart of the city, protected by hundreds of Israeli occupation soldiers. Across the West Bank, including east of occupied Jerusalem, over 720,000 settlers now live in illegal outposts, further entrenching the occupation and exacerbating tensions in the region.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2310673	2025-01-10T04:22:19-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-03998320017365115922.jpg
California Wildfires Leave 10 Dead, 130,000 Evacuated, $50 Billio...	At least 10 people have died, over 130,000 residents have been forced to evacuate, and approximately 10,000 structures have been destroyed by wildfires sweeping across Los Angeles, United States of America. Early damage estimates peg the losses at $50 billion. Uncontrollable Fires and Widespread Evacuations As of Thursday, five massive fires continued to rage, destroying homes, vehicles, and infrastructure. Two major wildfires remained out of control in the city, with firefighters working tirelessly to contain the flames after fierce winds driving the fires began to subside. However, meteorologists warned of continued fire risks through Friday. In the affluent Pacific Palisades neighborhood, nestled between Malibu and Santa Monica, fires burned through 6,500 hectares and more than 1,000 structures. Helicopters were deployed to combat the blaze. Meanwhile, Hollywood Hills saw fires near iconic landmarks like the Chinese Theatre and Hollywood Boulevard, though authorities lifted evacuation orders on Thursday after gaining control of the situation. 'Most Destructive Wildfires in Los Angeles History' The fires disrupted life in Los Angeles, halting film and TV productions and leading to the closure of Universal Studios Theme Park. The Oscar nominations announcement was postponed to January 19, and the Critics’ Choice Awards ceremony, scheduled for Sunday, was delayed. President Joe Biden described the fires as the 'largest and most destructive in California's history,' attributing their intensity to climate change. Declaring a major disaster, Biden held meetings with top officials to coordinate federal assistance. This is absolutely heartbreaking 😢. Our thoughts are with you at this very frightening time 🙏.#CaliforniaWildfires pic.twitter.com/hUUo7pBrUt — PROTECT ALL WILDLIFE (@Protect_Wldlife) January 9, 2025 California Governor Gavin Newsom revealed that over 7,500 firefighters, including reinforcements from other states and 400 National Guard troops, were battling the blazes. Private weather service AccuWeather estimated damages could reach $57 billion, warning this could become California’s worst wildfire disaster. Speculation on Causes and Political Fallout Authorities suspect electrical faults caused the fires, a recurring issue in California’s wildfire history. The ongoing crisis also became a political flashpoint, with former President Donald Trump blaming Democratic policies for water shortages, claiming they prioritize environmental causes over practical needs. His assertions were widely debunked, with experts pointing out that most water in Los Angeles supports agriculture, primarily sourced from the Colorado River. Trump demanded Governor Newsom’s resignation, calling the crisis a direct result of his leadership as the state continues to grapple with devastating losses and widespread displacement.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2310640	2025-01-10T03:32:23-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-09871220017365080486.png
Houthi: Hezbollah Preserves Strong Role in Lebanon, Trump’s Remar...	Head of Yemen's Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi tackled, on Thursday in a televised speech, the latest developments, indicating that the genocide crimes committed by the Zionist enemy in Gaza have exceeded 4,000 massacres, including 30 massacres this week. During the final days of Biden's presidency, he approved a major deal of bombs, shells, and ammunition for the Zionist enemy to kill children and women, he added. Sayyed Houthi said that the crime of starvation involves not only the Zionist enemy but also all the cowardly, stingy regimes that remain mere spectators as the Palestinian people starve, noting that the Zionist enemy continues its policy of rationing, allowing only minimal aid to enter Gaza. 'The Zionist enemy has formed gangs of traitors and collaborators to loot and seize aid near the military checkpoints it establishes in Gaza. This week, Zionist soldiers themselves have started directly looting the limited aid entering Gaza.' Houthi maintained the Zionist enemy has created a contaminated reality in Gaza, systematically targeting the entire healthcare infrastructure, adding that the attack on Kamal Adwan Hospital is a clear aggression and one of the major crimes committed by the Zionist enemy in Gaza. The Zionist enemy is now targeting the Indonesian Hospital and other hospitals providing minimal services under severe siege, he added. 'Zionist criminals in the Knesset continue to call for more crimes, tyranny, and destruction of all aspects of life. The Zionist enemy targets displaced individuals, leaving the entire population of Gaza in a state of displacement without real shelter centers.' The Zionist enemy seeks to use all means of genocide and deprivation of basic life essentials and legitimate human rights, Houthi said. Sayyed Houthi warned that the ultimate goal of the Zionist Jews is to completely destroy Al-Aqsa Mosque and build their alleged temple, with every step being deliberate. Houthi said that the Zionist enemy continues its violations in Lebanon, breaching the ceasefire agreement through shelling, gunfire, destruction, and demolition of homes. 'Despite its actions in southern Lebanon and its aggression on the country, the Zionist enemy has failed. The Zionist enemy has not achieved its declared goal of eliminating Hezbollah, which remains a strong presence in the Lebanese arena.' Ansarullah leader maintained that Hezbollah is recovering and growing stronger, maintaining a solid and unwavering front against the Zionist enemy, adding that the Zionist enemy, alongside the Americans and unfortunately with the cooperation of some Arab regimes, is targeting Lebanon's internal political scene. There is a significant responsibility on all Lebanese factions to act with awareness and prioritize the stability and interests of their country, he pointed out. 'Aligning with the Zionist enemy in Lebanon has severe consequences, even for those who serve its agenda. Those conspiring and destabilizing Lebanon are harming themselves while affecting the country's stability.' True national interests for all Lebanese lie in prioritizing internal stability, which benefits Lebanon as a whole, Houthi underlined. 'The Zionist enemy continues its aggression on Syria through airstrikes, targeting remaining factories. The Zionist enemy aims to solidify its control over the areas it recently invaded and occupied in Syria, proving its intention of permanent occupation.' The occupation in Syria serves Zionist interests, focused on exploitation and plunder, Sayyed Houthi warned. 'The Zionist enemy is bringing in more military reinforcements, constructing fortifications, and setting up prefabricated buildings in Syria. The Zionist enemy has reached the Al-Mantra Dam, the largest dam in southern Syria.' Houthi added that the Americans are establishing new military bases in eastern Syria, seeking to enhance their influence and control. The Yemeni leader noted that both the American and Zionist forces aim not only to occupy expanding territories but also to infiltrate Syria's internal affairs, adding that all Syrians must unite to protect their homeland from American and Zionist aggression. Sayyed Houthi clarified that the Zionist enemy has recently published a new map that includes areas in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan, following previously staged maps accompanied by provocative statements. 'Everyone in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Palestine must understand that the Zionist entity harbors aggressive ambitions for control and exploitation of these lands. The staged map released by the Zionist enemy is highly provocative and aggressive.' Houthi urged nations to stand strong and resilient to protect their nations from the American and Zionist threats and safeguard their lands and resources as free and independent peoples, adding that the current policies adopted by Jordan and Syria will not change the ambitions of the Zionist enemy, nor will they cause it to abandon its greed. 'The Zionist enemy remains determined in its ambitions and hostile policies, as evident in official statements and clear stances. Both the Zionist entity and the United States pursue aggressive, practical plans to achieve their hostile objectives.' Sayyed Houthi mentioned that the Hamas movement has shown significant flexibility in all rounds of negotiations, eliminating all excuses and justifications for the Americans and Zionists. 'Military operations on the Yemeni faith and fight front continued this week, targeting Zionist enemy objectives deep within occupied Palestine using hypersonic missiles and drones.' Sayyed Houthi added that the operations extended to occupied Jaffa and Ashkelon, targeting a substation and the 'Orot Rabin' power plant south of occupied Haifa. These operations have had a profound psychological impact on the enemy, exacerbating panic, anxiety, and fear, as the Zionists fail to intercept the missiles, Houthi highlighted. 'The scale of panic has expanded, with alarm sirens sounding in over 234 cities and towns in occupied Palestine, forcing more than half of Zionist settlers to seek refuge in shelters. Over half of Zionist settlers flee to shelters due to the continuous sounding of alarm sirens.' Sayyed Houthi indicated that the Zionist enemy is deeply concerned about its failure to intercept missiles launched by the Yemeni armed forces, adding that a Friday dawn missile, claimed to have been intercepted by the enemy, was clearly seen reaching its target in video footage, intensifying their worry. The enemy struggles with the high costs and widespread debris of its interceptive missiles, sometimes spreading over 80 kilometers, he added. 'Yemeni operations have significantly impacted the enemy’s aviation activity at Ben Gurion airport, forcing flight suspensions and affecting airlines' decisions to resume operations. Economic repercussions of Yemeni strikes are evident on the Zionist entity.' Meanwhile, the Yemeni leader affirmed that this week witnessed the third clash with the American aircraft carrier 'Truman,' marking the sixth confrontation overall with U.S. carriers. 'The clash coincided with U.S. preparations for large-scale aggressive operations against Yemen, which were thwarted by Allah’s grace.' Sayyed Houthi underscored that the notable American tactical achievement this week was the rapid retreat operations, as the 'Truman' carrier quickly fled, recalling all deployed fighter jets and rerouting to the far north of the Red Sea. 'The economic impact on the Zionist entity is substantial, forcing them to raise prices significantly. Zionist media likened the price hikes to a tsunami affecting all goods and public services, heavily burdening settler families.' 'Reverse migration continues, with over 82,000 settlers leaving during 2024. Economic collapse is evident, with 50,000 Zionist companies shutting down in 2024.' Sayyed Houthi highlighted that a significant security achievement was made this week with the arrest of a British espionage network, marking an important milestone, adding that the enemies face substantial failures in the security field, which remains a critical domain. 'The enemies continue their multi-faceted aggression against the people, targeting them militarily, economically, politically, and through media and intelligence. By Allah’s grace and support, the enemies are visibly failing across all fronts, while our resilient and steadfast people achieve success and maintain cohesion.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2310354	2025-01-09T12:07:56-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-02744070017364532661.jpg

Reflecting on Lebanon’s enduring history, Aoun emphasized the nation’s resilience and unity. 'Lebanon is as old as history itself. Our strength lies in our courage and our ability to adapt. No matter our differences, in times of crisis, we embrace one another. If one of us falls, we all fall,' the newly elected President said. Aoun further acknowledged the need for change in Lebanon's political system. 'We must change the political performance in Lebanon. My mandate begins today, and I pledge to serve all Lebanese, wherever they are, as the first servant of the country, upholding the national pact and practicing the full powers of the presidency as an impartial mediator between institutions.' President Aoun went on to underscore the importance of legal and judicial reform. 'If we want to build a nation, we must all be under the rule of law and the judiciary,' he said. 'Interference in the judiciary is forbidden, and there will be no immunity for criminals or corrupt individuals. There is no place for mafias, drug trafficking, or money laundering in Lebanon,' the President concluded. General Aoun underlined that, during his tenure, the armed forces will prevent the Israeli attacks on Lebanon, adding that he would discuss a defense strategy capable of removing the Zionist occupation. President Aoun affirmed that he would lead the construction of all what was destroyed in South Lebanon, Bekaa, and Dahiyeh by the Israeli war. President Aoun was felicitated by Speaker Berri and the rest of the member of the parliament in addition to the caretaker premier and ministers before he moved to Baabda Palace to assume his responsibilities.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2310123	2025-01-09T06:40:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-018448300173643361510.jpeg
Families of Israeli Soldiers: Netanyahu Abandoning Hostages, Wagi...	Families of Israeli conscripts and reservists who fought or are still fighting in Gaza issued a public letter accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of irresponsibly and unnecessarily risking the troops’ lives, and demanding that he reach a deal to end the war. In a letter addressed to the premier, more than 800 of the relatives accused him of leading 'a war without a horizon, unlike anything in our history, solely in the interest of your own political survival.' 'Our sons and daughters set out on a necessary war brought upon us by your actions,' they claimed, according to The Times of Israel. Israeli occupation army in Jabalia in northern Gaza Strip (November 5, 2024). 'They lost many friends and are continuing to die and get injured, mentally and physically.' The families said the troops were motivated by the stated war goals, 'first and foremost returning the hostages.' But now, after more than a year, they assert the only way this will happen is as part of a deal with Hamas, alleging that the war is being extended aimlessly and that 'the IDF has no reason to stay in Gaza, besides fulfilling messianic wishes of settling there.' 'We accuse you of abandoning the hostages and the soldiers,' the parents write, threatening to launch an 'all-out struggle.' Yedioth Ahronoth reported on Thursday that 10 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the start of the offensive in Beit Hanoun two weeks earlier. Meanwhile on Thursday, three soldiers were announced killed in northern Gaza battles.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2310013	2025-01-09T04:40:13-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/12/manar-08250970016716330715.jpg

Lebanon Presidential Race: Franjieh Withdraws, Sources Put Forwar...	On Thursday, Lebanon's parliament will convene to elect a president, with Lebanese Army Commander Joseph Aoun appears to be the strongest contender. On Wednesday, there was a flurry of activity including declarations, intensified discussions and communications. Marada Movement leader Sleiman Frangieh, who is preferred by Hezbollah and Amal Movement, declared he was withdrawaing from the presidential race. In a statement, Franjieh said: 'Now that the conditions for electing a president of the republic are in place tomorrow, and in light of the way things have turned out, I announce the withdrawal of my candidacy, which was never an obstacle to the election process. While I thank everyone who voted for me, I - in line with what I announced in previous positions - support General Joseph Aoun, who enjoys the qualifications to preserve the position of the first presidency.' صدر عن رئيس تيار المرده سليمان فرنجيه البيان التالي: 'أمّا وقد توفّرت ظروف انتخاب رئيس للجمهورية يوم غد، وإزاء ما آلت إليه الأمور، فإنني أعلن عن سحب ترشيحي الذي لم يكن يوماً هو العائق أمام عملية الانتخاب. وإذ أشكر كلّ من اقترع لي، فإنني - وانسجاماً مع ما كنت قد أعلنته في مواقف… — Sleiman Frangieh (@sleimanfrangieh) January 8, 2025 Frangieh wished the House of Parliament success in the election process, and for 'the country to pass this stage with unity, awareness and responsibility.' Meanwhile, Wednesday was marked by a visit from French envoy Jean-Yves Le Drian, who arrived in Beirut on Tuesday evening and was expected to attend the parliamentary presidential election session on Thursday.

The sources said that the efforts 'are accompanied by a media campaign to pressure the parliamentary forces, whose balances in the House of Representatives have not changed, which imposes a binding consensus to produce a president for the republic.' To win, the presidential hopeful needs 86 to achieve automatic victory, avoiding a second round and constitutional ratification. The official vote is tomorrow at 11 am local time, in a session led by Speaker Nabih Berri.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2309507	2025-01-08T12:21:37-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-06079400016643861464.png
‘Israel’ Advances into Quneitra, New Syrian Admin Provides No Det...	Zein Sandouk Translated by Al-Manar English Website Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) have intensified their incursions into southern Syria, particularly in Quneitra’s northern countryside. On the 2nd of January, the IOF advanced into the Al-Hamr Hills near Hadar and Taranja, where they uprooted trees, demolished homes and agricultural lands, and destroyed Syrian Army barracks and weapons depots. The area has been declared a military zone, barring civilian access. Residents were reportedly ordered to hand over weapons allegedly looted from Syrian military locations. In the southern Quneitra Countryside, Israeli forces supported by tanks entered the villages of Al-Asha, Abu Ghara, and Al-Hiran farm, further solidifying control. They also destroyed fortifications and demanded civilian compliance under the guise of military security. Israeli military armored vehicles block a road leading to the town of Quneitra (Jaunary 2025). In Jabatha al-Khashab, Israeli forces advanced and established new military points within Syrian territory, including constructing a 3-kilometer road inside the forest. The town’s mayor emphasized the need to resist Israeli demands and called on the new Syrian government to address the violations. The occupation forces’ control over weapons abandoned during Syrian Army collapses has fueled further tensions in the region. One of the most significant developments occurred when Israeli forces seized the Mantara Dam, the largest water reservoir in southern Syria, capable of holding 40.2 million cubic meters of water. By raising earthen barriers, the occupation has effectively blocked residents’ access to this critical resource. This move exacerbates Syria’s water security crisis, particularly in the face of climate change and declining reserves. Water theft persists as Israel grabs 40 percent of Syria's vital water resources Follow us on Telegram: pic.twitter.com/kwrEBw7I1X — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) January 8, 2025 Israeli consolidation of 13 military points in southern Syria, including the strategic Mount Hermon, further threatens Syria’s vital resources. Mount Hermon contains a vast water reservoir, making its occupation an existential threat to the region’s water security. The Syrian government responded by filing a complaint with the United Nations Security Council, condemning the Israeli incursions and violations. However, this diplomatic action has had little effect on the ground. An Israeli official stated that their forces would remain in the seized areas until assured that Syria’s new administration does not pose a threat to 'Israel'. These developments have left Syrian citizens frustrated and questioning the new administration’s ability to protect its territory and people. The situation underscores the growing humanitarian and geopolitical challenges in the levant as the IOF continues to fortify and solidify its occupation of southern Syria, contradicting its narrative of ensuring the safety of the Zionist entity.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2309463	2025-01-08T11:23:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-04233730017363641536.jpg
Israeli Violations of Lebanon Ceasefire Agreement Persist as Dead...	Since the ceasefire agreement took effect on November 27, Israeli occupation forces have repeatedly violated the terms, despite the resistance’s full adherence to the deal. As the 60-day deadline for Israeli enemy withdrawal from southern occupied villages nears, questions arise about the future of the ceasefire and its sustainability. Continued Israeli Violations and Civilian Casualties Israel has not only breached Lebanese airspace with military and reconnaissance flights but has also carried out numerous attacks and assassinations. Reports indicate that more than 45 civilians have been killed in these violations, including 14 martyrs from airstrikes on Shabaa, Tallousa, and Haris on December 4. The number of Israeli breaches has reached nearly 1,000 since the ceasefire began. Al-Manar correspondent Ali Shouaib reported on Wednesday that Israeli occupation forces advanced at the outskirts of Bint Jbeil, near Maroun Al-Ras, targeting and setting fire to several homes. He also confirmed two explosions in the town of Al-Jibbain and the establishment of new positions for military vehicles and tanks west of Al-Dhaira. Israeli occupation forces advance at the outskirts of Bint Jbeil, near Maroun al-Ras, targeting and setting fire to several homes (Jan 8, 2025) Israeli occupation forces advance in south Lebanon (Jan 8, 2025) Additionally, Israeli enemy forces deployed surveillance devices on a crane in Mount Blat, adjacent to the town of Marwahin. Resistance's Possible Response Hezbollah's Secretary-General, Sheikh Naim Qassem, left open the possibility of resistance retaliation. He emphasized that the resistance alone would decide whether to respond to Israeli provocations, warning that their patience could run out before the ceasefire period ends. Why Does the Israeli Enemy Continue Their Violations? Military expert Brigadier General (res.) Charles Abi Nader explained that the Israeli enemy seeks to inflict as much damage as possible during its presence in southern Lebanon. He noted that Zionist actions are driven by their aggressive stance, exploiting the Lebanese commitment to the ceasefire to intensify violations. The absence of the Lebanese Army in certain southern areas has provided Israel with a pretext to continue its violations, including claims of targeting Hezbollah’s infrastructure south of the Litani River. Role of the Monitoring Committee When questioned about the lack of effective monitoring of Israeli violations, Brigadier Abi Nader criticized the failure of the monitoring committee to carry out its duties. He suggested that the countries sponsoring the ceasefire are complicit with the Israeli occupation, using violations to pursue political objectives in Lebanon, such as influencing the presidential elections and undermining Hezbollah’s military capabilities. Brigadier Abi Nader dismissed the idea of the Lebanese Army confronting Israeli violations directly, attributing this historical issue to Western impositions on Lebanon. He acknowledged that while the Lebanese Army is doing its best, the challenges of deploying in areas with potential mines and unexploded ordnance make it difficult to assert full control in all areas vacated by Israeli forces. Israeli Withdrawal and Delayed Return of Residents: A Complex Situation Al-Manar correspondent Samer Al-Hajj Ali suggests that the Israeli enemy is intensifying demolition and sabotage operations for two main reasons: to delay the return of residents to border villages as much as possible and to create the illusion of achieving some success in the south after its initial failure in ground operations. He further noted that the resistance's challenge to the Israeli occupation is now deeply embedded in Israeli consciousness, prompting the enemy's ongoing aggression. Regarding the status quo, Al-Hajj Ali explained that the Israeli occupation is continuing its withdrawal from several positions in the western sector and plans to pull out from villages between Al-Naqoura and Rmeish. The Lebanese army is expected to position itself in several centers vacated by Israel at the start of its invasion, including Tair Harfa, Al-Jibbain, Al-Dhaira, Alma Al-Shaab, Al-Qawzah, Aita Al-Shaab, and Ras Al-Naqoura. The question remains: Will the Israeli enemy fully withdraw from Lebanese territory in the near future, or will it extend its occupation of part of these lands? How will the Zionist enemy's repeated violations of the ceasefire agreement be addressed?	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2309397	2025-01-08T07:25:20-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-01719130017363482839.jpg
Israeli Strike Claims the Lives of 3 Palestinians, Including Two ...	Israeli enemy drones struck Tammun southeast of Tubas in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, claiming the lives of three Palestinians, including two children. This comes amid a large-scale campaign of raids and arrests carried out by the Israeli forces across the West Bank early this morning, accompanied by widespread settler attacks on Palestinians and their properties for the third consecutive day. The escalation follows the 'Hotel Operation,' which resulted in the killing of three settlers and the injury of seven others. According to Palestinian medical sources, the victims were identified as 9-year-old Rida Ali Ahmad Bsharat, 10-year-old Hamza Ammar Ahmad Bsharat, and 23-year-old Adam Khaireddine Ahmad Bsharat. Israeli occupation forces seized their bodies after the attack. 🔴They were mere children, innocently playing in their backyard. What offense could possibly warrant their murder?

Witnesses reported that the area was crowded with families at the time of the strike. Morning Raid and Clashes Earlier in the day, Israeli occupation forces raided Tammun, deploying snipers and infantry across the town, surrounding several homes, and conducting house-to-house searches. A later drone strike injured several Palestinians, including Abdul Rahman Mohammad Eid Bani Odeh, 24, who succumbed to his injuries, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The ministry confirmed that Bani Odeh was killed by a drone strike targeting a group of Palestinians. His body was also confiscated by Israeli forces. Israeli enemy forces prevented Palestinian medical teams from reaching the injured near the strike site, citing security concerns. The Red Crescent Society reported difficulties in accessing the area due to restrictions imposed by the Israeli occupation military. 5 martyrs in Tammun in the last 24 hours Ahmad Al-Asaad, Governor of Tubas and Northern Jordan Valley, condemned the Israeli occupation military's targeting of civilians, particularly children, in Tammun. 'The claim of targeting an armed cell is baseless. The victims include two children under the age of ten and a young man who were near their home,' he stated. Al-Asaad called on the international community and human rights organizations to intervene immediately to halt Israel’s continued attacks on civilians. 'Tammun has lost five of its residents in the last 24 hours, alongside extensive destruction of infrastructure and public property,' he added. Ongoing Raids and Arrests in West Bank Since October 7, 2023 Palestinian organizations report that 844 Palestinians, including 172 children, 16 women, and 12 elderly individuals, were martyred in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem since October 7, 2023. These numbers resulted from Israeli occupation forces' shootings, bombings, and settler violence. The latest victim, Abdul Rahman Bani Awde from Tammun, Tubas, raised the martyr count in Tubas to 72. Jenin recorded the highest toll with 225 martyrs, followed by Tulkarm with 196. Among the martyrs, 238 were killed in targeted assassinations and 372 during Israeli enemy raids. Additionally, the number of withheld bodies has risen to 180. Bani Odeh was injured when an occupation drone targeted a group of young men in the town. The occupation forces kidnapped him.

Today, Hebron, Nablus, Ramallah, and Tulkarm witnessed intensified operations: In Nablus, Israeli occupation forces conducted raids in Beita and Sebastia, sparking confrontations where live bullets, sound bombs, and tear gas were used, while seven youths were detained during a raid on Askar Refugee Camp. Meanwhile, Hebron witnessed a widespread arrest campaign in Sa'ir targeting multiple residents, and five young men were briefly detained at the Shuhada Street checkpoint before being released. Tulkarm saw residents of Kafr Jammal and Irta enduring vehicle searches, home invasions, and arbitrary detentions during Israeli raids as settlers from the Ramin outpost fired at Palestinian vehicles passing through the area. In Jerusalem’s Old City, Israeli forces detained two women, Maram and Hasniya Fera’awi, and raided Hazma town, firing tear gas at homes. Settler Aggression and Restrictions Settlers in Tulkarm’s Ramin Valley targeted Palestinian vehicles, firing randomly at passersby. Meanwhile, the Israeli military continued its closure of the Jbara Bridge south of Tulkarm for the third consecutive day, restricting movement for vehicles and residents. Call for International Action Palestinian officials and rights groups have called on the international community to intervene against the escalating Israeli enemy military and settler aggression, which continues to claim civilian lives and disrupt daily life across the occupied territories.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2309276	2025-01-08T06:42:00-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-08732950017363472597.jpg
Imam Khamenei: US Severely Misjudged Iran Over Decades	Leader Imam Ali Khamenei accused the United States of repeatedly making grave miscalculations about Iran over the past decades. Addressing a gathering in the city of Qom, Khamenei said the US had long viewed Iran under the former Pahlavi monarchy as a 'formidable fortress' for American interests. However, he noted, 'it was from the heart of this fortress that the [1979 Islamic] Revolution was born and bubbled up. The Americans did not realize this, were duped, lagged behind, and became oblivious.' Imam Khamenei's remarks came as Iran commemorated the anniversary of a 1978 uprising that helped pave the way for the Islamic Revolution.

The Leader described the development as 'the Americans’ miscalculation' vis-à-vis Iran. 'After the Revolution, the Americans perpetrated mistakes concerning Iran throughout these several decades on most occasions,' Ayatollah Khamenei observed. The Leader said his remarks were mostly addressed towards those 'who are intimidated by the US’s policies.' Observers describe the Islamic Revolution as a force that took the global anti-colonial movement to the next level, calling it a symbol of the fight for a just and multipolar world order.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2309089	2025-01-08T01:36:37-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-00658010017339102662.jpg
Iran’s IRGC Showcases Air Defense Prowess in Eqtedar 1403 Drills	In a series of large-scale military exercises dubbed 'Eqtedar 1403' (Authority 1403), the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) has showcased its advanced air defense capabilities in protecting critical infrastructure, including the Natanz nuclear facility. According to IRGC Chief Commander Major General Hossein Salami, the drills involved 'various real-world scenarios' that the forces expected Iran's enemies might attempt. 'Fortunately, encouraging results and fairly valuable achievements were obtained,' Salami stated. A key focus of the exercises was bolstering the IRGC's air defense systems. Salami noted that this domain is 'among the most determining spheres' of Iran's defense capabilities, necessitating the 'exhibition of the capabilities of our air defense systems in a nearly real-world and very precise situation.'

Gaza Ceasefire Reportedly Looms Closer as Discussions Pivot on Po...	As the genocide in Gaza continues unabated for the 459th day, efforts to reach a ceasefire continue, with discussions focusing on post-war governance of the besieged strip. The Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) has intensified its bombardment, on Tuesday targeting multiple areas across the Gaza Strip. According to Ministry of Health in Gaza, 31 Palestinians were martyred as the IOF committed at least three massacres within the past 24 hours, bringing the total death toll since the war’s eruption on October 7, 2023, to 45,885.

Four additional soldiers sustained injuries during the confrontations. Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire, compounded by escalating violence, mounting casualties and worsening living conditions for civilians. The United Nations World Food Program (WFP) issued a statement on Monday condemning an attack by the IOF on one of its aid convoys a day earlier. The WFP reported that at least 16 bullets struck clearly marked vehicles belonging to the organization. Describing the incident as 'horrific' and 'unacceptable,' the WFP reiterated its demand for adherence to international humanitarian law, the safeguarding of civilian lives, and the unimpeded passage of humanitarian assistance. Ceasefire Talks Amid consistent violence, efforts to broker a ceasefire remain fraught with challenges, leaving the prospect of a resolution uncertain. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized the urgency of reaching a truce before the end of President Joe Biden’s term on the 20th of January. Speaking at a news conference in South Korea on Monday, Blinken expressed optimism, stating, 'We very much want to cross the finish line within the next two weeks, which is the time we have left.' His remarks came after a senior Hamas official revealed to Reuters that the resistance group had approved a list of 34 Israeli detainees to be released as part of a truce agreement. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the State Department (February 4, 2021 / photo by Reuters). Meanwhile, 'Israel' has dispatched a delegation of mid-level officials to Qatar for negotiations mediated by Qatari and Egyptian representatives. The team is expected to be joined by David Barnea, the head of Mossad, who is spearheading the talks. Gaza Post-war Governance In related developments, Reuters news agency reported that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is engaged in confidential discussions with 'Israel' and the US regarding Gaza’s post-war governance. The proposed plan envisions temporary oversight of Gaza by the UAE and the US to manage governance, security, and reconstruction until a Palestinian government is ready to assume full control. An Emirati official emphasized the 'necessity of reforming and empowering the Palestinian Authority (PA) as a prerequisite for the plan.' This vision includes the 'establishment of a credible roadmap toward an independent Palestinian state encompassing the West Bank, East Al-Quds (Jerusalem), and Gaza,' according to the report. Among the proposals put forth by Abu Dhabi is the use of private military contractors to form a peacekeeping police force for post-war Gaza, Reuters reported, adding that however, the 'plan remains contingent on significant reforms within the Palestinian Authority.' Hamas Stance Hamas has responded to these developments, with senior leader Osama Hamdan expressing the movement’s willingness to transfer Gaza’s administration to a Palestinian-led national unity government or a government composed of national elites. Osama Hamdan, top Hamas official during interview with the CNN (Thursday, June 14, 2024). Nonetheless, Hamdan reiterated Hamas’s rejection of external interference in post-war governance arrangements. Speaking at a press conference in Algeria, Hamdan affirmed that Hamas’s delegation in Doha remains steadfast in its demands, which include a complete withdrawal of the IOF, the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners, and unrestricted reconstruction efforts in Gaza. Addressing the ongoing ceasefire negotiations, Hamdan stated that no definitive outcomes were expected at this stage. He also emphasized the continued strength of the resistance, which he said is inflicting significant losses on the IOF. When questioned about a potential successor to Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Hamdan assured that internal arrangements were in place, and an announcement regarding the movement’s leadership would be made soon.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2308737	2025-01-07T12:13:43-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-02514580017267356425.jpeg
Strong Earthquake Kills at Least 126 People in Western China near...	A strong earthquake shook a high-altitude region of western China and areas of Nepal on Tuesday, damaging hundreds of houses, littering streets with rubble and killing at least 126 people in Tibet. Many others were trapped as dozens of aftershocks shook the remote region. Rescue workers climbed mounds of broken bricks, some using ladders in heavily damaged villages, as they searched for survivors. Videos posted by China's Ministry of Emergency Management showed two people being carried on stretchers by workers treading over the debris from collapsed homes. At least 188 people were injured in Tibet on the Chinese side of the border, the official Xinhua News Agency said. More than 1,000 homes were damaged in the barren and sparsely populated region, state broadcaster CCTV reported. In video posted by the broadcaster, building debris littered streets and crushed cars. People in northeastern Nepal strongly felt the earthquake, but there were no initial reports of injuries or damage, according to the country's National Emergency Operation Center. The area around Mount Everest, about 75 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of the epicenter, was empty in the depth of winter when even some residents move away to escape the cold. The quake woke up residents in Nepal’s capital of Kathmandu — about 230 kilometers (140 miles) from the epicenter — and sent them running into the streets. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake measured magnitude 7.1 and was relatively shallow at a depth of about 10 kilometers (6 miles). China's Earthquake Networks Center recorded the magnitude as 6.8. Shallow earthquakes often cause more damage. The epicenter was in Tibet's Tingri county, where the India and Eurasia plates grind against each other and can cause earthquakes strong enough to change the heights of some of the world’s tallest peaks in the Himalayan mountains. Tibet is part of China, but many Tibetans’ loyalties lie with the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader who has lived in exile in India since a failed anti-Chinese uprising in 1959. Western governments and human rights organizations have repeatedly accused the Chinese government of abuses in Tibet, where it has cracked down on dissent while investing heavily in economic development. There have been 10 earthquakes of at least magnitude 6 in the area where Tuesday’s quake hit over the past century, the USGS said. About 150 aftershocks were recorded in the nine hours after the earthquake, and the Mount Everest scenic area on the Chinese side was closed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2308550	2025-01-07T07:00:34-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-02622730017362620243.jpg
Lebanese Army Deploys in More Southern Towns as Israeli Enemy Con...	The Lebanese army units continued deploying troops in the towns of the Western Sector of South Lebanon as the Israeli enemy withdrew from more villages in the area. The Zionist occupation forces withdrew from Naqoura and Alma Al-Shaab towns before the Lebanese army completed its deployment in Naqoura and reached Labbouneh crossroad. The Lebanese army established a checkpoint in Wadi Al-Oyoun area at Beit Leif, Debl and Rshaf intersection, South Lebanon, according to Al-Manar reporter who added that the military is expected to enter all those towns in addition to that of Rmeish. Caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati affirmed that the ceasefire agreement obliges the Israeli enemy to be committed to its stipulations, adding that he informed the sponsors of the indirect deal that the halt of the Zionist violations as well as the compete withdrawal of the occupation forces are of a great necessity. Mikati also warned against the repercussions of the Zionist violations and their effects on the regional security and stability.

Israeli Occupation Escalates Aggression in the West Bank, Kills 3...	The Israeli occupation forces have escalated its aggression in the occupied West Bank, raiding several cities and towns and killing at least three Palestinians early on Tuesday. WAFA news agency reported that the ongoing aggression in the town of Tamoun, southeast Tubas, has so far resulted in the killing of two Palestinian young men. Red Crescent sources reported that their crews evacuated a critically injured person after Israeli occupation forces shelled the town. Local sources confirmed the killing of two Palestinians as a result of the shelling. Security sources identified one of the martyrs as Suleiman Mustafa Qteishat. However, they said that the identity of the second martyr was still unknown. The occupation forces raided several homes inside the town and caused damage to the properties, shops and infrastructure in the area.

2 Israeli Soldiers Killed, 4 Others Injured in Gaza Battles	Two Israeli soldiers were killed and four others were seriously wounded in fighting in the northern Gaza Strip on Monday, the Israeli occupation military announced on Tuesday. The slain soldiers served in the Nahal Brigade’s 932nd Battalion. One was a company commander and the other was his deputy, The Times of Israel reported, citing a statement by the Israeli occupation army. The two officers were killed and two other soldiers of the 932nd Battalion were seriously wounded in the same incident in northern Gaza’s Beit Hanoun. The Israeli army releases image of the two occupation soldiers killed in Gaza (January 7, 2024). The military did not immediately provide further details on the circumstances of the incident. In a separate incident on Monday, two other soldiers with the Nahal Brigade’s reconnaissance unit, were seriously wounded in fighting in northern Gaza. They were evacuated to the occupied territories for treatment. The deaths brought Israeli toll in the ground offensive on Gaza and in military operations along the border with the Strip to 397. Also on Monday, the occupation military said its instructions for soldiers have been 'sharpened' after troops opened fire on a UN World Food Program convoy in the central Gaza Strip Sunday. The WFP said the convoy of three vehicles with eight staff members came under fire by Israeli soldiers despite having received all of the necessary clearances from Israeli authorities.

US Cover-Ups for ‘Israel’ in South Lebanon: Extended Stays and Bu...	The Ceasefire Supervision Committee convened on Monday, led by US envoy Amos Hochstein, amid boiling-point tensions raised by ‘Israeli’ post-ceasefire barbarism in southern Lebanon. The meeting in the southern town of Naqoura marks the third session since the ceasefire on November 27, wherein Israeli occupation forces (IOF) saw the given 60 days as an opportunity to brazenly occupy Lebanese lands that they were never able to when in direct confrontation with Hezbollah resistance fighters. The Lebanese delegation, carrying strong objections, has aimed to address Israeli obstruction of the Lebanese army's deployment plan, Al-Akhbar Lebanese daily’s Amal Khalil reported on Monday. Prime Minister Najib Mikati previously expressed these concerns to US and French representatives during a meeting at the Grand Serail. Despite the Lebanese anger, the IOF continues their violations, with recent bombings and demolitions in areas like Naqoura, Al-Jebbain, and Teir Harfa, in addition to Taybeh, Yaroun and Aitaroun where the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) were beginning deployment. Khalil cited a well-informed source who hinted that 'the Israeli enemy will withdraw from Naqoura after this committee meeting, as it did from Khiyam after the first meeting.' بالصور | مراسل قناة المنار : توثيق لتوغل الدبابات الاسرائيلية المعادية في بلدة #الطيبة وعمليات الاحراق والتفجير pic.twitter.com/m2otZgqnqm — قناة المنار (@TVManar1) January 5, 2025 Extending Ceasefire Reports suggest that Hochstein would propose extending the ceasefire to 90 days, conditional on the Lebanese army's readiness to deploy. The source quoted US General Jasper Jeffers, US head of the monitoring committee, as saying, 'Israel will withdraw sooner or later, but according to arrangements that the border area will be subject to in cooperation between UNIFIL and the Lebanese army'. UNIFIL patrol in south Lebanon (photo from December 2024). This unclear 'sooner or later' rhetoric directly contradicts the original terms of the ceasefire agreement and suggests that the US will most likely push harder for extended IOF presence in southern Lebanon, Al-Akhbar report added. Jeffers commended the Lebanese army for adhering to UN Resolution 1701, contrasting 'Israeli' claims of the LAF’s negligence. He highlighted his recent visit to Khiyam, where he witnessed LAF units confiscating large quantities of ammunition, as evidence of its commitment, according to the report. Israeli Conditions Citing leaks from Israeli media sources, Al-Akhbar’s Khalil reported suggested conditions for withdrawal, including establishing a buffer zone along the border. These sources claimed that 'Israel will enforce a buffer zone across the border and not allow residents of southern towns to return,' though the Lebanese government has not received official confirmation of this plan. The sources added that a proposal yet to be presented by the supervision committee involves a buffer zone three kilometers deep as part of a revised map south of the Litani River, which would most likely be imposed through the signature illegal aggression of the IOF. The updated map accompanying the November 27 ceasefire agreement raises deadly concerns. While the Lebanese government reaffirmed its commitment to Resolution 1701 and stability along the Blue Line, the map omits key landmarks, such as the Shebaa Farms and Ghajar. The Blue Line, originally a withdrawal demarcation, is being treated by the supervision committee as the de facto border rather than the border set by the 1949 Israeli-Lebanese General Armistice Agreement, according to the leaks. The map also reportedly includes Yahmor Al-Shaqif, a town north of the Litani River, positioned just three kilometers from Metula, an Israeli settlement. This territorial adjustment complicates negotiations, especially as discussions turn to the party which will run the Ras Al-Naqoura crossing following the Israeli withdrawal. According to Khalil’s sources, 'Israel does not trust handing over the crossing to UNIFIL and the LAF' and instead suggests oversight by a reinforced international force or the direct involvement of the US head of the committee. While Lebanon remains firm in its demands for sovereignty and the cessation of hostilities, Israeli actions prove an entrenched refusal to comply with Resolution 1701. As the committee meets, the outcomes of proposed truce extensions, border adjustments, and management of key crossings will determine the trajectory of this volatile situation. Lebanon’s delegation seeks to ensure that its territorial integrity and rights are upheld in the face of Zionist arrogance and US deception. Earlier on Saturday, Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem warned that the resistance patience may run out before the end of the 60-day ceasefire deadline.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2308044	2025-01-06T13:18:28-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-06804240017361982106.jpg
Hochstein: Israeli Forces Will Withdraw Completely from South Leb...	The US presidential envoy Amos Hochstein arrived on Monday in Beirut, holding meetings with the senior Lebanese officials to discuss mainly the implementation of the US-brokered ceasefire in South Lebanon. Hoschstein met at first with the Lebanese Army Commander, General Joseph Aoun, in Yarzeh, in the presence of US Ambassador to Lebanon, Lisa A. Johnson, and Head of the Five-Party Supervisory Committee, US Major Gen. Jasper Jeffers. Discussions during the meeting touched on the mechanism for implementing the ceasefire which took into effect on November 27, 2024, and ended a two-month Israeli war on Lebanon. Later on, the US envoy chaired the third meeting of the Five-Party Supervisory Committee in Naqoura which was held in light of the Israeli withdrawal from the western sector. The US envoy and his accompanying delegation then visited House Speaker Nabih Berri at Ain El-Tineh Palace. Hochstein pledged continued commitment of the United States and the international community in support of the Lebanese Armed Forces as they implement the ceasefire agreement by ensuring security in the south and throughout Lebanon, noting that the withdrawals will continue until all Israeli forces are completely outside Lebanese territory. Hochstein and the US delegation also met with the Prime Minister Najib Mikati who demanded a timeline for the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon in addition to an immediate stop of the Zionist violations of the ceasefire.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2308011	2025-01-06T12:49:42-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-04563170017361965721.jpeg

The Ukrainian military command has turned Kurakhovo in the Donetsk People’s Republic into a fortified stronghold over the past 10 years, the Russian Defense Ministry said. 'Over ten years, the Kiev regime turned it into a powerful fortified area with the developed network of permanent firing positions and underground communications,' the ministry noted. According to the military agency, the Ukrainian army has amassed over 15,000 troops in Kurakhovo, including elite units, nationalist formations and foreign mercenaries.

Control over Kurakhovo hinders supplies to Ukrainian troops Establishing control over the town of Kurakhovo in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has substantially hindered combat service support to the Ukrainian armed forces, the Russian Defense Ministry said. 'Taking control over this important logistics hub has significantly hindered combat service support to the Ukrainian military grouping in the Donetsk area, depriving the Kiev regime of the opportunity to use artillery systems to shell civilians in the city of Donetsk, the capital of the DPR,' the ministry said in a statement.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2307813	2025-01-06T07:04:33-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-063171300173617586210.jpg
IRGC Commander: Resistance Front Reaches Apex of Power as Hezboll...	Major General Hossein Salami, the chief commander of Iran's elite Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), declared that the regional Resistance Front has attained an unprecedented level of strength and influence. Salami emphasized that while the Resistance Front continues to grow in power, their enemies have become objects of scorn and fear, a trend he believes will persist. The commander specifically praised Lebanon's formidable Hezbollah movement for its unwavering resolve in the face of grave threats. Resistance Front at 'peak of its power'; Hezbollah imposed its will on worn-out Israel: IRGC — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) January 6, 2025 'The fact that Hezbollah stays on its course, despite those heavy dangers, is down to the struggles of [the group’s former secretary-general] the Greatest Martyr His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and [former senior official] Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, who managed to plant the roots of Jihad within the Lebanese youths’ beliefs,' Salami elaborated. Salami asserted that Hezbollah's steadfast determination allowed it to impose its will on a worn-out Israel, compelling the entity to accept the terms of a truce deal following its failed aggression against Lebanon. During the ceremony honoring the late General Qassem Suleimani, Salami commended the former anti-terror commander for his tireless efforts in leading the fight against Western- and Israeli-backed Takfiri terrorist groups, sacrificing himself for the sake of regional Muslim nations.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2307648	2025-01-06T05:33:40-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/12/manar-067219500170375961910.jpg
Israeli Occupation Army Warns Soldiers of Arrest Risk Abroad over...	An investigative report by the Israeli Kan broadcaster highlights a surge in legal attempts to prosecute Israeli occupation army soldiers abroad since the war on the Gaza Strip began. Approximately 50 complaints have been filed against reserve soldiers, leading to 10 formal investigations in various countries. However, no arrests have been reported. Social Media Risks and Cautious Travel Data from the Israeli occupation army's Information Security Division indicates that soldiers post nearly one million pieces of content daily on social media, increasing the risk of exposure and legal action. While no official travel bans to specific countries have been issued, authorities are exercising caution, particularly for dual-nationality soldiers or those traveling to high-risk nations like South Africa. Intelligence suggesting targeted efforts against soldiers has heightened vigilance. Security officials have recommended reassessing high-risk travel and incorporating legal risk evaluations into decision-making. Consequently, Zionist soldiers have also been instructed to reduce their social media activity. Experts have raised alarms over the lack of a comprehensive strategy to address this growing threat, despite ongoing efforts to mitigate exposure and legal risks. High-Profile Cases and Warnings In a recent incident, Israeli media reported that a Zionist soldier wanted in Brazil managed to leave the country before authorities could arrest him. Brazilian authorities had issued an urgent arrest warrant following a complaint by a human rights organization accusing him of crimes in Gaza. Meanwhile, Haaretz reported that the Israeli occupation army has warned reserve soldiers abroad about the risk of arrest due to their involvement in the Gaza war. Human rights organizations have been actively collecting evidence, including videos documenting alleged war crimes, to pressure local authorities to pursue legal action. Soldiers’ Families Demand Legal Protection According to Israel Hayom, the mothers of Zionist soldiers sent a strongly worded letter to Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, demanding legal protection for their sons. The letter expressed concerns about international tribunals, particularly in light of the erosion of the Israeli occupation’s so-called judicial independence.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2307417	2025-01-06T05:29:22-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/08/manar-02566110017249333574.jpg

The Israeli occupation forces withdraw from an area only to see Palestinian resistance fighters return, launching precision operations that inflict direct casualties among enemy fighters. Explosions in Sderot Amid Rocket Attacks Israeli sources reported on Monday explosions in 'Sderot' and its surroundings following rocket sirens in the area. An Israeli Army Radio correspondent confirmed the rockets were launched from Beit Hanoun.

Axios reported that Brett McGurk, senior advisor to US President Joe Biden, also arrived in Doha to join the talks. Progress in Ceasefire Talks A Palestinian source told The New Arab news outlet that mediators have bridged gaps between the parties through compromise solutions. Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a late-night meeting on Sunday with ministers and officials to finalize a response, which Barnea is expected to deliver in Doha. Israeli media, however, noted that Netanyahu's security cabinet will not address the issue of hostages during these discussions, according to Kan 11. Escalating Aggression: Rising Civilian Casualties in Gaza The ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza has led to mounting civilian casualties. Over 20 Palestinians were injured when an Israeli drone targeted a school sheltering displaced individuals near Al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza. In Rafah, two children were martyred in an Israeli airstrike, while the Ministry of Health reported the martyrdom of a 35-day-old infant due to severe weather conditions and freezing temperatures. This brings the death toll of children succumbing to the cold in Gaza to eight. Brutal Israeli Airstrikes Across Gaza An Israeli occupation airstrike in Rafah’s Khirbet Al-Adas claimed the life of one Palestinian and injured two others. In Khan Younis, shelling in the Al-Mawasi area, which houses displaced individuals, caused additional injuries. Two children, Raed Mohammed Shehada Al-Najjar (15) and Mourad Mohammed Shehada Al-Najjar (12), were martyred in an IOF drone strike on Al-Shawka in eastern Rafah.

Widespread Destruction and Targeted Attacks Israeli occupation forces continued to shell areas west of Rafah, including Al-Mawasi, and launched artillery strikes near Al-Mufti’s land north of Al-Nuseirat camp. Airstrikes on homes near Al-Omari Mosque in Gaza City's Al-Daraj neighborhood killed a woman and her child. Another airstrike in Jabalia camp killed one civilian, while a volunteer nurse at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital lost her life in a strike on a home in Al-Nuseirat. In Rafah, two farmers were martyred while sleeping in their field, and two more were martyred in an Israeli strike targeting northeastern Rafah. Humanitarian Crisis in Northern Gaza The northern Gaza region has endured a relentless siege and bombardment for 94 consecutive days, leaving it isolated and devastated. Israeli enemy forces have paralyzed civil defense operations in northern Gaza for 74 days, preventing vital humanitarian and medical aid. Thousands of residents remain without essential care amid the continuing aggression.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2307362	2025-01-06T03:39:08-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-00626040017361631478.jpg

Hamas Says List of 34 Captives Submitted for Prisoner Swap	The Palestinian resistance group Hamas has reportedly approved a list of 34 captives it is willing to exchange with ‘Israel’ as part of ongoing ceasefire negotiations. However, the two sides remain at odds over the terms of a broader truce. According to a Hamas official who spoke to Reuters on Sunday, the list of prisoners was handed over to Israeli intermediaries on Sunday. The official emphasized that any final agreement would be contingent on Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and a permanent ceasefire. 'There has been no progress from ‘Israel’ on the matters of withdrawal from Gaza or a permanent ceasefire,' the Hamas official stated. But the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu disputed Hamas' statement, claiming that the group has not provided any names for a proposed prisoner swap. 'Up to this moment, Hamas has not delivered a list of hostage names,' a statement from Netanyahu's office said. These reports come as intensified Israeli airstrikes over the weekend killed over 100 Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip. Efforts to broker a ceasefire and secure the return of Israeli captives are ongoing in Doha, with Qatari and Egyptian mediators playing a key role.
