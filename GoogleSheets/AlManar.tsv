The nature of the ceasefire deal is the main issue of contention in the talks, with Hamas demanding a permanent end to the war along with the withdrawal of the IOF from Gaza, while the Zionist entity is seeking a temporary pause during which a number of Israeli captives, who are held in Gaza, would be released followed by a resumption of its genocidal war on the strip.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2294910	2024-12-20T08:27:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2020/12/manar-04384760016087190288-e1698484153190.jpg

‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô Expands Occupation, Controls Water Resources in Southern...	In a blatant violation of international law, Israeli occupation forces have expanded their presence in southern Syria, seizing control of three vital water bodies and additional territory in the region. According to reports, the Israeli occupation forces have advanced approximately 9 kilometers eastward of the town of Sayda, occupying the Saharan al-Julan Dam and two other crucial water sources in southwestern Syria. Several nearby villages, including Arab al-Sudi, Shabraq, Sihyun, and Nofa, have also fallen under the control of the Israeli occupation. Furthermore, the buffer zone to the east of the occupied Golan Heights has been completely seized by the Israeli regime, as well as the mountaintop of Mount Hermon. In total, Israeli media outlets have confirmed that over 370 square kilometers of Syrian territory have been occupied in recent days. This land grab comes amidst a series of unprovoked aerial assaults by ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô, which have significantly degraded Syria's strategic military capabilities, including its air defense systems and missiles. The Israeli attacks were launched following the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad by armed opposition groups on December 8th.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2293700	2024-12-19T00:00:10-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-00777770017338147474.jpg

Palestinian Resistance Heroically Kills Number of Israeli Soldier...	On the 439th day of the barbaric Zionist war on the besieged Gaza Strip, the Palestinian Resistance fighters are still showing unprecedented valor, bravery, and steadfastness in the battlefield. Qualitative operations were carried out on Wednesday, which left a number of Israeli soldiers dead. Hamas military wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, announced that its fighters successfully sniped a Zionist soldier, directly injuring him in the 'Tuwam' area, north of Gaza City. Al-Qassam Brigades targeted the enemy's command and control site in Netzarim with '107' missiles. Later on, Al-Qassam fighters managed to target a Zionist force that had resorted to a house with a 'TBG' shell near Abu Sharkh roundabout, west of Jabalia, in the northern Gaza Strip. 5 Zionist soldiers were killed by Al-Qassam fighters at a point-blank range near Al-Khulafa Mosque in central Jabalia camp, north of the Gaza Strip. Al-Qassam Brigades also detonated a Zionist troop carrier with a 'Shawaz' explosive device near the Martyr Imad Aql Mosque east of Jabalia camp, in northern Gaza. Moreover, one of Al-Qassam fighters managed to kill an Israeli soldier next to a Merkava tank, seize his weapon, and throw two hand grenades into the tank west of Beit Lahia, north of the Gaza Strip. For its part, the military wing of the Islamic Jihad Movement, Al-Quds Brigades, announced bombarding the Israeli soldiers and vehicles in central Jabalia camp with mortar shells. Al-Quds Brigades also announced seizing a Zionist reconnaissance drone during its intelligence mission over Rafah city in the southern Gaza Strip. Al-Quds Brigades further displayed the footage of targeting Ashkelon settlement with missiles from northern Gaza. The Israeli aggression on Gaza has continued and targeted the various towns and cities of the Strip. 23 martyrs were claimed by the Zionist attacks in Gaza on Wednesday. The latest reports indicated that 13 martyrs were claimed by an Israeli air raid on a house in Jabalia. 45,059 martyrs and 107,041 injuries have been so far by the brutal Israeli war on Gaza, according to the latest toll.

The commander, who refused to disclose his name, said in a statement on Wednesday that 'the indirect negotiations in Doha resolved the thorny points in the file of Palestinian prisoners with high sentences who are scheduled to be included in the exchange deal,' noting that '90% of this file has been resolved and there are still some simple notes.' Hamas commander pointed out that 'it can be said that we are about to announce reaching a real agreement unless any new demands or notes are added by the Israeli occupation government,' noting that 'the discussion of the proposed vision has been completed and understandings have been reached regarding all of its provisions.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2293469	2024-12-18T15:35:40-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-03760560017345649197.png
Iran FM Calls for Israel‚Äôs Immediate Withdrawal from Occupied Ter...	Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has called for an immediate withdrawal of the Israeli regime from the occupied territories in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria. Addressing a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Developing Eight Organization for Economic Cooperation (D-8) in Cairo on Wednesday, Araghchi reiterated Iran‚Äôs position on Israeli acts of aggression in the region. He also said in his speech that Iran would support any initiative that improves the economic sustainability in D-8 countries and helps their people cope with shocks caused by regional and international developments. 'The D-8 Special Summit on Situation in Palestine and the Lebanon here tomorrow will be the latest testament of our brotherly countries to our continued joint commitment to fraternity, peace, dialogue, justice and rule of law across the region and the world, as envisaged in the D-8 Charter.' 'The international community has embarrassingly failed to stop acts of aggression, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide by the Zionist regime,' he added, 'This is largely attributed to the political, military, intelligence and financial support by the US administration to Israel.' 'The Special D-8 Summit tomorrow will hopefully send a strong message to the world that the Israeli aggressions and violations in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria shall be ended immediately; the Zionist regime and its allies shall be held accountable for their acts; a permanent ceasefire shall be established in Gaza to allow unhindered access of People of Gaza to humanitarian assistance; the Palestine Cause and the right of Palestinians to self-determination shall be realized; any attempt for land annexation by Israel shall be prevented; the Israeli forces shall immediately withdraw from occupied territories in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria; and last but not the least, that D-8 countries are prepared to support Palestine and Lebanon to address economic and related challenges and problems resulted from the current situation.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2293381	2024-12-18T11:06:14-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-00152650017345487513.jpg
Ceasefire Monitoring Committee Fails to Stop Israeli Blatant Viol...	The committee tasked to monitor the ceasefire in South Lebanon held on Wednesday, December 18, its second meeting at the UNIFIL headquarters in Naqoura town. Representatives of the Lebanese Army, US, France, UNIFIL and the Zionist enemy convened to discuss the blatant Israeli violations of the truce which took into effect on November 27. 'UNIFIL hosted the meeting, with the United States serving as chair, assisted by France, and joined by the LAF and IOF,' the U.S. and French embassies and UNIFIL said in a joint statement after the meeting, adding that 'the committee will continue to meet in this format regularly and coordinate closely to support implementation of the ceasefire agreement and UNSCR 1701.' The statement failed to highlight the ongoing Israeli violations of the ceasefire, disregarding any practical steps to stop them. In this context, the Israeli occupation forces continued wiping out houses in Naqoura town hosting the meeting of the committee, which underlines the enemy's insistence on the violations. For the third consecutive day, Israeli bulldozers continued the operations of demolishing houses and scraping houses in the town of Naqoura in southern Lebanon, where they have deliberately damaged the infrastructure in the southern village on the border with occupied Palestine. ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿ±ÿßŸÅÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ŸäŸÑŸäÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿπÿßÿØŸäÿ© ÿ™ŸàÿßÿµŸÑ ÿπŸÖŸÑŸäÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ¨ÿ±ŸäŸÅ Ÿà ÿßŸÑŸáÿØŸÖ ŸÅŸä ÿ®ŸÑÿØÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÜÿßŸÇŸàÿ±ÿ© ŸÑŸÑŸäŸàŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ´ÿßŸÑÿ´ ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸàÿßŸÑŸä pic.twitter.com/Ei4zOxNqhm ‚Äî ŸÇŸÜÿßÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÜÿßÿ± (@TVManar1) December 18, 2024 The Israeli enemy also detonated several houses and destroyed forests in Kfarkila border town, demolishing a house and a Mosque in Bani Hayyan town.

‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô Eyes Open-ended Occupation of Syrian Territory	It seems that the Zionist entity, whose appetite for expansionism has risen, is planning for an open-ended occupation in Syria, with Zionist officials making remarks on long-term military control of the territory seized by the occupation army just after the fall of former president Bashar Al-Assad‚Äôs government in Syria. Meanwhile, the Israeli occupation military carried out more incursions on Wednesday in the country‚Äôs south, outside the buffer zone, which was established in 1974. Syrian media reported on Wednesday that the Israeli occupation forces raided the towns of Saida Al-Golan and Saida Al-Hanout south of Quneitra in the occupied Golan. ÿØÿ®ÿßÿ®ÿßÿ™ Ÿàÿ¢ŸÑŸäÿßÿ™ ÿ•ÿ≥ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ŸäŸÑŸäÿ© ÿ™ÿØÿÆŸÑ ŸÇÿ±Ÿäÿ© ÿµŸäÿØÿß ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸàŸÑÿßŸÜ#ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿ≤Ÿäÿ±ÿ©_ÿ≥Ÿàÿ±Ÿäÿß pic.twitter.com/6iqr73RmzF ‚Äî ŸÇŸÜÿßÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿ≤Ÿäÿ±ÿ© (@AJArabic) December 18, 2024 After deploying more forces and vehicles in the area, the occupation forces raided houses in these two towns and carried out inspections, according to local media.

Israeli Channel 12 reported that the 'Israeli army received orders from PM Netanyahu to stay in Mount Hermon till the end of 2025.' Earlier on Tuesday, Netanyahu said ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô would remain inside the buffer zone, 'until another arrangement can be found that guarantees Israel‚Äôs security'. 'We will stay &#8230; until another arrangement is found that ensures Israel‚Äôs security,' said Netanyahu who had traveled to the buffer zone on Tuesday with Defense Minister Israel Katz. Netanyahu made the comments from the summit of Mount Hermon ‚Äî the highest peak in the area ‚Äî inside Syria, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border with the Israel-held Golan Heights. The Israeli premier said he had been on the same mountaintop 53 years ago as a soldier.

Israel seized a swath of southern Syria along the border with the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights days after Assad was ousted by rebels last week. Israel‚Äôs capture of the buffer zone, a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) demilitarized area in Syrian territory, has sparked condemnation, with critics accusing Israel of violating a 1974 ceasefire and possibly exploiting the chaos in Syria in the wake of new events in Syria to make a land grab. The buffer zone between Syria and the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights was created by the U.N. after the 1973 Mideast war. A UN force of about 1,100 troops had patrolled the area since then.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2293194	2024-12-18T06:34:31-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-091914000173453238010.jpg

Imam Khamenei: It‚Äôs ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô That Will Be Eradicated, Not the Res...	Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei has dismissed the belief held by the US, the Zionist regime, and a few of their allies that resistance will cease, stating that the one who will be eradicated is Israel. Addressing a meeting with a group of Iranian women on Tuesday, five days before the birth anniversary of Lady Fatimah (AS), the daughter of prophet Mohammad (PBUH), which marks Mother's Day in Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei stressed the importance of fighting the temptations, mischievous measures and soft war of the enemies planned deviate women from the values. He emphasized that issues related to women are among the critical concerns that Muslims should address. The enemies of Iran have not remained idle and are busy hatching plots, he said, adding that they soon realized that the Islamic Revolution could not be defeated with hardware methods, so they resorted to software methods. The soft methods of the enemies included temptations and dishonesty in their slogans, such as defending women and starting riots under the pretext of defending a group of women or a woman in a country, he stated. Referring to the recent developments in Syria and the continuation of the Zionist regime's crimes in Gaza and Lebanon, he said that the the path of the martyrs of the resistance continues and the people of Gaza and Lebanon are standing against the Zionists' daily attacks. The Israeli regime is trying to besiege and eradicate Hezbollah forces through Syria, but the one who will be eradicated is Israel, he added. Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and Yahya Sinwar lost their bodies, but their thoughts remain, and their path continues. Gaza is under attack on a daily basis, and people are being martyred. But they stand firm and keep resisting. Lebanon continues to resist, the Supreme Leader said. Commenting on the different views on the issue of women in the world, he said that by having the effective media, capitalism and its politicians hypocritically hide their criminal and corrupt motives to interfere with the affairs of the women globally and acquire illegitimate benefits under the guise of philosophical and humanitarian theories. He said that it was necessary for the Islamic charter on women affairs to be explained for the general public to have a better understanding of the logic of Islam in this regard. The Supreme Leader termed the issue of marriage as the first important principle in the charter of women in Islam, adding that according to several verses of Holy Qur'an, a man and a woman are equal and complete each other. Saying that Islam has emphasis on 'hijab, chastity, and outfit', he commented that today's indecencies in the West are relatively new, and the descriptions of European women in the literary works of two or three centuries ago show that there were very careful in this regard in the West as well. Iranian women have been able to protect the identity, culture and historical traditions of the country with their modesty, and chastity, he said. Ayatollah Khamenei criticized the claim of defending women by starting a disturbance in a country as an example of the false slogans of ill-wishers. He urged girls, women, professors, students and the entire society of women to stand against the temptations, insidious methods, and soft war tactics of ill-wishers aimed at deviation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2292765	2024-12-17T10:25:19-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-036430900173445991210.jpg

Iran Says Reopening of Damascus Embassy on Agenda	Iran is considering plans to reopen its embassy in Damascus, the spokesperson for the Iranian Foreign Ministry said, without giving a precise date. In comments at a press conference on Tuesday, Esmaeil Baqaei said Iran has put plans to reopen its embassy in Damascus on the agenda. The spokesman said he would not use the term 'forthcoming' for the resumption of the activities of Iran‚Äôs embassy in Syria, saying it requires a series of arrangements to ensure the security of the diplomats and staffers. 'If the conditions are set, we will do that', he said, as quoted by Tasnim news agency. Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei (photo from archive). Iran closed its embassy in Damascus after it was stormed by armed militants last week following the fall of the government of Bashar al-Assad. The spokesman explained that Iran‚Äôs presence in Syria during the tenure of Assad was based on certain principles while the withdrawal of the Iranian forces was also a responsible move. Iran was not seeking to expand its boundaries or revive the past empires by acting in Syria, Baqaei added, noting that Iran was only trying to assist Syria in protecting the security of its people against terrorism. 'We were not in Syria to support a specific person or group. What mattered to us to the very last moments (before the fall of Assad) was to help maintain Syria‚Äôs territorial integrity. We believe that the security of regional countries will guarantee security in West Asia,' he added. On December 15, the Iranian ambassador to Damascus received a series of recommendations from Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi to protect Iran‚Äôs national interests and push for Syria‚Äôs territorial integrity.

'In response to various reports, my position regarding Gaza is clear. Once we defeat Hamas‚Äôs military power and ruling power in Gaza, Israel will control security in Gaza with full freedom to act, just as in Judea and Samaria,' he wrote in a post to X, in reference to the West Bank. Post of Israeli DM Israel Katz on security control of Gaza (December 17, 2024). 'We will not allow any terrorist activity against Israeli communities and citizens from Gaza. We will not allow a return to the pre-October 7 reality,' Katz posted. The statement came after Israeli Channel 12 reported that Katz had told a senior American official in a closed-door meeting that 'Israel does not want military control or civilian governance over the residents of the Gaza Strip.' Katz also reportedly said that 'there are no decisions regarding settlement in Gaza.' He was also quoted as saying with regard to the Palestinian Authority that, 'Israel is protecting the PA from Iran and Hamas. It must be shifted to the moderate side.'

Trump Blasts Biden‚Äôs Permission to Use US Weapons for Strikes ins...	US President-elect Donald Trump attacked the current US leader Joe Biden's move to allow deeper missile strikes inside Russia as wrong and stupid. 'I don't think they should have allowed missiles to be shot 200 miles into Russia. I think that was a bad thing,' he said at his first news conference since the election win. 'That did a lot of bad things.' 'I don't think that should have been allowed,' Trump went on to say, speaking at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. 'Certainly not just weeks before I take over.' 'I thought it was a very stupid thing to do,' he continued. The president-elect said he wasn‚Äôt asked to weigh in on the decision. Trump said he would have acted differently and could reconsider the decision when he takes office.. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov earlier said Trump's statement about the peril of using US long-range ATACMS missiles for deeper strikes inside Russia is fully in line with Moscow's position. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on November 21 that the US and its NATO allies had announced authorizing the use of longer-range weapons. Following the announcement, US and UK missiles attacked Russian targets in the Kursk and Bryansk regions, according to the president. Russia responded by firing its newest Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile with a non-nuclear warhead at a Ukrainian defense industry plant called Yuzhmash in the city of Dnepr, Putin said. The Russian president said the West could bring upon itself heavy consequences, should its inflammatory policies prompt further escalation of the conflict.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2292116	2024-12-16T13:21:31-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/08/manar-00172640016292705974.jpg
Prisoner Swap Deal with Hamas Closer than Ever: Katz	Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz stated on Monday that 'Israel' is closer than ever to reaching a prisoner swap deal with Hamas. In his remarks, Katz confirmed that 'the potential exchange deal is expected to gain majority support in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.' A Hamas official noted 'unprecedented progress in the negotiations regarding the Gaza ceasefire and prisoner release. However, the final decision rests with Netanyahu,' as reported by the Israeli news site Ynet. 'Despite the progress, disagreements remain over the number of prisoners to be released as part of the deal,' the official revealed, noting that 'both sides have yet to agree on which prisoners will be freed.' This issue has seen multiple rounds of mediation over the months, involving Qatar, Egypt, and the United States, raising hopes for an agreement to end the conflict in the Gaza Strip. However, these hopes have since faded. The occupation's insistence on maintaining a military presence in the enclave has been a major obstacle to the mediators' efforts and has impeded the progress of talks. As of now, approximately 100 Israeli prisoners remain held in Gaza since October 7, 2023, with Israeli estimates suggesting that half of them have perished. Meanwhile, thousands of Palestinians have been held in Zionist prisons for years.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2292050	2024-12-16T10:41:47-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-05414040017322736387.jpg

Bashar Al-Assad Says Remained in Damascus Until Last Moment, Cont...	In his first statement following the opposition's takeover of Syria, the former Syrian president, Bashar Al-Assad, clarified that his departure from the country was never planned, nor did he leave during the final hours of combat. He remained in Damascus, fulfilling his duties until the early hours of Sunday, December 8, 2024. 'As terrorism expanded within Damascus, Al-Assad coordinated with Russian allies to relocate to Latakia to oversee military operations. Upon reaching Hmeimim base, he found all frontlines abandoned and the last military positions lost, with escalating attacks on the Russian base itself,' the statement declared. Al-Assad stressed that he never sought personal power but saw himself as leading a national project backed by people who believed in him. He rejected any offers for personal escape, instead standing with his troops on the front lines, facing the enemy directly in the most intense and dangerous combat zones. He maintained that during these events, neither resignation nor refuge was ever an option‚Äîonly continued resistance against the terrorist assault. He also addressed the international rumors regarding his fate, stating that amidst the terrorist expansion in Syria, false narratives were spread, further fueling the international process of designating the violence as a 'Syrian liberation revolution.' 'In such a critical historical moment for the nation, the truth must have its place. There are important matters that need clarification through a brief statement, but due to the circumstances and the subsequent complete communication breakdown for security reasons, it was not possible to deliver it. These key points do not replace a full account of everything that transpired, which will be shared when the opportunity arises,' Al-Assad concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2291786	2024-12-16T05:57:23-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/03/manar-08822480016802582891-e1680258322831.jpg
Israeli Occupation Forces Exploit Ceasefire to Advance in Naqoura...	In a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement, the border town of Naqoura in southern Lebanon witnessed a series of alarming developments early this morning. Israeli occupation forces carried out successive explosions targeting homes, coupled with a ground incursion into the area. The National News Agency reported that Israeli enemy forces launched demolition operations starting at midnight, targeting homes and key infrastructure in Naqoura. The incursion was accompanied by the use of tanks and heavy weaponry, with residential neighborhoods coming under intense fire from machine guns during the advance. According to Al-Manar correspondent Ali Shoeib, Israeli forces are exploiting the ceasefire to penetrate areas of Naqoura that had previously been inaccessible due to fierce resistance by Hezbollah. This strategy mirrors their earlier expansionist actions in the town of Khiam, aiming to impose new territorial realities on the ground. ‚ö°Ô∏è The scene of exploiting the ceasefire in Al-Khiyam repeats today in Nakoura.Israeli forces are infiltrating neighborhoods they couldn‚Äôt enter during clashes, using bombs and machine guns.

Yemeni Official Warns US: Escalation in Yemen Will Open the Gates...	A high-ranking member of Yemen's Ansarullah resistance movement has issued a stern warning to the United States, stating that any escalation of tensions in Yemen will result in the US 'opening the gates of hell' on itself. According to Abdulrahman al-Ahnoumi, the Acting Director of the Yemeni General Corporation for Radio and Television, the US embassy in Aden has 'lined up its mercenaries for war against the Yemeni people,' with the aim of stopping operations supporting Palestinians in Gaza. 'We will target whatever American interests and bases we can, even if they are located somewhere in Africa and the Persian Gulf. Yemen has long made all the necessary preparations for such a purpose,' Ahnoumi said in a post published on his X account. The Ansarullah official emphasized that just as the US previously paid a heavy price for turning its ships and vessels into 'legitimate targets' for the Yemeni Armed Forces due to acts of aggression, it will have to bear a considerable cost if tensions heighten further. Ahnoumi's warning comes as the US and Britain conducted a joint airstrike on targets in Yemen's northern province of Hajjah, amid the Arab country's ongoing maritime operations against vessels linked to ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô in the Red Sea. Details on potential casualties or damage from the strikes have not been disclosed. The Yemeni Armed Forces have also targeted locations in the strategic western province of Hudaydah, as the country continues to voice its support for Palestine's struggle against the Israeli occupation. So far, the Israeli regime has killed at least 43,603 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured 102,929 others in Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2291500	2024-12-16T03:50:09-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-02168500017050333731.jpg

Iran Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has directed Iran‚Äôs ambassador to Syria to closely monitor the developments in the Arab country to safeguard the Islamic Republic‚Äôs national interests and security. Ambassador Hossein Akbari met with Araghchi at the Foreign Ministry in Tehran on Sunday. During the meeting, the ambassador provided an update on the latest developments in Syria, outlining the measures taken to ensure the safety and security of the Iranian embassy staff and diplomatic missions amidst the ongoing turmoil in the country. Araghchi emphasized the necessity of closely monitoring the situation in Syria to protect Iran's national interests and uphold the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria. In a separate meeting, Araghchi also met Kazem Jalali, the Iranian ambassador to Russia, where he stressed the importance of ongoing consultations with Russia, especially on Syria.

When asked whether Turkey was considering military cooperation with the new Syrian government, Guler said Ankara already had military cooperation and training agreements with many countries. Asked about Russia's future involvement in Syria, Guler said he saw no sign of a complete Russian withdrawal. Russia, he said, is moving its military assets from different parts of Syria to its two bases in the country - the Hmeimim air base at Latakia and a naval base in Tartous. 'I don't think the Russians are going to leave (Syria). They'll do everything they can to stay,' he said.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2291082	2024-12-15T06:10:01-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-07688580017342717571.jpg
Manpower Crunch Forces Israeli Army to Rely on Civilians in 'Enem...	Combat engineering, combat engineering and more combat engineering of all kinds. If we could double the Combat Engineering Corps, not just Yahalom, we‚Äôd have done it by now,' a senior IOF officer told Ynet, highlighting the growing demand for engineering capabilities amid prolonged fighting across multiple arenas. To address these challenges, the IOF plans to establish an additional regular combat engineering battalion in the coming months, adding to the existing three. However, this move is only a partial solution. Ynet mentioned that, in recent months, the IOF has increasingly relied on civilian contractors for operational missions in combat zones, under the command of IOF officers. Initially limited in scope, this practice has grown significantly. Civilian contractors, using large orange bulldozers, have been deployed to level hundreds of buildings in the Netzarim Corridor in northern Gaza, drill for tunnels in areas like the Philadelphi Corridor in southern Gaza and clear space for safer IOF attacks. The Philadelphi Corridor itself has been expanded to a width of 3-4 kilometers, providing a buffer for IOF forces. This trend has extended beyond Gaza. In Lebanon, contractors have crossed the border to clear vast thickets. Some civilian engineering missions in Gaza have reached the front lines, with battalion commanders deploying teams to demolish buildings used to fire on IOF forces. In several recent cases, contractors were spotted working without protective gear such as helmets, overalls or uniforms. One of them described that 'even if they ask us to protect ourselves, it is not comfortable to drill or dig under the sun for hours with a helmet on. We are briefed by the officers before each workday and are warned about how to behave in the event of an operational incident. It is clear that this is dangerous work.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2290950	2024-12-15T03:57:50-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-09698710017342638636.png
Israelis Will Be Buried in Syria: IRGC Commander	IRGC Commander Major General Hussein Salami said that Iran will resolutely protect its security, independence, ruling system, national interests, history and land.

According to IRNA, Major General Salami said, on Sunday at the closing ceremony of the third biennial selection of the best research works, sacred defense and resistance (Martyr Lieutenant General Hajj Qassem Suleimani Award) held at the Museum of the Islamic Revolution and Sacred Defense: 'The Zionists will pay a heavy price. They will be buried in Syrian soil, but this issue will take some time.' Stating that the Islamic world is today the arena of jihad and that the happiness of Muslims passes through the arena of jihad, General Salami said: 'The young mujahideen of the Islamic world have the faith, zeal and motivation necessary to defeat the Zionists and will carry out this action.' IRGC Commander continued: 'Today we see how the foreign powers that are incinerating Syria are like hungry wolves hunting for a lone deer in the desert, tearing off each piece of its body.' The Iranian forces did not go to Syria in order to attain ambitions and interests, General Salami said, yet to help the Syrian live decently and honorably. General Salami also emphasized, in a brief interview with reporters on the sidelines of the ceremony, 'In the face of enemies martyr Suleimani, who is a model of steadfastness and resistance can be a guide, and Muslim nations must stand up and defend their identity.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2290840	2024-12-15T01:08:53-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/08/manar-05368670017225129456.jpg
Israeli Enemy Continues Genocidal War on Gaza for 436th Consecuti...	The Israeli occupation forces continue the genocidal war on the Gaza for its 436th consecutive day, amid an escalation of brutal bombing, massacres and war crimes against civilians across the Strip. According to the Ministry of Public Health, the total number of martyrs of the aggression until Saturday evening reached 44,930 martyrs, in addition to 106,624 injuries, including very serious cases, since October 7, 2023. Local sources also reported the martyrdom of an entire family, namely Abu Alaa Khalaf, his wife and two daughters, in addition to injuries in the Al-Za'anin family, as a result of Israeli artillery shelling in Beit Hanoun, north of the Strip. On Sunday morning, 14 martyrs were killed and about 30 others were injured in raids targeting various areas of Gaza. The Civil Defense announced the recovery of 4 martyrs from under the rubble after shelling targeted the 'Urouq' family in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood. In northern Gaza, the intensive Israeli aggression continued for the 69th consecutive day, as the area witnessed forced displacement, comprehensive destruction of residential buildings, and direct targeting of medical staff, especially in Kamal Adwan Hospital. Healthcare institutions' sources announced on Saturday evening the martyrdom of 47 Palestinians as a result of Israeli raids since dawn, 26 of them in the central and southern Gaza Strip. In a new attack on Palestinian journalists, Muhammad Jabr Qrenawi, an editor at 'Sanad News Agency', was martyred along with his wife and three children as a result of a bombing that targeted their home in Al-Bureij camp in the central Gaza Strip. This brings the number of martyrs of the press since the beginning of the war to 195. In another crime, the brothers Alaa, Karim and Hadeel Radwan Totah were martyred as a result of the shelling of their home in the Al-Zeitoun neighborhood, while eight civilians were injured in the shelling of a tent for displaced people in Deir al-Balah. The occupation forces continued their random shelling on Saturday evening, targeting various areas, including the 'Al-Badr' factory in Al-Daraj neighborhood, the vicinity of Sheikh Zayed and Beit Lahia, in addition to shelter schools in Beit Hanoun estate. The occupation aircraft also launched raids on western Khan Yunis, targeting the tents of the displaced near Al-Durra Stadium in Deir al-Balah. The occupation forces blew up houses in the Beit Lahia project and Jabalia camp, while targeting a residential apartment for the Al-Atal family in Sheikh Radwan neighborhood, which led to the martyrdom of a citizen and the injury of others. The violent artillery shelling targeted the areas of Al-Saftawi and Abu Al-Jidyan in the northern Gaza Strip, adding more tragedies to the Gaza Strip, which lives under a barbaric aggression that targets children, old men, safe houses and hospitals.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2290785	2024-12-15T00:04:30-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-09913260017342498655.jpg
Sheikh Qassem: Hezbollah Defeated Israeli Expansionist Agenda, Sy...	Hezbollah Secretary General, Sheikh Naeem Qassem, affirmed that supporting Gaza is both a noble and essential duty, not only for the group but for the entire Arab and Muslim world, stressing that when others failed to fulfill their responsibilities, the Zionists escalated their aggression, emboldening their tyranny. In a televised speech via Al-Manar, Sheikh Qassem noted that Hezbollah had expected an Israeli attack on Lebanon, though the timing was unknown. He emphasized that the aggression, which began before Operation Al-Aqsa Flood and continued afterward, was unrelated to Gaza's support. The Israeli attack, he explained, was part of their expansionist agenda, aiming to eliminate any resistance that stands in the way of their regional ambitions. 'During this war, the Israeli occupation forces claimed the lives of key Hezbollah leaders, including the late martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, along with several other commanders and fighters. They also breached communication networks and detonated pagers and telecom lines, at a great cost in terms of lives and suffering. However, despite these operations, the enemy failed to achieve its objectives, instead resorting to barbaric attacks on civilians, villages, homes, and innocent children and women,' Sheikh Naim explained. Sheikh Qassem emphasized that the Israeli enemy's crimes were aimed at breaking the resistance, but despite immense sacrifices, they failed. 'Israeli crimes are not achievements; Hezbollah's resistance successfully thwarted the enemy's efforts to destroy and crush it,' he asserted. He highlighted that the enemy had repeatedly stated its intent to eliminate Hezbollah, but the resistance fighters halted their advances. 'Hezbollah's missiles struck deep into Israeli territory, inflicting significant damage and displacing nearly 200,000 settlers. The resistance killed hundreds of Israeli soldiers, wounded many more, and caused extensive economic and social damage across the occupied territories,' his eminence explained. Sheikh Qassem praised the resilience of the people who made tremendous sacrifices to protect the resistance, referring to them as 'brave heroes' who viewed resistance as their sole and vital option in this struggle. 'Thank God, we achieved a true divine victory in this confrontation. The Israeli enemy recognized that its path to defeating Hezbollah‚Äôs resistance is blocked, prompting it to seek a ceasefire agreement.' Israeli Enemy Pursued Ceasefire, Lebanese Government Tasked with Overseeing Violations Sheikh Naim Qassem revealed that the ceasefire agreement was brokered by Hochstein, with both the Israeli occupation and the U.S. in agreement. The agreement was then presented to the Lebanese state, including Speaker Nabih Berri. Despite observations from both President Berri and Hezbollah, necessary adjustments were made, and the agreement was finalized with his involvement. Sheikh Qassem highlighted three factors that led the enemy to seek the agreement: the resistance's steadfastness in the field, the sacrifices of martyrs, and effective political and military leadership. 'We assess that the resistance won because the enemy failed to achieve its central goal of destroying Hezbollah. It couldn‚Äôt return the settlers without an agreement, nor could it enter the ‚Äònew Middle East‚Äô through Lebanon. We blocked its path,' Sheikh Qassem stated. He clarified that the agreement aimed at halting the aggression, not ending the resistance. The deal is an executive one based on Resolution 1701, focusing solely on the area south of the Litani River, where Israel must withdraw and the Lebanese army will deploy as the sole armed authority, ensuring no militants or weapons remain in the region. Sheikh Qassem affirmed that the agreement does not address internal Lebanese issues, including the resistance‚Äôs relationship with the state, the military, or the presence of weapons, all of which require separate dialogue. 'We have tolerated hundreds of Israeli violations to facilitate the implementation of the agreement and expose the Israeli enemy. The Lebanese government is responsible for preventing Israeli violations, and the committee tasked with overseeing the agreement must ensure its implementation. Hezbollah will monitor developments and act according to what we deem necessary for the best interest,' his eminence stated. Resistance Legitimacy Stems from Belief in Its Cause Hezbollah's Secretary General, Sheikh Naim Qassem, stated that the resistance is rooted in faith in God, freedom, dignity, and the defense of justice, land, and country. This belief is supported by preparation, both in terms of weaponry and capabilities, to protect it from adversaries. 'The resistance does not win by a decisive strike; it wins through persistence,' he noted, adding that it may endure for 10 or even 50 years. Sheikh Qassem explained that the resistance faces victories and setbacks, a natural part of its struggle. What matters is its continuity, remaining steadfast in the field despite limited resources. 'Sacrifices made by the resistance do not indicate defeat; they are the price for its survival. These sacrifices shape the resistance‚Äôs strength,' his eminence affirmed. Resistance Continues, Adapting to Each Stage Regarding Hezbollah's next phase, Sheikh Qassem stressed that the resistance is ongoing, with each stage requiring distinct methods and approaches. He emphasized the importance of the resistance's continuity while acknowledging that strategies must evolve to suit each phase, and this is what Hezbollah will focus on. He noted that all Lebanese who supported, wished for, or stood against the Israeli enemy‚Äîwhether by sheltering or backing the resistance‚Äîare partners in its victory. Without the resilience of the resistance on the frontlines, Israel would have reached Beirut, leading to further steps like settlement, naturalization, and undermining Lebanon‚Äôs sovereignty. Sheikh Qassem warned of the expansionist nature of the Israeli enemy and emphasized the necessity of continued resistance. He praised the Lebanese army, which paid a heavy price with the lives of many martyrs in defense of Lebanon, and commended the Lebanese people's unity and cooperation in achieving this result. He added that Hezbollah is strong, recovering from its wounds, and continues to resist. Lebanon‚Äôs strength lies in its army, people, and resistance, which together prevent division and preserve Lebanon‚Äôs unity. Sheikh Qassem outlined Hezbollah's plan for the coming phase, which includes implementing the agreement south of the Litani River, rebuilding with state assistance in collaboration with countries, organizations, and allies supporting Lebanon's reconstruction, and working towards electing a president by January 9th to resume state functioning. The plan also focuses on participating in a state-driven reform and rescue program emphasizing citizenship, equality, the rule of law, and anti-corruption, along with engaging in constructive dialogue on contentious issues. Hezbollah Calls for Syrian-Lebanese Cooperation, Uninterrupted Anti-Israeli Occupation Stance Speaking of the recent developments in Syria, Sheikh Qassem emphasized that Hezbollah supported Syria due to its anti-Israeli occupation stance, contributing to the resistance‚Äôs capabilities through its territory for Lebanon and Palestine. However, with the fall of the old regime and the rise of new forces, he stated, 'We cannot assess these new powers until stability is achieved and their positions are clarified.' He expressed hope that the new Syrian government and its people would choose cooperation between Lebanon and Syria based on equality and mutual support while urging that Syria should recognize Israel as an enemy and avoid normalization. Sheikh Qassem affirmed the Syrian people‚Äôs right to choose their leadership, constitution, and future without foreign interference, particularly from countries with interests aligned with Israel. Regarding Hezbollah‚Äôs military supply route through Syria, Sheikh Qassem acknowledged the loss of this route but stressed that the resistance is adaptable, capable of finding new paths or relying on alternative methods if needed. His eminence concluded by stating that the situation in Syria would not negatively affect Lebanon and expressed hope for Syria‚Äôs stability and prosperity, noting the broader regional pressures influenced by the US and Israeli enemy.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2290686	2024-12-14T10:54:59-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-00928590017342024751.jpg

Iran Calls for Free Elections in Syria Amid ‚ÄòDifficult Test‚Äô from...	Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has warned that Syria is facing a 'difficult test' from terrorist groups and foreign aggression, but says free elections can help the country overcome its challenges.

The threat posed by the movements of terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda and Daesh has heightened regional concerns, raising fears that the terrorists may turn Syria into their safe haven,' Araghchi wrote. The Iranian minister also condemned the 'barbaric crimes' and 'encroachment' of the Israeli regime on Syrian territory, saying the actions were aimed at 'the destruction of Syria's social foundations, scientific assets, economic infrastructure, and defensive capabilities.' Araghchi was critical of regional countries that have expressed 'regret and concern' over the situation, calling their words 'the most meaningless' in the face of ongoing atrocities. To address the crisis, Araghchi proposed 'free elections' as a solution, stating that 'the way out of the current impasse and to keep the flag of independence aloft and uphold the pride and dignity of the Syrian nation is to preserve cohesion and foster a spirit of coexistence among the people through free elections.' The Iranian foreign minister emphasized that 'respect for the people's votes is realized through free and fair elections that reflect the will of the Syrian nation and lead to the formation of a political system representing all segments of society.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2290246	2024-12-14T05:36:28-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-07218780017283823862.jpg
Iran Atomic Organization Says Tougher IAEA Inspection Quite Natur...	Head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Mohammad Eslami said the AEOI won‚Äôt impede the UN nuclear watchdog‚Äôs access and inspection of its sites. Speaking to reporters in Tehran on Saturday, tamped down media controversy over the new plans for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to toughen the monitoring of Iran‚Äôs nuclear activities, describing it as part of an ordinary course. He said it is totally natural for a country with nuclear activities to allow a change in the level of monitoring when a change in the scale of enrichment takes place. AEOI chief says IAEA has always been able to conduct its routine inspections at #Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities without facing any restrictions. 'Iran operates within IAEA framework and it is natural that the agency will increase its inspections after a rise in nuclear activities.' pic.twitter.com/BVIabvrUyb ‚Äî Iran's Today (@Iran) December 14, 2024 Eslami said Iran has decided to increase the uranium enrichment capacity and so the frequency of IAEA inspections would naturally grow as well. 'We are acting within the framework of the IAEA, which oversees Iran‚Äôs activities. It is natural that when, for example, three (uranium enrichment) units increase to five units, the monitoring will proportionally increase,' he noted. Eslami stated that the IAEA is overseeing Iran‚Äôs nuclear activities in accordance with the Safeguards Agreement and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) without any restriction. 'We have not created and will not create any obstacles for the agency‚Äôs inspections and access,' the AEOI chief was quoted as saying by Iranian media. 'We operate within the framework of safeguards, and the agency also acts according to regulations‚Äîno more, no less,' he added. On Thursday, the IAEA said in a confidential report to member states that Iran has agreed to the Agency's request to increase the frequency and intensity of the implementation of safeguards measures at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant (FFEP) and is facilitating the implementation of this strengthened safeguards approach. Last week the UN nuclear agency reported that Iran had multiplied the pace of its enrichment to up to 60% purity at Fordow.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2290224	2024-12-14T04:54:23-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/02/manar-00938960016442205707.jpg

Elsewhere in the Old City of Hebron, Israeli occupation troops were reported to have assaulted and detained a young Palestinian man. Local activist Aref Jaber expressed grave concerns about the escalating violence by Israeli forces and illegal settlers against Palestinian residents in the area. This incident comes amid a concerning rise in casualties in the West Bank, as a result of the intensified near-daily Israeli raids into villages and cities in the occupied territories.

UN Chief Calls on ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô to End Strikes in Syria, Withdraw from...	UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres expressed concern at Israeli 'extensive violations of Syria‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity', a spokesman said on Thursday. Guterres is particularly concerned about several hundred Israeli airstrikes on several Syrian locations and stresses 'the urgent need to deescalate violence on all fronts throughout the country,' UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric tells reporters Thursday. Dujarric noted that the UN chief 'condemns all actions violating the 1974 ceasefire agreement' between Syria and the Zionist entity, insisting it remains in force days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared it 'void'due to the fall of former president Bashar AL-Assad‚Äôs government. Stephane Dujarric, UN spokesman, in a press conference (image from archive). Guterres also calls on the parties to uphold the agreement and end 'all unauthorized presence in the area of separation' and refrain from any action undermining the disengagement pact and stability in the Golan Heights, the spokesman said. The Israeli occupation military said Tuesday it carried out more than 350 strikes in Syria over the previous 48 hours, hitting 'most of the strategic weapons stockpiles' belonging to the FRMER Syrian government.

Russia Nears Deal With New Syria Leaders to Keep Army Bases	Russia is nearing an agreement with Syria‚Äôs new leadership to keep two vital military bases in the Middle East state, a key objective of the Kremlin after the armed groups controlled the country. Talks are taking place for Russian forces to remain at the naval port in Tartus and the air base at Khmeimim, according to people with knowledge of the matter in Moscow, Europe and the Middle East, asking not to be identified because the issue is sensitive. The Defense Ministry in Moscow believes it has an informal understanding with Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham, or HTS, the former al-Qaeda offshoot that it can stay at the Syrian bases, the person in Russia said. The situation could still change amid the instability in Syria, the person cautioned. Moscow has established contact with HTS in Damascus and hopes the group 'will honor promises' to keep foreign diplomats safe, Russian state media cited Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov as saying. Russia plans to keep its bases in Syria as the fight against ISIL, is not over, he said. 'I assume that everyone agrees that the fight against terrorism and the remnants of ISIL is not over,' Bogdanov was reported as saying. 'This requires collective effort and in this sense our presence and the Khmeimim base have been playing an important role.' 'The bases remain on Syrian territory, where they were,' Bogdanov added. 'No other decisions have been made.' It wasn‚Äôt immediately possible to verify the information with officials in the transitional government in Syria. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a request to comment. Status Quo Western officials with knowledge of the interactions said the international community has expressed an informal interest in maintaining the status quo when it came to the Russian bases for the time being, as they could act as a deterrent for any recurrence of extremism in the country. HTS has signaled to Russia it isn‚Äôt interested in hostilities because there are no obvious contenders to its power in the country, the Western officials added. Russia‚Äôs Tartus naval base is the country‚Äôs only hub on the Mediterranean Sea. The airfield is used to supply Russia‚Äôs security operations in Africa, allowing it to project political and economic influence and restore some of Moscow‚Äôs Cold War-era authority on the continent. President Bashar Al-Assad arrived in Moscow with his family, the Kremlin said on Sunday, adding that Russian officials are in contact with representatives of the armed Syrian opposition who took control of the Syrian capital and several key provinces in the Arab country.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2289300	2024-12-12T13:03:45-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-09689210017340374151.jpg
Houthi Affirms Yemen‚Äôs Support for Syria against Israeli Peril Th...	Head of Yemen's Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi delivered on Thursday a televised speech, highlighting the Zionist danger threatening the entire Arab and Islamic Umma. Sayyed Houthi indicated that the 'Israeli' aggression on Syria took two directions: the first involved the incursion of its forces deep into the territory, approaching the outskirts of Damascus, and the second focused on destroying military assets. Reports estimate that the enemy army is 25 km away from Damascus, highlighting the extent of the 'Israeli' incursion, with the possibility of continued expansion and invasion, he added. Houthi noted that the enemy army advanced without encountering any resistance or showing concern for the Syrian people, the factions controlling Syria, their supporters, or the global community. The 'Israeli' enemy, through its incursion into Syria, disregarded international laws, conventions, and UN charters, he maintained. The 'Israeli' enemy seeks to occupy countries whenever opportunities arise, actively creating and preparing favorable conditions to implement its plans, Houthi warned. Houthi underlined that the American occupation in Syria focuses on oil resources, engaging in blatant and open looting of Syrian oil, adding that the 'Israeli' enemy destroyed Syria‚Äôs military capabilities in the largest air aggression since the establishment of the occupying entity. The 'Israeli' enemy has never targeted the military capabilities of any Arab country as extensively as it did in Syria, claiming to have destroyed 80% in a single night, he added. According to the Yemeni leader, the 'Israeli' aggression on Syria aims to establish a principle of impunity, working in collaboration with and supported by the United States to impose this on the nations and countries of our region. The enemy seeks to seize specific areas to use as military bases without any objections or resistance, according to Sayyed Houthi who added that 'Israel' is first working to establish its dominance in Syria before moving to broader objectives. 'The second principle the Israeli enemy aims to enforce is capping the military capabilities of our nations to ensure its own military superiority.The enemy endeavors to destroy all defensive capabilities, including air, naval, missile, and air defense systems, as seen in Syria.' The Syrian people and the factions that took control of Syria have a responsibility to confront the Israeli aggression, Houthi stressed, adding that the wider Muslim nation has a duty to stand with the Syrian people against the 'Israeli' aggression. 'The Israeli enemy represents a genuine threat to the entire nation, transcending all sects, doctrines, and affiliations. The actions of the enemy after these groups seized control in Syria prove that their claims of targeting Iran are false. Despite the armed groups‚Äô hostility toward Iran, the Israeli enemy continues to attack Syria.' Sayyed Houthi reaffirmed the Yemeni solidarity with Syria and its people against the Israeli aggression. 'Our stance against Israeli aggression is unwavering, regardless of who controls the situation. As long as the aggression targets an Arab country and a Muslim people, we stand with that country.' Sayyed Houthi called on everyone to take a clear and declared stance against the Israeli enemy, adding that silence and inaction are unacceptable; now is not the time for leniency with the enemy. 'There is surprising tolerance among some Arab and Islamic regimes and groups toward the horrific crimes committed by the Israeli enemy against Palestinian detainees and captives.' Houthi addressed the groups controlling Syria: 'How we wish to see chants of 'Allahu Akbar', rifles, and knives used in confronting Israeli soldiers.' The American and Israeli rhetoric about reshaping the Middle East signifies an ongoing U.S.-Israeli project and conspiracy targeting our nations and countries, Houthi pointed out. Gaza 'From the outset of the Israeli aggression on Gaza, we declared a clear stance supported by action, including missiles, drones, naval operations, financial support, and other means.' Sayyed Houthi said that joint operations have been carried out between the Yemeni Armed Forces and the Islamic Resistance in Iraq against the Israeli enemy, which were announced and claimed. 'This week witnessed significant and numerous operations from Yemen's support front as part of the fifth phase of escalation in the Promised Victory battle and Sacred Jihad. Yemen's operations this week included 19 ballistic and cruise missiles as well as drones. The support front operations targeted occupied Jaffa, Ashdod, and Ashkelon this week. Some operations extended to the seas, targeting five American ships in the Gulf of Aden, including two warships. The American ships were targeted despite exercising the utmost caution, camouflage, and concealment.' In support for the Palestinian people and their mujahideen and retaliation to the American-British aggression against Yemen, the naval , UAV , and the missile forces of the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out a specific military operation targeted three American supply ships after they left the port of Djibouti and had previously practiced their aggression against Yemen.

The Lebanese Army Thursday deployed its military units at five positions in Khiam town in coordination with the UNIFIL troops and after the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation soldiers defeated by the Islamic Resistance.

Iran‚Äôs Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Commander Major General Hossein Salami stressed on Thursday that routes to support Resistance Front are still open and that they are not limited to Syria, noting that the IRGC forces were the last people to leave the country following the downfall of former president Bashar Al-Assad‚Äôs government. Speaking to a gathering of IRGC commanders, Maj. Gen. Salami hailed the former Syrian President Bashar Assad for its foreign policy and siding with the Resistance Front. 'Syria had the brightest and most salient record among Arab countries in confronting Zionism, and it was the only country that did not accept any of normalization plans and was always in a state of confrontation, offensive, defensive, and resistance towards the United States and the Israeli regime,' Maj. Gen. Salami said in remarks carried by Mehr News Agency. 'After destroying ISIL's control, we had to withdraw our non-necessary forces from Syria,' he continued. 'Over the past 13-year period, we have tried to make Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Palestinian movement largely independent&#8230;' the IRGC commander continued.

'We couldn't engage the entire IRGC and Basij in a place where its army was just bystander.' The IRGC commander further said that Iranian intelligence had warned the Syrian government about the increasing activities of the armed opposition groups. 'Even our brothers (IRGC intel forces) were able to find the axes of their attack using intelligence techniques and conveyed the intellects to the political and military level in Syria, but because the will to change, war, and resistance in its true sense did not exist, unfortunately, we say what happened.' In this context, he affirmed that the routes to support the Resistance Front are still open and that they are not limited to Syria.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2288893	2024-12-12T01:52:18-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/08/manar-05368670017225129456.jpg

Russia Completed its Mission in Syria Some Time ŸêŸêŸêAgo: Kremlin	Russia assisted Syria in countering terrorists and stabilizing the situation after 2015, but subsequent actions were up to the country‚Äôs government, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. 'A while ago, Russia helped the Syrian Arab Republic in combating terrorists and ensuring stability when the situation posed a threat to the entire region. We put in significant effort toward that goal. Russia completed its mission at that point,' he said. 'Afterward, it was the [Bashar] Assad government that took charge in its own country, striving to ensure development, but unfortunately, the situation reached the point it did,' Peskov said, adding that 'now, we need to proceed based on the realities on the ground.' Asked how a potential change of government in Syria would affect Moscow‚Äôs geopolitical influence in the Middle East, the presidential spokesman emphasized that 'Russia maintains dialogue with all countries in the region.' 'We are committed to continuing in this manner,' Peskov said. In late November, armed opposition forces launched a large-scale offensive on the Syrian army‚Äôs positions and entered Damascus on December 8, while government troops withdrew from the capital. A Kremlin source told TASS on Sunday that Assad and his family members had arrived in Moscow. Russia granted them asylum on humanitarian grounds.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2288343	2024-12-11T06:59:23-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2016/08/manar-08251680014726505203.jpg

Russia Strongly Believes Syria Should Be Sovereign and Unified, A...	Russia is providing sanctuary to Bashar Al-Assad, having transported the former Syrian leader there 'in the most secure way possible' after the collapse of his government, Russia‚Äôs deputy foreign minister said in an interview Tuesday. 'He is secured, and it shows that Russia acts as required in such an extraordinary situation,' Sergei Ryabkov told NBC News, becoming the first Russian official to confirm Assad‚Äôs presence in the country. 'I have no idea what is going on with him right now,' Ryabkov said, adding that it 'would be very wrong for me to elaborate on what happened and how it was resolved.' President Bashar Al-Assad during a visit to Moscow in March 2023. The Kremlin said on Monday that President Vladimir Putin had made the decision to grant asylum in Russia to Assad. Asked if the Kremlin would hand over Assad for trial, Ryabkov said Russia is not a party to the convention that established the International Criminal Court. Assad 'was accused by the same group of countries and governments that continuously defeat attempts to live their own ways as it happened in Iraq, in Libya and in many more,' Ryabkov said, adding that it was 'amazing, but it is also very revealing,' that the U.S. 'configures its reaction and response' depending on whom the court is prosecuting. Whoever ends up governing Syria, be it the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) militant group, which led militants as they stormed across Syria, or someone else, Ryabkov said, Russia 'forcefully and strongly' believes that Syria 'should be sovereign, unified and integral.' 'We will not have a situation there, hopefully, that will mean separation of parts of Syria from one another,' he added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2287771	2024-12-11T00:09:57-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2019/07/manar-08865710015637816978.jpg

For the first time after the ceasefire concluded in South Lebanon on November 27, 2024, the UNIFIL vehicles were seen on Tuesday with Lebanese army soldiers at the Ainatha-Bint Jbeil junction near Al-Maslakh neighborhood. The Israeli occupation army carried out a large-scale bombing operation in Khiam, blowing up houses and buildings. Media reports indicated that 'a column of Israeli Merkava tanks withdrew from Wata Khiam towards the Sarda and Al-Amra areas adjacent to the Wazzani orchards.' The Israeli army also fired its machine guns at the surroundings of the town of Shaqra, Qalaat Dubiyeh and the valleys adjacent to the towns of Qabrikha and Majdal Salm, while a number of Israeli artillery shells were recorded falling on the outskirts of Sheheen and Al-Jbeen. Meanwhile, a missile fired by Israeli warplanes penetrated a three-story house in the town of Qleiaat in the Akkar plain, but did not explode.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2287584	2024-12-10T15:50:46-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-09021120017338746358.png
Hezbollah Calls for Taking All Necessary Measures to Prevent Isra...	Hezbollah issued on Tuesday a statement to maintain that the Israeli entity's occupation of additional Syrian territories and targeting of military capabilities there constitutes a dangerous and strongly condemned act of aggression. The UN Security Council, the international community, and Arab and Islamic nations bear the responsibility of rejecting as well as ending this aggression and protecting the Syrian people during this critical and pivotal stage of their history, the statement noted. 'We have always warned against Israeli ambitions across the region and resisted them to prevent the occupation from achieving its goals. We have repeatedly emphasized that the aggression on Gaza is a war of extermination and a stepping stone to altering the region‚Äôs landscape and ending the Palestinian cause.' Hezbollah stressed that the complete silence of the Arab, Islamic, and international entities about the criminal aggression on Syria, backed by unlimited American support, and the failure to take practical measures to confront this aggression and support the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights, have emboldened the Zionist entity to expand its transgressions against the region. 'All necessary steps must be taken to prevent the Israeli entity from achieving its goals. Silence or mere observation of this brutal aggression against Syria and its people is unacceptable. What is happening in Syria today, both on popular and political levels, and the resulting internal and external political choices, is the exclusive right of the Syrian people, free from any external pressures or influences.' We hope Syria will stabilize through the choices of its people, achieve its revival, and remain firmly in the position of rejecting Israeli occupation and preventing foreign interventions in its affairs, the statement read. Hezbollah affirmed would continue to stand by Syria and its people in defending their right to shape their future and confront their enemy, the usurping Israeli entity. The Israeli air force went ahead with striking Syria‚Äôs military capabilities, with over 300 strikes being staged in the last few days. a Hezbollah issued late Monday a statement which stressed that the ongoing crimes committed by the Zionist enemy on Syrian territory, whether by occupying more lands in the Golan Heights or striking and destroying the defensive capabilities of the Syrian state, represent a blatant aggression and a insolent violation of the sovereignty of the Syrian state and people and constitute an attempt to destabilize this brotherly country.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2287529	2024-12-10T12:40:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-04165050017056142612.png

Israeli Massacres in Gaza Continue as Ceasefire and Prisoner Swap...	The ongoing genocide in Gaza marks its 431st day, with a new massacre in the north leaving at least 20 Palestinians dead and several others injured in an Israeli airstrike on Beit Hanoun. More casualties were reported in Al-Nuseirat, Rafah, and Zeitoun. Amid these massacres, discussions within the Israeli occupation entity suggest a potential prisoner swap and ceasefire with Hamas, though Zionist Prime Minister Netanyahu's office downplays reports of progress. The Qatari Foreign Ministry has stated that negotiations continue, but any developments are premature. Hamas has reportedly provided Egypt with a list of elderly and ill Zionist prisoners for release in the first phase of the ceasefire. They also presented names of Palestinian prisoners they seek to free. Sources close to Hamas said their delegation briefed Egypt's intelligence minister on these efforts, but no breakthrough occurred in the talks. Hamas emphasized its commitment to ending the conflict and supporting the management of Gaza. Meanwhile, a Zionist official suggested that a prisoner swap could be finalized in one to two weeks, claiming conditions are favorable, according to Yedioth Ahronoth. However, sources close to Hamas stated that the deal hinges on the Zionist entity agreeing to Egypt‚Äôs proposal. Reports from Israeli Channel 12 reveal that it remains uncertain whether Hamas will drop its demand for a permanent ceasefire. Hamas is aware of Israeli occupation‚Äôs resistance to any concessions regarding future military operations. The Zionist cabinet will meet on Thursday to discuss the situation, with reports indicating that Netanyahu may struggle to secure coalition support for the deal. This comes ahead of a visit by US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who will discuss the ceasefire, developments in Lebanon and Syria, and the Gaza prisoner swap with Israeli officials. Ongoing Genocide in Gaza: 44,758 Martyrs, 106,134 Injured As Israeli occupation airstrikes continue across Gaza, claiming the lives of nearly 60 Palestinians, the death toll since the onset of the massacre on October 7 has reached 44,758, with over 106,000 injured. The Israeli occupation forces have carried out 9,905 attacks, including 7,160 against families, and have wiped out 1,410 families, resulting in 5,444 martyrs. Today, 13 Palestinians were martyred in an Israeli bombing in central Gaza. Meanwhile, 25 Palestinians died and many others were injured or went missing when Israeli forces targeted an apartment building in Beit Hanoun. In the Nuseirat camp, a Palestinian fisherman was martyred by Israeli naval fire, while seven others were killed in an airstrike on a home in the same camp. In northern Gaza, 25 civilians were killed when Israeli airstrikes destroyed a home in Abed Rabbo. Israeli forces also targeted civilian homes in Gaza City with heavy artillery, while six fishermen were arrested off the coast of Deir Al-Balah. In Rafah, two bodies were recovered after an Israeli drone attack on the Al-Zuhur neighborhood. Additionally, Israeli artillery shelled the Al-Tuwam and Al-Saftawi areas in northern Gaza. Israeli occupation forces demolished a house in Rafah and more homes in the west of the Jabaliya camp. A bombing in the Maghazi camp left several children injured, and a six-month-old girl was injured in an attack on a displaced persons' tent in the south. For 67 days, northern Gaza has been under siege, with no access to humanitarian or medical aid due to constant Israeli attacks and blockades. The Civil Defense has been unable to operate in northern Gaza for 49 days, leaving thousands of residents without critical care. The spokesperson for Gaza's Civil Defense warns that if the war continues, over 2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip could lose their lives. pic.twitter.com/OcqiE0izyO ‚Äî Quds News Network (@QudsNen) December 10, 2024 Education Amid Crisis In other developments, 29,600 students in Gaza have qualified for secondary school exams despite the challenges. According to the Ministry of Education, 260,000 students are now learning through online platforms, and digital exams have been held for 29,600 students in the 11th grade. Despite widespread power and internet outages due to the ongoing conflict, the ministry continues to launch initiatives to support digital learning. Educational materials have been adapted to focus on essential content to accommodate the difficult conditions. Since the start of the war, 11,923 students have been martyred, and 19,199 have been injured. Over 788,000 students have been unable to attend schools or universities due to the ongoing aggression, with many suffering from severe psychological trauma and difficult living conditions.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2287342	2024-12-10T05:47:37-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-00126400017338373639.jpeg
Netanyahu in Court for Corruption Amid Protests	Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared today, Tuesday, before the Central Court in the occupied city of Tel Aviv to testify in response to charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust brought against him by the public prosecutor. This marks a pivotal moment in the five-year-long legal battle, as Netanyahu, the central figure in corruption cases 1000, 2000, and 4000, begins presenting his defense. Netanyahu‚Äôs testimony is expected to span several weeks, with the court requiring his attendance three times a week for extended hours. According to Israeli Occupation Army Radio, this is an unprecedented event, as a sitting 'prime minister' stands trial while still in office. Outside the courthouse, protesters gathered, including families of Zionist prisoners in Gaza, criticizing Netanyahu for prioritizing his military offensives over resolving prisoner exchanges or achieving a ceasefire with Palestinian resistance factions. Demonstrators chanted, 'A year of devastation‚Äîwe will not forget or forgive,' and echoed the charges against Netanyahu: 'Bribery, fraud, and betrayal of trust.'

His testimony was ultimately moved to Tel Aviv‚Äôs Central Court for security reasons. Netanyahu arrived at the court at 10:00 a.m., having sought to reduce his required court days, citing ongoing military operations in Gaza and Syria‚Äîa request denied by the judges. Zionist Speaker of the Knesset Amir Ohana‚Äôs argument that the court should coordinate Netanyahu‚Äôs schedule with him was also rejected, as Netanyahu had waived his parliamentary immunity. The Corruption Cases Netanyahu faces three major corruption cases. First, in Case 1000, he is accused of accepting expensive gifts and personal benefits from businessmen, including Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan, in exchange for political favors, such as securing a 10-year US visa for Milchan. Second, in Case 2000, he allegedly negotiated with Yedioth Ahronoth publisher Arnon Mozes, proposing to limit the free distribution of rival newspaper Israel Hayom in return for favorable coverage in Yedioth. Third, in Case 4000, Netanyahu is charged with striking a deal with businessman Shaul Elovitch, owner of the Walla news site, to secure positive media coverage in exchange for regulatory benefits facilitating the merger of Elovitch‚Äôs companies, Bezeq and Yes.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2287100	2024-12-10T03:45:11-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-06725410017338309854.jpg

According to the report, a significant number of prisoners in the Etzion Detention Center are suffering from severe food poisoning after consuming spoiled meals provided by the prison administration. A lawyer from the Commission of Detainees' Affairs visited nine of the affected detainees, who exhibited similar symptoms of 'abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, weakness, fatigue, facial yellowing, significant fluid loss, and an inability to stand.' This is not the first time such an incident has occurred at Etzion, with previous cases of food poisoning documented over the years. The Commission of Detainees' Affairs has accused the prison administration of 'deliberately subjecting detainees to harsh punishment since the start of the (Israeli) assault on Gaza,' including prolonged hunger, poor-quality meals, and severe beatings and solitary confinement for those who protest. Amani Sarahna, the media coordinator for the Palestinian Prisoners Society, stated that Etzion is a temporary detention and investigation center, where detainees are later transferred to other facilities. The prison currently holds 111 detainees, none of whom received medical treatment for the food poisoning. The Commission of Detainees' Affairs has called on international organizations to 'intervene urgently to alleviate their suffering and ensure their protection in Israeli prisons.' The commission's lawyer reported that the detainees' severe symptoms indicate a deliberate attempt to punish and mistreat the prisoners. This disturbing revelation sheds light on the ongoing human rights abuses faced by Palestinian detainees in Israeli custody, further highlighting the need for immediate intervention and accountability.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2287166	2024-12-10T03:10:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-03554820017312583591.png

Israeli Air Force chief Tomer Bar said on Tuesday that a drone fired from Yemen which hit a building in the city of Yavne yesterday without any sirens was mistakenly thought to pose no threat. A statement from the Israeli occupation military said that after Bar investigated the incident, it was found that the drone was initially flagged as suspect, and was slated to be shot down, before officials decided instead not to, believing it to be a civilian aircraft. Tomer Bar, Israeli Air Force chief (image from archive). Since the drone was not classified as a threat, no sirens were sounded, the statement added. Bar said that the 'Air Force failed in the incident and did not provide protection and warning to Israeli citizens.' He noted that in the future, sirens should be sounded even if a drone is not fully determined to be a threat. Earlier on Monday, Yemeni Armed Forces announced a drone strike on a target in Yavne, in support of the oppressed people of Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2286913	2024-12-10T00:16:23-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-04236860017338178481.jpg

Hezbollah Denounces Israeli Expanding Occupation of Golan Heights...	Hezbollah issued late Monday a statement which stressed that the ongoing crimes committed by the Zionist enemy on Syrian territory, whether by occupying more lands in the Golan Heights or striking and destroying the defensive capabilities of the Syrian state, represent a blatant aggression and a insolent violation of the sovereignty of the Syrian state and people and constitute an attempt to destabilize this brotherly country. The Resistance Party maintained that this aggressive occupation of Syrian territories comes with the continued aggression of the Zionist army on Lebanon and its daily violations as well as attacks on Gaza, which places the peoples in front of an imminent danger that confirms the unity of the their path and the necessity of rejecting and confronting this aggression. 'While we condemn these attacks, we warn against the consequences of their continuation. We also call on the world, especially the Arab and Islamic worlds, to take firm positions against these crimes and to exert pressure in all political and legal fields to stop this series of attacks, as all the justifications put forward by the enemy are flimsy allegations.' Hezbollah maintained that all the enemy attempts to control new Syrian lands cannot consecrate any kind of rights, as all of this can only be called an ongoing occupation in the Golan region since 1967. Finally, Hezbollah reiterated its support for Syria, underlining the necessity of preserving its unity in terms of people and territory. The Zionist air force launched on Monday more than 100 air raids on Syrian military airports as well as weaponry caches and factories. Israeli Army Radio announced that fighter jets bombed more than 100 sites inside Syria in the past few hours. Israeli air raids destroyed Syrian warships at port of Latakia, according to media reports.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2286748	2024-12-09T15:01:55-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-027725400166239486010.jpg
Iran Condemns Zionist Regime‚Äôs Repeated Attacks on Syrian Infrast...	Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Esmail Baghaei Hamaneh strongly condemned the Zionist regime's repeated encroachment on Syrian infrastructure and the occupation of other parts of the Syrian Golan. Baghaei condemned the Zionist regime's repeated encroachment on Syrian infrastructure over the past two days and the occupation of other parts of the Syrian Golan, and condemned the supporting the regime by Western countries and their silence and inaction against this clear violation of the law, which the Zionist regime considers as confirmation of its aggressive actions. Referring to the action of the Zionist regime in the military attack on Syrian territory - in a situation where the Syrian people are facing changes caused by the change of the regime - Baghaei called this act of aggression a clear violation of the UN Charter and demanded an immediate response from the UN Security Council to stop the aggression and holding the occupying regime accountable. Baghaei warned that the Israeli regime is exploiting the situation in Syria to expand its genocidal campaign against Palestinians. 'These days they are abusing the complicated situation in #Syria for ever-expanding their genocidal campaign in #Palestine,' Baghaei wrote in a message on social media platform X on Monday to mark the anniversary of the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which was adopted on December 9, 1948. Citing UN Special Rapporteur for Palestine Francesca Albanese, Baghaei noted that the Israeli regime is founded on the goal of erasing Palestinians and that its entire political system is directed towards that objective. 'Genocide is defined as a specific set of acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group,' he said. 'It is high time that the int'l community stood up in support of humanity and put an end to this horrific century-long genocide,' he said. Baghaei pointed out that the Israeli regime has defied all six provisional measures by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which ruled early this year that Israel must prevent any acts contrary to the Genocide Convention.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2286715	2024-12-09T13:03:33-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-04255540017337782001.jpg
