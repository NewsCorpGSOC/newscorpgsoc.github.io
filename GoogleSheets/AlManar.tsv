Speaker Berri Salutes Martyr S. Nasrallah, Calls on Displaced Leb...	Lebanese parliament Speaker Nabih Berri called for all displaced people, including those abroad, to return home, few hours after the ceasefire between Lebanon and the Zionist entity took effect at dawn. In a televised speech, Speaker Berri saluted the nation’s martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, whom he said tasked him with the responsibility of the political resistance. 'I call you to come back to your country, come back to your towns and come back to the places where you were born, even if they were in rubble. You should protect the land that saw the blood of all the martyrs,' stated Speaker Berri, who was mandated by Hezbollah to lead negotiations on behalf of Hezbollah and along PM Najib Mikati on behalf of the Lebanese State. 'Come back to your land and bring back life to all the neighborhoods that the Israeli occupation and aggression tried to destroy. The victory of your land relies on you coming back,' he added. Speaker Berri said Lebanon needs 'to elect a president as soon as possible'. 'It should unify all of us. It is a test so that we can protect Lebanon from all the threats including Israeli threats,' the Lebanese Parliament speaker said. 'The only thing which would keep us all together is to protect Lebanon, so we can overcome this challenge and be stronger,' Berri added. 'And also to demonstrate and show to the world that it is a country that can coexist with its different spiritual components, in contradiction with the racism of Israel,' he noted.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2279620	2024-11-27T03:33:32-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-07687950017327071093.jpg
Gaza’s Islamic Jihad Vows Unity with Hezbollah Until Victory	The secretary-general of the Gaza-based Palestinian resistance movement Islamic Jihad has pledged continued unity with its Lebanese counterpart, Hezbollah, until victory is achieved. In a message to Hezbollah's deputy secretary-general, Sheikh Naim Qassem, Ziad Nakhala declared, 'We will stay united as one front and one Resistance, until victory.' The Palestinian official further commended regional resistance movements for their valiant and successful struggle in the face of the Israeli regime and its allies. 'From Palestine to Lebanon, from the courageous Gaza to the resilient suburbs of Beirut, and from the heroic Palestinian fighters to the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon, we commend your unwavering steadfastness and strength,' he wrote. 'Despite the wounds and the relentless onslaught of enemies, led by the US and its allies, you continue to uphold the banner of resistance with pride and dignity.' Nakhala recalled how the resistance groups had rushed to Palestinians’ defense and support, 'offering your valuable lives, while others were unable to provide even basic relief to the thirsty and hungry people of Palestine.' The comments concerned hundreds of successful retaliatory operations that the movements have been carrying out against the occupied Palestinian territories since last October, when the Israeli regime began bringing the Gaza Strip under a genocidal war. The remarks come after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a ceasefire deal, following a deadly Israeli aggression on Gaza and Lebanon that claimed over 3,700 lives. Hezbollah has responded with hundreds of successful retaliatory strikes, which observers believe forced Israel's hand in accepting the ceasefire. Nakhala praised the resistance movements for rushing to the defense of Palestinians, 'offering your valuable lives, while others were unable to provide even basic relief to the thirsty and hungry people of Palestine.' He expressed confidence that the united front of resistance will continue to 'uphold the banner of resistance with pride and dignity' until victory is achieved.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2279521	2024-11-27T02:26:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/11/manar-09077080017008254086.jpeg

Lebanon Ceasefire Takes Effect: Citizens Defy Israeli Threats, Re...	Shortly after the ceasefire with the Israeli enemy took effect in Lebanon on Wednesday, citizens started to return home in their towns and neighborhoods in Bekaa, south Lebanon and Dahiyeh (the southern suburb of Beirut), defying Israeli threats to return, especially to southern villages. Israeli occupation army warned soon after the ceasefire began at 4:00 at dawn that residents of south Lebanon should not approach enemy army positions and villages its forces had ordered to be evacuated. 'With the entry into force of the ceasefire agreement and based on its provisions, the IDF remains deployed in its positions inside southern Lebanon,' enemy army spokesman Avichay Adraee said in a post on X, referring to the Israeli occupation forces. 'You are prohibited from heading towards the villages that the IDF has ordered to be evacuated or towards IDF forces in the area.' However, photos and videos circulated on social media showed streams of cars carrying displaced people heading for southern villages, as the citizens couldn’t wait more to go to their hometowns after 65 days of brutal Israeli aggression that started on September 23. توثيق لزحمة السير.. النازحون يعودون إلى قراهم في الجنوب.#وقائع pic.twitter.com/XqouGZS10C — وقائع (@waqa2e3) November 27, 2024 The hours before the truce took effect were some of the most violent in the war, with the Israeli enemy staging violent raids on the capital Beirut, Dahiyeh, Bekaa and southern Lebanon.

Netanyahu Indirectly Acknowledges Failure of War on Lebanon: We N...	After around two months of war on Lebanon, the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Tel Aviv would approve an indirect ceasefire deal with Lebanon mediated by the United States and France. In a press conference on Tuesday evening, Netanyau claimed that the Israeli approval of the ceasefire came in order to concentrate on the 'Iranian threat', reactivate the army, overcome the restrictions imposed on the arms supplies to 'Israel', and separating the Lebanese and Gaza fronts in order to isolate Hamas were behind the Zionist decision to accept the ceasefire. In an attempt to justify the decision before the Israelis, Netanyahu said that the occupation army would attack whenever it detects violation of the deal, alleging that 'Israel' would prevent Hezbollah from rearming. The Israeli Channel 13 conducted a poll which showed that 61% of the Zionists believe that 'Israel' did not win the war. Netanyahu also faces a harsh criticism from the residents of the northern settlements over the agreement, amid assertions that the displaced settlers would not return home in light of the outcome of the ongoing confrontation. In this regard, the former minister Avigdor Lieberman said that none can prevent Hezbollah from rearming, calling on the displaced settlers to avoid returning to the 'North'.

In a scene of maximum madness, confusion, and fear of Hezbollah entitlements in addition to the national steadfastness in Lebanon, the Israeli enemy attacked the capital Beirut with a number of air raids. In this regard, the Zionist war jets raided a residential building in Nweiri area, killing seven civilians and injuring 37 of others. The raid led to the complete destruction of the building and much damage in the area. من مكان الغارة في النويري pic.twitter.com/ZuloRl1nSE — قناة المنار (@TVManar1) November 26, 2024 Another Israeli air raid targeted a residential apartment in Barbour area.

The Israeli air raids also targeted Sultan Ibrahim area in Beirut in addition to numerous residential buildings in Beirut's Dahiyeh. The Zionist insanity was also reflected in targeting a house in Qobayat, Akkar. Sidon and Tyre received their portions from the Israeli grudge with air raid which also targeted towns in South Lebanon, including Khiam on the borders. The Israeli enemy also massacred civilians in Baalbek and launched air raids on Hermel and Shmistar.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2278663	2024-11-26T10:10:11-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-01132160017326445867.jpg

The suffering of Palestinians has been further compounded by the severe cold and heavy rainfall in the Gaza Strip. Seawater has swept through the tents of the displaced people set up on the shore of Mawasi Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip, while rainwater has flooded the tents in various northern, central, and southern areas. The Danish Refugee Council has warned that the remnants of Israeli munitions, both exploded and unexploded, pose a long-term threat to Gaza residents, who are at risk of injury and death as they search for basic necessities among the rubble. The report states that only 19 percent of victims of these explosive weapons receive first aid, and children are particularly vulnerable to mistaking them for toys or junk. في يومها الـ 417.. أبرز تطورات الإبادة الجماعية الإسرائيلية في غزة اقرأ المزيد عبر المركز الفلسطيني للإعلام: — المركز الفلسطيني للإعلام (@PalinfoAr) November 26, 2024 With American support, Israel has been waging a war on Gaza since October 7, 2023, leaving about 149,000 Palestinian martyrs and wounded, most of them children and women, and more than 10,000 missing, amid massive destruction and famine that killed dozens of children and the elderly, in one of the worst humanitarian disasters in the world.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2278267	2024-11-26T03:30:55-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-05594880017260474442.jpg

Hezbollah Deals Heavy Blows to Israeli Forces, Crushes Incursion ...	Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance showcased its unwavering resolve to defend its people and land against the Israeli enemy's relentless aggression, executing 51 operations on Sunday—the highest in a single day since the aggression on Lebanon began. These strikes targeted key Israeli positions, from the southern borders to deep within occupied territories, halting attempted advances into border villages and thwarting any significant incursion. Among the highlights was a devastating blow in Al-Bayada, where eight Merkava tanks were destroyed within 48 hours; their burned remains a testament to the resistance's strength and precision. Hezbollah's military media released a series of statements detailing the attacks and their outcomes: The initial statement indicated that at 8:45 AM on Monday, November 25, 2024, Islamic Resistance fighters targeted the Shraga base (the administrative headquarters of the Golani Brigade command) north of the occupied city of Acre with a barrage of rockets.

Imam Khamenei Calls for Netanyahu’s Execution	Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, the leader of Iran's Islamic Revolution, has demanded that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be sentenced to death, dismissing the International Criminal Court's (ICC) recently issued arrest warrant as an inadequate response to Netanyahu's war crimes in Gaza and Lebanon. Ayatollah Khamenei Urges Capital Punishment for Netanyahu pic.twitter.com/fWnXiKV3DC — Tasnim News Agency (@Tasnimnews_EN) November 25, 2024 'The (ICC) arrest warrant is not enough, Netanyahu's death sentence must be ordered,' Imam Khamenei said during a meeting with members of the Iranian Basij volunteer force on Monday, as part of Basij Week celebrations. The ICC has issued arrest warrants against Netanyahu and his former defense minister Yoav Gallant for their roles in the ongoing genocide in Gaza and atrocities committed in Lebanon. The warrants mean the two Israeli leaders risk arrest if they travel to any of the 124 countries that have signed the Rome Statute establishing the ICC. Condemning Israel's aggression in Gaza and Lebanon, Imam Khamenei dismissed the bombing of civilian homes as a crime rather than a victory. The Leader asserted that ‘Israel’ has failed to win its wars in these regions and will never succeed. The Leader noted that Imam Khomeini, founder of the Islamic Revolution, created Basij volunteer force as a 'bulwark' against threats. Basiji is not intimidated by the US and Israeli propaganda, he asserted, adding that some of the prominent Iranian scientists, who were assassinated by the enemy, were members of the volunteer force. Imam Khamenei further said that Basij will definitely destroy the Zionist regime. Basij, he emphasized, should strengthen, expand and maintain preparedness. The leader said the United States' ideal for the region is either submission or chaos, urging the force to counter US duality of dictator ship and anarchy. Additionally in his remarks, the Leader praised Basij’s successes in foiling enemies’ plots against the Islamic Revolution. Imam Khamenei touched on a deal around 15 years ago, when the US 'vowed' to deliver uranium with 20 percent purity to Iran to be used for radio pharmaceuticals in return for taking all of the country's 3.5 percent uranium. 'The Americans were cheating, we realized that they were cheating. It (the deal) was stopped,' the Leader said.'Those who disrupted the US's evil conspiracy in the case of 20 percent enriched uranium, which was needed by the country, were Basij members.' 'At the same time, Iran’s Basiji professors managed to produce the 20 percent enriched uranium inside the country. Americans could not believe this would happen,' the Leader added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2277596	2024-11-25T04:05:35-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-08656070017325363297.jpg
Iraqi Resistance Strikes Back at Israeli Targets in Occupied Terr...	The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an alliance of anti-terror fighters, has conducted two consecutive attacks on Israeli sites within the occupied territories. In a statement, the resistance group said it launched a drone strike on a 'vital target' in southern occupied areas on Sunday. Later that same day, the group claimed responsibility for another drone attack on a 'military target' in the south. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq said the attacks were carried out 'in support of our people in Palestine and Lebanon' and in response to Israel's massacres against civilians, including women, children and the elderly. The resistance vowed to continue striking Israeli sites at an 'increasing pace', stating the operations were a reaction to Israel's ongoing aggression. Since the start of Israel's aggression on Gaza last October, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has conducted similar attacks against sensitive targets across the occupied territories. This latest barrage comes amid a broader escalation, as Hezbollah in Lebanon has also retaliated against Israeli strikes.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2277541	2024-11-25T02:10:33-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-00502260017314075886.jpg

The Israeli occupation's genocidal campaign in the Gaza Strip has reached a grim milestone, as the Israeli aggression entered its 415th day.

Body of Missing Zionist rabbi Found in UAE	The Israeli enemy entity officially announced today, Sunday, that the body of Rabbi Zvi Kogan, who has been missing since Thursday in the United Arab Emirates, was found. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the entity's Foreign Ministry said in a joint statement, 'The intelligence and security authorities in the UAE have found the body of Zvi Kogan, who has been missing since Thursday.' The statement described Kogan's killing as 'a heinous anti-Semitic terrorist act,' according to its expression, noting that the temporary entity will do its utmost 'until justice is served against the criminals responsible for his killing.' There was no immediate comment from the Emirati authorities on the Israeli announcement of the rabbi's death. It is noteworthy that Zvi Kogan is one of the representatives of the Jewish 'Chabad' movement in the Emirates and holds Moldovan citizenship in addition to Israeli citizenship. According to the Israeli newspaper 'Yedioth Ahronoth', Kogan (28 years old) was officially residing in the Emirates as an assistant to the Chief Rabbi of Abu Dhabi. The Chabad organization, which 'does not believe in the right of the Palestinians to exist,' calls for their expulsion from occupied Palestine, and 'opposes any agreement that would give them part of the land,' at a time when the Palestinians have the right to all of Palestine, not just part of it.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2276683	2024-11-24T02:57:48-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-061088300173244586310.jpg
Jordan Security Forces Kill Man Who Opened Fire Near Israeli Emba...	Tensions escalated near the Israeli embassy in Jordan's capital city of Amman on Sunday, as a gunman opened fire on security personnel, leading to a deadly confrontation. According to the Jordanian Public Security, the incident occurred in the Rabieh area of Amman. The gunman reportedly opened fire on a police patrol, prompting a security team to respond. In the ensuing clash, the shooter was pursued and surrounded, at which point he opened fire on the security forces. Authorities say the security team then 'applied the rules of engagement,' resulting in the gunman's death. The attack left 3 police officers injured. Jordanian officials have not released the identity of the shooter or provided details on a possible motive. Earlier reports from Israeli media had indicated a security incident near the Israeli embassy in Amman, with the gunman firing towards the embassy premises for several minutes. A heavy security presence was deployed to the area around the embassy following the sound of gunfire.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2276540	2024-11-24T01:16:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-00931000017324397837.jpg
Hamas Announces Death of Female Captive in Israeli Bombardment of...	Military spokesperson for Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas Resistance Movement, announced the death of one more captive in the Zionist aggression of the various zones of Gaza. After re-establishing contact with fighters assigned to protect Israeli enemy captives, it was revealed that one of the enemy’s female captives was killed in an area under heavy Israeli aggression in the northern Gaza Strip, Abu Ubaida said. Meanwhile, another female captive remains in grave danger, he added. Abu Ubaida affirmed that the war criminal Netanyahu, his government, and the leaders of his army bear full responsibility for the lives of their captives, as they persist in causing their suffering and deaths. The enemy must prepare to deal with the issue of the disappearance of the bodies of their fallen soldiers due to widespread destruction and the martyrdom of some of the captors, Abu Ubaida warned. Al-Qassam Brigades posted a photo which shows body of the dead captive with a caption that reads, 'A new victim of Netanyahu and Halevi.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2276287	2024-11-23T13:54:55-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/11/manar-095946600169999520110.jpg
Merkava Tanks Couldn’t Reach Quarter of Distance Crossed in 2006:...	TV channels, newspapers, politicians, journalists, analysts, and social media accounts are all involved in providing an instant media coverage for the ongoing military confrontation between Hezbollah and the Israeli occupation army in accordance with the adopted values, principles and political affiliations. The military confrontation with the Zionist enemy is accompanied by a hostile propaganda aimed supporting the goals of Israeli war on Lebanon. What must be completely condemned is the distortion of reality in an attempt to prove an untrue idea or figure. It is totally immoral, for example, to claim that the enemy controlled a certain town while the clashes are still ongoing in its vicinity. Since the beginning of the Israeli ground invasion of South Lebanon, the hostile media tried its best to magnify the Israeli aggression 'achievements' and trivialize the Resistance feats. A very sharp and clear example, in this regard, can be the promotion of the idea that the Israeli ground progress is much faster than that which was in 2006 in order to solidify the claim that Hezbollah in 2024 is weaker than it was in 2006. A factual comparison between the Zionist ground invasion in 2024 and that in 2006 shows that - the Israeli Merkava tanks reached in 30 days Ghandouriyeh (landing) and Wadi Al Houjeir Reserve, which lie around 10 kilometers away from the Lebanese Palestinian borders in 2006. - the Israeli Merkava tanks failed in around 55 days to cross Deir Mimas which lies around one kilometer away from the Lebanese Palestinian borders in 2024. A map shows the difference between the ground invasion in 2024 and that in 2006 Another clear example can be that, in 2006, the Merkava tanks reached Al-Bayada and even the outskirts of Al-Mansouri in Tyre district. Whereas, in 2024, the enemy vehicles reached only the outskirts of Shamaa and Al-Bayada. These are mere instances to say that the Islamic Resistance fighters are bravely fighting to defend the South Lebanon town, including Khiam and Bint Jbeil, and that the pace of the Israeli ground advance is not at all faster than that in 2006, yet even much slower. Thus, those who are promoting the Israeli ground advance must hold on and wait for the consequences of the battle which will gradually appear.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2276089	2024-11-23T10:59:13-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-02851670017323882094.png
Hezbollah Fighters Frustrate Israeli Advance Schemes in South Leb...	The Islamic Resistance fighters continued on Saturday, November 23, 2024, confronting the barbaric Israeli war on Lebanon, showing unprecedented bravery in the ground fight against the enemy troops attempting to control towns in the South. More than 51 Merkava tanks have been destroyed by Hezbollah fighters who audaciously repelled the Zionist ground advance into the towns of Khiam, Deir Mimas and Al-Bayada. It is worth noting that the Israeli ground invasion of South Lebanon has taken the form of incursion lines which do not grant the enemy forces the capability of controlling any of the villages in South Lebanon.

No Hezbollah Figure Targeted in Beirut Strike: Lawmaker	Member of Hezbollah’s Loyalty to Resistance bloc MP Amin Sherri firmly denied on Saturday that the Israeli strike on Beirut’s Al-Basta targeted a Hezbollah figure, noting that the brutal attack which killed or injured dozens in the Lebanese capital is only aimed at terrifying the Lebanese citizens. As he visited the scene of the Israeli strike, MP Sherri said: 'This is the eighth attack on Beirut (since the start of the war on September 23). No military target was hit in all of these attacks.' 'Neither a military figure nor an individual who is affiliated with any political party was targeted in any of the two destroyed buildings,' the lawmaker affirmed. ⚡Lebanese MP Amin Sherri from Basta: There is no Hezbollah figure in the targeted building #Iraq #Syria #Hezbollah #Beirut #Lebanon #Israel #TelAviv #Gaza #Yemen #Iran #Tehran #IRGC pic.twitter.com/B1jLCfOdhe — War Analysis (@iiamguri9) November 23, 2024 He saluted the people who have been displaced from the unsafe regions across Lebanon to the capital Beirut. 'These attacks will never break the will of our people,' MP Sherri stressed. He noted, meanwhile, that the real confrontation is in south Lebanon, with the resistance fighters, rather than the systematic killings of civilians. Massive Israeli strike that employed bunker busting bombs on Beirut's Al-Basta area killed or injured dozens of people at dawn on Saturday.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2275913	2024-11-23T06:23:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-07648920017323717154.png
Iran to Launch New Advanced Centrifuges: AEOI	Spokesman of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) Behrouz Kamalvandi said that the organization plans to activate a series of new and advanced centrifuges in response to the IAEA politically-motivated resolution. The International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors on Thursday voted 19 to 3, with 12 abstentions, for the resolution, brought by the UK, France, and Germany (E3), that accused the Islamic Republic of poor cooperation with the agency. Speaking in a televised interview on Friday, Kamalvandi said that after the resolution was issued, the AEOI immediately started its remedial measures. 'We will significantly increase the enrichment capacity with different kinds of advanced machines,' he said, naming the increase in the speed of industrial research and development as another measure that would be taken by Iran in response to the resolution. He further stressed that after the resolution was issued, the President and the AEOI chief issued the necessary orders, and the process started that night. 'Soon, the IAEA will surely provide its reports and it will be clear that what they did led to the increase of Iran's nuclear industry capacity in various fields,' he added. The AEOI official said that the IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi was informed during his visit to Iran that Tehran is seeking interaction but if the IAEA wants to adopt other methods, the Islamic Republic is also ready to act accordingly. Iran has announced it has launched new advanced centrifuges after the E3-US drafted resolution was passed at the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors (IAEA BoG) on Thursday night. In a joint statement, the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) and the Iranian Foreign Ministry condemned the passing of the resolution as a politically motivated, unrealistic, and counterproductive move.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2275869	2024-11-23T05:32:06-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/04/manar-04755240016178797859.jpg

Putin Says Oreshnik Missile System Cutting-edge Innovation by Rus...	Russia’s Oreshnik hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile system is not an upgraded version of previous versions dating back from the Soviet times, and it is in the line of the latest and modern developments, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday. 'The Oreshnik system has nothing to do with the modernization of the old Soviet systems,' Putin said. 'It is obvious that we were all raised watching various systems of the Soviet Union operating, we were all brought up on what was done by previous generations, and to a certain extent we used their results,' Putin said. 'However, this system is indeed the prime result of your work, the work that was done in Russian times, under the conditions of the new Russia, it was waged on the basis of modern, latest developments,' Putin said addressing the meeting with the Defense Ministry executive board, representatives of the military-industrial complex and missile weapon designers. The Russian Defense Ministry announced earlier in the day that the country’s latest Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile hit all the targets at a major Ukrainian military-industrial enterprise in Dnepr (Dnepropetrovsk) with its MIRVed warheads. 'On November 21, 2024, in response to the use of American-and British-made long-range missiles against facilities on Russian territory, the Armed Forces delivered a combined strike on one of the Ukrainian military-industrial sites in Dnepropetrovsk. For the first time, the Oreshnik hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile with a non-nuclear payload was employed in combat conditions in the strike. The goal of the strike was achieved. All the warheads hit the facility,' the ministry said in a statement. On November 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree approving the Foundations of State Policy in the Field of Nuclear Deterrence, the country’s updated nuclear doctrine. The fundamental principle of the doctrine is that the use of nuclear weapons is a measure of last resort to protect the country’s sovereignty. The emergence of new military threats and risks prompted Russia to clarify the conditions for the use of nuclear weapons. In particular, the amended doctrine expands the range of countries and military alliances subject to nuclear deterrence, as well as the list of military threats that such deterrence is designed to counter. In addition, the document states that Russia will now view any attack by a non-nuclear country supported by a nuclear power as a joint attack. Moscow also reserves the right to consider a nuclear response to a conventional weapons attack threatening its sovereignty, a large-scale launch of enemy aircraft, missiles, and drones targeting Russian territory, their crossing of the Russian border, and an attack on its ally Belarus.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2275176	2024-11-22T11:52:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-09745410017323051094.jpg

Iran Hails ICC Warrant for Netanyahu as ‘Political Death’ of ‘Isr...	The Commander of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps, General Hossein Salami, has welcomed the International Criminal Court's (ICC) arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Security Minister Yoav Gallant, describing the move as marking the 'end and political death' of 'Israel.' Salami declared in a speech aired on Iranian state television that the ICC's decision signifies 'the end and political death of the Zionist regime, a regime that today lives in absolute political isolation in the world, and its officials can no longer travel to other countries.' IRGC chief urges Muslim countries to cut aid routes to Israel — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) November 22, 2024 The Iranian commander characterized the warrants as a 'great victory for the Palestinian and Lebanese resistance movements' and a pivotal step in holding the Israeli occupation accountable for its actions, particularly the ongoing genocide in Gaza. In contrast, Netanyahu and his allies have dismissed the ICC's move as politically motivated and antisemitic, with the Israeli president accusing the court of undermining justice and siding with 'terrorism and evil.' The United States, Israel's closest ally, has also criticized the ICC's decision. The warrants, which theoretically restrict Netanyahu's international travel, come as the death toll from the Israeli war against Gaza surpasses 44,000 martyrs over 412 days.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2274923	2024-11-22T06:37:50-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/12/manar-067219500170375961910.jpg
Iran Activates Advanced Centrifuges in Retaliation of IAEA Resolu...	Iran has denounced a United Nations nuclear watchdog resolution as 'unjustifiable' and initiated the operation of advanced centrifuges in reciprocal response. Iran's Foreign Ministry and the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) issued a joint statement early Friday, announcing the activation of 'a substantial number of advanced centrifuges of various models.' The statement emphasized that the move is a defensive measure to protect Iran's national interests and address its increasing need for a civilian nuclear program, in line with its obligations under the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement. 📌 Joint Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Regarding the Unjust Resolution Adopted by the IAEA Board of Governors on Iran’s Peaceful Nuclear Program In the final hours of the #IAEA Board of Governors meeting on 21 Nov 2024, a… pic.twitter.com/XjM5Up5eLs — Foreign Ministry, Islamic Republic of Iran 🇮🇷 (@IRIMFA_EN) November 22, 2024 The action follows a resolution passed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors, which accused Tehran of inadequate cooperation and called for a 'comprehensive' report on its nuclear activities by spring 2025. The resolution passed with 19 votes in favor, three against, and 12 abstentions. IAEA Director General @rafaelmgrossi briefed the Board of Governors on his high-level meetings in Tehran last week, describing his discussions with the new government as constructive. Nevertheless, he pointed out, there were ongoing concerns. Read more: pic.twitter.com/Jt4uIzucsJ — IAEA - International Atomic Energy Agency ⚛️ (@iaeaorg) November 22, 2024 Iran described the resolution as a 'non-consensus' measure driven by the 'pressure and insistence' of the US, UK, France and Germany, despite lacking support from nearly half of the 35-member Board of Governors. 'The actions of the three European nations and the United States—countries with a documented history of reneging on their commitments, including under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and resorting to unlawful sanctions and pressures against the Iranian nation—are both confrontational and unjustifiable,' the statement read. It criticized the resolution as 'politically motivated' and warned it undermines the constructive atmosphere fostered during IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi's recent visit to Tehran. 'This politicized and destructive measure undermines the positive momentum achieved between Iran and the Agency and blatantly contradicts the professed commitment of the three European nations and the United States to preserving the integrity and impartiality of the IAEA. It lays bare their use of the nuclear issue as a pretext to advance illegitimate objectives,' the statement added. Despite its condemnation of the resolution, Iran reaffirmed its commitment to cooperating with the IAEA within the framework of the Safeguards Agreement. 'The principled policy of the I.R. of Iran has consistently been to engage constructively with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) within the framework of rights and obligations enshrined in the Treaty on the NPT and the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement,' it said. Iran signed the JCPOA in 2015, proving the peaceful intent of its nuclear program to six world powers. However, the deal has been in jeopardy since the United States unilaterally withdrew in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. In response to unmet commitments by other signatories, Iran began rolling back its JCPOA obligations in 2019.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2274835	2024-11-22T05:50:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/06/manar-02354790016244400227.jpg

In the Shuja'iyya neighborhood of Gaza City, an airstrike on the home of the Abu Asr family claimed 8 lives, while 5 Palestinians were killed in a bombing of a house north of the Nuseirat refugee camp in the central region. Two more Palestinians were martyred in a strike that hit a house west of Deir al-Balah city.

Meanwhile, the northern Gaza Strip continues to bear the brunt of the ongoing offensive, as the Israeli occupation forces have intensified their bombardment of the Jabalia refugee camp. Residential buildings in the area have been systematically destroyed, in what appears to be a deliberate attempt to displace the local population. Last night, Israeli occupation warplanes targeted and bombed an inhabited residential block in the vicinity of Kamal Adwan hospital, massacring at least 66 civilians and injuring over 100. pic.twitter.com/zoUqz1z6zn — PALESTINE ONLINE 🇵🇸 (@OnlinePalEng) November 21, 2024 On October 5, the occupation army invaded the northern Gaza governorate under the pretext of preventing the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) from regaining its strength in the area, committing the most heinous atrocities against the people of the north in a clear attempt to displace them in implementation of the so-called 'generals’ plan.' The Palestinians confirm that the enemy wants to occupy the northern Gaza Strip and turn it into a buffer zone after displacing its residents under the pressure of continuous bloody bombing and a tight siege that prevents the entry of food, water and medicine.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2274626	2024-11-22T04:18:17-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-09688970017322778755.jpg
‘Israel’ Greenlights Settler Attacks, Announces End of Administra...	New Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced an end to administrative detention orders for Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank settlers, in a new measure that is seen a practice of apartheid against Palestinian people, and a green light for Zionist settlers to attack the native people of Palestine. While the practice is primarily deployed against Palestinian people in Israeli jails, it is also used against some Israelis, described as 'extremist Jewish'. It sees individuals held without charge for up to six months at a time. The detentions can be renewed indefinitely while allowing military prosecutors to keep suspects from being able to see the evidence against them. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem on November 10, 2024. In a statement, Katz claimed that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are subject to so-called 'serious Palestinian terror threats and unjustified international sanctions are taken against the settlers.' 'It is not appropriate for the State of Israel to take such a severe measure against the people of the settlements,' the Israeli DM added. Katz met with Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar this week and told him that he had decided 'to stop the use of administrative detention orders against Jewish settlers in Judea and Samaria, and asked him to put alternative tools in place,' his office said, referring to the Hebrew name of the West Bank. The measure could be seen as a new Israeli attempt to permit settler violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, which spiked since October 2023. Israeli occupation authorities rarely arrest Jewish perpetrators in such attacks. Rights groups lament that convictions are even more unusual and that the vast majority of charges in these types of attacks are dropped.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2274494	2024-11-22T03:08:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-01632750017322734949.jpg

Israeli warplanes launched a series of airstrikes on the Southern Suburb of Beirut on Friday, reducing several residential buildings to rubble. The brutal attacks appear to be part of Israel's retaliatory actions against areas inhabited by the Resistance's popular support base, following recent battlefield setbacks. the Israeli warplanes targeted the neighborhoods of Haret Hreik, al-Hadath, and al-Kafaat. The Israeli occupation military had issued three separate warnings, announcing plans to strike three residential buildings in the targeted areas. However, the number of strikes launched during each round of raids has consistently exceeded the number of individual warnings issued, and dozens of buildings have been struck with no prior notice. بالفيديو | لحظة تدمير الطيران الاسرائيلي مبنى في #الضاحية_الجنوبية لبيروت pic.twitter.com/efo5sxwGLM — قناة المنار (@TVManar1) November 21, 2024 Despite Israel's claims that the strikes target buildings affiliated with the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon, emerging footage and eyewitness statements continue to prove otherwise, revealing the indiscriminate nature of the attacks and the significant destruction caused. The ongoing Israeli aggression across Lebanon has resulted in the martyrdom of at least 3,583 people and the wounding of 15,244 since October 2023. On Thursday alone, the Lebanese Health Ministry reported 25 martyrs and 121 injuries, with the toll particularly high in the Baalbek-Hermel Governorate, where six members of the same family were killed in the town of Maqneh and at least 11 were martyred in Nabha. The relentless Israeli airstrikes have continued to target several towns in the Bekaa Valley, with the total number of raids reaching 1,182 and resulting in 839 martyrs and 1,399 wounded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2274373	2024-11-22T00:56:07-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-04603610017322657605.jpg

ICC Issues Arrest Warrants for Israel’s Netanyahu, Gallant over W...	The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense chief for committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. In their decision, the ICC judges said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant were criminally responsible for acts including murder, persecution and starvation as a weapon of war as part of a 'widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza'. The decision was met with outrage in 'Israel', which called it shameful and absurd. Hamas welcomed the warrants, and a senior official told Reuters it was a first step towards justice. 'Israel' has rejected the jurisdiction of the Hague-based court and denied war crimes in Gaza. The United States, Israel's main supporter, is also not a member of the ICC. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan had announced on May 20 that he was seeking arrest warrants for crimes connected to the Israeli military response in Gaza. Israeli leaders have dismissed allegations that they committed war crimes. The court does not have its own police force to carry out arrests and relies on its 124 member states for that. Whether they are arrested or not depends on the member states. They have an obligation to do so but the court has only limited diplomatic means to force them if they do not want to. REACTIONS Netanyahu's office said the ICC decision was 'anti-semitic' and he will 'not yield to pressure, will not be deterred' until Israel's war objectives are met. The ICC has 'lost all legitimacy' after issuing the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said. 'A dark moment for the International Criminal Court,' Saar said on X, adding that it had issued 'absurd orders without authority'. There was no immediate comment from Gallant. The White House said Washington 'fundamentally rejects' the ICC decision, adding that they are 'deeply concerned by the Prosecutor’s rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision'. 'The United States has been clear that the ICC does not have jurisdiction over this matter,' a National Security Council spokesperson said. In a statement, Hamas welcomed the warrants against Gallant and Netanyahu and urged the court to expand accountability to all Israeli leaders. Senior Hamas official Basem Naim told Reuters the warrants against the Israelis were an important step towards bringing justice for the victims. 'But it remains a limited and spiritual step if it was not backed practically by all countries to get this decision implemented in compliance with law and justice,' he said. The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the decision was not a political one but made by a court and thus should be respected and implemented. 'The tragedy in Gaza has to stop,' Borrell said. Jordan's foreign minister Ayman Safadi also said the ICC's decision must be implemented, adding that the Palestinians deserved justice after what he termed Israel's 'war crimes' in Gaza. The Netherlands' foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp said his country was prepared to act upon the warrants, Dutch news agency ANP reported. In the United States, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, said: 'The Court is a dangerous joke. It is now time for the U.S. Senate to act and sanction this irresponsible body.' Israel's 13-month campaign in Gaza has killed about 44,000 Palestinians and displaced nearly all the enclave's population while creating a humanitarian crisis, Gaza officials say.

Hezbollah’s Epic Fight in Khiam Obliges Israeli Forces to Withdra...	The most eloquent description of the Islamic Resistance fight in the South Lebanon town of Khiam was posted by Al-Manar correspondent Ali Shoeib who said that usually the invading force leave an exit corridor for the defenders to depart the attacked area, but that Hezbollah fighters left the exit corridor to escape from Khiam. According to media reports, the Israeli occupation forces withdrew from Khiam due to the strikes of Hezbollah fighters. This epic fight performed by Hezbollah fighters has so far frustrated the Israeli invasion schemes which seem to be limitless amid the enemy's desperate attempts to occupy and control swathes of territories in South Lebanon. The enemy troops managed merely to advance through incursion lines away from the resistance fire into Shamaa without controlling neither the targeted village nor the towns behind it on the borders with occupied Palestine. In this regard, Hezbollah Operation Room issued a statement regarding the clash with an 'Israeli' force in the town of Tayr Harfa (supposed to be controlled by IOF)and the destruction of an armored vehicle. The Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance reports the following: - Islamic Resistance fighters observed an infiltration by an 'Israeli' army unit into a house on the western side of Tayr Harfa. - Our fighters opened fire on the house where the unit was stationed, using medium-range machine guns, followed by direct targeting of the house. This resulted in the partial destruction of the house on the unit inside. - An 'Israeli' force supported by an armored vehicle attempted to advance to evacuate the casualties from the site. - The armored vehicle was targeted with direct fire, leading to its destruction. Our fighters then combed the targeted area using machine guns. (Statement No. 17, issued at 7:29 pm yesterday). - Hours after the incident, the 'Israeli' army acknowledged of four soldiers being killed with injuries to several others. Meanwhile, 'Israeli' media reported the death of six soldiers in the ambush. - Among the casualties were an officer and a soldier from the 13th Battalion (Golani), a soldier from the 'Maglan' Unit, and an archaeologist accompanying the force under the supervision of the brigade commander to 'study the area,' as stated by the 'Israeli' army.

US Veto of UN Gaza Resolution ‘License’ for More Israeli Atrociti...	The United States' veto of a United Nations resolution calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip serves as a 'license' for the Israeli regime to continue its 'bloody wars' in the region, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said on Thursday. In a scathing rebuke, Baghaei condemned the 'disgraceful' US move, which blocked the draft resolution that had secured 14 votes in favor at the 15-member UN Security Council. He said the veto 'not only marks another failure of [the] UNSC to uphold its Charter-based mandate but also serves as a U.S.-granted license for the occupying regime to continue its carnage in Gaza and Lebanon with impunity.'

‘Israel’ Lies: Archeologist Killed in South Lebanon Wasn’t 'Civil...	Israeli archeologist was killed along with an Israeli soldier in south Lebanon on Wednesday, as the family of the researcher disputed the occupation military’s count that he was a civilian. Ze'ev (Jabo) Hanoch Erlich, 71, was killed along with a soldier of Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion, with an officer and another soldier being injured in south Lebanon’s western sector. Israeli media cited an initial investigation into the incident found that a force led by Golani Brigade Chief of Staff Brig. Gen. Yoav Yarom entered the area where the brigade was operating. Israeli soldier was killed along with researcher Ze'ev (Jabo) Hanoch Erlich in south Lebanon (Wednesday, November 20, 2024). The force reached an ancient fort considered an archaeological site, the probe found, adding that two Hezbollah fighters who were hiding at the scene opened fire at the force, killing Erlich. Yarom was wounded, while another soldier was seriously injured in the confrontation. The head of the IDF Personnel Directorate decided to recognize Erlich as an IDF casualty. The occupation army said the incident was 'severe' and will be investigated, claiming that Erlich entered the battlefield as a 'civilian' was not authorized as needed by the commanders of the division and command, but was allowed by Yarom. However, the researcher’s brother, Yigal Amitai disputed the occupation military’s claim. 'Contrary to the IDF spokesperson’s claims, we clarify that Jabo was enlisted and treated in the field as a soldier,' Amitai told Ynet. 'He was fully recognized as a soldier, entering Lebanon with the IDF’s approval and accompaniment, albeit for archaeological research, as he always did in Judea and Samaria,' Amitai said referring to the Hebrew name of the occupied West Bank. He said he last spoke with Erlich on Wednesday morning before his entry into Lebanon. 'At 11 a.m., he told me, ‘We’re going into Lebanon,’' Amitai added, accusing the Israeli army spokesperson of 'shielding senior officers while shifting blame onto mid-level ranks'. The Israeli occupation army also announced the death of an Israeli soldier, of the Maglan commando unit, and the injury of another, in an alleged building collapse in another incident in south Lebanon, raising the toll of Wednesday battles in south Lebanon to 3 Israelis killed and 3 wounded.

Sheikh Qassem: Beirut versus Central Tel Aviv	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem stressed on Wednesday that the Resistance will certainly emerge victorious from the ongoing battle when it prevents the Zionist enemy from achieving its goals. In a televised speech, Sheikh Qassem hailed the soul of the martyred leader Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, underlining his pivotal role in presiding over Hezbollah Executive Council concerned with the educations, social, economic and medical files. Sheikh Qassem added that the Israeli enemy launched an aggression on the Lebanese capital, Beirut, assassinating the icon of the jihadi and resistance media and Head of Hezbollah Media Relations Department, Martyr Hajj Mohammad Afif. Regarding the aggression on Beirut, Sheikh Qassem maintained that Israeli enemy should understand that Central Tel Aviv will pay the price for any aggression on Beirut. 'We may never abandon Beirut under strikes.' Do not falter in pursuit of the enemy—if you are suffering, they too are suffering. But you can hope to receive from Allah what they can never hope for. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.

Sheikh Qassem asserted that Hezbollah will continue the battle regardless of the costs which will rise with respect to the enemy as well 'When we prevent the enemy from reaching its goals, we emerge from the battle victorious/' Regarding the Lebanese politics, Hezbollah Secretary General stressed Hezbollah would contribute to the presidential elections and the public life in the framework of Taif Accord. Hezbollah will present in the resistance field and politics simultaneously in order to protect and build up the nation, Sheikh Qassem emphasized.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2272921	2024-11-20T07:58:06-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-099385300173211828010.jpg

Hezbollah Ops Room Illustrates Failure of Israeli Ground Invasion...	The Islamic Resistance fighters have continued confronting the Israeli aggression on Lebanon, inflicting heavy losses upon the enemy's soldiers, officers, and equipment along the border area as well as their deployment positions in occupied Palestine, the Islamic Resistance Operations Room introduced its statement summing the latest developments of the battlefield. The statement summarized the most important developments in the main field confrontations between the Islamic Resistance and the Israeli enemy: 1. Haifa Qualitative Operation: - Haifa qualitative missile operation is part of the promise made by the Islamic Resistance Operations Room to intensify and escalate the 'Khaibar' series of special operations. It also serves to refute the claims of enemy leaders regarding the destruction of the Resistance's missile force. - Through this operation, the Resistance affirms its ability to target enemy military bases of various types simultaneously and with large salvos of precise missiles, which rained down on the occupied city of Haifa and successfully hit their targets. - The operation achieved its objectives, with Resistance missiles striking the five announced military bases, forcing over 300,000 settlers into shelters. - Settlers are paying the price for the 'Israeli' enemy army’s strategy of placing military bases within settlements and occupied cities, near commercial and economic interests. - The Resistance has prepared itself to ensure its readiness and capability to conduct such operations in Haifa and beyond [beyond] Haifa, over a time frame that the enemy does not anticipate. 2. The Enemy's Declaration of the Second Phase of the Ground Operation in Southern Lebanon: - Following a 40% retreat in the 'Israeli' enemy army’s air and ground operations in the border area, due to its inability to establish control within Lebanese territory, the enemy rushed to announce the second phase of its ground operation in southern Lebanon. - The Islamic Resistance Operations Room confirms that the concentrated and strategic defensive operations it carried out during the 'first phase' of the enemy's ground operations forced its forces to retreat beyond the border in some areas and denied them the ability to stabilize in most of the border towns. - The 'Israeli' enemy's air force continues to attack border villages —which it claims to control—with dozens of airstrikes by warplanes and drones daily, regardless of the artillery shelling and sweeping with machine guns from border positions targeting many of these villages. These assaults confirm the enemy's failure to establish control within Lebanese territory. The recent attempts to advance toward areas south of Al-Khiam—where they previously attempted to enter but were forced to withdraw under the blows of the fighters—further demonstrate the failure of the first phase. - Since the start of the ground operation until the date of this statement, our heroic fighters have carried out over 350 operations against 'Israeli' enemy forces on Lebanese territories, and more than 600 fire operations targeting the zones of responsibility of 'Israeli' military divisions on occupied Palestinian territories, causing significant losses to the enemy army. - To the officers and soldiers of the 'Israeli' enemy army, we affirm that what happened to Battalion 51 of the Golani Brigade at the outskirts of the Ainata – Maroun Al-Ras – Aitaroun triangle is just the beginning, and between us and you there are the days, the nights, and the battlefield. As our most sacred martyr [His Eminence Martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah] said: 'You will enter vertically and leave horizontally.' 3. Ground Engagements: - Western Sector: - 'Israeli' enemy forces advanced toward the town of Shamaa in the western sector in an attempt to seize control and pressure the second-line towns of the front, aiming to reduce the Resistance’s missile strikes on the city of Nahariya and the Haifa area in occupied Palestine. - Enemy forces infiltrated from Al-Labbuneh forests, passing through the forests of Alma Al-Shaab and Tayr Harfa, heading toward Shamaa. - The advancing forces fell into a series of ambushes prepared by our fighters on the outskirts of the town and within it. - As a crew, including an armored company, attempted to advance toward the vicinity of the town’s mosque and municipal building (east of the UNIFIL site), our fighters targeted them with guided missiles, destroying two Merkava tanks and a bulldozer accompanying the force. Additionally, a guided missile targeted an infantry force near the shrine of Prophet Shamoun Al-Safa in the town center, resulting in several casualties. - Close-range clashes occurred between our fighters and enemy forces around the shrine, the municipal building, the mosque, and the outskirts of the town. These engagements, which involved machine guns, hand grenades, and rocket-propelled grenades, took place over five times, causing significant casualties among enemy forces. 'Israeli' evacuation units responded by dispatching two helicopters for rescue and evacuation, utilizing flares to identify their location near the town’s school. - On the western outskirts of Al-Jibein, our fighters targeted a Merkava tank with a guided missile, killing and wounding its crew. The area was then shelled with 120mm and 81mm mortar rounds. - The Resistance’s missile units targets enemy soldier positions and military equipment along this axis with dozens of missile salvos and artillery shells. Central Sector: Ainata – Maroun Al-Ras – Aitaroun Triangle: Refuting the 'Israeli' enemy’s narrative regarding the ambush that ensnared its forces at the Ainata – Maroun Al-Ras – Aitaroun triangle, and to document the heroics of our fighters on the battlefronts, the Islamic Resistance Operations Room announces the following: - At dawn on Wednesday, November 13, 2024, our fighters detected a force from Battalion 51 of the Golani Brigade belonging to Division 36 infiltrating from the border area between Aitaroun and Maroun Al-Ras toward the southeastern outskirts of Bint Jbeil aiming to conduct reconnaissance at the Ainata – Maroun Al-Ras – Aitaroun triangle. - Despite intense aerial bombardments by the 'Israeli' air force over the area, the enemy force fell into a well-planned ambush set by a group of Resistance fighters. - The enemy force reached the ambush site at 9:50 am, where a group of our fighters was positioned in a building damaged by the aggression and its surrounding area. - As the 'Israeli' force approached the 'kill zone', our fighters opened fire from all directions using machine guns, forcing the enemy to scatter in the place. - A portion of the hostile force entered a house in the region to protect itself from the fire of our fighters while the rest soldiers deployed around it. - Once the enemy stabilized in the house, and with the call of Labbaik Ya Nasrallah, [We are at your service O Nasrallah] our fighters targeted the house with several RPG rounds designed for personnel and armor, destroying parts of the building and killing those inside. - As the house collapsed, and amidst the panic among the remaining 'Israeli' enemy forces in its vicinity, our fighters opened fire on those who have remained from the force with machine guns. - The clashes continued for over three hours, during which evacuation operations took place under heavy smoke and cover fire. - The 'Israeli' army admitted that an officer and 5 soldiers from Battalion 51 of Golani Brigade were killed in addition to four being wounded. - No ground activity by the Israeli enemy army has been recorded in the area since the incident until this date. - It is worth noting that during July 2006 aggression, a force from Battalion 51 of the Golani Brigade fell into a Resistance ambush on the eastern outskirts of Bint Jbeil which resulted in 8 soldiers being killed and over 25 being wounded, marking it as one of the most significant battles in the Golani Brigade's history and one of the hardest-fought engagements of the 'Second Lebanon War'. Eastern Sector: - The enemy has intensified its aggression on Al-Khiam city and its surroundings over recent days, carrying out over 60 airstrikes and drone attacks, in addition to launching more than 130 artillery shells. This was in preparation for a renewed attempt to advance toward the city after its initial failure over ten days ago due to the severe blows inflicted by the fighters. - Our fighters engaged with the advancing forces as they reached Wata Al-Khiam area south of the city, using machine guns and rocket shells. They also targeted two Merkava tanks with guided missiles, setting them ablaze and killing and wounding those inside. - Following a series of concentrated missile operations and direct clashes with the advancing forces from the eastern and southern directions of Al-Khiam, the enemy, facing heavy losses and under the relentless strikes of the fighters, partially retreated from the positions it had advanced to for the second time. The statement also illustrated the enemy losses in the ongoing ground battle between the Islamic Resistance and the Israeli enemy: Since the 'Israeli' enemy announced the start of the 'second phase' of its ground operation in southern Lebanon on November 12, 2024, the Islamic Resistance fighters have documented the following losses: - Over 18 killed and 32 wounded (some critically) among enemy troops. - Destruction of five Merkava tanks and one military bulldozer. So the cumulative losses of the 'Israeli' enemy from October 1, 2024, to the date of this statement are as follows: - Over 110 killed and more than 1,050 wounded among enemy officers and soldiers. - Destruction of 48 Merkava tanks, 9 military bulldozers, 2 Hummer vehicles, 2 armored vehicles, and 2 troop carriers. - Downing of 6 'Hermes 450' drones, 2 'Hermes 900' drones, and 1 'Quadcopter' glider. It is noteworthy that these figures do not include the enemy's losses at its bases, military sites, barracks, settlements, or occupied cities.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2271678	2024-11-19T11:16:08-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-09014400017320436769.jpg

Yemeni Armed Forces Target New Ship in Red Sea in Support of Resi...	In support for the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and resistance, the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out an operation targeting the ship 'Anadolu S' in the Red Sea with a number of appropriate ballistic and naval missiles. The naval hit was accurate and direct, the Yemeni military spokesman General Yahya Sarea said. The ship was targeted because it did not respond to the warnings of the naval forces and because the company that owns it violated the ban decision of entry to the ports of occupied Palestine, General Sarea added. The Yemeni Armed Forces confirmed the continuation in imposing a naval blockade on the Israeli enemy and targeting all ships linked , heading , or dealing with it as well as their continuation in targeting the Israeli enemy with missiles and drones, and that these operations will not stop until the aggression stops, the siege on the Gaza Strip is lifted, and the aggression on Lebanon stops. بيان القوات المسلحة اليمنية بشأن استهداف سفينة 'Anadolu S' في البحر الأحمر بعدد من الصواريخ الباليستية والبحرية المناسبة، وذلك لعدم استجابتها لتحذيرات القوات البحرية ولانتهاك الشركة المالكة لها قرار حظر الدخول إلى موانئ فلسطين المحتلة. pic.twitter.com/MXbfx1CgMQ — العميد يحيى سريع (@army21ye) November 19, 2024	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2271414	2024-11-19T06:37:44-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2019/09/manar-06187460015686244773.jpg
Gaza genocide continues for the 410th day, Catastrophic Condition...	On the 410th day of the aggression, the Israeli enemy continues its brutal aggression on every part of the Gaza Strip, while sources from inside the Strip reported that the occupation forces have blown up a number of buildings in the Beit Lahia Project area in the north.

The occupation forces also continue for the 28th day to forcibly disrupt the work of civil defense in the areas of the northern Gaza Strip due to the ongoing Israeli targeting and aggression, thus leaving thousands of citizens there without humanitarian and medical care.

Two Palestinians died of their wounds in the bombing of the central and southern Gaza Strip. An infant was also killed as a result of enemy artillery shelling that targeted Palestinian homes north of Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip. According to the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, Hussam Abu Safiya, the healthcare crisis in northern Gaza is rapidly deteriorating. 'Every day that passes since the beginning of the genocide in the northern governorate, the situation is getting worse. The health system is still in a state of disaster, and we are providing services at a minimum level,' he said. Abu Safiya confirmed the dire shortage of medical capabilities in the region, noting that Israel continues to block the arrival of critical medical delegations. 'Cases of malnutrition have begun to arrive at the hospital, most of them children and the elderly due to famine,' he added, warning that 'the risk of death threatens the lives of elderly patients due to the depletion of medicine and the spread of famine in northern Gaza.' The hospital director also reported that 'injured people are losing their lives daily due to the lack of doctors and medicines in the hospital.' This crisis has only worsened with the recent destruction of the only hospital in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, by the enemy. The worsening healthcare situation in Gaza is a direct result of the ongoing Israeli blockade and military attacks, which have crippled the region's medical infrastructure and left its most vulnerable populations without access to life-saving care.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2271337	2024-11-19T05:22:13-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-08604690017306480946.jpg
Lebanon Stands Firm against Israeli Conditions in Under-Fire Ceas...	Lebanon has been firmly standing against the Israeli conditions during talks aimed at reaching a ceasefire. The Israeli enemy has been escalating its attacks in the latest days with at least 3 strikes targeting the capital Beirut on Sunday and Monday, in attacks that described by observers as a direct message of pressure and negotiations that are under fire. The latest strike on Beirut was on Monday evening, when an aerial attack targeted a center for humanitarian aids in a densely populated residential area, killing at least five people, including a mayor and his assistant, and injuring many others. In a new push for a ceasefire between Lebanon and the Zionist entity, US envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut on Tuesday, a day after Lebanon handed its response to the US ceasefire proposal. Hochstein met with Lebanese officials including Speaker Nabih Berri, caretaker PM Najib Mikati and Army Commander Joseph Aoun. US envoy AMos Hochstein and Lebanese Speaker Nabih Berri in Beirut (October 21, 2024). Meanwhile, and despite reports on 'optimism' over reaching a deal, caution still prevails ‘Israel Can’t Be Trusted’ Al-Araby Al-Jadeed newspaper quoted sources close to Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri as saying that the Zionist entity 'cannot be trusted,' and that Beirut is negotiating under fire and constant escalation. 'Although the atmosphere is somewhat positive, it cannot be built upon or taken into account, whether for previous experiences with the enemy on the Lebanese level, the latest of which was the American-French initiative, or the truce path in Gaza,' the sources said. 'The enemy is resorting to escalation, expanding its targets, and attacking civilians and civil defense. On Sunday, it also attacked the Lebanese army in the south, which indicates its criminality, intentions, and attempt to exert pressure with force of fire to impose its conditions,' according to the sources. Conditions As for details of the US ceasefire proposal, Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar reported on Tuesday that the US, Lebanon and the Zionist entity kept the draft proposal confidential. However, leaks revealed that it includes 12 points, and that the points of contention are two: The first is related to the 'principle of self-defense,' which the draft calls for adopting as a right for both parties (Lebanon and the Zionist entity), while the second is related to the membership of the committee overseeing the implementation of the UN Resolution 1701, according to the Lebanese daily. Lebanon believes that the 'right to self-defense' is guaranteed by the international laws and cannot be included in a ceasefire deal, and that Tel Aviv’s insistence on it conceals a desire to obtain so-called 'legitimacy' for any hostile action against Lebanon under the pretext of 'self-defense', Al-Akhbar added, stressing that Beirut categorically rejects such conditions. Regarding the committee overseeing the implementation of 1701, Al-Akhbar reported that Lebanon has reservations about the membership of Britain and Germany and about the working mechanism of this committee. Hezbollah Stance Earlier on Monday, Member of Hezbollah’s Loyalty to Resistance parliamentary bloc, MP Ihab Hamade stressed that the stance on the ceasefire has 3 constants: 'Adherence to Resolution 1701 without any amendment, safeguarding Lebanese sovereignty, and ensuring that the enemy gains nothing politically it couldn’t achieve militarily.' 'We seek a ceasefire and remain open to dialogue, but we are not begging for any agreement; our focus is on the battlefield,' the Lebanese lawmaker added. #Israeli Army Took 7 Days to Reach #Beirut in 1982, Battling #Hezbollah on Border for 40 Days in 2024 #جنوب_لبنان #المقاومة_الاسلامية pic.twitter.com/kC1pDx1Oj5 — ManarWeb (@WebManar) November 9, 2024 In his latest speech, Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem stressed that Speaker Nabih Berri is leading Lebanon’s talks, along with PM Najib Mikati, stressing that Lebanon will never accept any deal that violate its sovereignty.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2271172	2024-11-19T04:35:21-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-02967310017320196763.jpg

Hochstein Arrives in Beirut for Ceasefire Talks	US Presidential Envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut, Lebanon today, landing at Rafic Hariri International Airport around 8:00 am. Hochstein's visit comes amid cautious optimism from Lebanese officials, including Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, about the prospects of reaching an agreement to end the 58-day Israeli aggression on Lebanon. Lebanon delivered a response to a proposed US draft ceasefire agreement to the US embassy in Beirut yesterday. This came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for the 'freedom of action for the Israeli army' and preventing weapons from entering Lebanon from Syria - remarks seen as an attempt to gain political ground he has failed to achieve militarily. The resistance's response to Netanyahu's aggression was swift and painful. Yesterday, the resistance launched heavy missiles that reached the heart of Tel Aviv, directly hitting a building and sparking a fire in the Ramat Gan area, resulting in injuries among Israeli settlers. The Islamic Resistance also announced an air attack using suicide drones on sensitive military targets in Tel Aviv. As Hochstein arrives in Beirut to broker a ceasefire, the resistance has made it clear it will not back down in the face of continued Israeli aggression, raising the stakes in this high-stakes diplomatic dance.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2270831	2024-11-19T01:13:17-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-00451270017320075923.jpg

Hezbollah Fighters Heroically Confront Israeli Forces in South Le...	Hezbollah carried out qualitative strikes on Monday against Israeli occupation forces, strategic sites, and settlements in support of the Palestinian resistance in Gaza and in defense of Lebanese territory and its people. The group's Military Media reported a series of rocket and drone attacks targeting critical locations in the occupied territories and Israeli forces.

Mikati Says Hochstein to Visit Lebanon Soon, Vague Issues to Be A...	Caretaker Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said on Monday that US envoy Amos Hochstein will be visiting Lebanon soon, and that the vague files should be addressed face-to-face. 'Lebanon’s response to the US paper was positive, but some points require discussion,' Mikati said in an interview with Al-Araby TV. 'We hope to reach a ceasefire in Lebanon in the nearest time,' he said. 'The key matter for us in the US ceasefire proposal is the implementation of Resolution 1701. Lebanon is committed to its implementation, and our goal is its implementation in south of Litani,' he stressed, emphasizing the necessity of restoring stability and ending the bloodshed and destruction in south Lebanon. 'Speaker Nabih Berri is leading the negotiations with the US mediator, and I am in constant touch with him, and I haven’t heard about any condition relevant to Israel’s operational freedom in Lebanon,' he went on saying. 'What matters to me is to reinforce the presence of the (Lebanese) army in south Lebanon,' he stated, adding that there should only be the so-called 'legitimate' weapons. Mikati also stressed that 'the Israeli enemy must draw back from any move it has taken inside the Lebanese territory.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2270237	2024-11-18T04:38:20-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-07260790017286522724.jpg
Israeli Security Chiefs Urge Netanyahu to Soften Stance on Captiv...	Families of Israeli captives held in Gaza protested on Monday calling on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach a deal to free the hostages. The protest was a day after a select group of Israeli ministers and top security brass reportedly planned to tell an emergency meeting on efforts to free the Israeli captives that agreeing to an end to the war with Hamas was the only way to reach a deal. Dozens of family members of Israeli captives and their supporters demonstrated outside Netanyahu’s residence in occupied Al-Quds (Jerusalem), calling on him to reach a deal to free the captives held by Hamas in Gaza. They warned that a deal is even more urgent with winter approaching. Families of Israeli captives rally outside PM Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in occupied Al-Quds on Monday 'The hostages won’t survive the freezing cold in the tunnels of Gaza,' the organizers said in a statement, according to The Times of Israel. 'While Netanyahu and his team are busy trying to skew public opinion, 101 hostages are dying in impossible conditions.' The protest on Monday was preceded by another rally, also outside Netanyahu’s residence, to call on the Israeli premier to release the captives and end the war in Gaza. Protesters rally outside Netanyahu’s residence in Al-Quds, demanding reaching a deal (Sunday, November 17, 2024). On Sunday evening, Netanyahu hosted an emergency meeting with some ministers and top security chiefs at the Kirya Defense Ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv. The head of the Shin Bet security agency, Ronen Bar, Israeli Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, Mossad Director David Barnea, and the Israeli military’s hostage point man Maj. Gen. (res.) Nitzan Alon were set to tell ministers that Hamas is still demanding an end to the war and the military’s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, even after troops killed the Palestinian resistance group’s leader Yahya Sinwar last month, unnamed sources told multiple Hebrew media outlets. The security chiefs planned on emphasizing that agreeing to such demands would be the only way to reach a deal, the reports said. A senior defense official told Channel 13 news that Barnea was set to present new options for reaching a deal given Hamas’s stance, with the report not going into further detail. Defense Minister Israel Katz, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich were reportedly involved in Sunday’s meeting. The meeting came off the back of an assessment held earlier Sunday between Katz and defense officials on the subject of the captives, announced by the defense minister’s office, and a separate joint meeting between Bar, Halevi, Barnea and Alon, announced by the Shin Bet, which said it focused on 'advancing the efforts to return the hostages.' Israeli Channel 12 reported that the security chiefs gave Katz a very grim assessment of the condition of the captives who have been held by in Gaza for more than 400 days.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2270083	2024-11-18T03:01:23-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-02946160017319276042.jpeg

Berri to Netanyahu: Pressure-for-Surrender Policy Doesn’t Work	Lebanese Speaker Nabih Berri revealed that efforts aimed at reaching a ceasefire between Lebanon and the Zionist entity are underway, stressing that the Israeli policy aimed at pressuring Lebanon in a bid to force it to surrender doesn’t work. In remarks published by Al-Sharq Al-Awsat Newspaper late Friday, Berri affirmed that 'There can be no undermining of our sovereignty.' He firmly denied reports that the US proposal which was reportedly delivered to him via US Ambassador Lisa Johnson earlier this week, didn’t stipulated that the Israeli occupation military would have freedom of movement in Lebanon. Concerning freedom of (Israeli) movement in Lebanon, 'This is not up for discussion and there is no room for discussion about it. The Americans know this very well,' the Lebanese speaker said, as quoted by the paper. Meanwhile, he added that the US proposal is not unacceptable regarding the formation of an international committee that will monitor the implementation of Resolution 1701. 'As for Resolution 1701, There is no approval to form an international committee that will monitor the implementation of Resolution 1701, nor to introduce multinational or NATO forces. There is commitment to UN Resolution 1701. The work of UNIFIL forces and the Lebanese army will be activated to implement it.' Asked about the massive Israeli strikes on his hometown of Tebnine and other neighborhoods in Beirut’s Dahiyeh, Speaker Berri said: 'It seems that (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu thinks that when he wants to force someone to surrender he acts harshly. However, he doesn’t know whom he is dealing with, and that this policy doesn’t work with us.' Earlier on Friday, Berri met with Ali Larijani, an advisor to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, in Beirut. Speaker Berri and Larijani in Beirut's Ain Al-Tineh (November 15, 2024).

Sayyed Houthi: Targeting US Aircraft Carrier Frustrated Major Ame...	Head of Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi indicated that Yemen continues its operations and activities as part of the Promised Victory Battle and Sacred Jihad. This week, military operations were carried out with 29 ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as drones, Sayyed Houthi said Thursday in his speech. Our military operations targeted deep and southern areas of occupied Palestine, including Jaffa, Ashkelon, Umm Al-Rashrash, and an 'Israeli' enemy air base in the Negev Desert, as well as maritime targets, he added. Sayyed Houthi revealed that the most notable of our naval operations was the targeting of the American aircraft carrier 'USS Abraham Lincoln' in the Arabian Sea, which fled hundreds of miles after being struck. Since the retreat of the American aircraft carrier that was previously in the Red Sea, the enemy has avoided entering the Red Sea, and no aircraft carrier has entered it since that time, he stressed. 'The American aircraft carrier now moves either from the Gulf to the Gulf of Oman, the edges of the Indian Ocean, or in the Arabian Sea with caution and disguise. In some instances, the American aircraft carrier navigates close to certain African coastlines out of fear of being targeted.' 'No nation in the world has decided to target an American aircraft carrier like Yemen has, thanks to Allah's support and the result of the faith-based, Quranic, and fight orientation of our esteemed people.' 'Who dares to make the decision to target an American aircraft carrier and execute it by actually launching missiles and drones to attack it?!' Sayyed Houthi noted that the American aircraft carrier 'Lincoln' retreated hundreds of miles deep into the Arabian Sea following its targeting. 'Along with the targeting of the aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, two American warships were targeted in the Red Sea.' The maritime operation was executed at a time when the Americans were preparing to carry out the most extensive aerial assault on our country since their declaration of support for the 'Israeli' enemy, Sayyed Houthi added. 'The American-planned operation failed, putting them on the defensive line, and their aircraft carrier retreated hundreds of miles.' As long as the 'Israeli' enemy continues its aggression—along with the American support—against Gaza and the Lebanese people, we will continue our operations, Sayyed Houthi reiterated. Yemeni Armed Forces targeted the American aircraft carrier (Abraham) located in the Arabian Sea with a number of cruise missiles and drones while the American enemy was preparing to carry out hostile operations targeting Yemen.
