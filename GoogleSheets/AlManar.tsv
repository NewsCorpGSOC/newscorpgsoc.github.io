Iran’s Tolerance Fades Following Assassination of Sayyed Nasralla...	Iran's top military commander stated that Iran had shown restraint following aggressive actions from ‘Israel’ in July but could no longer remain patient after the assassination of Hezbollah Leader Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and a prominent Iranian general. Major General Mohammad Baqeri made this announcement on Wednesday after Operation True Promise II. The regime assassinated Ismail Haniyeh, former chief of the Political Bureau of the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas, during a targeted killing in the Iranian capital Tehran on July 31. 'After Martyr Haniyeh’s assassination, Iran went through a tough period of self-restraint amid repeated requests by the Americans and Europeans, who would ask us to exercise self-restraint so they would establish a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip (where the Israeli regime has been waging a genocidal war),' Bagheri said. 'However, after Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah’s and [Brigadier] General [Abbas] Nilforoushan’s martyrdom, the situation was no longer tolerable,' he added. Hezbollah Leader Sayyed Nasrallah and the Iranian commander were assassinated during intense Israeli airstrikes on the southern suburb of Beirut on Friday. On Tuesday, Iran responded to the triple assassinations as well as the regime’s ongoing deadly aggression against Gaza and Lebanon by launching hundreds of missiles toward the Zionist entity’s military and intelligence bases all over the occupied Palestinian territories.

According to Bagheri, the targets of the 'heroic' operation that 'served as a response to many of the Zionists’ crimes,' included three of the Israeli regime’s main airbases. He named the bases as the headquarters of the regime’s Mossad spy agency, which he identified as the 'center for terrorism,' the regime’s Nevatim airbase that houses its F-35 warplanes, and the Hatzerim base that was used towards enabling Nasrallah’s assassination. The targets also featured the regime’s strategic radars, the centers housing the regime’s tanks and personnel carriers, and the center accommodating those of the regime’s forces that partake in massacres against Palestinians in Gaza. 'All Israeli infrastructures to be targeted if it repeats its atrocities' The military chief asserted that the Islamic Republic’s Armed Forces were completely prepared to respond to the potential repetition of such atrocities on the part of the regime, describing the forces’ capabilities as 'many times more than' what was displayed during True Promise II. 'If the Zionist regime, which has reached madness, was not controlled by the United States and Europe, and sought to either continue its atrocities or take action against our territorial integrity and sovereignty, tonight’s operation would be repeated with multiple magnitude and all of their infrastructures would be struck.' He, however, hoped that the US would reverse its approach and stop the regime so the region could move towards experiencing calm. The General Staff of Iran’s Armed Forces also commented on the operation in a statement, saying it came in reaction to the regime’s disregard for the legitimate sovereign rights of the Islamic Republic. It praised the response as an instance of the country’s 'making any malicious aggressor, at any level, regret their actions.' The statement, meanwhile, warned the aggressive regime that 'it should expect the widespread and comprehensive destruction of its infrastructure within the occupied Palestinian lands if it responds [to the operation] in kind.' It finally cautioned the regime’s supporters, including the United States, against taking part in direct intervention against the Islamic Republic, saying such interference would warrant 'a powerful and regret-inducing response against their centers and interests across the region.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2215809	2024-10-02T03:00:23-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04726330017278632178.jpg
Yemeni Armed Forces launch Quds-5 cruise missiles deep into ‘Isra...	The missile force of the Yemeni Armed Forces (YAF) has launched a significant attack on military sites deep within the Israeli occupation territory using three Quds-5 cruise missiles, as confirmed by YAF spokesperson Brigadier General Yahya Saree on Wednesday. Saree emphasized that the Israeli occupation authorities have remained silent regarding the outcomes of this operation, which is declared as a show of support for the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and a demonstration of solidarity with their Resistance. In addition, the YAF extended their congratulations on Iran's Operation True Promise 2 against the Israeli occupation entity and expressed their readiness to partake in joint military actions in support of the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples, as well as in response to any Israeli aggression against their support fronts. Furthermore, the spokesperson issued a warning concerning the continued support of, The United States and Britain for ‘Israel’, stating that such support places American and British interests in the region at risk. Brigadier General Saree also underlined the YAF's unwavering determination to escalate their military operations against, ‘Israel’, and its supporters until the aggression on Gaza ceases, the blockade on the Strip is lifted, and the aggression on Lebanon comes to an end. The senior military source highlighted the Quds-5's exceptional features, including its high speed, formidable destructive power, and capability to penetrate all types of air defenses deployed in the region. Moreover, Saree hinted at the element of surprise associated with the Quds-5, drawing a parallel to the previous shock caused by the Quds-3 missile and indicating that further unexpected developments should be expected. This remarkable attack follows closely on the heels of Saree's announcement that the YAF's naval, missile, and UAV forces executed three separate military operations in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. The initial operation targeted the Cordelia Moon British oil tanker in the Red Sea, employing eight ballistic and cruise missiles, a drone, and an uncrewed surface boat, resulting in significant damage to the vessel. The subsequent operations took aim at the Marathopolis tanker in the Indian Ocean, utilizing a cruise missile and a drone to enforce the YAF's maritime ban on ships heading towards the occupied ports of Palestine. The YAF's UAV force had previously struck an Israeli military target in occupied Yafa (Eilat) using a Yafa-type drone, as well as other military targets in occupied Umm al-Rashrash (Eilat) with four Samad-4 drones, all of which achieved their objectives effectively.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2216062	2024-10-02T03:00:10-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/06/manar-00923210017183201212.jpg

Eight Zionists Dead in Jaffa Shooting, Many More Wounded	Six people were murdered and dozens were wounded in a terrorist shooting attack at a light rail station in Jaffa on Tuesday evening. Eight people were taken to Ichilov Medical Center with at least two in critical condition with head wounds and the others moderately to seriously wounded. Twelve wounded, including a child, were transferred to the Wolfson Medical Center; five were in serious condition. Security forces initially believed the incident was criminal because there has been a criminal shooting in the area nearly every day recently due to a well-known criminal living nearby, according to Maariv. Once they heard the shooting and shouts of 'Allahu Akbar,' the authorities arrived on the scene ready for a terror incident. Eyewitnesses described the terror and chaos. 'We were on the light rail when we suddenly heard gunfire from outside,' one witness said. 'At first, we thought it was fireworks, but then we realized it was something much worse. There were many gunshots. We dropped to the floor, and people were crying. I saw someone bleeding on the ground.' A nearby shop owner added, 'I saw crowds of people running and shouting ‘terror attack.’ I quickly closed my shutters and locked up.' The two attackers, Muhammad Chalaf Sahar Rajab and Hassan Muhammad Hassan Tamimi, from Hebron, were shot dead by members of a Tel Aviv-Jaffa Municipality security patrol unit and citizens using personal firearms, according to the police. Chaos in Tel Aviv's light rail Hanan Peretz, head of the local patrol unit, praised his team’s swift response. 'They identified the gunman, took cover without hesitation, and fired at him,' he said. 'It seems the attacker’s weapon malfunctioned during the shooting.' The police and security services are continuing their investigation into the attack, which took place near the Gush Dan Light Rail’s Erlich Station. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Police Commissioner Daniel Levy arrived at the scene, along with Tel Aviv District Commander Haim Sargrof. 'This is a difficult incident,' Sargrof said. 'At around 7 p.m., we received a report that two attackers had boarded the light rail and opened fire. They injured four people, then exited the train and continued shooting at civilians on the street. A light rail security guard, two officers from the municipal Sela Unit, and police officers shot at the attackers and neutralized both of them. We know their origin and are conducting further checks with the Shin Bet [Israel Security Agency]. They are not Israeli citizens.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2215622	2024-10-01T13:21:05-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-09163930017278140366.jpg
Iran’s Ballistic Missiles Strike ‘Israel’	The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps carried out a missile strike against the Israeli occupation entity on Tuesday evening. The IRGC said in a statement that it has targeted 'the heart of the occupied territories' in response to the martyrdom of Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh, Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, and IRGC general Abbas Nilforoushan at the hands of the Zionist regime. The statement said the retaliatory attack has been launched after a period of self-restraint following the violation of Iran’s sovereignty. The IRGC said it has fired tens of ballistic missiles at vital military and security Israeli targets. The IRGC has also warned the Zionist regime that if it intends to react militarily to Iran’s operation which conforms with Tehran’s legitimate rights and the international law, it will have to face subsequent 'crushing and devastating strikes'. Reports suggest that as many as 200 Iranian missiles have been fired during half an hour. Images released by the media outlets show a large number of projectiles over Tel Aviv a number of other cities across the occupied territories. Hamas Hamas Resistance Movement issued a statement to commend the Iranian missile strikes in response to the Zionist aggression against the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples.

The Islamic Resistance Movement - Hamas, expresses its support for the heroic missile launches executed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran, targeting large areas of our occupied lands. These strikes are a response to the ongoing crimes of the Zionist occupation against the peoples of the region and an act of retribution for the blood of our honored martyrs: the martyred fighter Ismail Haniyeh, His Eminence Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, and General Abbas Nilforoushan. We affirm that this honorable Iranian retaliation sends a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government, aiming to deter their continued terrorism. Their persistent violations of international law and humanitarian norms, as well as their crimes and arrogance, have exceeded all bounds. We take pride in our brothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran and deeply appreciate their stance against unchecked Zionist aggression. Their commitment to justice aligns with the struggles of the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and the broader interests of the Islamic Nation, embodied in ending the occupation and curbing the fascist Zionist enemy. We call on all countries, peoples, parties, and forces within the Arab and Islamic Nations to unite in confronting Zionist crimes and their expansionist project, which threatens us all.

Tel Aviv now faces the strikes of the Mujahideen from Yemen, Lebanon, Palestine, and Iran.

The very heavy words about the martyrdom of Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah can never be up to the major challenges it poses. Shrewd plans and adept performance are necessary in order to reach the intended victory. Sayyed Nasrallah's lovers were aggrieved by the loss of the leader and the guide; however, their faith and patience helped them to accept Holy God's will and move on to the stage of consecrating the great martyrs objectives in a general framework to be followed. The main question that is raised in the aftermath of the Zionist massacre is focused on the manner of avenging Sayyed Nasrallah's blood. The Lebanese politician, Nasser Kandil, told Al-Manar TV that avenging Sayyed Nasrallah's blood necessitates working for achieving victory in Palestine through the eradication of the occupation entity. Kandil stressed, in an interview with the Resistance Channel, that observing the requirements of achieving victory is much more important that dealing a loud blow in order to take an emotional revenge. The editor-in-chief of Al-Binaa newspaper called for maintaining trust in the resistance and its choices established by the martyred leader, underlining the loyalty to the Resistance in accordance with the teachings of Sayyed Nasrallah. Deputy Leader Sheikh Naim Qassem assured on Monday that the Lebanese resistance group is strong enough and ready for all scenarios, adding that Hezbollah will go on with its goals and its battle. In this regard, Kandil indicated that all the Israeli aerial attacks and their consequences will fail to achieve any of the enemy's goals, including the return of the northern settlers to their houses. Iran and the regional war The Lebanese politician affirmed that the Palestinian cause needs the operations of the resistance groups who are free of all the state considerations, explaining that state wars always lead to compromises that delay the ultimate victory. The resistance groups can inflict accumulating losses upon the enemy without involving the regional states in devastating wars, he said, recalling Sayyed Nasrallah's notion of achieving victory through scoring successive goals, not dealing not dealing a mortal combat. Kandil noted that Hezbollah has the border advantage of firing heavy missiles from short distances and within a very limited time, and is not in need of any Iranian help to destroy Tel Aviv. The relation between Iran and Hezbollah is not based of servitude, Kandil said, mentioning instances in which Tehran rejected to strike any deal with the United States at the expense of the Lebanese resistance group. Kandil called for trusting the resistance and its choices established by the martyred leader Sayyed Nasrallah, ridiculing all the malicious media attempts to cause strife and sedition among the components of the axis of resistance.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2214390	2024-09-30T14:28:33-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-02397330017277316942.jpeg

A Message to Sayyed Nasrallah from Al-Manar English Website: We S...	Your Eminence, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, our beloved leader, For years, it has been our deepest honor at Al-Manar English Website to translate your speeches. It was not just a duty but a privilege, as we shared your words with the world. We were humbled to bring your guidance to those who sought your wisdom, across lands and languages. Each speech carried with it a weight that we could never fully capture in translation, for your words were filled with a depth and grace beyond any language. Forgive us, Sayyed, if we ever fell short. We labored with utmost care to reflect the true essence of your thoughts, yet we know that no translation could ever truly embody the power of your words. Your eloquence transcended every boundary we tried to cross. We searched dictionaries, deliberated among ourselves, and strove to find the perfect words, yet we were always conscious of the greatness that our efforts could not fully convey. Your words were not just spoken—they were lived, and they breathed life into your beloved ones’ hearts. This past Saturday, as the news of your martyrdom echoed across the land, our hearts shattered. The followers of the resistance felt the weight of Karbala in every tear. Was it possible? Could our leader, who stood with such strength and conviction, truly be gone? The vile enemy gloated, but we could not comprehend a world without you, Sayyed. How do we write these words when our hands tremble with grief? How do we address you now, knowing that you have joined the ranks of the martyrs? Reporting the breaking news of your martyrdom was our hardest task ever. Our fingers were quivering while typing the tragic words. We seek shelter beneath the cloak of Zainab (peace be upon her), for she too faced a grief that words could not describe. We pray, as she did, that God accepts this immense sacrifice. Today, the resistance faces its greatest test: 'If only we were with you, so we could win a great victory.' In our mourning, we recall the final words of Imam Hussein (peace be upon him) as he spoke to Zainab: 'Do not tear your clothes for me, do not slap your cheeks. Protect the children for me.' And so we, too, must stand firm. We are called to endure this test with the strength of those who came before us, and in their example, we find our courage. From the hilltops of Zainabi, the Islamic Resistance looks to the Commander of the Faithful, Imam Ali (peace be upon him), and hears his command: 'Hold fast. Stand firm. Look to the farthest reaches.' The truth is, Sayyed, this is the harshest battle we have faced. Not one fought with weapons, but one that tears at the very core of our being. No words can console us. No voice can calm the pain we feel. But let there be no doubt: Hezbollah's grief does not come from weakness or fear. We are not shaken. The answer to those who question will be found not in words, but in action—on the front lines, where your spirit continues to guide us. A leader like you, Sayyed, never wavered. From the beginning, you knew the cost of this path. You knew the sacrifices it would demand, but you were never afraid. What weighed on your heart was not the risk to yourself, but the lives of your comrades, the people who believed in you and followed your leadership with unwavering trust. Every decision you made was for us, and we can only imagine the burden you carried. And yet, through it all, you found solace in your faith, in your deep connection to God, and in the wisdom of those who guided you, like the Supreme Leader Sayyed Ali Khamenei, who you once turned to in times of overwhelming pressure, and whom we turn to despite all the deceitful schemes against the resistance axis. Sayyed, your martyrdom is a wound that no victory can heal. The resistance could burn 'Israel' to the ground, and still, the loss of you is a grief beyond measure. Yet, as you told us: 'The news is in what you see, not in what you hear.' The struggle continues, and so too does your legacy. You once said that if we were to die a thousand deaths, we would never leave the side of Imam Hussein (peace be upon him). Now, we face this reality with broken hearts, but with our heads held high. You have been martyred, just as Sayyed Abbas al-Moussawi was before you. Your legacy now carries on, burning brightly in the hearts of those who walked with you on this path. In your absence, we at Al-Manar English Website pledge to continue the work you inspired. We shall endure. We will keep spreading your message, translating the resistance words, carrying the light you kindled for us all. We once took pride in every speech you gave, in every stance you took. Now, that pride is mixed with sorrow, but it is also strengthened by our resolve. You were not just our leader, Sayyed. You were our guide, our teacher, our inspiration. Your blood now flows in the hands of the faithful, who will raise it to the sky and ask: 'Are you satisfied, O Lord?' We will not rest until we fulfill our duty, until your sacrifice is victorious, until your memory and legacy are honored in full. Sayyed, you are our leader. You are the heart of our resistance. And we, the Al-Manar English team, will continue to serve you with all that we have. We will spread your word, and we will remain true to the path you have set before us. With love, loyalty, and eternal gratitude, The Al-Manar English Website Team	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2213290	2024-09-29T13:53:02-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-09574970017276430486.jpg

Hamas expressed its deepest condolences and solidarity with the brotherly Lebanese people, Hezbollah, and the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon. 'We strongly condemn this brutal Zionist aggression and the targeting of residential buildings in Haret Hreik, in the southern suburbs of Beirut (Dahiyeh). We consider this a cowardly act of terrorism, a massacre, and a heinous crime that once again reveals the bloodthirsty and savage nature of this occupation. It is a rogue entity that disregards all values, norms, and international treaties, openly threatening global peace and security amid international silence, incapacity, and complacency,' Hamas affirmed. Hamas' statement concluded with a prayer for mercy upon Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and his fellow leaders who were martyred alongside him on the path to liberating Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa. 'May God grant them His boundless mercy and forgiveness and bestow patience and solace upon their families, comrades, and the brotherly Lebanese people,' Hamas added.

'The resistance forces in Lebanon, Palestine, and across the region will ensure that the enemy pays the price for its crimes and will make it taste defeat for its wicked actions, sooner rather than later,' the movement affirmed.

Imam Khamenei: All Resistance Forces Stand by Hezbollah	Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei stressed that committing massacres against the unarmed people in Lebanon has once again exposed the savage nature of the rabid Zionist dog to everyone and demonstrated the shortsightedness and foolish policy of the leaders of the usurping regime. In a statement, Imam Khamenei indicated that the terrorist gang ruling over the Zionist entity has not learned from their criminal year-long war in Gaza, nor have they realized that the mass killing of women, children, and civilians cannot weaken or overthrow the strong structure of the Resistance. 'Now they are testing the same foolish policy in Lebanon.' The Zionist criminals must know that they are far too insignificant to cause any significant harm to the strong structure of the Lebanese Hezbollah, His Eminence added, all Resistance forces in the region stand by Hezbollah and support it. The fate of this region will be determined by the Resistance forces, with the victorious Hezbollah at the forefront, Imam Khamenei affirmed. 'The people of Lebanon have not forgotten that once upon a time, the military forces of the usurping regime even reached Beirut, and it was Hezbollah that cut their legs off and made Lebanon dignified and proud. Today as well, with the power and might of Allah, Lebanon will make the aggressive, evil, and cowardly enemy regret. It is incumbent upon all Muslims to stand with their capabilities beside the people of Lebanon and the victorious Hezbollah and assist them in confronting this usurping, unjust, and evil regime.'

Hezbollah Mourns Commander Martyred in Dahiyeh Aggression	Hezbollah mourned commander Mohammad Hussein Srour who embraced martyrdom all the way to Al-Quds during an Israeli strike on Beirut’s southern suburb, Dahiyeh, on Thursday. In a statement released late Thursday, Hezbollah’s Military Media said: 'With utmost pride and honor, the Islamic Resistance announces the martyrdom of commander Mohammad Hussein Srour (Abu Saleh), from the southern border town of Ayta Al-Shaab.' The resistance group’s Military Media provided a brief biography that highlights the journey of the martyred commander. Born in Ayta Al-Shaab on July 8, 1973, commander Srour joined the ranks of the Islamic Resistance in 1986. He assumed organizational responsibilities with the Resistance and underwent several high-level leadership training programs. Commander Abu Saleh participated in many Islamic Resistance operations against the Israeli occupation, and was one of the key commanders who confronted the takfiri attacks on Lebanon's eastern borders and in various Syrian provinces. He specialized in various military fields and took over responsibility of Hezbollah’s Air Force since 2020. He led the military operations of Hezbollah Air Force on the Lebanese front supporting Gaza since the start of Al-Aqsa Flood Battle until his blessed martyrdom. Commander Abu Slaeh ascended as a martyr All the Way to Al-Quds following a treacherous Israeli assassination operation on September 26, 2024, in Beirut's Dahiyeh, according to the biography. من مكان وقوع الغارة في الضاحية الجنوبية في شارع القائم.#وقائع pic.twitter.com/pdNVckTZxv — وقائع (@waqa2e3) September 26, 2024	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2210452	2024-09-27T00:23:24-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-00429500017274213997.jpg
Houthi: Any Israeli Ground Invasion of Lebanon Will Be Doomed to ...	Head of Yemen’s Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Al-Houthi stressed that Hezbollah defeated the Israeli enemy in epochs during which the Resistance group did not possess the capabilities it has now. In his weekly speech, Houthi noted that the Zionist enemy has escalated in Lebanon, relying on its criminal tactics of widespread targeting, killing civilians, and destroying homes, similar to its actions in the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah’s role in supporting Gaza since the beginning of the aggression has been the strongest and most influential among the support fronts, he affirmed. 'Hezbollah plays a fundamental and important role in confronting the enemy, and its heroic record, achievements, and victories prove its pivotal role for Palestine, Lebanon, and the entire nation.' The 'Israeli' goal of escalation in Lebanon is to prevent Hezbollah from supporting Gaza and the Palestinian people, a goal that will not be achieved, Houthi underscored. 'Hezbollah’s stance in supporting Gaza is principled, religious, humanitarian, and ethical, and at the same time, it serves Lebanon’s interests. If the enemy were to achieve its objectives in Palestine and free itself for other fronts, Lebanon would be at the top of its target list.' The enemy had been preparing for aggression against Lebanon and Hezbollah, gathering intelligence, devising targeting plans, and arranging the necessary components for such attacks, Houthi pointed out. 'We observe the strength, resilience, and determination of Hezbollah, despite the scale of the Zionist aggression. The fighters in Lebanon and Palestine are driven by faith, fully aware of their sacred fight duty in standing for the just cause.' The Yemeni leader indicated that the danger facing the Ummah (nation) is not in its movement and raising the banner of fight in the path of Allah to confront its hateful enemies, but in its hesitation, stagnation, surrender, and incapacity. The experience of the fighters in the Gaza Strip has brought about significant victories and inflicted heavy losses on the 'Israeli' enemy, and they have developed a firm, steadfast, and resilient approach in confronting the enemy, according to Houthi. If the 'Israeli' enemy undertakes a ground operation in Lebanon, it will face defeat and will not succeed, he underscored. 'Hezbollah has the military and missile capabilities to reach all parts of occupied Palestine; thus, the enemy will not win this escalation.' Houth emphasized that the Iraqi support front is strong, with significant and impactful operations on the rise from the Jordan Valley to Eilat and towards Haifa and beyond. The Red Sea, Arabian Sea, and Gulf of Aden have become completely prohibited areas for the Israeli, American, and British enemies Houthi recalled. We will never hesitate to support Gaza and Palestine as a whole, as well as Lebanon and Hezbollah, and to cooperate with them, Houthi concluded. The Islamic Resistance continued on Thursday confronting the criminal Israeli aggression on Lebanon, firing dozens of missiles at northern Palestine.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2210265	2024-09-26T13:31:28-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-08909880017273826794.jpg

Global Outcry as Israeli Aggression Leaves Hundreds Dead, Thousan...	The world has reacted with outrage after a devastating Israeli aggression on Lebanon resulted in the deaths of nearly 500 people and left over 1,600 injured. The airstrikes, which began on Monday, have sparked a chorus of international condemnation. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi voiced strong support for Lebanon, denouncing the 'indiscriminate attacks against civilians' during a meeting with his Lebanese counterpart. 'No matter how the situation changes, we will always stand on the side of justice, on the side of our Arab brothers, including Lebanon,' Wang said. Arab foreign ministers also issued a robust condemnation of Israel's increasing aggression against Lebanon, reaffirming their steadfast support for the Lebanese government and its citizens, during the annual Arab League Council meeting held on Monday alongside the 79th United Nations General Assembly. 'We strongly condemn the Israeli regime's escalating aggression against Lebanon, particularly the recent assaults that commenced on Monday morning. We express our readiness to support Lebanon in the face of these attacks, while holding the Israeli regime accountable for this alarming escalation,' the statement said. Turkey: Israel Pushing Region Deeper into 'Chaos' The Turkish Foreign Ministry in a statement warned that Israel's attacks on Lebanon threatened to push the West Asia region deeper into 'chaos.' 'Israel's attacks on Lebanon mark a new phase in its efforts to drag the entire region into chaos,' the statement said. The ministry added that 'the countries that unconditionally support ‘Israel’ are helping [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu shed blood for his political interests.' France Urges UNSC to Take Immediate Measures Meanwhile, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot on Monday said that France urged all involved parties and their supporters to deescalate tensions and prevent a regional conflict that could have catastrophic consequences, particularly for civilians. The country has also requested an emergency meeting of the Security Council regarding Lebanon to take place this week. The ministry urged all institutions responsible for maintaining international peace and security, especially the UN Security Council, as well as the international community, to take necessary measures without any delay. EU Urges Solution European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned on Monday that the escalating clashes between ‘Israel’ and Lebanon threaten to plunge the region into an all-out war. 'We're seeing more military strikes, more damage, more collateral damage, more victims,' Borrell said ahead of a gathering of world leaders at the United Nations. He emphasized the urgent need for collective action to stop the crisis, stating that everyone must fully commit to finding a solution during discussions in New York. The top EU diplomat said 'despite all the diplomatic capacity that we have deployed, nothing has been able to stop the war' in Gaza. 'A Genocide' As he held a meeting with Brazil's Landless Movement in Caracas, Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro referred to the Israeli strikes in Lebanon on Monday as 'genocide,' calling it a global battle between fascism and the people. 'It is no longer simply a threat, it is a reality,' Maduro said, adding that what is happening now in Lebanon is genocide against the Arab nation. Greece's Foreign Minister, George Gerapetritis, said that Israel is not facing sufficient pressure to end the war in Gaza, adding that the escalation in Lebanon is a minefield that the international community may not be able to deal with. 'We have not prevented the spillover, and the more dispersed the war becomes, the more the situation becomes more complicated to be solved,' he said, adding 'Lebanon could easily be a zone of tremendous hostility, and this is something that we cannot deal with. It's a clear minefield.' Gerapetritis emphasized the importance of collaboration between Arabs and Europeans on coming up with unified initiatives instead of pursuing separate actions, noting that the recent escalation at the Lebanon border with the Israeli occupied territories highlighted a significant international failure. Jordan’s King Abdullah II has affirmed his country’s 'absolute support for Lebanon, its security, sovereignty, and the safety of its citizens in the face of Israel’s war on it.' Speaking with Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati on Monday, the Jordanian King highlighted the risks posed by Israel’s escalating actions and underscored the urgent need for global intervention to avert a regional conflict. He emphasized that the path to peace begins with an 'immediate end to the war on Gaza.' Other countries, including Egypt, Syria, Qatar and Iraq, in separate statements have also condemned Israel’s aggression against Lebanon and expressed their solidarity with the Lebanese government and people. This comes as Mikati urged the United Nations and the world powers to deter what he called Israel's 'plan that aims to destroy Lebanese villages and towns.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2207757	2024-09-24T02:41:13-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-04166000017270915569.jpg

For his part, the head of telecoms company Ogero, Imad Kreidieh, told Reuters that Lebanon received more than 80,000 suspected Israeli call attempts asking people to evacuate their areas.

The attacks in Lebanon and the genocide in Gaza as well as the aggression in the west Bank, 'is a blatant violation of all humanitarian rules and norms, international laws and agreements,' the group said, stressing that such war crimes 'require urgent action by the international community to stop them and hold their perpetrators accountable.' 'We support our brothers in Hezbollah as we affirm our full solidarity with them and laud their courageous stances and their insistence to adhere to national, religious and humanitarian values by continuing the battle to support our people in the Gaza Strip,' Hamas added.

'The government of the Zionist enemy is going ahead with its crimes against the brotherly Lebanese people, with the aim of dragging Lebanon into an all-out war, or imposing humiliating conditions on it, on top of which is stopping the support front that Hezbollah is leading in defense of the Palestinian people.' 'As we highly appreciate the great sacrifices made by Hezbollah and the Lebanese people in confronting the Zionist enemy, we ask God Almighty to bestow mercy upon the souls of the martyrs, and to grant the wounded a speedy and complete recovery,' the Islamic Jihad added. For its part, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine stressed that targeting populated areas in Dahiyeh 'is a new crime to be added to the record of crimes of the terrorist Israeli army and this criminal fascist government.' The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine also denounced the aggression on Dahiyeh, warning that: 'It is no longer a secret that the goal of the Israeli escalation against Lebanon is to drag the region into a large-scale war… in a bid to implement the US-Israeli colonial terrorist project.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2204127	2024-09-20T11:09:38-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-07082930017268556631.jpg

‘Israel’: Artificial Intelligence with Strategic Stupidity (Video...	In light of the Israeli cyber attack on Lebanon last Tuesday and Wednesday which left thousands of martyrs and injuries, the foreign media outlets followed up its repercussions with awe. Frontline Magazine reported that the explosions, which left at least nine dead and over 2,800 injured, have exposed a new frontier in modern warfare. 'Experts agree this attack marks a pivotal moment in how warfare is conducted in the 21st century. Cyber attacks are often invisible, leaving no trace, no debris, and no smoking gun. They target essential systems—communication networks, power grids, financial institutions—bringing entire nations to their knees without a single conventional weapon being deployed.' 'Military strategies must now account for cyberspace as a key battleground, where attacks can disrupt societies, economies, and critical infrastructure without firing a shot.' Reuters highlighted that role of the Israeli cyber intelligence unit 8200 in the attack, mentioning the incidents of the unit's failure, including October 7, and underling its unethical activities regarding spying individual privacy. The New York Times said that the Israeli intelligence planted explosives in the communication devices which exploded in Lebanon, mentioning much alleged details about the source of the pagers. The Washington Post asked about the timing of the Zionist attack, wondering about the cause of this escalation if it is not part of an all-out war. The Guardian reported the Israeli unease after the cyber attack on Lebanon, quoting Israeli analysts as saying that it would return the Zionist settlers to northern Palestine and questioning its feasibility without a strategic context. Hezbollah secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah stressed, in a televised speech on Thursday, that the painful cyber attack will fail to overthrow the resistance and return the residents of the North.

RGC Chief Warns ‘Israel’ of 'Crushing Response' For acts of terro...	The chief commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) says ‘Israel’ will face 'a crushing response from the axis of resistance' for its acts of terror in Lebanon which are the result of the regime's despair. In a letter to Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on Thursday, Major General Hossein Salami condemned 'the terrorist crime of the occupying regime, which resulted in the martyrdom and mass injury of beloved Lebanese nationals and Hezbollah fighters'. 'I declare that such terrorist acts, that are undoubtedly due to the desperation and successive failures of the Zionist regime, will soon be met with a crushing response from the resistance front and we will witness complete destruction of this cruel and criminal regime,' he said. Salami praised Sayyed Nasrallah and Hezbollah resistance fighters as well as the Lebanese nation for supporting the Palestinians in their struggle against the Israeli occupation. Salami touched on Hezbollah's operations over the past year, especially Operation Arbaeen Day last month in response to Israel's assassination of top military commander Fuad Shukr, saying they have shaken the security, intelligence and military bases of the 'treacherous and usurping regime'. 'The enemy, incapable of face-to-face confrontation, commits crimes behind the front line and magnifies the achievement of the crime in order to delay its demise and hide the scandal of its successive defeats from the world. He said IRGC servicemen, together with the great Iranian nation, laud the numerous sacrifices made by Hezbollah fighters, pay homage to the victims of recent device explosions in Lebanon, offer condolences to their families, and pray for the quick recovery of the injured. Salami said ‘Israel’ has not achieved any of its goals in Gaza after nearly a year of war and resorting to all kinds of crimes, despite the 'ignorant and unwavering support of the Western governments'. 'The humiliated enemy which is under the daily strikes of the resistance in the center, north, east and south and besieged will get nowhere with the new massive terrorist attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday using pagers and electronic systems against women, men and children of Lebanon.' The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has denounced the detonation of pagers and wireless devices in Lebanon, saying it is a blatant violation of international law. The organization said the attack did not only target Hezbollah members but also indiscriminately exploded devices used by civilians.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2202895	2024-09-20T01:59:46-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/12/manar-067219500170375961910.jpg

Sayyed Nasrallah: Difficult Reckoning Awaits ‘Israel’, Hezbollah ...	Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah said clear on Wednesday: The devices massacres that killed or injured thousands in Lebanon will be met with a difficult reckoning and won’t force the Lebanese resistance group from assuming its religious and moral duty of supporting the oppressed people of Gaza and Palestine.
