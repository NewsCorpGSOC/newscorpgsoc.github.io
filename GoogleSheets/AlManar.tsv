The Syrian Ministry of Defense reported on Friday that the Israeli occupation launched an aggression from the direction of the occupied Syrian Golan, targeting a Syrian military site near the village of Kfir Yabous in the Damascus countryside. A statement issued by the Ministry of Defense said that the Israeli aggression that targeted Kfir Yabous at around 1:35 a.m. on Friday resulted in the martyrdom of 5 soldiers and the injury of another. On September 9, 18 civilians were killed and dozens were injured as a result of the Israeli aggression that targeted the vicinity of the city of Masyaf in the western countryside of Hama.

The Israeli attacks on Syria come in light of a large-scale Israeli aggression on Lebanon, which resulted in hundreds of civilian martyrs and wounded as a result of the intensive raids for about 4 days.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2210738	2024-09-27T03:33:23-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-03237410017258648894.jpg

Hezbollah Mourns Commander Martyred in Dahiyeh Aggression	Hezbollah mourned commander Mohammad Hussein Srour who embraced martyrdom all the way to Al-Quds during an Israeli strike on Beirut’s southern suburb, Dahiyeh, on Thursday. In a statement released late Thursday, Hezbollah’s Military Media said: 'With utmost pride and honor, the Islamic Resistance announces the martyrdom of commander Mohammad Hussein Srour (Abu Saleh), from the southern border town of Ayta Al-Shaab.' The resistance group’s Military Media provided a brief biography that highlights the journey of the martyred commander. Born in Ayta Al-Shaab on July 8, 1973, commander Srour joined the ranks of the Islamic Resistance in 1986. He assumed organizational responsibilities with the Resistance and underwent several high-level leadership training programs. Commander Abu Saleh participated in many Islamic Resistance operations against the Israeli occupation, and was one of the key commanders who confronted the takfiri attacks on Lebanon's eastern borders and in various Syrian provinces. He specialized in various military fields and took over responsibility of Hezbollah’s Air Force since 2020. He led the military operations of Hezbollah Air Force on the Lebanese front supporting Gaza since the start of Al-Aqsa Flood Battle until his blessed martyrdom. Commander Abu Slaeh ascended as a martyr All the Way to Al-Quds following a treacherous Israeli assassination operation on September 26, 2024, in Beirut's Dahiyeh, according to the biography. من مكان وقوع الغارة في الضاحية الجنوبية في شارع القائم.#وقائع pic.twitter.com/pdNVckTZxv — وقائع (@waqa2e3) September 26, 2024	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2210452	2024-09-27T00:23:24-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-00429500017274213997.jpg
Houthi: Any Israeli Ground Invasion of Lebanon Will Be Doomed to ...	Head of Yemen’s Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Al-Houthi stressed that Hezbollah defeated the Israeli enemy in epochs during which the Resistance group did not possess the capabilities it has now. In his weekly speech, Houthi noted that the Zionist enemy has escalated in Lebanon, relying on its criminal tactics of widespread targeting, killing civilians, and destroying homes, similar to its actions in the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah’s role in supporting Gaza since the beginning of the aggression has been the strongest and most influential among the support fronts, he affirmed. 'Hezbollah plays a fundamental and important role in confronting the enemy, and its heroic record, achievements, and victories prove its pivotal role for Palestine, Lebanon, and the entire nation.' The 'Israeli' goal of escalation in Lebanon is to prevent Hezbollah from supporting Gaza and the Palestinian people, a goal that will not be achieved, Houthi underscored. 'Hezbollah’s stance in supporting Gaza is principled, religious, humanitarian, and ethical, and at the same time, it serves Lebanon’s interests. If the enemy were to achieve its objectives in Palestine and free itself for other fronts, Lebanon would be at the top of its target list.' The enemy had been preparing for aggression against Lebanon and Hezbollah, gathering intelligence, devising targeting plans, and arranging the necessary components for such attacks, Houthi pointed out. 'We observe the strength, resilience, and determination of Hezbollah, despite the scale of the Zionist aggression. The fighters in Lebanon and Palestine are driven by faith, fully aware of their sacred fight duty in standing for the just cause.' The Yemeni leader indicated that the danger facing the Ummah (nation) is not in its movement and raising the banner of fight in the path of Allah to confront its hateful enemies, but in its hesitation, stagnation, surrender, and incapacity. The experience of the fighters in the Gaza Strip has brought about significant victories and inflicted heavy losses on the 'Israeli' enemy, and they have developed a firm, steadfast, and resilient approach in confronting the enemy, according to Houthi. If the 'Israeli' enemy undertakes a ground operation in Lebanon, it will face defeat and will not succeed, he underscored. 'Hezbollah has the military and missile capabilities to reach all parts of occupied Palestine; thus, the enemy will not win this escalation.' Houth emphasized that the Iraqi support front is strong, with significant and impactful operations on the rise from the Jordan Valley to Eilat and towards Haifa and beyond. The Red Sea, Arabian Sea, and Gulf of Aden have become completely prohibited areas for the Israeli, American, and British enemies Houthi recalled. We will never hesitate to support Gaza and Palestine as a whole, as well as Lebanon and Hezbollah, and to cooperate with them, Houthi concluded. The Islamic Resistance continued on Thursday confronting the criminal Israeli aggression on Lebanon, firing dozens of missiles at northern Palestine.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2210265	2024-09-26T13:31:28-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-08909880017273826794.jpg

Global Outcry as Israeli Aggression Leaves Hundreds Dead, Thousan...	The world has reacted with outrage after a devastating Israeli aggression on Lebanon resulted in the deaths of nearly 500 people and left over 1,600 injured. The airstrikes, which began on Monday, have sparked a chorus of international condemnation. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi voiced strong support for Lebanon, denouncing the 'indiscriminate attacks against civilians' during a meeting with his Lebanese counterpart. 'No matter how the situation changes, we will always stand on the side of justice, on the side of our Arab brothers, including Lebanon,' Wang said. Arab foreign ministers also issued a robust condemnation of Israel's increasing aggression against Lebanon, reaffirming their steadfast support for the Lebanese government and its citizens, during the annual Arab League Council meeting held on Monday alongside the 79th United Nations General Assembly. 'We strongly condemn the Israeli regime's escalating aggression against Lebanon, particularly the recent assaults that commenced on Monday morning. We express our readiness to support Lebanon in the face of these attacks, while holding the Israeli regime accountable for this alarming escalation,' the statement said. Turkey: Israel Pushing Region Deeper into 'Chaos' The Turkish Foreign Ministry in a statement warned that Israel's attacks on Lebanon threatened to push the West Asia region deeper into 'chaos.' 'Israel's attacks on Lebanon mark a new phase in its efforts to drag the entire region into chaos,' the statement said. The ministry added that 'the countries that unconditionally support ‘Israel’ are helping [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu shed blood for his political interests.' France Urges UNSC to Take Immediate Measures Meanwhile, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot on Monday said that France urged all involved parties and their supporters to deescalate tensions and prevent a regional conflict that could have catastrophic consequences, particularly for civilians. The country has also requested an emergency meeting of the Security Council regarding Lebanon to take place this week. The ministry urged all institutions responsible for maintaining international peace and security, especially the UN Security Council, as well as the international community, to take necessary measures without any delay. EU Urges Solution European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned on Monday that the escalating clashes between ‘Israel’ and Lebanon threaten to plunge the region into an all-out war. 'We're seeing more military strikes, more damage, more collateral damage, more victims,' Borrell said ahead of a gathering of world leaders at the United Nations. He emphasized the urgent need for collective action to stop the crisis, stating that everyone must fully commit to finding a solution during discussions in New York. The top EU diplomat said 'despite all the diplomatic capacity that we have deployed, nothing has been able to stop the war' in Gaza. 'A Genocide' As he held a meeting with Brazil's Landless Movement in Caracas, Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro referred to the Israeli strikes in Lebanon on Monday as 'genocide,' calling it a global battle between fascism and the people. 'It is no longer simply a threat, it is a reality,' Maduro said, adding that what is happening now in Lebanon is genocide against the Arab nation. Greece's Foreign Minister, George Gerapetritis, said that Israel is not facing sufficient pressure to end the war in Gaza, adding that the escalation in Lebanon is a minefield that the international community may not be able to deal with. 'We have not prevented the spillover, and the more dispersed the war becomes, the more the situation becomes more complicated to be solved,' he said, adding 'Lebanon could easily be a zone of tremendous hostility, and this is something that we cannot deal with. It's a clear minefield.' Gerapetritis emphasized the importance of collaboration between Arabs and Europeans on coming up with unified initiatives instead of pursuing separate actions, noting that the recent escalation at the Lebanon border with the Israeli occupied territories highlighted a significant international failure. Jordan’s King Abdullah II has affirmed his country’s 'absolute support for Lebanon, its security, sovereignty, and the safety of its citizens in the face of Israel’s war on it.' Speaking with Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati on Monday, the Jordanian King highlighted the risks posed by Israel’s escalating actions and underscored the urgent need for global intervention to avert a regional conflict. He emphasized that the path to peace begins with an 'immediate end to the war on Gaza.' Other countries, including Egypt, Syria, Qatar and Iraq, in separate statements have also condemned Israel’s aggression against Lebanon and expressed their solidarity with the Lebanese government and people. This comes as Mikati urged the United Nations and the world powers to deter what he called Israel's 'plan that aims to destroy Lebanese villages and towns.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2207757	2024-09-24T02:41:13-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-04166000017270915569.jpg

'Experts agree this attack marks a pivotal moment in how warfare is conducted in the 21st century. Cyber attacks are often invisible, leaving no trace, no debris, and no smoking gun. They target essential systems—communication networks, power grids, financial institutions—bringing entire nations to their knees without a single conventional weapon being deployed.' 'Military strategies must now account for cyberspace as a key battleground, where attacks can disrupt societies, economies, and critical infrastructure without firing a shot.' Reuters highlighted that role of the Israeli cyber intelligence unit 8200 in the attack, mentioning the incidents of the unit's failure, including October 7, and underling its unethical activities regarding spying individual privacy. The New York Times said that the Israeli intelligence planted explosives in the communication devices which exploded in Lebanon, mentioning much alleged details about the source of the pagers. The Washington Post asked about the timing of the Zionist attack, wondering about the cause of this escalation if it is not part of an all-out war. The Guardian reported the Israeli unease after the cyber attack on Lebanon, quoting Israeli analysts as saying that it would return the Zionist settlers to northern Palestine and questioning its feasibility without a strategic context. Hezbollah secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah stressed, in a televised speech on Thursday, that the painful cyber attack will fail to overthrow the resistance and return the residents of the North.

RGC Chief Warns ‘Israel’ of 'Crushing Response' For acts of terro...	The chief commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) says ‘Israel’ will face 'a crushing response from the axis of resistance' for its acts of terror in Lebanon which are the result of the regime's despair. In a letter to Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on Thursday, Major General Hossein Salami condemned 'the terrorist crime of the occupying regime, which resulted in the martyrdom and mass injury of beloved Lebanese nationals and Hezbollah fighters'. 'I declare that such terrorist acts, that are undoubtedly due to the desperation and successive failures of the Zionist regime, will soon be met with a crushing response from the resistance front and we will witness complete destruction of this cruel and criminal regime,' he said. Salami praised Sayyed Nasrallah and Hezbollah resistance fighters as well as the Lebanese nation for supporting the Palestinians in their struggle against the Israeli occupation. Salami touched on Hezbollah's operations over the past year, especially Operation Arbaeen Day last month in response to Israel's assassination of top military commander Fuad Shukr, saying they have shaken the security, intelligence and military bases of the 'treacherous and usurping regime'. 'The enemy, incapable of face-to-face confrontation, commits crimes behind the front line and magnifies the achievement of the crime in order to delay its demise and hide the scandal of its successive defeats from the world. He said IRGC servicemen, together with the great Iranian nation, laud the numerous sacrifices made by Hezbollah fighters, pay homage to the victims of recent device explosions in Lebanon, offer condolences to their families, and pray for the quick recovery of the injured. Salami said ‘Israel’ has not achieved any of its goals in Gaza after nearly a year of war and resorting to all kinds of crimes, despite the 'ignorant and unwavering support of the Western governments'. 'The humiliated enemy which is under the daily strikes of the resistance in the center, north, east and south and besieged will get nowhere with the new massive terrorist attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday using pagers and electronic systems against women, men and children of Lebanon.' The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has denounced the detonation of pagers and wireless devices in Lebanon, saying it is a blatant violation of international law. The organization said the attack did not only target Hezbollah members but also indiscriminately exploded devices used by civilians.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2202895	2024-09-20T01:59:46-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/12/manar-067219500170375961910.jpg

Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah said clear on Wednesday: The devices massacres that killed or injured thousands in Lebanon will be met with a difficult reckoning and won’t force the Lebanese resistance group from assuming its religious and moral duty of supporting the oppressed people of Gaza and Palestine.
