Berri to Netanyahu: Pressure-for-Surrender Policy Doesn’t Work	Lebanese Speaker Nabih Berri revealed that efforts aimed at reaching a ceasefire between Lebanon and the Zionist entity are underway, stressing that the Israeli policy aimed at pressuring Lebanon in a bid to force it to surrender doesn’t work. In remarks published by Al-Sharq Al-Awsat Newspaper late Friday, Berri affirmed that 'There can be no undermining of our sovereignty.' He firmly denied reports that the US proposal which was reportedly delivered to him via US Ambassador Lisa Johnson earlier this week, didn’t stipulated that the Israeli occupation military would have freedom of movement in Lebanon. Concerning freedom of (Israeli) movement in Lebanon, 'This is not up for discussion and there is no room for discussion about it. The Americans know this very well,' the Lebanese speaker said, as quoted by the paper. Meanwhile, he added that the US proposal is not unacceptable regarding the formation of an international committee that will monitor the implementation of Resolution 1701. 'As for Resolution 1701, There is no approval to form an international committee that will monitor the implementation of Resolution 1701, nor to introduce multinational or NATO forces. There is commitment to UN Resolution 1701. The work of UNIFIL forces and the Lebanese army will be activated to implement it.' Asked about the massive Israeli strikes on his hometown of Tebnine and other neighborhoods in Beirut’s Dahiyeh, Speaker Berri said: 'It seems that (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu thinks that when he wants to force someone to surrender he acts harshly. However, he doesn’t know whom he is dealing with, and that this policy doesn’t work with us.' Earlier on Friday, Berri met with Ali Larijani, an advisor to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, in Beirut. Speaker Berri and Larijani in Beirut's Ain Al-Tineh (November 15, 2024). Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem said earlier this month that Speaker Berri has been responsible for talks aimed at ending the Israeli aggression, describing Berri’s efforts as the political resistance. The newly elected Hezbollah S.G. stressed in a televised speech that there is no room for any solution that disregards Lebanon’s sovereignty.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2268554	2024-11-16T06:39:52-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/03/manar-08269500016170111069.jpg

Sayyed Houthi: Targeting US Aircraft Carrier Frustrated Major Ame...	Head of Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi indicated that Yemen continues its operations and activities as part of the Promised Victory Battle and Sacred Jihad. This week, military operations were carried out with 29 ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as drones, Sayyed Houthi said Thursday in his speech. Our military operations targeted deep and southern areas of occupied Palestine, including Jaffa, Ashkelon, Umm Al-Rashrash, and an 'Israeli' enemy air base in the Negev Desert, as well as maritime targets, he added. Sayyed Houthi revealed that the most notable of our naval operations was the targeting of the American aircraft carrier 'USS Abraham Lincoln' in the Arabian Sea, which fled hundreds of miles after being struck. Since the retreat of the American aircraft carrier that was previously in the Red Sea, the enemy has avoided entering the Red Sea, and no aircraft carrier has entered it since that time, he stressed. 'The American aircraft carrier now moves either from the Gulf to the Gulf of Oman, the edges of the Indian Ocean, or in the Arabian Sea with caution and disguise. In some instances, the American aircraft carrier navigates close to certain African coastlines out of fear of being targeted.' 'No nation in the world has decided to target an American aircraft carrier like Yemen has, thanks to Allah's support and the result of the faith-based, Quranic, and fight orientation of our esteemed people.' 'Who dares to make the decision to target an American aircraft carrier and execute it by actually launching missiles and drones to attack it?!' Sayyed Houthi noted that the American aircraft carrier 'Lincoln' retreated hundreds of miles deep into the Arabian Sea following its targeting. 'Along with the targeting of the aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, two American warships were targeted in the Red Sea.' The maritime operation was executed at a time when the Americans were preparing to carry out the most extensive aerial assault on our country since their declaration of support for the 'Israeli' enemy, Sayyed Houthi added. 'The American-planned operation failed, putting them on the defensive line, and their aircraft carrier retreated hundreds of miles.' As long as the 'Israeli' enemy continues its aggression—along with the American support—against Gaza and the Lebanese people, we will continue our operations, Sayyed Houthi reiterated.

Israeli Police to Question Netanyahu Chief of Staff over Blackmai...	Israeli police will question Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s chief of staff over blackmailing of an Israeli occupation officer. Tzachi Braverman will be questioned under caution today by the police’s Lahav 443 serious crimes unit, Hebrew media reported. Braverman was reported on Sunday to be the official suspected of blackmailing an Israeli military officer to alter minutes from wartime meetings by threatening him over a sensitive video recording of the officer. The case, one of several scandals roiling the Netanyahu’s office, is largely under a court gag order. The reports said police will ask to lift the order after he completes his questioning. Braverman’s name was first reported by the Kan public broadcaster, which also stated that the video in question had been obtained from security cameras in the Israeli premier’s office and that other employees in the office had been allowed to watch the recording. In a statement, Braverman denied any such activity, calling the report 'false' and 'defamatory,' and claiming he had neither collected any such video nor attempted to use it for blackmail purposes: 'This is a lie from start to finish, whose aim is to harm me and the Prime Minister’s Office in the middle of a war.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2266200	2024-11-14T02:19:23-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-06789110017315795038.jpg

Video| Israeli Terrorism at Peak: Destruction of Residential Buil...	It is not a coincidence that Maariv newspaper published, few hours before the Israeli aggression on Beirut's southern suburb, a fabricated report about Dahiyeh. The Zionist paper had provided the media coverage and justification for the crime which hit merely civilian targets. Around 20 air raids targeted the overpopulated area in the recent hours, hitting residential buildings, stores and medical centers. Videos shared by the locals showed the massive destruction caused by the barbaric attack on civilian targets. The Zionist air raids targeted Chiah, Ghobeiri, and Haret Hreik after overnight aerial assault had hit Jamous, Laylaki. Ghobeiri, and Haret Hreik. It is worth noting that Dar Al-Hawraa Medical Center was one of the targets struck by the Zionist war jets.

Islamic Resistance Ops Room: Our Attacks Have Left More than 100 ...	The Islamic Resistance Operations Room issued on Tuesday a statement to detail the developments of 'The Formidable in Might' Battle, highlighting the achievements reached by the Resistance fighters. The Islamic Resistance fighters continue to confront the 'Israeli' aggression on Lebanon, inflicting severe losses on the enemy's army in personnel and equipment, including officers and soldiers, across the frontlines and into the depth of occupied Palestine, according to the statement which highlighted every section of this confrontation, as follows: Ground Engagements: • Western Sector: - Due to intensive and concentrated strikes by the Resistance, the 'Israeli' army has withdrawn from most towns it had advanced into, retreating behind the border, except for the continued presence of Division 146 units in the forests of Al-Labbuneh and east of Al-Naqoura, where they attempt to advance toward Wadi Hamoul from the eastern side of the town. No infiltration attempts have been recorded in the border towns of the western sector since October 28, 2024. The enemy conducts repeated sweeps from border positions, targeting areas it has withdrawn from with artillery fire and airstrikes on secondary line towns, including Tyr Harfa, Al-Batishiyah, Al-Jibein, Shihine, and Sidiqeen,etc&#8230; - In Maroun Al-Ras area, our fighters carried out more than 24 operations using missiles and attack drones against 'Israeli' army positions and gatherings of forces and equipment advancing into Lebanese territory. Additionally, 26 missile and artillery strikes targeted settlements, including Avivim, Dovev, Sa’sa, Bar’am, Yir'on, Dishon, Malkiya, and Bar Yohai. These settlements house air defense and missile bases, command centers for participating battalions, weapons depots, and vehicle assembly areas under the command of Division 36 in the 'Israeli' army. - When an 'Israeli' force attempted to infiltrate from the town of Yaroun toward western Maroun Al-Ras, our fighters ambushed and engaged the infiltrating force with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, inflicting casualties among the enemy. - East of Maroun Al-Ras, between the town and Aitaroun, our fighters ambushed an 'Israeli' force attempting to infiltrate toward Ainatha. Intense close-range combat erupted, with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, resulting in all members of the enemy force being killed and wounded. Our fighters withdrew from the ambush point under cover fire from the Islamic Resistance support units. • Eastern Sector: - Under the Resistance’s strikes, 'Israeli' forces retreated from the towns of Meiss El Jabal, Markaba Rab Thalathin, Odaisseh, and Al-Khiam to positions behind the border. The enemy is now targeting secondary line villages in this sector with artillery and airstrikes. - Following the precise operation in Al-Khiam and after tracking Division 91’s movements at the eastern edges of Hula and around the Al-Abbad border post, our fighters launched qualitative missiles at a gathering of 'Israeli' forces and equipment, causing massive explosions, casualties, and extensive damage to the site and the vehicles within it. - In Kfar Kila, as the engineering units of Division 98 in the 'Israeli' army were demolishing homes and infrastructure, our fighters struck two bulldozers and an armored personnel carrier with guided missiles, killing and wounding the personnel within. Attempts to extract the casualties were met with intense missile barrages. Khaibar Operations Series: - Since its initiation, the Khaibar operations series has included 70 operations, targeting 33 strategic objectives up to 145 km south of Tel Aviv, such as military, logistics, air, and naval bases, air defense and missile sites, command centers, communication and intelligence bases, and training camps.  - The Resistance’s air force participated in 22 operations within the Khaibar series, launching more than 60 advanced drones with a range of up to 145 km, reaching the southern outskirts of 'Tel Aviv.' Missile Force: - The Resistance’s missile force continues targeting enemy concentrations at military sites and bases along the Lebanese-Palestinian border and strategic, security, and military bases within occupied Palestine. Various types of missiles, including precision-guided ones used for the first time, are employed. - Since the start of 'The Formidable in Might' battle on September 17, 2024, the missile force has conducted over 1,020 missile strikes, 125 of which occurred in the past week alone. - On November 6, 2024, for the first time, the missile force launched the Fateh 110 missile, striking the Tzrifin base located 130 km from the closest point to the Lebanese-Palestinian border. Air Force: - The Resistance’s air force continues targeting enemy military sites, bases, and gatherings of enemy officers and soldiers, straining all levels of the 'Israeli' air defense system and the 'Israeli' air force, which is deploying both fighter jets and helicopters. This has led to a state of exhaustion and incapacity among 'Israeli' military branches. - Cameras operated by frightened settlers - prompted by ongoing alarms in all settlements and cities since our drones breached the border - document repeated 'Israeli' failures to down Resistance drones, which reach their targets with precision, causing losses in the 'Israeli' army ranks. - Since the start of Al-Aqsa Flood Battle until November 12, 2024, the Resistance’s air force has conducted more than 315 operations, deploying over 1,000 drones of varying sizes and capabilities, including 105 operations that have been conducted with more than 300 drones since the beginning of 'The Formidable in Might' battle on September 17, 2024. • According to the statement, the cumulative toll of the enemy’s losses observed by the Islamic Resistance fighters since the enemy began its so-called 'ground maneuver in southern Lebanon' on October 1, 2024, includes: - Over 100 killed and 1,000 wounded among 'Israeli' army officers and soldiers. - Destruction of 43 Merkava tanks, eight military bulldozers, two Hummer vehicles, two armored personnel carriers, and two troop carriers. - Downing of four 'Hermes 450' drones and two 'Hermes 900' drones. It is noted that these figures do not include enemy losses in military bases, installations, settlements, and occupied cities. The Islamic Resistance Operations Room affirmed, in the statement, the following: - The decision by the 'Israeli' army leadership to move to the second phase of its 'ground maneuver' in southern Lebanon will lead only to more losses and failures; our fighters are ready. - The Resistance has taken all defensive measures to engage in a prolonged battle, preventing the enemy from achieving its goals, and is committed to defending the freedom, sovereignty, and dignity of its people. The frontlines in all sectors are fully equipped with personnel and resources across various military specialties. - Despite enemy claims of control over the border villages, our fighters have continued to conduct missile strikes from the Lebanese-Palestinian border into occupied territory, surprising the enemy with direct engagements behind its lines. - The Khaibar operations series continues at a high pace. Despite the enemy’s intense intelligence and aerial campaigns, it cannot prevent these operations from reaching their military objectives and inflicting confirmed damage, forcing hundreds of thousands of settlers into shelters with each missile and drone launch.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2264803	2024-11-12T13:28:58-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-05112750017314469268.jpg
Yemeni Armed Forces Attack American Aircraft Carrier, Two Destroy...	In retaliation to the American-British aggression against Yemen and in continuation of supporting the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples, the missile, UAV forces of the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out two specific military operations. In a statement read by the military spokesman, General Yahya Sarea, the Yemeni Armed Forces detailed the attacks and their outcomes. The first operation targeted the American aircraft carrier (Abraham) located in the Arabian Sea with a number of cruise missiles and drones while the American enemy was preparing to carry out hostile operations targeting our country, Sarea said. The operation has successfully achieved its objectives, and led to thwarting the operation that the American enemy was preparing against our country, he added. 'The other operation targeted two American destroyers in the Red Sea with a number of ballistic missiles and drones. The operation has successfully achieved its objectives.' The two operations took eight hours in a row, Sarea affirmed. Accordingly, the Yemeni Armed Forces hold the American and British enemy responsible for turning the Red Sea region into a zone of military tension and its repercussions on maritime navigation, according to the statement. 'Launching an aggression against Yemen within the American-British defensive actions of the Israeli enemy by the American warships will only push the Yemeni Armed Forces to further use their legitimate right to defend, confront and strike all hostile threats in the Red and Arab Seas and in any other region that Yemeni weapons reach.' The operations of the Yemeni Armed Forces will not stop until the aggression on Gaza is stopped, the siege is lifted and the aggression on Lebanon is stopped, the statement concluded. بيان القوات المسلحة اليمنيةبشأن تنفيذ عمليتين عسكريتين أولاهمااستهدفت حاملة الطائرات الأمريكية(إبراهام) في البحر العربي بعدد من الصواريخ المجنحةوالطائرات المسيرة،والأخرى استهدفت مدمرتين أمريكيتين في البحرالأحمربعدد من الصواريخ الباليستيةوالطائرات المسيرة. pic.twitter.com/WqnepzykiY — العميد يحيى سريع (@army21ye) November 12, 2024	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2264495	2024-11-12T08:51:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/04/manar-09219370016189056621.jpg

Speaker Berri: No Solution at Lebanon’s Expense, Battlefield Has ...	Lebanese Speaker Nabih Berri affirmed on Tuesday that no settlement will be at the expense of Lebanon, as he reiterated that the battlefield has the final say. In remarks to Lebanese newspaper Al-Jumhouriya, Speaker Berri said that 'Lebanon’s stance is clear: Ceasefire and implementation of UN Resolution 1701.' 'Any sane person can believe that we would agree to a settlement that serves the interests of ‘Israel’ at the expense of Lebanon and its sovereignty?' the Lebanese speaker wondered. 'Last September, France put forward an initiative that was supported by the UA and signed by a large group of countries. It was like a joint call to end the war. All parties responded to this call, except for ‘Israel’, which alone did not commit and blew up these efforts,' Speaker Berri told the Lebanese paper. 'That call is now behind us and we won’t return to. What is required now is a ceasefire and the full implementation of UN Resolution 1701. This is what we agreed upon with US envoy Amos Hochstein.' US envoy Amos Hochstein and Lebanese Speaker Nabih Berri in Beirut (October 21, 2024). On the other hand, the Lebanese speaker noted that the Israeli forces haven’t managed to seize control of any of the Lebanese border towns, stressing: 'The battlefield has the final say.' Earlier last week, Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem said that Speaker Berri has been responsible for talks aimed at ending the Israeli aggression, describing Berri’s efforts as the political resistance. The newly elected Hezbollah S.G. stressed in a televised speech that there is no room for any solution that disregards Lebanon’s sovereignty.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2264209	2024-11-12T04:45:18-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/03/manar-08269500016170111069.jpg

Hezbollah on Martyr’s Day: 100K Fighters to Avenge Sayyed Nasrall...	Head of Hezbollah Media Relation Department Hajj Mohammad Afifi held on Monday a press conference at Sayyed Al-Shuhada Complex in Ruweis, Beirut's Dahiyeh, on the occasion of the Resistance Group's Martyr Day which falls every November 11. Afif recalled how every year the former Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah attends the Complex in order to address the eager crowds on martyrdom and narrate the great stories of the martyrs. This year the scene is different, and Sayyed Nasrallah has been martyred, yet still leading the battle of the 'Formidable in Might', Afif stressed. Hezbollah designates November 11 as Martyr’s Day, a solemn occasion commemorating the sacrifice of all martyrs and especially Ahmad Kassir, who valiantly orchestrated a pivotal operation against the Israeli military command in Tyre back in 1982, reshaping the course of history Marking the anniversary of Martyr Kassir this year is done by achieving victory in the battle field, Afif stressed. Afif stressed that valiant fighters of Hezbollah are eager to meet the enemy and avenge the martyrdom of their master, adding that the Resistance fight will determine the fate of the nation and the entire Middle East. Afif added that around 65 thousand Israeli soldiers have failed to control any of the Lebanese border villages after 45 days of fierce clashes with Hezbollah fighters. Hezbollah has the Husseini will to fight till martyrdom, enough time till the advent of the winter season when it will submerge the Zionist tanks in the Lebanese mud, and the land which it knows well and where the Resistance fighters can perform free movements and maneuvers. Afif noted that the air force supremacy cannot grant the enemy victory, adding that, if the Israeli occupation forces fail to control the ground, Tel Aviv will not be able to impose its terms in politics. 'Along with more 'home' front cracks, there will be a turning point which will prove again that 'Israel' is weaker than a spider web.' Afif maintained that Hezbollah has enough weapons, equipment and supplies to engage in a long battle, adding that the Resistance use of heavy and precision missile barrages, including Fateh-110, answers the Zionist claims about the deficiency of Hezbollah rocket stockpiles. Hezbollah official underlined the firm ties between Hezbollah and the Lebanese Army, recalling the martyrdom of martyr Sayyed Hadi Nasrallah along with the Army officer Jawad Azar in addition to the martyrdom of the army officer Mohammad Farhat in the border village of Aitaroun as well as his funeral in Zgharta which turned to be a national wedding. This reflects the real role of the army in protecting Lebanon, Afif affirmed. Some Lebanese parties who fought the Army in the civil war allege now to defending the army by opening the political fire at the Resistance raising a normal question about the Israeli landing operation in Batroun, Afif said, emphasizing that those will fail to strike the relation between Hezbollah and the Resistance. Afif highlighted the malicious pro-Israeli propaganda against the Resistance and its social milieu, adding that it witnessed a come-back after Hezbollah restored its power. The Israeli aggression dates back to the thirties of the past century and has started before the emergence of Hezbollah, according to Afif who wondered about the intentions behind this reality distortion. Afif indicated that Hezbollah acknowledges the high cost of the resistance against the occupation and aggression, asking about the alternative choice and maintaining that patience will certainly lead to victory. Afif underscored that the battlefield was portrayed by Maariv which said that 50K Zionist soldiers have failed to occupy any Lebanese village. Hezbollah official praised Amsterdam protests against the Zionist hooligans, adding that, despite the governmental complicity in the West, the public can highlight Israeli's isolation. After the press conference, Afif led the reporters in a tour to inspect the massive destruction caused by the barbaric Zionist aggression on Beirut's Dahiyeh.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2263472	2024-11-11T10:05:01-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-02866230017313482725.jpeg

Iraqi Resistance Unleashes 6 Drone Strikes on Occupied Israeli Ta...	The Islamic Resistance in Iraq launched a series of six drone strikes targeting strategic sites in the occupied territories on Monday. This latest round of attacks comes as part of the group's ongoing efforts to support the people of Palestine and Lebanon and resist the Israeli occupation. According to statements from the Islamic Resistance, the first operation involved a drone strike on a vital target in the southern region of the occupied territories. This was followed by two more strikes against significant locations in the north, marking a successive operation in that area. Later, a fourth drone strike was launched against a vital target in southern occupied Palestine, the second such attack in that region since midnight. 🔻مشاهد من اطلاق المقاومة الاسلامية في العراق لطيران مسير باتجاه هدف حيوي في شمال الاراضي المحتلة. بتاريخ ١١-١١-٢٠٢٤ pic.twitter.com/vFcFfF1fpK — قناة المنار (@TVManar1) November 11, 2024 On Monday morning, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq announced that its fighters had carried out two additional operations, using drones to strike two separate vital targets in northern occupied Palestine.

The Resistance has emphasized its commitment to continuing and intensifying these operations to strike at enemy strongholds. This latest wave of drone strikes follows a previous announcement by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq on November 6, when its fighters launched three separate drone strikes targeting an Israeli military site in northern occupied Palestine.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2263296	2024-11-11T04:15:21-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-021635200172940795210.png
Israeli Settlers in Northern ‘Israel’ Voice Doubts over Security ...	Israeli settlers in northern occupied territories are expressing deep concern and skepticism toward their government and military’s assurances about returning to their homes, as resistance rocket fire continues to strike the area. Many settlers are questioning the future of settlement in northern ‘Israel’, warning of the war’s potential long-term impact on the region. Despite the Israeli army's expanded operations against Lebanon, settlers in the north remain unconvinced. The continuing rocket fire and lack of 'apparent safety' have left many pessimistic about returning, especially as Hezbollah maintains a fortified presence in the Galilee, creating uncertainty about the future. 'It is said that many will not return to the north; a lot of the displaced have moved elsewhere because we feel isolated. There’s nothing here—no shops, no infrastructure. We travel to Nahariya weekly for necessities. There’s little to encourage people to build a life here,' said Zohar Levi, a resident of Netu’a. Another settler, who preferred anonymity, Israeli media said, highlighted the dangers faced by children in the region: 'Why would I expose my children to such danger? I grew up like this, with my father killed in Lebanon and the constant threat of rockets. I don’t want my children to live this way.' ⚡️JUST IN: Haifa is turning into a ghost town, and the Israeli army radio reports that more than a million settlers ran to shelters after Hezbollah launched a rocket at Haifa and the north, just a short while ago. pic.twitter.com/x2QQ9jBmrl — Suppressed News. (@SuppressedNws) September 29, 2024 Benny Cohen, a soldier from Netu’a, expressed resistance to evacuation: 'I don’t believe in leaving. If we abandon our homes, it signals the end of the Zionist project. We must stay here, even under threat, to ensure the future of settlements.' Ron Avman, a former IOF commander, echoed the loss of confidence: 'Before October 7, parents in the north trusted the IDF for protection. Now, that trust is broken. If we don’t investigate this thoroughly and learn, we may never rebuild it.' Local northern authorities have rejected military calls for settlers to return, deeming them irresponsible and endangering lives. Ongoing attacks from Hezbollah underscore the fragility of Israeli assurances, casting doubt on any notion of peace and security in the region, Israeli media reported. Resistance Strengthens Its Grip on Northern Occupied Territories Islamic Resistance forces continue their attacks, dispelling Israeli leaders' promises to settlers about returning safely. Statements by Israeli officials paint a picture of stability, but field realities suggest otherwise, as the Resistance exerts control over the northern border. IOF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi recently suggested a gradual return of residents in the coming months, yet these remain 'pipe dreams' given the Resistance’s determination to disrupt them. In northern occupied territories, many settlers are hesitant to return, citing the continuous threat of rocket fire and lack of reliable protection. Halevi’s meetings with local leaders failed to assuage fears or encourage resettlement, as heavy rocket barrages persist. Just yesterday, resistance fire rained on Haifa Bay and Sharon, with around seventy missiles and numerous drones targeting strategic locations despite Israeli airstrikes. Israeli Media Highlights Security Concerns in the North Israeli news channel correspondent Uria Keshet noted that Hezbollah has managed to maintain its attacks despite intensified Israeli ground and air operations. Meanwhile, Channel 13 military correspondent Or Heller reported that while the ground operation is nearing its end, a strategic deadlock remains. Israeli forces are hesitant to conclude their ground operation without political progress, aware that northern residents are unlikely to return without robust security guarantees. The ongoing resistance operations cast doubt on Israel’s efforts to secure its northern regions. With the possibility of a ceasefire being discussed, Israeli leaders are insisting on the right to intervene, signaling an uncertain path ahead for northern settlements.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2262834	2024-11-10T11:57:51-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/11/manar-08607740016993491181.jpg

A Syrian military source confirmed that these attacks resulted in injuries to several soldiers and caused material damage. Explosions were heard near the al-Safira area southeast of Aleppo, where multiple sites were targeted. The Syrian Foreign Ministry condemned the repeated Israeli attacks, asserting that the continued targeting of civilian areas by the Israeli Occupation Forces reflects a lack of serious international efforts to curb such aggression. The ministry renewed its call for the United Nations to take immediate action to halt these assaults and hold those responsible to account.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2262779	2024-11-10T09:58:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-00847950017312614597.jpg
Israeli Occupation Forces Carry Out More Massacres in Northern Ga...	On the 401st day of Israel’s aggression against Gaza, it has become clear that the enemy is committing acts of extermination against the people of the north, witnessed by the world. Even Israeli media has admitted this, with Haaretz reporting that the commander of the 162nd division confirmed executing 'ethnic cleansing' operations in northern Gaza, preventing Palestinians from returning under orders from the military and political leadership. For 37 days, nothing has been spared from destruction—people, homes, and even animals—amid the use of internationally banned weapons. In this context, Hamas' Al-Qassam Brigades announced on Sunday that its fighters targeted and killed a 15-soldier Israeli patrol with RPGs and light weapons west of Sheikh Zayed, in northern Gaza. The brigades also hit two Israeli military vehicles with 'Yassin 105' and 'Tandem' rockets and destroyed a bulldozer near the Al-Qassam mosque in Jabaliya camp.

A young man was martyred in the ongoing Israeli shelling of the camp. Additionally, five Palestinians were martyred and others injured in an Israeli airstrike on a house near Al-Salam Mosque in the Sabra neighborhood, south of Gaza City. Rescue operations are still underway for missing persons. On the other hand, Israeli warboats fired several shells towards the shores of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip.

Hamas Urges Arab Leaders to Act Against Gaza Genocide Hamas condemned the Alloush family massacre in Jabalia as further proof of Israeli enemy's ethnic cleansing efforts against the besieged population in northern Gaza. The group called on Arab and Islamic leaders to take a firm stance, demanding urgent international intervention to halt the genocide and hold Israeli war criminals accountable. Popular Front: Jabalia Massacre a Stain on Arab Regimes The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced the Jabalia massacre as a shameful mark on Arab governments and the international community. It accused the US of playing a central role in the ongoing genocide, as the global silence and complicity continue. Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor Warns of Imminent Hunger Crisis The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor demanded that the famine be recognized officially, emphasizing that 'Israel' continues to use starvation as a weapon. The group noted that 'more than 50 days have passed since the occupation blocked aid to the besieged people in the north,' adding that 'tens of thousands of Palestinians in the north are facing the imminent threat of death by hunger.' The Monitor stressed that 'the world bears responsibility for the hunger crisis created by the occupation in Gaza,' warning that 'the famine crisis in Gaza has reached a point of no return.' This comes as Israeli Channel 11 reported that Netanyahu’s government is concerned that a potential famine declaration by the World Health Organization could lead to sanctions on 'Israel' and an arms export ban.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2262735	2024-11-10T09:11:38-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-03554820017312583591.png

Israel’s Attorney General Gives Authority to Investigate Netanyah...	Israeli Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara permitted authorities to investigate Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office for the leak of secret security documents from his office, local media said Friday. The security scandal comes as Netanyahu's government is facing a series of political and security crises, including the dismissal of defense chief Yoav Gallant, which has triggered significant opposition, as well as Israel’s attacks against the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. The Maariv newspaper said the green light by Baharav-Miara means that investigating authorities are also allowed to investigate Netanyahu. If the investigation finds involvement by Netanyahu in any security-related cases, investigators must halt the probe until they obtain permission again to continue from the Attorney General, according to Israeli legal procedures. Netanyahu's office is yet to comment on the report by Maariv. Israeli domestic security agency, Shin Bet, announced the arrest Sunday of four people, including a spokesperson for Netanyahu, concerning security documents leaks related to the war on Gaza. The Haaretz newspaper also published Sunday details of a scandal involving Netanyahu that is related to the appointment of a spokesperson who took part in 'sensitive security sessions.' An aide to Netanyahu is one of several suspects arrested for an alleged security breach that involved leaking top secret intelligence, Israeli officials said. 'Israel' has continued a devastating offensive on Gaza since an attack by the Palestinian resistance group, Hamas, on Oct. 7, 2023. The ensuing Israeli war has killed more than 43,500 people and rendered the enclave almost uninhabitable.

In a televised interview, MP Fadlallah added that the Islamic Resistance command identifies the devises the military plans according to which the attacks in the Zionist enemy are decided. MP Fadlallah indicated that Hezbollah has never bet on the US administration to halt the aggression, adding that Washington deals with the Lebanese file in the same manner it has resorted to in Gaza. If the US administration wants a ceasefire, Hezbollah is ready for that, according to MP Fadlallah, who maintained that Hezbollah relies solely on the outcomes of the battlefield to stop the aggression. Hezbollah lawmaker emphasized that the Israeli enemy can never gain in politics what it is losing in the battlefield despite all the sacrifices, adding that the Zionist target of eradicating the resistance is impossible. MP Fadlallah stressed that, regarding the ground battle, the Israeli enemy can neither advance, nor protect the positions it entered, reassuring the Resistance supporters that the required outcome will be obtained and calling on them to show more patience. Delusional are those who think they can change the political formula in Lebanon, MP Fadlallah confirmed.

IRGC: Defeat of ‘Israel’ is Imminent and Close to Becoming a Real...	In a statement to Iranian media, the chief commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) said that Iran's recent retaliatory operation against ‘Israel’ showcased only a small fraction of the country's formidable military power. Speaking to a gathering of IRGC public relations officials and members of the press in the city of Mashhad, Major General Hossein Salami emphasized the strength of the 'Axis of Resistance' against Israel and its Western backers. The chief commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps says that Iran’s recent retaliatory operation against the Israeli regime exhibited only a small fraction of the country’s power. pic.twitter.com/xOSsyiQpfF — Mehr News Agency (@MehrnewsCom) November 8, 2024 Referring to the IRGC's 'Operation True Promise II' missile strikes on October 1, Salami declared that 'the potential defeat of the Zionist regime is very close to becoming a reality.' He said the operation not only demonstrated Iran's overwhelming missile capabilities, but also its unwavering support for the Palestinian resistance, even in the face of adversity. The strikes were in retaliation for Israel's assassinations of senior Hamas and Hezbollah leaders. 'In the course of Operation True Promise II, we even attacked the Zionists' base at Netzarim in the heart of Gaza,' Salami said, emphasizing that all these territories belong to the Muslim world. The IRGC chief warned that attacks on Israeli ports and disruption of the Mediterranean Sea could cripple the Israeli economy, which he said is heavily dependent on maritime trade. He claimed the U.S. has been unable to provide sufficient support to prop up its 'vassal regime' in Israel, whose military is now a 'drained force.' Salami boasted that Iran has only utilized a small portion of its military capacities, while its enemies have exhausted theirs. He suggested the results of the recent U.S. presidential election showed that the Palestinian resistance has the power to influence American politics, as voters rejected candidates who 'armed the Zionists' killing machine.' The IRGC commander concluded that the new US administration's only option is to scale down aid to ‘Israel’, as any expansion of the conflict will further erode America's credibility and interests.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2260975	2024-11-08T05:26:44-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/04/manar-06334020017123167677.jpg

Sayyed Houthi: Neither Trump, Nor Any World Criminal Can Prevent ...	Head of Yemen's Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi stressed Thursday that the Yemeni attacks on the US-UK-Zionist vessels in addition to the Israeli targets in Occupied Palestine would continue despite the attempts to disguise the possession of the ships. In a televised speech, Sayyed Houthi underscored that this decision is resolute regardless of the results of the US elections, adding that some Arab regimes are raising their people fears of the US President-elect Donald Trump. 'We, in Yemen, had an experience with Trump, and he failed to impose his terms on Iran, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine. Trump only managed to reap billions of dollars from the rich Arab states.' All the US presidents have just served the Israeli interests, recalling the failure of the 'deal of the century'. Yemen insists on supporting the Palestinian people regardless of any military escalation against it, Houthi said, adding that the best choice for the US administration is to end the Zionist wars on Lebanon and Gaza, while aggression and sedition are futile. Sayyed Houthi also underlined the crisis plaguing the Zionist entity manifested by the economic deterioration, dismissal of the defense minister, and the military recruitment after the loss of thousands of soldiers and officers in the battles. Houthi highlighted Hezbollah's remarkable support for Gaza, adding that the Israelis were surprised by Hezbollah great capabilities in the ground battle. The Yemeni leader reiterated that the former Secretary General of Hezbollah Martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah is a rare and historical figure, adding that, on His Arbaeen, the Islamic Resistance carried out a major operation against Tel Aviv. Houthi also stressed that the operations carried out by the Iraqi resistance groups would continue despite all the media and political pressure aimed at stopping them. Sayyed Houthi also maintained that the reluctance of the Arabs and Muslims in supporting Gaza reflects the moral and humanitarian deterioration, stressing that the West would respect the Umma if it assumed its responsibilities.

Leader Hails Sayyed Nasrallah for Growing Hezbollah Too Strong	The Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, has attributed Hezbollah's extraordinary transformation from a small group of fighters into a formidable organization to the bravery, tactics, patience, and faith of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Khamenei hailed the late Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah for his bravery and wisdom to make the movement grow too powerful. — Mehr News Agency (@MehrnewsCom) November 7, 2024 Imam Khamenei praised Nasrallah's exceptional leadership, noting that despite the enemy's material and propaganda weapons, Hezbollah has achieved remarkable evolution, forcing the 'enemy to retreat and defeat it.' Dismissing rumors of Hezbollah's weakening after the martyrdom of its leaders, Khamenei asserted that the resistance group remains strong and continues its fight. The Leader also paid tribute to other resistance martyrs, including Hezbollah Head of Executive Council Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, and Abbas Nilforoushan, stating that they have bestowed upon Islam dignity, honor, strength, and power. 'During these many years and nearly 40 years, Hezbollah once forced the Zionist regime to retreat from Beirut, once from Saida, once from the city of Tyre, and once from southern Lebanon and entirely from the cities, villages and highlands of Lebanon, which means its capability has increased over time,' the Leader said. Imam Khamenei also praised Hamas, saying the Palestinian resistance group's continued fight against Israel indicates the regime has been defeated. 'The Zionist regime intended to eliminate Hamas but has been unable to do so after massacring so many people, and showed their ugly face to the whole world, and proved their wickedness to everyone. 'They think they have martyred Hamas and resistance leaders, and that Hamas is finished but Hamas is still fighting and resisting. This means the failure of the Zionist regime,' the Leader added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2259699	2024-11-07T06:23:15-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-09081710017309893906.jpg

Islamic Resistance Operations Room Vows Commitment to Path of loy...	The Islamic Resistance fighters continued their stand against the 'Israeli' aggression on Lebanon, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy army in both equipment and personnel, from officers to soldiers, along the front lines and into the depths of occupied Palestine, according to a statement issued by the Islamic Resistance Operations Room regarding the field developments in the 'The Formidable in Might' battle. The statement detailed the achievements, made by the Resistance fighters repelling the ground offensive of the Zionist enemy against South Lebanon border villages, as well as the long-range missile and drone attacks on the Zionist occupation's military camps, settlements and cities, as follows. 1- Ground Engagements: • On 28-10-2024, the 'Israeli' enemy army initiated a large-scale advancement towards the town of Al-Khiam, with extensive personnel and vehicles, under heavy air cover over the surrounding area. Enemy forces positioned themselves on forward posts in Tel Nahas, Al-Hamames, and Al-Majidiya Plain. In line with pre-established defense plans and after closely monitoring potential advancement routes, the Islamic Resistance fighters implemented a defensive fire strategy, anchored in synchronized and concentrated rocket and artillery strikes. More than 70 targeting operations were executed over three consecutive days (50 of them on the town's southern and eastern edges), resulting in the destruction of four tanks with guided missiles, killing and injuring their crews. A soldier position in Al-Metula settlement was targeted with a guided missile, causing fatalities and injuries, in addition to targeting a security group in Tel Nahas. The Military Media showcased footage documenting the hit. The most significant of these operations was the accurate rocket barrage that struck large gatherings of enemy soldiers and vehicles in the Wadi Al-Asafir area, southeast of the town, using high-precision missiles with warheads weighing 250 kg of high-explosives. The massive explosions and numerous casualties triggered panic and disorder among the enemy ranks. In addition to targeting enemy movements within Lebanese territory, strategic strikes were conducted in the rear areas supporting the enemy assault, specifically: - Targeting the enemy's security forces in Al-Metula and surrounding orchards with 11 concentrated rocket barrages and artillery shells, resulting in confirmed hits. - Striking a training camp, fire bases, and command centers in Ayelet HaShahar, rocket fire bases in Yesud HaMa'ala, an armored gathering in Sha'al, and command centers in Shamir with 23 rocket barrages. - On the night of Thursday, 31-10-2024, the 'Israeli' forces were forced to retreat beyond the borders, evacuating their dead and wounded via helicopters and deploying special vehicles to extract the destroyed tanks. • During an attempted 'Israeli' advancement towards the village of Houla on Saturday, our fighters detected a full battalion-sized convoy of 40 military vehicles (including tanks, armored carriers, and troop transports) led by two bulldozers aimed at clearing paths for advancing into the town center. Upon reaching our fighters' range, the bulldozers were struck by two Kornet anti-armor missiles, destroying them and resulting in casualties. Under heavy 'Israeli' artillery cover, the convoy retreated to the town's eastern border. Once the convoy regrouped, it was struck by three rocket barrages at five-minute intervals with over 60 rockets, achieving the intended results. • Due to repeated and severe strikes by the Resistance, 'Israeli' forces were unable to establish stable positions within the border villages, prompting a withdrawal to positions behind the borders. These villages, such as Aita al-Shaab, Ramiya, Meiss Al-Jabal, Blida, and Al-Khiam, are now subject to extensive sweeping operations from border sites, artillery bases, and airstrikes.  Meanwhile, ongoing confrontations are being managed in response to persistent 'Israeli' attempts to encircle the town of Naqoura in the western sector, as well as a thwarted infiltration attempt in the Wazzani area in the eastern sector, which was targeted with a rocket barrage that forced the enemy to withdraw.  2. Khaibar Operations Series: - Despite intense surveillance and continuous activity by the 'Israeli' Air Force, the Resistance has intensified its precise and deliberate strikes against strategic 'Israeli' centers, facilities, and bases as part of the 'Khaibar' operations series, reaching a depth of up to 145 km within occupied Palestine using advanced missiles and drones. - These focused and calculated strikes are executed with a clear plan, complete control over the field, and a measured evaluation of the front’s developments. - Since the launch of the 'Khaibar' series on 01-10-2024, 56 operations have been carried out, with 18 of them occurring in the past week. - These operations have achieved military objectives, and over 2 million settlers across an area of more than 5,000 km², reaching up to 145 km inside occupied Palestine, have been repeatedly forced into shelters, halting education, work, and air traffic with each operation. 3. The Islamic Resistance Operations Room emphasized the following: - The 'Khaibar' operations series continues to escalate with a clear vision and management that ensures effective targeting as specified by the Resistance leadership. - Settlers who have been warned to evacuate their settlements are advised not to return, as these areas have become military targets, housing command centers, barracks, factories, artillery stations, rocket bases, and logistical service stations for forces attacking Lebanese lands. - The only achievement by the 'Israeli' army in what it calls the 'ground maneuver' is the destruction of civilian homes, infrastructure, and the leveling of agricultural lands in border towns. - Recent weeks have proven that the Resistance’s formations have successfully organized their structures at various levels, as evidenced by the increased frequency of missile and assault drone launches at various targets within the temporary entity, reaching as far as Tel Aviv. - Our fighters on the southern frontline have, through their precise and repeated strikes and high capacity to counter the enemy’s advances and destroy their tanks and vehicles, forced the 'Israeli' enemy forces to remain restricted to the frontline villages, preventing them from advancing toward the second-tier villages or approaching the Litani River. On the fortieth commemoration of our most revered and honored martyr, His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, may his pure spirit be blessed, the Islamic Resistance affirms its steadfast commitment to the blood of its martyrs. It remains resolute in achieving the objectives for which they sacrificed, foremost among them the dignity of its resilient people, and the freedom and sovereignty of its nation. The Resistance pledges to its Secretary-General, His Eminence Sheikh Naim Qassem, may Allah preserve him, to remain unwavering on the path of loyalty until victory is achieved by Allah's permission. On Martyr Sayyed Nasrallah’s Arbaeen, the Islamic Resistance conspicuously showed its capability and readiness to defend Lebanon against the barbaric Zionist war, bombarding Tel Aviv with waves of heavy rockets and striking Israeli military bases and gatherings in the occupied North and Golan.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2259215	2024-11-06T14:19:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-08559660017297117333.jpg

In a televised speech via Al-Manar, the second since his election as a secretary general, Sheikh Qassem vowed that Hezbollah will emerge victorious in the end of the war, noting that there is no place across the Zionist entity that Hezbollah can’t reach.

Israeli PM Netanyahu Fires Defense Minister Gallant; Opposition, ...	Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he has fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who is set to be replaced by Israel Katz, Israel's foreign minister, Haaretz reported. In a statement, Netanyahu stated that while there had been productive cooperation in the early months of the war, significant differences in strategy had emerged between him and Gallant in recent months. 'At a time of war, full trust between the prime minister and the defense minister is critical,' Netanyahu said. 'Unfortunately, this trust has eroded, and attempts to bridge the gaps have failed.' He noted that the differences were not only made public in an 'unacceptable manner' but had also reached Israel's enemies, who had 'derived great benefit' from the situation. Netanyahu announced that Israel Katz, a veteran politician and former minister of foreign affairs, finance, and intelligence, would replace Gallant as defense minister. Describing Katz as a 'bulldozer' with a combination of 'responsibility and quiet determination,' Netanyahu praised his extensive experience and leadership, saying Katz was well-equipped to lead the defense effort during this critical period. Gideon Sa'ar, who was a minister without a portfolio, will assume the role of foreign minister, it added. The Israeli media mentioned that Netanyahu informed Gallant that he would sack him 10 minutes before issuing the decision, adding that the meeting between the two Zionist officials lasted only for three minutes. Israeli media mentioned that, following the dismissal of 'Defense Minister' [War Minister] Yoav Gallant, calls were made to take to the streets as of 9:00 pm. The headquarters of the families of 'Israeli' captives in the Gaza Strip considered that the dismissal of the 'Defense Minister' [War Minister] is a direct continuation of efforts to sabotage the captive exchange deal. Head of the Israeli opposition, Yair Lapid, said that Gallant dismissal endangers entire 'Israel' for the sake of shameful political leverage. Former 'Israeli' War Minister 'Avigdor Lieberman' said that, if the Defense Minister can be replaced in the midst of a war, then it is also possible to replace a Prime Minister who has failed in his duties and neglected 'the country’s' security, and certainly to establish a governmental investigative committee. Yair Golan, who heads Israel's new center-left party The Democrats, took to X to urge Israelis to take to the streets in protest. In late March, thousands protested spontaneously against Netanyahu's decision to fire Gallant, which was ultimately rescinded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2257147	2024-11-05T11:24:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-082230800173083465010.png

What to Know About US Knife-Edge Presidential Race: Harris or Tru...	Millions of voters across the United States gear up to cast their ballots on Tuesday as Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump go head-to-head in a race that remains too close to call. With the country stretching across six time zones, Election Day is a massive undertaking – and voting will begin as early as 5am EST (10:00 GMT) and go as late as 1am (06:00 GMT) on Wednesday. Polls show Harris, 60, who is the current vice-president and Trump, 78, who is a former president, running neck and neck nationally and in the battleground states or the 'swing states' (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin). More than 78 million voters have already cast ballots, according to Election Lab at the University of Florida. Voters will also elect 34 US senators (out of 100) and all 435 members for the US House of Representatives, among other posts that are up for grabs. Final Calls In the final days of their campaigns, both hopefuls were flooding social media sites, TV and radio stations with a last round of campaign ads, and racing to knock on doors and make calls. Harris ended her campaign in Philadelphia, where she doubled down on the economy, and outlined her plan to 'build an economy where we bring down the cost of living'. Harris speaks during a final rally in Pennsylvania (November 4, 2024). Among the measures she intends to implement, she listed a ban on corporate price gouging on groceries; cutting taxes for workers, middle-class families and small businesses; and lowering healthcare costs, including the cost of home care for seniors. Trump predicted the 'greatest victory' in his closing argument in Michigan. He linked immigration to a high crime rate, blending claims about voter fraud with warnings about migrants committing crimes and promises to revitalize the United States. 'Over the past four years, Americans have suffered one catastrophic failure, betrayal and humiliation after another,' Trump said. Trump speaks during his final campaign rally at Michigan (November 5, 2024). Positions on Foreign Policy The presidential candidates diverge on most of the policies related to key issues including economy, immigration, foreign policy, democracy, abortion and many others. Harris and Trump offer two starkly different visions for the US’ foreign policy. The Democratic candidate has fully aligned herself with the Biden administration’s response to the Russia-Ukraine war, while the republican candidate vowed to 'fundamentally re-evaluate' the country’s approach on the US aid to Ukraine and claimed that he will end the nearly three-year war on his first day in office On the situation in Palestine and Lebanon, or what the US calls the 'Middle East crisis', Harris vowed to back the Zionist entity’s so-called 'right to defend itself', and ensure ‘Israel’ has the ability to do so, rejecting the arms embargo. She also pledged to work to end the war in Gaza and to 'allow Palestinians to realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.'

Nothing. pic.twitter.com/kvnp6I4fEh — Globe Eye News (@GlobeEyeNews) November 1, 2024 When is Election Result Expected? In some presidential elections the victor has been named late on election night, or early the next morning. However, the Presidential hopefuls are running neck and neck in this year’s race, meaning that in many states media outlets may wait longer before projecting who has won. Narrow victories could also mean recounts. In the key swing state of Pennsylvania, for example, a state-wide recount would be required if there’s a half-percentage-point difference between the votes cast for the winner and loser. In 2020, the margin was just over 1.1 percentage points. Legal challenges are also possible. More than 100 pre-election lawsuits have already been filed, including challenges to voter eligibility and voter roll management, by Republicans.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2256685	2024-11-05T03:30:26-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-04635410017308061888.jpg

'This assault is viewed as an extension of widespread settler crimes across the West Bank, including occupied Jerusalem, and as a replication of the genocide and forced displacement campaign endured by the Palestinian people in Gaza, which has persisted unabated for 395 days,' it said.

‘Israel’ Officially Terminates UNRWA Work, Informs UN	Israeli Foreign Ministry on Monday officially has informed the United Nations that the Zionist entity is withdrawing from the 1967 agreement recognizing the Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, a new proof that the occupation regime takes no account of the international bodies run by the United Nations. Foreign Ministry Director-General Jacob Blitshtein sent the letter to UN General Assembly President Philemon Yang of Cameroon, informing him of the Israeli move. 'Israel will continue to work with international partners, including other United Nations agencies, to ensure the facilitation of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not undermine Israel’s security. Israel expects the United Nations to contribute to and cooperate in this effort,' the letter read.

The bill takes effect in three months, according to Israeli media. Commenting on the Israeli move, the UN agency said on Monday that the Israeli ban on its operations would lead to the 'collapse' of humanitarian work in the war-torn Gaza Strip. 'If this law is implemented, it would be likely to cause the collapse of the international humanitarian operation in the Gaza Strip - an operation of which UNRWA is the backbone,' Jonathan Fowler, a UNRWA spokesman, told AFP. The Zionist entity has been for months launching a campaign aimed at defaming the UNRWA, by propagating allegations that the international body has links to October 7 attacks. Last January, Carrie Keller-Lynn, who served in the Israeli occupation army, wrote an article claiming alleged connections between UNRWA staff and fighters who took part in October 7 Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. The story prompted many countries to halt funding to the UN agency.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2255849	2024-11-04T04:24:19-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/03/manar-00602030017100139095.jpeg

What’s New in the Ongoing Israeli 42-Day Offensive on Lebanon?	Following over a month of operations in southern Lebanon, Israel’s military offensive has shown limited success, as indicated by recent events in Khiyam, South of Lebanon. On Sunday, Al-Manar correspondent confirmed that the town was completely cleared of Israeli soldiers after a week of intense clashes with Lebanese resistance forces. Amid this military stalemate, Israeli forces have escalated attacks against civilian areas across Lebanon, spanning from southern villages to Baalbek and the Bekaa Valley, as well as the southern suburbs of Beirut. The aerial raids have left dozens dead, hundreds injured, and caused widespread destruction to homes and infrastructure. In the Bekaa region, the Israeli military threatened to strike five buildings within Baalbek and Douris. This threat materialized when Israeli forces launched air raids on Baalbek, hitting Douris near the old municipality building and the Al-Rida Restaurant near the governmental hospital. Additional raids were reported on the outskirts of Mashghara and Labaya in western Bekaa. Baalbek Governmental Hospital’s director, Dr. Abbas Shukr, assured the public that despite damage from nearby airstrikes, the hospital remains fully operational. 'We will replace the shattered glass within 24 hours, and our work continues without obstruction,' he stated. In southern Lebanon, Israeli warplanes carried out intensive airstrikes, targeting areas like Qaq’iyat al-Sanbar and al-Bissariyeh. According to the Ministry of Public Health’s Emergency Operations Center, a raid on Haret Saida resulted in three fatalities and nine injuries. Another airstrike on a house in Joaya killed two and wounded others, who were transferred to Tyre Hospital. Additional strikes hit the outskirts of Al-Bazouriya and Al-Burj Al-Shamali in Tyre District. Reports from local sources detail further casualties in Jabal Al-Batm, where two individuals lost their lives. Additional raids targeted homes in Arabsalim and Ghazieh, Sidon District, leaving one dead and others injured. In Tyre District, attacks continued, including raids on Tyre Park, Qana, and nearby towns, as well as the Burj al-Shamali-al-Bazourieh highway, though no injuries were reported. In al-Bazourieh, a center for the Islamic Health Authority was also struck, prompting a response from Islamic Message Scouts ambulances to assess the scene. In Khiyam, where resistance forces made advances, the International Red Cross and Lebanese Red Cross began evacuating two families, about 20 people, whose home was destroyed in an airstrike last week. At least 20 confirmed dead at the scene of a massacre in the southern Lebanese town of Khiam. Any prior attempt to rescue them was impossible until 3 Nov., as Israel 'refused to grant access.' — مهى 🍉 🇱🇧 🇵🇸🇾🇪 (@Taltool11) November 3, 2024 The Lebanese Red Cross has also started recovering bodies from the rubble in Wata al-Khiam, where 15 Lebanese and one Syrian victim remain.

Horrifying Situation in Northern Gaza on Day 394 of Brutal Israel...	The Israeli genocidal war on Gaza, today in its 394th day, hasn’t spared a polio vaccination center, as the occupation tightens the siege on the strip’s north. The UN announced on Sunday that polio vaccination center and the car of UN aid official involved in this weekend’s vaccination campaign came under Israeli fire despite a promised 'humanitarian pause' in bombardment. Catherine Russell, the executive director of the UN child support and protection agency UNICEF, said: 'At least three children were reportedly injured by another attack in the proximity of a vaccination clinic in Sheikh Radwan, while a polio vaccination campaign was under way.' This has already been a deadly weekend of attacks in North Gaza. Attacks on civilians, including humanitarian workers, and what remains of Gaza’s civilian facilities and infrastructure must stop. My statement👇 — Catherine Russell (@unicefchief) November 2, 2024 She added that the personal car of a UNICEF employee working on the polio vaccine campaign 'came under fire by what we believe to be a quadcopter'. Russel said that in the previous 48-hour period, more than 50 children had been martyred in the Jabalia refugee camp, a focus of Israeli military operations over the past month. 'The attacks on Jabalia, the vaccination clinic and the UNICEF staff member are yet further examples of the grave consequences of the indiscriminate strikes on civilians in the Gaza Strip,' Russell said. Meanwhile, media reports described the situation in northern Gaza Strip as horrifying, with people have been for at least three week left without food, medicine or even clean water, amid heavy bombardment of the area. Palestinian media reported that some people in Beit Lahia and Jabalia were still under rubble, as the Israeli occupation have been preventing health workers from reaching the scene of the attacks. Palestinian Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmoud Basal told Al Jazeera on Sunday that Israeli forces have been preventing medical supplies and their equipment from reaching northern Gaza. 'We call on the world to work to enable the civil defense to reach the northern Gaza Strip,' he said. Also on Sunday, medical sources said that Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed 23 people, 13 in the north and 9 in Khan Younis, since dawn.
