Israeli Occupation Forces Kill Three Palestinians in Northern Wes...	Israeli occupation forces Wednesday evening killed three Palestinians in Al-Far'a refugee camp, south of the occupied West Bank city of Tubas, according to security sources. They said that the occupation forces besieged and targeted a house in the refugee camp, firing missiles and gunfire toward it and killing three Palestinians. They added that the occupation forces were withholding their bodies. Meanwhile, medical sources said that following the withdrawal of Israeli forces, ambulance crews and paramedics entered the house and found body parts scattered along with traces of blood inside. The occupation forces barged their way into the camp to reinforce special forces who sneaked their way earlier into a house and fired ENERGA anti-tank missiles at it. 'Israel' has been launching a massive onslaught on the refugee camp for the 18th consecutive day, conducting house-to-house raids, forcing out the families, ransacking the houses, turning them into outposts, and causing the stock of foodstuff to run out. The enemy forces deliberately ploughed through infrastructure, destroying main water pipelines, leading to a water crisis and causing a power outage in parts of the town and the camp.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2343871	2025-02-19T13:35:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-05150850017400009048.png
Supreme Leader Says Iran’s Definite Policy is to Expand Ties with...	Leader of the Islamic Revolution Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei has said expanding ties with neighboring countries remains the 'definite policy' of the Islamic Republic, as he received Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in Tehran. The Qatari Emir arrived in Tehran earlier in the day on an official visit and sat down for talks with President Masoud Pezeshkian before meeting Ayatollah Khamenei. 'One of the policies announced by the administration of Mr. Pezeshkian is the expansion of ties with neighbors,' Ayatollah Khamenei said during the meeting, which was also attended by President Pezeshkian. He noted that the Pezeshkian administration has already taken good measures to enhance relations with neighboring countries, achieving some level of progress thus far. Ayatollah Khamenei expressed hope that the agreements reached earlier in the day between Iranian and Qatari officials would benefit both countries, enabling them to fulfill their 'neighborly duties' more effectively. In his remarks, the Leader emphasized that Iran considers Qatar a 'friendly and brotherly country,' despite some 'unclear and unresolved' matters, including the issue of frozen Iranian assets. Approximately $6 billion in Iranian funds remain frozen under U.S. sanctions and are currently held in a Qatari bank after being released by South Korea in September 2023. The Leader criticized the United States for obstructing the agreement to return the funds to Iran. 'We know that the U.S. is the main obstacle to the implementation of an agreement that had been reached in this regard,' he said, adding that Iran expects Qatar to resist pressure from Washington and return Iran’s assets. For his part, Qatar’s Emir expressed satisfaction with his meeting with Ayatollah Khamenei and praised the Leader for Iran’s support of the Palestinian people. He acknowledged the ongoing tensions in the West Asia region, saying regional countries should cooperate more to address the current situation. The Emir also referred to the agreements reached between Iran and Qatar, and said the two countries will soon establish a joint commission to increase the volume of bilateral trade. Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian held on Wednesday constructive talks with Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani who arrived in Tehran on a state visit to hold talks with Iranian officials in order to discuss regional issues and deepen bilateral relations between the two neighboring countries.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2343816	2025-02-19T11:19:40-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-057342900173999274110.jpg
Archbishop Hanna: Palestine is Loyal to Martyr Sayyed Nasrallah’s...	Archbishop Atallah Hanna, Archbishop of Sebastia for the Greek Orthodox in occupied Palestine delivered a message in eulogy of the Nation’s Master of Martyrs, Hezbollah Secretary-General His Eminence, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah. 'Dear beloved, in a few days, Lebanon will witness a great and exceptional event—the funeral of His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and the martyrs who were with him. From Al-Quds, we stand in reverence and honor for the sacrifices of His Eminence Sayyed Nasrallah, his companions, and his associates—those who stood with Palestine, defended Palestine, and paid a heavy price for Palestine. We are loyal to these sacrifices; all Palestinians are loyal to the sacrifices of His Eminence and his comrades,' he said. 'As we offer our condolences and send a message of sympathy from the heart of our sacred city, we affirm that we will never forget those who stood with Palestine and defended it in the darkest times and the most difficult circumstances. Today, there is a conspiracy against the Palestinian cause. Our enemies seek to displace our people and liquidate our cause, but Palestinians will not raise the flag of surrender. They remain steadfast in their rights, principles, and convictions. The word 'surrender' does not exist in our Palestinian vocabulary.' 'Dear beloved, we are all one family, one nation, standing against colonial projects that do not target Palestine alone but the entire nation. Our message has always been and will always be that Palestine is the compass. Those whose compass is Palestine are in the right place, and those whose compass is elsewhere are in the wrong place. We call upon them to correct their deviation and realign their compass in the right direction,' Archbishop Hanna added. 'Dear beloved, our message in these times is that we must be united as a nation—Christians, Muslims, and all sects and denominations. They want us to be fragmented and divided, to speak the language of sectarianism, and to be internally divided so that they can pass their projects under the well-known colonial strategy of 'divide and rule.' They seek to fragment us to facilitate their colonial plans that target Palestine and the entire nation.' 'We, Christians and Muslims in this East, will remain one nation. Our compass is Al-Quds, our cause is Palestine, and we must not allow anyone or any entity to advance their schemes aimed at further division and fragmentation. We are one family—this is how we were, and this is how we shall remain,' Archbishop Hanna concluded.

'The latest information that I received literally an hour ago: fighters of the 810th Brigade crossed the border of the Russian Federation and Ukraine and entered the enemy’s territory over the night,' Putin said, responding to reporters’ questions as he visited a drone manufacturing plant in St. Petersburg.

In particular, the Brigade’s fighters participated in the liberation of Mariupol, the repulsion of the Ukrainian army’s counteroffensive in the Zaporozhye Region and conducted operations in the island zone of the Dnieper River in the Kherson Region. As the Ukrainian army launched its attack on the Kursk Region, the Brigade’s units were deployed to its borderline areas where they continue accomplishing their combat objectives. In particular, as reported in early February, forces of the 11th Separate Air Assault Brigade, the 810th Separate Marine Infantry Brigade, the Veterans and Arbat volunteer formations, UAV operators of the Rubicon Center, the 40th Separate Marine Infantry Brigade and the 177th Separate Marine Infantry Regiment participated in repelling eight waves of Ukrainian army attacks. Putin has stated on many occasions that the Russian troops fighting in the Kursk direction are operating efficiently, competently and audaciously.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2343706	2025-02-19T07:41:20-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/02/manar-015138000167639631010.jpg

IRGC Busts Vast Espionage Network Linked to US, ‘Israel’ in North...	The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander of Iran's Mazandaran province has announced that intelligence services from the US, ‘Israel’, and other adversarial countries have been actively trying to infiltrate Iran using foreign nationals and frequent travelers as cover. IRGC provincial commander Brigadier General Siavash Moslemi announced the successful crackdown on Wednesday, stating that the operation not only foiled significant security threats but also prevented potential crises from unfolding. IRGC dismantles Israeli-US linked networks in northern Iran pic.twitter.com/yYZmstv9kJ — IRNA News Agency (@IrnaEnglish) February 19, 2025 According to Moslemi, intelligence services from the US, ‘Israel’, and other hostile nations have been actively attempting to infiltrate Iran by posing as foreign nationals and displaced persons. Many of these foreign agents were operating under the guise of commercial companies, cultural centers, and charities, seeking to collect classified data and establish influence networks within the country. However, IRGC forces were able to identify and dismantle the espionage cells through meticulous intelligence monitoring, the commander added. This latest takedown comes on the heels of other recent IRGC operations against foreign spy networks. In January, the elite force arrested members of a network involved in gathering information about sensitive Iranian facilities in Khuzestan province for a foreign intelligence agency. In December, the IRGC also apprehended an individual in Ardabil province on charges of affiliation with the spy agency of a neighboring country. Additionally, Iran's Intelligence Ministry announced in late October that it had dismantled a separatist group linked to the Israeli regime that was planning to infiltrate the country from Iraqi Kurdistan in order to incite street riots and carry out assassinations. One of the group's key members was killed, while two others were arrested, and their weapons were confiscated during the operation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2343442	2025-02-19T05:12:55-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00858110017399707694.jpg

Many Israeli Fathers and Mothers Will Cry Because of Five Posts i...	It is surely needless to recall that the Zionist entity has always evaded commitment to the resolutions of the legitimacy institutions in the world and the international laws since its very existence is illegitimate. The wicked essence of Zionism makes power the only way for the states and people affected by the Israeli barbarism to regain their rights. The resistance groups in Lebanon and Palestine have been a conspicuous instance. In the same context, the ceasefire agreement in South Lebanon, concluded on November 27, 2024, stipulates the full Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon. However, the Zionist enemy decided to keep five occupations posts within the Lebanese territories in South Lebanon after the extended withdrawal deadline on February 18. The Israeli occupation army alleged that the five posts will remain temporarily in an attempt to reduce the effects of the major breach of the agreement on Tel Aviv diplomatically. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun held an emergency meeting at the Baabda Presidential Palace with Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam to address the latest developments along Lebanon’s southern border and the escalating Israeli violations. The leaders reaffirmed Lebanon’s unified national stance, emphasizing the urgent need for Israeli occupation forces’ full withdrawal from occupied Lebanese territories in accordance with international treaties and UN resolutions, particularly Resolution 1701. They also reiterated Lebanon’s full commitment to the resolution in its entirety while condemning Israel’s repeated breaches of its provisions. Despite the five occupation posts, the residents of the southern towns of Yaroun, Maroun al-Ras, Blida, Mays al-Jabal, Houla, Markaba, Adaisseh, Kfar Kila, and al-Wazzani entered their villages and towns after the Israeli enemy had been defeated. Al-Manar reporter Ali Shoeib highlighted the grandiosity of the scene of the Zionist withdrawal and the residents' return to the border villages, stressing that the five occupation posts do not have any military significance. Shoeib added that the Israeli enemy wants the five posts to reassure the Zionist settlers before their scheduled return to the border settlements on March 1. However, Metula mayor told the settlements' displaced residents to avoid returning due to the security threats in the region. Israeli media outlets indicated that the settlers may not be reassured by the five occupation posts in South Lebanon, adding that they will likely see Hezbollah convoys near the borders soon. Maariv newspaper described the step of maintaining posts in South Lebanon as a strategic Israeli mistake, adding that many fathers and mothers will cry because of this move. It is worth noting that around 100 thousand settlers left northern Palestine because of Hezbollah attacks on Zionist targets in support of Gaza against the Israeli genocidal war. The Israeli media reports massive destruction of houses and infrastructure in the northern settlements because of Hezbollah fire.

‘Foolish’ American Plan for Gaza Will Lead Nowhere: Imam Khamenei	Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei says the United States’ 'foolish American plan' for Gaza will lead nowhere. Ayatollah Khamenei received the secretary-general of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement, Ziyad al-Nakhaleh, and his accompanying delegation in Tehran on Tuesday. The Leader congratulated the Palestinian resistance on their victory against Israel in Gaza, where the occupying regime has been forced to enter into a ceasefire agreement with Hamas after failing to dismantle the resistance groups, a chief objective of its genocidal war in the enclave. 'The great work of the leaders and fighters of the Palestinian resistance in creating unity and cohesion and steadfastness against the enemy, and moving the complex negotiations forward, along with the patience and perseverance of the (Palestinian) people, has brought honor to the resistance in the region,' Ayatollah Khamenei said. Ayatollah Khamenei noted that this victory has set 'a new benchmark' in resistance against the occupying regime. The Leader pointed out that the Israeli regime is now negotiating the release of its prisoners held in Gaza in exchange for a substantially larger number of Palestinian prisoners and with the same resistance groups that it had vowed to destroy going into the war. 'Currently, global public opinion is in favor of Palestine, and under these circumstances, no plan will succeed without the consent of the resistance and the people of Gaza,' he said. Ayatollah Khamenei was referring to a proposed plan by U.S. President Donald Trump to 'take over' Gaza after the enclave has been forcibly cleared of its more than two million residents. The plan has been widely rejected by both the Palestinians and the broader Arab world. During the meeting, Nakhalah congratulated Ayatollah Khamenei on the Palestinian victory and expressed gratitude for the Islamic Republic's continuous support of the resistance. 'The Palestinian resistance has, in fact, been at war with the United States and the West for the past year and a half,' he said. 'Despite the unequal balance of (military) power, the Palestinian resistance has been able to achieve great victories.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2342859	2025-02-18T07:40:41-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-06876130017398932317.jpg

Israeli occupation forces have intensified their military operations in the northern West Bank, inflicting casualties and detaining locals in the cities of Tulkarm and Nablus. According to eyewitness accounts, Israeli troops have tightened their siege on Tulkarm's eastern neighborhood, forcing residents to remain in their homes while raiding businesses and damaging infrastructure. Several Palestinians have also been detained at newly installed checkpoints on the roads connecting Tulkarm to nearby refugee camps.

This escalation is part of a broader Israeli occupation military campaign dubbed 'Operation Iron Wall' that was launched in January, targeting the Jenin area. The offensive has already displaced over 40,000 refugees from the Jenin, Nur Shams, and Al-Faraa camps, according to UNRWA. More than half of the 13,000 residents of the Nur Shams refugee camp have fled since the start of the Israeli operation on Saturday. UNRWA's Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini has warned that this displacement is the largest in the West Bank since 1967.

They also reiterated Lebanon’s full commitment to the resolution in its entirety while condemning Israel’s repeated breaches of its provisions. Lebanese Army’s Role in Defending Sovereignty The participants highlighted the essential role of the Lebanese Army, affirming its complete readiness to assume full responsibilities along the internationally recognized borders. This step is crucial to safeguarding national sovereignty, protecting the residents of southern Lebanon, and ensuring their security and stability. Citing International Commitments The meeting also recalled the joint statement issued by the Presidents of the United States and France on November 26, 2024, which reaffirmed commitments to security arrangements and the implementation of Resolution 1701. The leaders specifically noted the statement’s declaration: 'The United States and France will work with the Israeli enemy and Lebanon to ensure the full implementation of this arrangement.' Additionally, they referenced Clause 12 of the same statement, which explicitly outlined 'the implementation of a detailed plan for the phased withdrawal and redeployment between Israeli Occupation Forces and the Lebanese Armed Forces within a maximum of 60 days.' Clause 13 further emphasized that 'the United States and France understand that the Israeli enemy and Lebanon will accept the above commitments in parallel with this declaration.' Video shows Israeli enemy carries out a massive explosion in the southern town of Kfar Shouba on Feb. 18, 2025 Lebanon’s Next Steps in Response to Israeli Violations In light of the Israeli enemy's continued evasion of its commitments and persistent violations of international agreements, the Lebanese leadership announced the following measures: Appealing to the UN Security Council—Lebanon will formally request the Council, which endorsed Resolution 1701, to take necessary actions against Israeli violations and enforce an immediate Israeli withdrawal to the internationally recognized borders in line with the resolution and related declarations. Reaffirming Israel’s Presence as an Occupation: The continued Israeli presence on any part of Lebanese territory is deemed an occupation, carrying all legal consequences under international law. Pursuing Full Implementation of the November 27 Declaration: Lebanon will persist in its efforts through the Military Technical Committee and the Tripartite Mechanism to ensure the complete application of the declaration. Negotiating for the Release of Lebanese Prisoners: Lebanon will engage in discussions with the International Monitoring Committee and the International Red Cross to secure the release of Lebanese detainees held by the Israeli enemy. Finally, the Lebanese leadership reaffirmed the state’s unwavering commitment to its full national rights and sovereignty over all its territories, asserting Lebanon’s right to employ all necessary means to ensure the complete withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2342650	2025-02-18T03:59:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-06512810017398796766.jpg

Israeli Enemy Says Will Keep Five Occupation Posts in South Leban...	The Israeli enemy will complete early Tuesday its withdrawal from all South Lebanon towns and villages, yet it will keep five occupation positions within the Lebanese territories. The Israeli media outlets mentioned that the occupation army would finish its pull-out from Lebanon on Tuesday in the morning, adding that five Zionist posts would be kept within Lebanese territory under the pretext of protecting the border settlements from Hezbollah. Al-Manar reporter Ali Shoeib mentioned that the situation in the border area on Monday indicates that the enemy will complete its withdrawal by the end of the extended deadline, clarifying that the Zionist enemy did not carry out movements inside the villages. International Red Cross and the Lebanese Army managed to pull out the body of the martyr Khadija Atwi from inside the town of Houla still occupied by the Israeli enemy, knowing that the martyr died after she was left bleeding due to a Zionist gunshot inside her town on Sunday. Houla residents challenged the Israeli occupation and entered their hometown even before the Lebanese army. Meanwhile, the occupation forces have escalated their aggression on Lebanon hours before their withdrawal stipulated by the ceasefire, which took effect on November 27, 2024. Tuesday's violations were started by a vehicular incursion into KfarShouba town in the eastern sector of South Lebanon. Massive explosions were executed by the Israeli enemy in several towns, including Mays Al-Jabal, Yaroun, Teir Harfa, and Adaisseh. The Israeli enemy also carried out some construction works in Kfarkila, placing barbed wires along the border fence and a near gate and paving a road with base course materials. On the other hand, the Israeli warplanes and drones flew over several Lebanese towns, raiding Litani River course and Teir Harfa. Earlier, Israeli drones assassinated Hamas leader Mohammad Shaheen in the southern Lebanese city of Sidon. The strike hit his vehicle near the coastal corniche, just meters from a Lebanese Army checkpoint.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2342232	2025-02-17T11:44:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01611620017398214507.png
Hezbollah Statement Denounces Suspicious Attack on President Jose...	Hezbollah condemned in a statement on Monday the attack on the monument of President Joseph Aoun in Jarmaq-Aishiyeh area, South Lebanon. Hezbollah considered that 'this suspicious attack is a seditious act, especially at this sensitive time, as the country prepares for a pivotal day represented by the entitlement of the Israeli withdrawal from the South.' Hezbollah pointed out that 'this condemned behavior strongly contradicts the values and principles that Hezbollah believes in and were embodied by the Master of the Martyrs of the Nation, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah. It also contradicts Martyr Sayyed Nasrallah's approach and convictions. Hezbollah stressed its condemnation of this act that seeks to harm the relationship with the President of the Republic,' and called for 'thwarting all suspicious attempts to destabilize the nation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2342100	2025-02-17T07:25:09-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-04165050017056142612.png
Lebanese Nationals Protest Being Stranded in Iran over Israeli Th...	Lebanese nationals held a sit-in on Monday in the Iranian city of Qom protesting being stranded and unable to return home over Israeli threats after an Iranian plane was denied permission to land in Lebanon’s capital last week. The Lebanese nationals expressed their dissatisfaction with the government's decision that prevented them from returning to their homeland. Lebanese actor Mahdi Fakhreddin who is stranded in Iran demanded the provision of alternative options for the nationals, noting that many of those stranded have commitments in their homeland. For his part, Spokesman of the stranded Lebanese Sheikh Abbas Zgheib stressed that the Lebanese nationals’ right to return to their homeland and to freely move in their country, is preserved by the Lebanese constitution, urging the Lebanese President Joseph Aoun to act in a bid to get the stranded national back home. Thousands of Lebanese national head for Iran or reside in the Islamic Republic for pilgrimage, education or work there, with the Lebanese government hindering their return as it subduing to the US and Israeli dictations. Meanwhile, Lebanese Ambassador to Tehran Hasan Abbas said that communication is still ongoing between the Lebanese and Iranian authorities to secure the return of the Lebanese stranded in Iran since Thursday, following the Lebanese decision to prevent Iranian air carriers from landing at Beirut airport due to Israeli threats. In an interview with Al-Manar, the Lebanese ambassador said that the 'atmosphere is generally positive,' and that the foreign ministers of the Islamic Republic and Lebanon discussed the matter 'to ultimately find a way out of the crisis.' In this context, Abbas said that he is contacting the stranded citizens through the Lebanese Committee in Iran to secure their residence in the Islamic Republic and their return home soon. He explained that a number of travelers and families returned Lebanon via other countries, and that the remaining number is estimated at about two hundred people, most of whom were visiting the holy shrines. ⚡️⭕️ #Lebanon: Al-Mayadeen correspondent in Beirut: Protesters continue to block the airport road in protest against preventing an #Iranian plane from heading from Tehran to Beirut Under the orders of CENCTOM , Lebanese citizens are stranded in Iran as the Lebanese state… pic.twitter.com/0TB7YYwarB — Middle East Observer (@ME_Observer_) February 13, 2025	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2342023	2025-02-17T06:44:28-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-06865200017398030472.jpg
Israeli Occupation Used Palestinian Elderly as Gaza Human Shield:...	The Israeli occupation military forced an 80-year-old Palestinian man to act as a human shield in Gaza by tying an explosive cord around his neck and threatening to have his head blown off, an investigation has found. A senior officer from the occupation army’s Nahal Brigade tied the explosive cord around the man’s neck before he was ordered to scout houses the Israeli outlet The Hottest Place in Hell found in an investigation. After eight hours, soldiers ordered the man to flee with his wife from their home in Gaza City’s Zeitoun neighborhood in May, said +972 magazine, which reported the piece in partnership with The Hottest Place in Hell. But when another Israeli battalion spotted the elderly couple on the street, they were shot dead on the spot, according to Israeli occupation soldiers present at the scene. The Israeli soldiers had initially encountered the couple in their home. They told Arabic-speaking soldiers that they were unable to flee to southern Gaza due to mobility difficulties. But even in his condition, the soldiers forced the unnamed 80-year-old to walk ahead of them with his cane, while his wife was detained in their house. Additional details of the methods of warfare used in Gaza by the Israeli military and the deployment of civilians as human shields, then executed. The amount of evidence on the use of the practice in Gaza is unprecedented. It is clearly a military policy. pic.twitter.com/GbTagI6Wjy — Nicola Perugini (@PeruginiNic) February 16, 2025 A soldier told the investigation that the Israeli commander had decided to use the Palestinian couple as 'mosquitoes', referring to a procedure where the Israeli army forces Palestinian civilians to serve as human shields to protect the Israeli forces from being shot or blown up. 'He entered each house before us so that if there were [explosives] or a militant inside, he would [take the hit] instead of us,' one soldier said. 'He was told that if he did anything wrong or didn’t follow orders, the soldier behind him would pull the cord, and his head would be torn from his body.' The man was forced to act as a human shield for eight hours, before he was ordered, along with his wife, to walk towards the so-called 'humanitarian zone' in southern Gaza. But the soldiers did not care to tell nearby Israeli divisions that the couple was going to pass through the area, according to the testimonies. 'After 100 meters, the other battalion saw them and immediately shot them,' a soldier said. 'They died like that, in the street.' More reports emerge on the Israeli occupation army’s war crimes committed against the Palestinian people throughout 16 months of genocidal war in Gaza, with the atrocities of the so-called 'most moral army in the world' are being exposed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2341968	2025-02-17T05:16:33-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/12/manar-09560120017027419721.jpg
Video | Israeli Drone Strike Targets Hamas’ Mahmoud Shaheen in Le...	In a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement, an Israeli airstrike targeted a civilian vehicle on Monday morning in Sidon’s coastal corniche, just meters from a Lebanese Army checkpoint. Lebanese Army forces immediately cordoned off the area, later granting journalists access to document the targeted vehicle. The attack also triggered severe traffic congestion, as security measures led to road closures around the site. The Lebanese Health Ministry later confirmed that the strike claimed the life of one civilian, while emergency responders, including ambulances and fire brigades, rushed to the scene. This marks the first Israeli attack on Sidon since the ceasefire took effect on November 23 and the second strike within 24 hours, following the targeting of another civilian vehicle on Jarjouh Road in the Iqlim Al-Tuffah region. Later on Monday, Lebanon’s Al-Jamaa Al-Islamiya (Islamic Group) announced the martyrdom of Hamas military official Mahmoud Shaheen, who was killed in the Sidon airstrike.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2341814	2025-02-17T03:07:00-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00287420017397903525.jpg
Lebanese Residents Fearlessly Enter Houla Southern Town as Israel...	In a bold move, residents of the southern Lebanese town of Houla entered their hometown on Sunday without waiting for official authorization or directives. Pushing past Lebanese Army checkpoints and maneuvering through dirt mounds and trenches left by Israeli bulldozers, they made their way from the western entrance into the heart of the town. Al-Manar’s correspondent entered Houla, located along Lebanon’s southern border with occupied Palestine, to document the destruction left behind by Israeli forces before their withdrawal. As residents moved through most of the town’s neighborhoods, reaching roads leading to Mays Al-Jabal and Markaba, Israeli occupation forces launched a new assault. Residents enter the southern town of Houla (Feb. 16, 2025) IOF Block Lebanese Army, Red Cross from Evacuating Martyr’s Body Israeli occupation forces have denied entry to the Lebanese Army and the Red Cross into the center of Houla to retrieve the body of Khadija Atwi, who was killed earlier today by Israeli gunfire. The forces also prevented the evacuation of several trapped civilians, including the martyr’s sister. The Municipality of Houla has urgently called on the Lebanese Army, UNIFIL, and the International Red Cross to intervene swiftly and facilitate an immediate evacuation, warning that civilians may be forced to spend the night exposed to the elements. 🚨13-year-old Khadija Atwi, the daughter of Hezbollah martyr on the road to Al-Quds Hussein Mohamad Atwi, is the martyr who ascended in the town of Houla in southern Lebanon after the IOF opened fire on civilians, injuring several and kidnapping 5 people.

According to the statement, responders faced significant field challenges as Israeli forces barred ambulances from entering, forcing them to reach the wounded on foot. The Zionist forces opened fire directly on civilians in Houla, resulting in one fatality and the detention of five residents. Some of the captives were later released. Later on Sunday, Al-Manar’s correspondent reported that Israeli artillery targeted the southwestern outskirts of Houla with 120mm shells. Health Ministry Condemns Abduction of Paramedics The Lebanese Ministry of Public Health strongly condemned the abduction of paramedics affiliated with Islamic Scout Rescue by Israeli occupation forces. The paramedics were taken to an unknown location while carrying out their humanitarian duty of evacuating the wounded from the town of Houla. The ministry denounced the act as a 'blatant violation of international and humanitarian laws, which protect medical and emergency teams in the line of duty.' It called for the immediate release of the abducted paramedics and urged for the necessary protection of medical and emergency personnel while they perform their duties. Israeli Breaches Continue in Border Villages While resilient southerners reclaimed Houla, other border villages in the central sector—including Maroun Al-Ras, Yaroun, and the outskirts of Aytaroun—witnessed further Israeli violations throughout the day. Israeli occupation forces were spotted near the western outskirts of Maroun Al-Ras, specifically around the Hussainiyah Square area. The dirt road leading into the village had previously halted Israeli advances when residents mobilized in early protests. However, Israeli troops have now resumed fortification efforts, reinforcing dirt barriers south of the village. In recent days, Zionist forces have advanced toward Maroun al-Ras' northern outskirts, conducting excavation work along the main road. Since Saturday, occupation forces have returned to the village’s western periphery, intensifying earthworks and trench reinforcements. Israeli activity has been concentrated in the village’s western and southwestern outskirts, with troops advancing toward the border with occupied Palestine. Escalation Near Aitaroun and Eastern Border Movements At the border of Aitaroun, Israeli occupation forces have been constructing new dirt barriers on the high ground known as 'Jal Al-Deir.' Two Merkava tanks have been stationed atop these fortifications, and in recent days, Israeli troops have transported concrete blocks and installed surveillance and monitoring poles in the area. Meanwhile, in Yaroun, Israeli occupation forces have been absent for most of the day following two explosions that occurred in the village last night. Further east, Israeli tanks were seen maneuvering around Kfar Jouba, north of Kfar Shouba, near a local water reservoir. An Israeli bulldozer was also spotted carrying out excavation operations in the Al-Sadana area. Two Israeli Merkava tanks and a military bulldozer advanced into the vicinity of the water reservoir north of Kfar Shouba, carrying out excavation work in the Al-Sadana area (Feb. 16, 2025) Also on Sunday, the Israeli occupation army carried out a large explosion in the Al-Sadana area on the outskirts of Kfar Shouba	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2340978	2025-02-16T12:33:11-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01004240017397371018.jpg
Hezbollah’s Sheikh Qassem Warns Against Palestinian Displacement,...	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem reaffirmed on the anniversary of the group's martyred senior leaders that the Islamic Resistance will unwaveringly continue its journey, drawing strength from the legacy of its martyrs who paved the way for resilience and honor through their ultimate sacrifices. Opening his address on Sunday, Sheikh Qassem extended congratulations to the Muslim nation on the birth anniversary of the 12th Shiite Imam, the awaited Imam Mahdi (AS), reaffirming Hezbollah’s unwavering commitment to his banner—symbolizing truth and humanity. He also reflected on the 20th anniversary of the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, calling for the preservation of national unity in the face of adversity. Hezbollah Martyred Leaders: Icons of Resistance Sheikh Qassem honored the legacy of Hezbollah’s senior martyred leaders, beginning with martyr Sheikh Ragheb Harb, a beloved figure who stood with courage against the Israeli occupation in the early years of the Zionist invasion of Lebanon. His eminence emphasized that the Israeli invasion of 1982 aimed not only to uproot Palestinian resistance but was part of a broader effort to eliminate resistance in Lebanon and the region. However, the outcomes of this invasion were far from what the enemy had anticipated. Sheikh Qassem also paid tribute to martyr Sayyed Abbas Al-Mousawi, describing him as the very embodiment of a true resistance leader—always on the front lines, instilling an unwavering spirit of victory among the fighters. His eminence quoted martyr Sayyed Abbas’ iconic words: 'Kill us, and we will grow stronger.' Turning to the legendary martyr Hajj Imad Moghniyeh, Sheikh Qassem lauded his spiritual devotion, which guided Hezbollah's fighters. He highlighted Moghniyeh’s innovative strategies and expertise in both security and military fields. 'These martyred leaders shared a common ideology and mission, grounded in authentic Islamic values and an unyielding commitment to jihad in the face of injustice, with the Israeli enemy always their primary target,' Sheikh Qassem concluded. Stance on Palestinian Displacement On the political front, Sheikh Qassem deemed US President Donald Trump’s stance on the Palestinian issue as highly dangerous, aiming to eradicate Palestine and its people. He characterized these positions as a form of 'political genocide,' following the failure of the US-Israeli plans during Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. Hezbollah's Sheikh Qassem condemned any attempt to forcibly displace Palestinians from their land, firmly rejecting their relocation to Jordan, Egypt, or Saudi Arabia. Additionally, Sheikh Qassem warned that every action carried out by the Israeli enemy is under direct US management. His eminence called on Arab and Islamic nations to take a clear and decisive stance against this scheme, stressing the grave impact of the US plan on the entire region. Furthermore, he affirmed that Hezbollah is prepared to contribute to any Arab or Islamic initiative aimed at resisting the displacement of Palestinians. Lebanese Government and Sovereignty Affairs Regarding Lebanese internal issues, Sheikh Qassem expressed satisfaction with the formation of the Lebanese government, considering it a vital constitutional achievement. He emphasized the need for the proper functioning of constitutional institutions and highlighted the key role played by the national duo in ensuring the election of the President of the Republic. 'The Lebanese PM decided to prevent the Iranian plane from landing under the pretext of aviation and civilian safety, yet this was in execution of the Israeli decision,' Sheikh Qassem stated. Regarding the anticipated Israeli withdrawal on February 18, Sheikh Qassem firmly stated that there is no justification for the continued Israeli occupation of any part of Lebanese territory. His eminence called on the Lebanese state to adopt a firm and resolute stance, rejecting any potential compromises, including the so-called 'five positions.' Sheikh Qassem also highlighted Lebanon’s responsibility to rebuild what was destroyed by Israeli aggression. He reassured the people, stating that Hezbollah would not abandon them in efforts related to housing, restoration, or reconstruction. His eminence assured that homes would be rebuilt to even higher standards than before. Furthermore, Sheikh Qassem proposed that the government implement a system of administrative appointments based on competitive exams, selecting the most qualified individuals free from political quotas, to improve the efficiency of Lebanon’s administration. Iranian Aircraft and UNIFIL Discussing the Lebanese government's decision to prevent the landing of an Iranian plane in Beirut's Rafic Hariri Airport, Sheikh Qassem stated that this decision was in direct response to an Israeli directive, disguised under the pretext of 'aviation and civilian safety.' Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem statement on Feb. 16, 2025 His eminence called on the Lebanese government to reconsider this decision and adopt a more assertive, sovereign stance. Sheikh Qassem also reiterated Hezbollah's firm opposition to any attack on UNIFIL forces, emphasizing the importance of maintaining their safety and the peacekeeping mission. Additionally, he reaffirmed Hezbollah's full preparation for Sayyed Nasrallah’s funeral on February 23, with diverse participation, urging supporters for wide attendance and discipline.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2341451	2025-02-16T11:34:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-06446200017397342586.png

Hezbollah: The Army’s Use of Tear Gas Against Protesters Is a Rep...	In a statement, Hezbollah confirmed that the 'popular sit-in organized by the group yesterday to condemn Israeli interference in Lebanese affairs and the violation of national sovereignty was a peaceful movement and a civilized expression of a popular position rejecting unjustified submission to external dictates.' However, Hezbollah indicated that 'the protesters were surprised by some members of the Lebanese army firing tear gas bombs at them, in a reprehensible act that constitutes an unjustified attack on peaceful citizens. It is a suspicious attempt to drag the army into a confrontation with its people.' Expressing concern, Hezbollah called on the army leadership to urgently investigate this 'reprehensible attack' and take appropriate measures to preserve the military's role in protecting stability and civil peace. Hezbollah also called on the Lebanese government to fulfill its responsibilities in protecting peaceful protesters and their right to express their positions and demands. The group demanded the government reverse its decision to prevent an Iranian aircraft from landing at Beirut airport and take serious measures to prevent Israeli encroachment on national sovereignty. Condemning an incident that targeted the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) the previous day near Rafik Hariri International Airport, Hezbollah stressed its 'absolute rejection of any targeting' of UNIFIL or harm to public and private property. Thousands of Lebanese citizens participated in the Hezbollah-called sit-in on the old road leading to Beirut's airport, protesting Israeli violations of Lebanese sovereignty and refusing to submit to Israeli threats. The protesters also demanded the government facilitate the return of Lebanese citizens stranded in Tehran after authorities prevented an Iranian aircraft from landing in Beirut.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2340725	2025-02-16T04:47:49-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-001802500173971005910.jpg
Europe Will Not Be Part of Ukraine Peace Talks, US Envoy Says	The United States has indicated that Europe will not have a seat at the table for the upcoming Ukraine peace talks, according to Donald Trump's Ukraine envoy. Speaking at a global security conference in Munich, the envoy, Jim Kellogg, bluntly stated: 'I'm (from) a school of realism. I think that's not gonna happen' when asked about European participation. The news has sparked concerns among European leaders, who have insisted they must be involved in any negotiations that impact their own security. 'There's no way in which we can have discussions or negotiations about Ukraine, Ukraine's future or European security structure, without Europeans,' Finland's President Alexander Stubb told reporters. The US has taken an increasingly unilateral approach to the Ukraine conflict, with Trump shocking allies by calling Russian President Vladimir Putin without consulting European partners or the Ukrainian government. Trump administration officials have also made clear that they expect European NATO allies to take primary responsibility for the region, as the US shifts focus to issues like border security and countering China. This has fueled fears that Europe may be cut out of a peace deal that could significantly impact their interests, particularly if it is seen as too favorable to Russia. In a sign of the growing tensions, the US has sent a questionnaire to European capitals asking what they could contribute to security guarantees for Ukraine. 'The Americans are approaching European capitals and asking how many soldiers they are ready to deploy,' one European diplomat revealed. French President Emmanuel Macron is now discussing the possibility of an informal meeting among European leaders to coordinate their response. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte also urged Europeans to 'get into the debate' and come up with 'concrete proposals' rather than just complaining about being excluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2340670	2025-02-16T03:52:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-05140070017397067446.jpg

Allies Often Worse Than Enemies': Trump Announces Reciprocal Tar...	US President Donald Trump today announced sweeping 'reciprocal tariffs' hitting both allies and competitors, in a dramatic escalation of an international trade war that economists warn could fuel inflation at home. Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said he decided to impose reciprocal duties, telling reporters that US allies were often 'worse than our enemies' on trade issues. The levies would be tailored to each US trading partner and consider factors including value added tax (VAT). Trump has announced a broad range of tariffs targeting some of the biggest US trading partners since taking office, arguing that they would help tackle unfair practices — and in some cases using the threats to influence policy. The president has referred to tariffs as a way to raise revenue, remedy trade imbalances and pressure countries to act on US concerns. Trump's announcement came hours before he was due to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington. It remains unclear when exactly the tariffs would take effect, if imposed. Analysts have warned that reciprocal duties could bring a broad tariff hike to emerging market economies such as India and Thailand, which tend to have higher effective tariff rates on US products. Countries such as South Korea that have trade deals with Washington are less at risk from this move, analysts believe.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2338899	2025-02-14T06:30:38-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2020/11/manar-02037370016046496872.jpg

He pointed to the recent developments in Gaza, stating, 'Look at the agreement—Israel opened the Rafah crossing and withdrew from the Netzarim axis, while thousands of Palestinians returned to the north.' Eiland noted that 'Hamas can dictate to us in phase two an agreement.' Although admitting the importance of recovering Israeli detainees currently held in Gaza, he said that Israel 'will also pay with the mass release of hundreds of prisoners.'

He said Hamas had, conversely, 'achieved all of its goals, chief among them: continuing its rule in Gaza.'

The committee also reported the displacement of 20,000 Palestinians due to the ongoing assault, which has left hundreds of homes and facilities completely or partially destroyed. Siege, Arrests, and Humanitarian Crisis The Israeli aggression has also extended to other West Bank camps, including Tulkarm, Nour Shams, and Fara'a, where the occupation forces have imposed a crippling siege, carried out raids, and arrested dozens of Palestinians. These actions have led to the forced displacement of an estimated 40,000 people, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).

Videos| Hezbollah MP Calls on Government to Protect Sovereign Fac...	Member of the Loyalty to Resistance parliamentary bloc, Dr. Ibrahim Al-Moussawi, called on all the Lebanese parties to condemn the Israeli violations of the national sovereignty and loudly hold the international competent institutions responsible for stopping the Zionist attacks against the Martyr President Rafik Hariri International Airport. In a statement issued to comment on on the crisis of Lebanese citizens stranded abroad as a result of the Israeli threat to target the Iranian plane that will transport them from Iran, MP Al-Moussawi said, 'the Lebanese who are optimistic about the reactivation of the work of constitutional institutions are holding the government responsible and demanding that it take the necessary measures to guarantee Lebanon’s sovereignty at all its public facilities, most importantly the airport, so that the enemy does not think that it is free to practice aggression and violate sovereignty as it pleases.' 'The Lebanese state, with all its apparatuses, must assume its responsibilities to end this matter and work to return its citizens to their country immediately and not comply with Israeli threats under any name or circumstance.' At the same time, Al-Moussawi called on the honorable citizens and all those who are keen on the interests of their country and families to be deeply aware and rational and to make room for solutions to this emerging crisis, stressing that the expression of rejection of these Israeli violations and infringements of our sovereignty to be peaceful and responsible. Hundreds of demonstrators staged a sit-in on Thursday evening off Beirut International Airport, protesting against the prevention of an Iranian plane carrying Lebanese citizens from landing at the airport. Dozens of young men blocked the airport road by burning tires, in rejection of the decision to prevent the plane from landing, which includes arbitrarily preventing citizens from returning to their homeland. Earlier, a video went viral via social media platforms and showed Lebanese passengers stranded at Tehran airport. They underlined their rights as Lebanese citizens to return to their homeland through the airport, urging the Lebanese officials address their issue.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2338415	2025-02-13T13:20:54-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-02359810017394816433.png
Sayyed Houthi: We Will Militarily Confront Trump’s Gaza Displacem...	Head of Yemen’s Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi vowed a military action if 'Israel' or the US proceed with a plan to displace the Gaza Strip residents into other countries. 'Our position concerning support for the Palestinian nation and their fighters is firm and principled, and we will resolutely stand by their side,' he said in a televised speech from Yemeni capital Sanaa on Thursday. 'If the US manages to advance its plot against Gaza, we will take military action to prevent it, and act within the framework of our religious duties. We will not sit idly by.' He added that 'Israel' has not yet fulfilled its commitments under the Gaza ceasefire agreement by preventing the entry of aid, basic commodities and tents into the Strip. Houthi took a swipe at the Zionist regime for violating the terms of the ceasefire in Gaza due to the encouragement of the deceitful US administration, which denies all rights. The Ansarullah chief also rejected the US president’s call for the cancellation of the Gaza ceasefire unless the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas frees all remaining Israeli captives by Saturday, stating that 'Hell is for you (Donald Trump) and people of your kind like tyrants, criminals and oppressors.' Houthi emphasized that Trump’s Gaza displacement plan is more like a joke and naive talk from the president of a country that proclaims to be civilized. 'Trump's plan to displace the Palestinian people from their homeland is a confiscation of a right from which many other rights are derived. Trump is a criminal and accustomed to making careless and ridiculous remarks.' Houthi underlined that Trump's plan to displace Palestinians from Gaza reflects his insistence on the criminal plan to deny Palestinians’ rights and justice for them. A drone view captures Palestinians, forcibly displaced to southern Gaza by IOF, making their way back to their homes in the north after a ceasefire took effect in central Gaza (Reuters: Jan 27, 2025) 'Trump's plan for Gaza is evil and cruel. It appears that he is serious about implementing the scheme, and is putting pressure on some Arab countries to accept it. We are not surprised by the US president’s plot as it shows the tyranny and criminal record of his country. There are no boundaries to the ambitions of Trump, who believes in the aggressive and unjust Zionist plan and seeks to realize it,' he stated. The Ansarullah leader stated that Trump, who unveiled the so-called 'Deal of the Century' during his term in office, is now poised to perpetrate the 'Crime of the Century' during his second term. 'Through his plan, Trump seeks to obtain what the Israeli aggression on Gaza failed to achieve, namely, displacing the Palestinians from their land. When the Americans raise the issue of displacing the Palestinian people from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, they seek to completely liquidate the Palestinian cause,' Houthi said. He warned that the plan to forcibly relocate Palestinians is part of the Zionist project that seeks to expand the occupying entity’s influence and is aimed at holy sites, especially the al-Aqsa Mosque. 'Trump’s Gaza plan cannot succeed as long as Arabs, especially the Arab countries neighboring Palestine, do not accept it. A great responsibility lies with Arab and Muslim countries to clearly reject it, and more importantly express their vehement opposition. 'The US seeks to entrap Arab regimes in a major scandal and act against the interests of their countries and peoples,' Houthi noted. He warned that approving the American plan would have very serious consequences for the national security of Arab countries, and the entire West Asia region.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2338382	2025-02-13T11:54:43-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01327440017394764775.jpg
Speaker Berri to US Delegation: If Israeli Occupation Persists in...	House Speaker Nabih Berri announced that the American told him that the Israeli enemy will withdraw from South Lebanon by February 18, but will keep occupation troops in five positions, adding that he rejected the issue categorically. Speaker Berri met with head of the Ceasefire Monitoring Committee, U.S. General Jasper Jeffers, at the Second Presidency headquarters in Ain al-Tineh in the presence of U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon, Lisa Johnson. Speaker Berri told the reporters that he totally dismissed the extension of Israeli withdrawal deadline, adding that the Americans must guarantee the Zionist pull-out from Lebanon; otherwise, they would have cause a major setback fro the new Lebanese government. 'If the Israeli occupation persists in South Lebanon, days will tell. The Lebanese state is responsible for that. The Lebanese Army is assuming its responsibilities south of Litani River; however, the national dialogue will address the situation as of north of Litani River in the context of the defense strategy.' The Parliament Speaker stressed that 'Hezbollah is fully committed, but the continuation of the occupation means that the Israelis will exercise freedom of movement and aggression within Lebanese territory, and this is completely unacceptable.' The Israeli occupation forces continued on Thursday violating the ceasefire agreement in South Lebanon few days before the extended withdrawal deadline. The ceasefire took effect on November 27, 2024, ending a 66-day Zionist war on Lebanon.

Video Shows Martyr Sayyed Nasrallah Anticipating Displacement Per...	The US President Donald Trump did not disclose a secret scheme when he raised the issue of forcibly displacing Gaza residents in order to turn it into an American real-estate project. The dark scenario, which completely eradicates the Palestinian cause and threatens all the Arab countries, was anticipated by the former Secretary General of Hezbollah Martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah. In a speech on the anniversary of Hezbollah's martyred commanders, Sayyed Nasrallah warned that the enemy was planning to displace the residents of Gaza, West Bank, and the Palestinian territories occupied in 1948. Hezbollah decided since the start of the Zionist genocidal war on Gaza to support the Palestinian resistance militarily in order to frustrate such schemes despite the heavy sacrifices made for this sake. Palestinians displaced from Gaza to neighboring countries under a 'U.S. proposal' would not have the right to return to the enclave, US President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox News about his proposal to 'own' the Gaza Strip and develop real estate there. After visiting Washington and meeting Trump, the Jordanian King Abdullah II held a phone call with the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to discuss the latest issued related to the Palestinian cause. The two leaders reaffirmed the unified positions of Egypt and Jordan, including the crucial necessity to fully implement the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, continue the release of hostages and detainees, and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid in order to alleviate the severe humanitarian suffering in the Strip. President El-Sisi and King Abdullah II also reiterated the imperative to immediately start the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip without displacing the Palestinian people from their land. Furthermore, they stressed the necessity to stop the practices carried out by Israeli occupation forces against the Palestinians in the West Bank. 'The Arab world has fought [this idea] for 100 years. After resisting this for 100 years, we Arabs are not about to capitulate now.'

Heavy clashes broke out at dawn on Thursday between Palestinian resistance fighters and Israeli occupation forces in the Jenin and Nur Shams refugee camps in the northern West Bank. Meanwhile, the Hamas movement condemned the Israeli enemy’s deportation of three Palestinian prisoners from occupied Jerusalem. Palestinian media reported that an Israeli drone dropped explosive bombs on residential homes in the Jenin refugee camp. On Wednesday evening, three Palestinians were shot and wounded by Israeli forces as they attempted to enter the camp to check on their properties. According to local sources, Israeli enemy snipers were deployed on rooftops, firing at anyone attempting to reach the besieged camp, which has been cut off from the city of Jenin for 24 consecutive days. The occupation forces also continued sending reinforcements, including military bulldozers, to destroy infrastructure and civilian properties. Martyr in Nur Shams Amid Israeli Attacks In Tulkarm, sources confirmed that a Palestinian from the town of Alar was martyred during armed clashes in Nur Shams camp, east of Tulkarm. Meanwhile, Israeli Channel 13 reported that a soldier from the elite 'Maglan' unit was injured in the confrontation.

Imam Khamenei Highlights Iran’s Military Power Feared by Foes	Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei has hailed the participation of people in Monday rallies across the country on the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, saying President Masoud Pezeshkian’s 'clear and decisive' speech complemented the great popular movement. The Leader made the remarks during a Wednesday meeting with scientists, specialists, and officials from Iran’s defense industry, as well as several families of martyrs from the country’s defense sector. 'This recent Bahman 22 (February 10) was one of the most outstanding celebrations of the [Islamic] Revolution – one of the most significant ones,' Ayatollah Khamenei said, describing the rallies as a 'popular uprising' in the face of the enemy’s massive propaganda campaign against the Islamic Revolution. 'The people indeed rose up on Monday; they took to the streets, chanted slogans, expressed their views in the media, and this happened across the entire country. It was a popular uprising, a great national movement,' he said. ‘Rallies conveyed message of unity’ The Leader further said the participation of young people and the broad turnout across the country, including in villages despite bitterly cold and highly unfavorable weather, conveyed a 'message of unity' from the Iranian nation. Emphasizing the significance of the huge turnout, Ayatollah Khamenei noted that Iranians had done something 'extraordinary' by showcasing their 'identity, dignity, strength, and resilience' in the face of 'foolish threats' repeatedly made against them. 'Complementing this great popular movement on Bahman 22 were the clear and decisive remarks of the esteemed president, who voiced the people’s concerns and articulated what needed to be said,' he said. 'I always reiterate to my audience, to the dear young people to whom I am deeply attached and devoted, that actions must be taken at the right time. The Iranian nation acted at the right time on Monday; they did what needed to be done exactly when it needed to be done. They showed themselves at the right moment.' Prior to the meeting, Ayatollah Khamenei visited the Eghtedar-1403 exhibition for an hour, which showcased the latest achievements and capabilities of the country’s defense industry scientists and specialists. The exhibition featured advanced equipment and new technologies used in air defense, ballistic and cruise missiles, smart munitions, space technology, drones and aviation, naval vessels, and energy systems. Referring to the exhibition, the Leader described the issue of defending the nation and ensuring the country’s security as extremely important, stating that Iran’s defensive power is now widely recognized – admired by the 'friends of the Revolution' and feared by its enemies – making it a significant asset for the country. Ayatollah Khamenei recalled a time when global bullies refused to sell Iran essential defense equipment, even at heavy prices. He noted that those same powers now demand that Iran refrain from selling military equipment to others, emphasizing the vast gap between their past stance of 'we won’t sell to you' and their current plea of 'don’t sell to others,' a gap that has been bridged through the 'efforts of Iranian scientists and the sharp minds of young specialists.' Highlighting Iran’s remarkable defense advancements despite ongoing sanctions, the Leader said that the country’s defense industry has reached a point where if any part or equipment is withheld, Iranian youth produce an even better version domestically.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2337667	2025-02-12T13:39:46-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-014585500173939637610.jpg

Sheikh Yazbek: Israeli Withdrawal Deadline Approaching, Hezbollah...	Head of Hezbollah’s Juristic Council Sheikh Mohammad Yazbek issued on Wednesday a statement which tackles the latest developments and affirms that the Resistance is the fortress of Lebanon. Sheikh Yazebk started his statement by felicitating the nation on the anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, saying: 'In these days, the days of the victorious and blessed Islamic Revolution, the triumph of the oppressed over the oppressors, these are the days of authentic Mohammadan Islam. We extend our warmest congratulations to the Imam of our time and to the nation on this blessed occasion&#8230;' Sheikh Yazbek added: 'Today, we have experienced great crises and tragedies, particularly when we lost the lover of Imam Mahdi, the lover of Allah, the inspired leader, the martyr of the nation, His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah—may Allah sanctify his pure soul—who was an entire nation in one man. He was the one who proclaimed: 'We will never abandon you, O Hussein,' and he never did. Instead, he attained martyrdom on the very path laid down by Imam Hussein. Peace be upon you, upon your supporter and brother, and upon our brother, His Eminence Sayyed Hashem Safieddine—may Allah sanctify his pure soul—who was your steadfast supporter, just as Al-Abbas was to Imam Hussein, in this blessed journey to lift oppression from the oppressed, in victory for the truth, and in defense of Palestine and Al-Quds. You both, along with those who stood with you on this sacred path to Al-Quds, dedicated your efforts to supporting and assisting Gaza. You gave your lives for this cause, driven by divine duty, human responsibility, and noble values, for the dignity of the oppressed. You did not ignore the cries and pleas of the children, women, and men of Gaza; rather, you answered their call. Yes, this is how you established this blessed Resistance, which has now entered its fourth decade, evolving from one era to the next. This dear and honorable Resistance has brought dignity to the entire nation, not just Lebanon. It has been the shield and the guardian of this homeland’s freedom. You and all the leaders and martyrs, every single one of you who has stood in the battlefield against the 'Israeli' enemy, have ensured that despite 64 days of battle, the enemy was unable to advance. Instead, the fighters of this Resistance stood firm, like the supporters of Imam Hussein, as the men of Allah and Imam Mahdi—men who insisted on confrontation, who fought for a dignified life for their nation, their people, and their homeland.' Sheikh Yazbek pointed out, 'When we agreed to the ceasefire, it was to protect this homeland and preserve others. However, this enemy has no covenant or pact. What it failed to achieve in war, it now seeks to accomplish by violating the ceasefire—wreaking havoc on our land and our people, destroying buildings, and assaulting civilians, while the United States backs it. The supervisory committee has failed to fulfill its role. We gave an opportunity for all to understand the situation. The state must implement what was agreed upon and take responsibility.' 'However, after 60 days had passed without action, our people in the south rose up and advanced toward the villages occupied by the enemy. They breached the barriers and made sacrifices, offering martyrs and wounded in their struggle to return. This return is a victorious one—a triumph after triumph. This Resistance belongs to the people. We congratulate our people on their return, their steadfastness, and their unwavering will. The enemy sought to break their resolve but failed. Yes, we are the followers of the Islamic path—the path of honor and dignity, the path drawn for us by our Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him).' Sheikh Yazbek addressed the Southerners, 'You, the honorable, the resistors, the people who do not fear the enemy, those who face death with courage—this Resistance is yours. You are its backbone and at its forefront. You are the ones who teach the enemy a lesson, just as our people in Gaza have done by achieving victory and denying the enemy any of its objectives. The enemy failed to accomplish anything in Lebanon, just as it failed in Palestine and Gaza, his eminence added. 'And now, those who seek to bargain today—such as Trump, who believes he can turn Gaza into real estate for sale—let them be disgraced along with all their allies. The entire world should know that as long as there are those who declare, 'There is no god but Allah,' the true owners of the land remain deeply rooted in it, just like our people in the south, in Jabal Amel, and across Lebanon. They have offered the dearest sacrifices and will never abandon the land they have watered with their blood.' Sheikh Yazbek called on the state to fulfill its responsibilities in confronting this occupation. We are approaching the end of the deadline that was granted. 'After that, as our Secretary-General, His Eminence Sheikh Naim Qassem, has stated: 'We will then reassess our actions moving forward.' We are fully prepared for whatever is necessary to preserve our dignity, our honor, and Lebanon’s sovereignty.The Resistance is defending Lebanon—it is the fortress of this nation. Lebanon needs those who will stand in its defense. When the state takes up its role in protecting the borders, we will stand with it and support it. This was evident when our people stood with the army as they advanced into the occupied villages. We all look forward to that day.' Sheikh Yazbek concluded, 'We also look forward to February 23, the day when the martyr of the nation, the sacred leader, His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, will be laid to rest. This national funeral will be a tribute to the homeland, for which he gave his blood, his very existence, and his Resistance. The Resistance will remain; its banner will never fall. As Sayyed promised, the flag will continue to be raised—it is a promise that will be fulfilled. We ask Allah Almighty to grant our nation honor and dignity.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2337579	2025-02-12T13:05:02-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07784730017393942971.jpg
Israeli War Jets Create Sonic Booms over Beirut as Lebanese Offic...	As the withdrawal deadline, stipulated by the ceasefire agreement, comes closer, the Israeli enemy escalated pressure to gain a new extension in order to continue its attacks and violations. The ceasefire took effect on November 27, 2024, ending a 66-day Zionist war on Lebanon. After the end of the 60-day withdrawal deadline, the bias US sponsor of the agreement supported the Israeli enemy to keep its occupation forces in South Lebanon till February 18, 2025. Few days before the deadline, the Israeli enemy started exerting various forms of pressures to delay the withdrawal. In this regard, the Israeli media quoted some officials as claiming that the Army would remain in South Lebanon for a longer term although some outlets reported the contrary. In this regard, Israeli Channel 14 mentioned that, under the ceasefire agreement, and unless there is any change, the 'Israeli' army will withdraw from Lebanon within a week. Al-Hadath TV Channel alleged that the Lebanese officials agreed a new extension of the withdrawal deadline till after next April. However, President Michel Aoun and House Speaker Nabih Berri categorically denied the Israeli-motivated rumors, reiterating the demand that the Israeli occupation forces withdraw from South Lebanon before February 18. Few hours after the Lebanese political stance confirmed rejection of the withdrawal deadline, the Israeli war jets created sonic booms over several Lebanese areas, including Beirut, for the first time since November 27. The Zionist mock raids were also carried out over Bekaa and Al-Matn.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2337524	2025-02-12T10:46:26-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01178340017393859748.png

On December 8, they entered Damascus, while President Bashar Assad stepped down and leftthe country. On December 10, Mohammed al-Bashir, who had led the so-called Syrian Salvation Government in the Idlib governorate, announced his appointment as head of Syria’s interim government, saying that the transitional period would last until March 1, 2025. The leader of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group , Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, has become Syria’s de facto new leader.

Israeli Occupation Forces Escalate Violations in Southern Lebanon...	Israeli occupation forces persist in violating Lebanese sovereignty by maintaining a presence in several points within southern villages, where their troops are seen actively moving. These operations include frequent incursions by both foot and armored patrols, alongside ongoing sweeping operations and repeated explosions. The latest of these occurred last night in the town of Yaroun, which has recently witnessed multiple bombing and demolition operations. Additionally, the Israeli occupation army has set fire to homes and carried out explosive attacks in the town of Adaisseh. Tensions Rise on the Southern Border Zionist forces launched bursts of gunfire from the town of Maroun Al-Ras, targeting the outskirts of the city of Bint Jbeil. In the southern area near the town of Aita Al-Shaab, which borders the Blue Line with occupied Palestine, an explosion targeted a farm at the border. Lebanese Rejection of Israeli Request The Lebanese Ministry of Defense was informed today, Wednesday, by the UNIFIL ceasefire monitoring committee that the Israeli army has requested to remain at certain points in southern Lebanon until February 28. However, this request has been firmly rejected by the Lebanese authorities. Delays in Ceasefire Monitoring Discussions A scheduled meeting of the committee overseeing the implementation of the ceasefire agreement was postponed from Thursday to Friday for further consultations on the fate of the ceasefire, which is set to expire next Tuesday. Al-Manar's correspondent reported on Wednesday that Israeli occupation forces continue to set fire to several homes in the town of Adaisseh, while a Merkava tank remains on standby behind earthen barriers at the town entrances leading from Rab Thalatheen and Taybeh. Additionally, Israeli bulldozers are conducting earthworks at the outskirts of Al-Dhahirah, while Israeli artillery has targeted Wadi Al-Shebaa. Also on Wednesday, the acting Lebanese Army Commander, Major General Hassan Aouda, inspects army deployment centers in the eastern sector of southern Lebanon. Aouda arrived earlier at the François Hajj Barracks in Marjayoun, marking his first visit to the border region in southern Lebanon.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2337315	2025-02-12T06:11:35-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00807440017393678339.jpg

For his part, US Secretary of State Rubio said Washington is open to hearing alternative plans from Arab allies who oppose Trump’s proposal to take over Gaza. 'If people don’t like the Trump plan for Gaza — right now it’s the only plan. It’s now incumbent upon the Arab countries… if they think they’ve got a better plan, we need to hear it,' the top US diplomat said in an interview with the Fox News on Tuesday. On the other hand, Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said he rejects any displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and West Bank, calling it 'unacceptable' for the region.

The Israeli occupation stepped up its aggression on the West Bank, with Palestinian media reporting massive raids, arrests and more displacement of the residents on Wednesday. The Israeli occupation forces (IOF) raided the Al-Arroub refugee camp and launched large-scale arrests in the camp that lies near the city of Al-Khalil (Hebron).

Palestinian media reported the IOF arrested two women from their homes in Tulkarm early on Wednesday. Wafa news agency said that residents trapped in an eastern neighborhood of the city were calling for help, including the delivery of food and medical assistance. The agency quoted residents as saying that the IOF have turned three buildings there into military barracks and that snipers have taken position there, preventing them from leaving their homes 'or even appearing at their windows and on their balconies'.

Ongoing Israeli Violations of South Lebanon Ceasefire Reflect Sch...	The Israeli occupation forces continued on Tuesday their attacks, explosions and various violations of the ceasefire in South Lebanon. Meanwhile, Israeli reports indicated that the Zionist Army is planning to keep its occupation of five to seven positions for a longer period. In this context, a Zionist force, accompanied by a Merkava tank, advanced into the western outskirts of Aita Al-Shaab, raising an earthen berm that blocks the way into Al-Hadab Hill which leads to a Lebanese military outpost, where the Army wanted to redeploy troops after the enemy has withdrawn. An Israeli tank also incurred into Yaroun outskirts, while the enemy continued its explosions in the border towns and attacked the residents returning to them. Al-Manar correspondent, Ali Shoeib, indicated that the Israeli enemy kept razing lands and executing explosions in Yaroun, Maroun Al-A-Ras, Aitaroun Markaba, Tallousa and Kfarkila. On the other hand, the Israeli media outlets unveiled the Zionist scheme of keeping troops in South Lebanon after the withdrawal deadline of February 18. In this regard, the Israeli Channel 14 would not withdraw from five to seven positions. After the end of the 60-day withdrawal deadline stipulated by the ceasefire which took effect on November 27, 2024, the US sponsor of the indirect agreement claimed that a further extension is needed to implement the 'terms of the deal.' The Israeli enemy has been utilizing the withdrawal deadline to detonate buildings, raze lands, scrape roads, burn forests, cut trees and attack the civilians returning to their villages.

On Anniversary of Humiliating US Marines Escape from Yemen, Sayye...	Head of Yemen’s Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi on Thursday extended praise and thanks to God on the great victory with the humiliating escape of the American Marines from Sanaa On the anniversary of the escape of the US marines from Yemen, Houthi said that the American defeat in Sanaa is a great blessing from God, a great victory, and a great achievement for the Yemeni people The escape of the Marines from Sanaa was a failure for the American project to completely control our country with all its consequences and was a great and important fruit of the September 21 Revolution, he added. 'Getting rid of American hegemony and American control preserved the human dignity of our dear people,' Sayyed houthi said, 'No people in the whole world can be free while America controls them in all their affairs.' According to Sayyed Houthi, those who view the American as a benefactor and a reliable destination to achieve interests and gains have a stupid and wrong view. Houthi underscored the US greed and ambitions as explicit in Trump's hostile remarks while addressing even non-Islamic countries, adding that the US administration does not deal with others respectfully. The program of the Americans was to lead Yemen to the brink of collapse in all areas, Houthi said. 'The American-Israeli project is an aggressive, destructive project that seriously targets our nation with the aim of occupying a large geographical area of our nation's countries.' The American-Israeli project seeks to confiscate the sanctities, not only Al-Aqsa Mosque, but Mecca and Medina are part of the Zionist project, Houthi affirmed, adding that the enemy seeks to rob the nation of everything moral from principles and values, from all the divine guidance that can build it to be at the level of confrontation. 'The American approach poses a danger to our entire nation without exception, although the danger targets certain countries more, but it postpones targeting the rest to future stages. The Zionist project is destructive and aggressive and cannot be adapted to, and it will lose any people who want to adapt to it in this world and the hereafter.' Sayyed Houthi emphasized our firm, principled, humanitarian, moral and religious position in supporting the #Palestinian people and their mujahideen at all levels, militarily, politically and in the media The Yemeni leader affirmed readiness even for military intervention in any round of escalation against Gaza at any time 'We saw the fruit of steadfastness and reliance on God in the position of the Palestinian people in Gaza Strip, despite the extremely difficult circumstances. The capital of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip was faith in God and their cause and adherence to their legitimate rights, so the result was in their favor.' - The second day in the Gaza Strip was a day of Palestinian victory, an enthusiastic day, in which the Qassam Brigades and the Palestinian factions appeared with all pride and dignity, Houthi confirmed. 'The Islamic Revolution in Iran was victorious because the Muslim Iranian people moved and carried the will to be saved from American hegemony through the Shah, who was practically for America and 'Israel', he added. The Israeli enemy was defeated in 2006 in a humiliating manner, and through that confrontation it wanted to completely eliminate Hezbollah and subject Lebanon to it and to the Americans.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2336754	2025-02-11T13:03:43-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-08587280017393078162.jpg
Gaza Under Siege: Aid Cut off as US President Trump’s Remarks Thr...	As the drained Gaza Strip faces severe restrictions on humanitarian aid, including the blocking of vital fuel supplies, US President Donald Trump’s recent statements add further tension to an already volatile situation. An article in the Israeli Haaretz newspaper describes Trump’s recent statements and interventions as 'tempting fate', warning that they could derail the ceasefire agreement in Gaza and disrupt the prisoner exchange process. Zionist analyst Amos Harel, writing for Haaretz, refers to Trump as an 'unpredictable force' whose actions risk intensifying the crisis. Trump’s call for the release of prisoners in a single batch, diverging from the previously agreed incremental approach, represents a radical shift in negotiations that could have dangerous consequences. While many in the Zionist entity, particularly those supporting the prisoner exchange deal, had placed their hopes on Trump, Harel notes that they now share the 'painful frustration' previously felt by critics, especially those from the right-wing factions. Trump threatens to withhold aid from Jordan and Egypt if they refuse his proposal to transform Gaza into a tourism hub, amid ongoing tensions over Palestinian relocation. pic.twitter.com/fROjKGckWI — News Now (@NewsNowUS) February 11, 2025 Rising Right-Wing Optimism and Potential Fallout The article further highlights how right-wing factions in the Zionist entity have embraced Trump’s remarks, seeing them as an opening for Zionist Prime Minister Netanyahu to retract his commitments and take military action against Hamas. However, Harel cautions that such action could lead to the deaths of dozens of prisoners still held in Gaza. In conclusion, Harel dismisses the right-wing optimism surrounding Trump’s intervention, stressing that military force is unlikely to change Hamas’s stance, particularly as the group has nothing left to lose. He suggests that Trump’s motivations may include securing a significant regional achievement, such as ending the Gaza conflict, facilitating normalization with the Israeli enemy's regional neighbors, or even securing a Nobel Peace Prize. Limited Aid and Severe Shortages In a blatant escalation of restrictions, Israeli occupation forces have blocked the entry of commercial fuel into Gaza, despite clear stipulations in the humanitarian protocol. Sources within Gaza confirmed to Al-Jazeera that the occupation has also halted the supply of fuel for essential services, including civil defense and municipal vehicles required for crucial road repairs and debris removal. Additionally, no commercial fuel has been allowed to enter the enclave, exacerbating the ongoing humanitarian crisis. The same sources revealed that only around 53,000 tents have been allowed into Gaza out of the agreed 200,000, and none of the 60,000 caravans required for shelter have been delivered. They also noted that only 4 heavy vehicles have been permitted to enter for debris removal and body retrieval, despite the sector’s need for 500 such vehicles. In addition, the Israeli occupation has prevented the entry of construction materials needed for rebuilding hospitals and civil defense centers. Gaza’s Rashid Street remains closed to vehicles, and crossing checks continue on Salah Al-Din Street following the expiration of the 22-day deadline. No power station equipment has been allowed to enter, hindering repairs and the restoration of the power grid.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2336611	2025-02-11T09:06:04-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00142580017392932812.jpg
Lebanon’s Berri Condemns Netanyahu’s Proposal on Establishing Pal...	House Speaker, Nabih Berri, on Tuesday denounced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s call for a Palestinian state on Saudi land as a blatant attack on the kingdom’s sovereignty and part of Israel’s cross-border aggression. Berri warned that this scheme aims to eliminate the Palestinian cause and undermine Palestinian rights. Moreover, the House Speaker stressed that defending Palestine is a matter of Arab national security, urging Arab states and the international community to take decisive action against such threats before it is too late. Berri also reaffirmed solidarity with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan in safeguarding Palestinian rights and regional stability. Saudi Arabia has condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s suggestion that the kingdom’s land be used to establish a Palestinian state. In a statement on Sunday, the Saudi Foreign Ministry accused Netanyahu of attempting to 'divert attention' from Israel’s ongoing 'crimes' in Gaza, including 'ethnic cleansing'. 'The kingdom affirms that the Palestinian people have a right to their land, and they are not intruders or immigrants to it who can be expelled whenever the brutal Israeli occupation wishes,' said the Foreign Ministry.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2336622	2025-02-11T08:10:51-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-07687950017327071093.jpg
New Lebanese Cabinet Holds First Session, Forms Committee Tasked ...	The new Lebanese government held on Tuesday its first session at Baabda Palace after a meeting between President Joseph Aoun, House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam. President of the Republic, Joseph Aoun, who chaired the session, emphasized that Lebanon was not bankrupt but was suffering from 'failed management,' urging reforms to revive the country. 'If Lebanon were bankrupt, it must rise through reforms, which we, as ministers and the government, will work tirelessly to implement. Lebanon, as a state, must protect all its sectors and institutions,' Aoun said. The President then stressed the importance of loyalty solely to the state, clarifying that ministers are there to serve the people, not the other way around. 'Our focus will be on reforming and developing ministries, with the significant international support we’ve received. The opportunities are available to seize this support once the necessary reforms are carried out,' Aoun added. The President went on to underscore that 'forming a government was not enough; restoring trust is essential through actions such as fighting corruption, making key appointments, and addressing pressing issues.' He highlighted the need to tackle urgent matters, including the national budget, municipal elections, and the implementation of Resolution 1701. Aoun also called for Israel's withdrawal by February 18, despite ongoing challenges. Furthermore, the President urged the government to refrain from criticizing friendly and brotherly nations, stressing that Lebanon should not be used as a platform for such criticism. Minister of Information, Paul Morcos, on Tuesday announced the decisions of the cabinet session, stating that President Joseph Aoun urged new ministers to prioritize national interests and focus on governmental reforms with international support. Morcos then confirmed the formation of a ministerial committee to draft the government's policy statement. Led by Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, the five-member committee includes Yassine Jaber, Tarek Mitri, Ghassan Salameh, Fayez Rasamny, and Joe Issa El-Khoury.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2336567	2025-02-11T06:35:44-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-04974150017392845364.png

Trump Threatens ‘Hell’ if Israeli Captives Not Released	In a high-stakes diplomatic showdown, United States President Donald Trump has issued a stern warning to the Palestinian authorities, threatening to 'let all hell break loose' if Israeli captives being held in the Gaza Strip are not released by noon on Saturday. Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump made it clear that the decision ultimately rests with the Israeli government, stating, 'I'm speaking for myself. ‘Israel’ can override it.' This is not the first time the president has made such a threat, having previously warned of bringing 'hell to Gaza' if the captives were not freed by January 20, 2024. US President Donald Trump stated that Palestinians would not have the right of return under his proposed plan for Gaza. When asked by Fox News Channel’s Bret Baier whether Palestinians would be granted this right, Trump responded, 'No, they wouldn’t, because they’re going to… pic.twitter.com/D6w8iEXzVh — The Cradle (@TheCradleMedia) February 10, 2025 When asked about specific measures the US would take to enforce his demand, Trump responded, 'You’ll find out. And they’ll find out too. Hamas will find out what I mean.' 'These are sick people,' he added, referring to the movement’s members, despite their having treated the captives humanely and provided them with all necessary foodstuffs and medical attention by the captives’ own admission. Trump, meanwhile, threated that the US would cut off its aid to Jordan and Egypt if they did not take in Gaza’s Palestinians. 'I would conceivably withhold it [the US aid],' he said. His administration has pushed for the mass displacement of Gaza’s entire two-million-plus Palestinians, a plan denounced by many regional and global states and legal experts as ethnic cleansing. However, the Trump administration had previously approved a ceasefire agreement that would allow for the gradual release of Israeli captives and Palestinian detainees over multiple phases. This time, the Trump is demanding a 'one-go' release of 'all hostages,' refusing to accept a 'trickle' of releases. The ceasefire was initiated last month between the Israeli regime and Hamas in the hope of ending a ferocious war of genocide by the regime that had claimed the lives of at least 17,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children. Ever since its onset, the deal has witnessed numerous Israeli violations that have claimed the lives of hundreds more Palestinians. The agreement has mandated phased release of the Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Earlier on Monday, Hamas announced that it was suspending the process, citing Israeli violations of the agreement. 'The door remains open for the [captive/] prisoner exchange batch to proceed as planned, once the occupation complies,' the group said in a statement. In response, Tel Aviv ordered the military to prepare for 'any scenario in Gaza.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2336094	2025-02-10T23:56:41-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07169730017387823318.jpg
Trump Says Palestinians Displaced by U.S. Proposal Would Not Retu...	Palestinians displaced from Gaza to neighboring countries under a 'U.S. proposal' would not have the right to return to the enclave, US President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox News about his proposal to 'own' the Gaza Strip and develop real estate there. 'Think of it as a real estate development for the future. It would be a beautiful piece of land,' Trump said of the proposal, which he first floated last week during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Washington. Hamas said it would delay the release of three Israeli hostages scheduled for Saturday 'until further notice.' Hamas military spokesman Abu Obeidah indicated that the enemy’s violations of the ceasefire and failure to fulfill its obligations under the agreement are behind Hamas decision. Though the number of trucks carrying humanitarian aid and fuel has surged since the ceasefire went into effect last month, aid groups have said that some key aid has not been allowed entry to Gaza. Last week, the United Nations pointed to goods related to agriculture, telecommunications, reconstruction and education that remained restricted by Israeli occupation authorities. In response, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz called the delay 'a complete violation of the ceasefire agreement and the hostage release deal.' Katz said he has instructed Israel’s military to 'prepare at the highest level of readiness for any possible scenario in Gaza and to defend the communities.' An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a consultation with senior defense officials after the Hamas statement and would move Tuesday’s security cabinet meeting to the morning.

The military spokesman for the Palestinian Resistance Movement Hamas announced on Monday the suspension of the Israeli prisoners release operations until a further notice. Abu Obeidah indicated that the enemy's violations of the ceasefire and failure to fulfill its obligations under the agreement are behind Hamas decision. 'Over the past three weeks, the resistance leadership has monitored the enemy's violations and failure to fulfill its obligations under the agreement; including the delay in allowing the return of the displaced to the northern Gaza Strip, targeting them with direct shelling and gunfire in various areas across Gaza, and denying relief supplies of all kinds to enter as agreed, while the resistance has implemented all its obligations.' Therefore, the release of the Zionist prisoners next Saturday, Feb. 15, 2025, will be postponed until further notice, and until the occupation commits to and provides compensation for the entitlements of the past weeks retroactively, Abu Obeidah added. 'We reaffirm our commitment to the terms of the agreement, as long as the occupation remains committed to them,' Abu Obeidah concluded. On Saturday, February 8, the 21st day of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, the 'Al-Qassam Brigades', Hamas military wing, handed over three Israeli captives to the Red Cross in Deir al-Balah. This handover marked the 'fifth batch' in the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, exchanged for the release of dozens of Palestinian prisoners by ‘Israel’.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2335973	2025-02-10T08:57:58-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2019/07/manar-09143510015639613673.png
Israeli Aggression Escalates Across Southern Lebanon: Tank Advanc...	The Israeli enemy continues its widespread violations across southern Lebanon on Monday, with bombings, explosions, and ground incursions involving tanks and armored personnel carriers. The southern border town of Yaroun is bearing the brunt of these attacks, facing a series of explosions carried out by the Israeli occupation army after advancing into the eastern part of the town. According to Al-Manar correspondent Hashem Al-Sayyed Hasan, a heavily armed Israeli occupation force advanced toward an eastern neighborhood of Yaroun on Sunday, located near the town center and overlooking its main square. The Israeli occupation forces proceeded to rig numerous houses with explosives, demolishing nearly nine homes. 'Three to four houses were destroyed in a single explosion on Sunday, and this area has been subjected to five violent explosions in the past week or ten days, executed by the Israeli occupation army. This brings the total number of homes destroyed in just one week to approximately twenty-five,' Al-Manar's correspondent added. Israeli Tank Advances in Yaroun Later on Monday, Al-Manar's Hashem Al-Sayyed Hasan reported that an Israeli tank advanced toward the northeastern outskirts of Yaroun. Israeli occupation tank advances in Yaroun, south Lebanon (Feb. 10, 2025) He further stated that following this, an armored personnel carrier moved toward the Al-Sawwana neighborhood on the town's northeastern edge. Video: Israeli Occupation Forces Invading Houses Additionally, Zionist forces opened fire directly on a house in the same neighborhood of Al-Sawwana, coinciding with the invasion of the house by several soldiers. Lebanese Army’s Limited Presence in Yaroun Earlier, the Lebanese army deployed in the western part of the town but did not advance toward the town center or the eastern section, allowing Israeli forces to push further into the area. It is important to note that the homes destroyed in recent hours and over the past week are large properties, amplifying the scale of destruction left by the Israeli occupation in Yaroun. Overnight Airstrikes In addition to the ongoing ground violations, the Israeli enemy carried out a series of airstrikes last night, targeting deep southern Lebanon, including the Al-Jabour area and the Rihan Heights, where Israeli warplanes launched multiple raids. Two explosive operations were also carried out in the town of Mays Al-Jabal, alongside another explosion in the town of Kfarkala during the early hours of the evening.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2335764	2025-02-10T06:10:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00023800017391965707.jpg
46 Years On: Hezbollah Lauds Iran’s Islamic Revolution as Histori...	Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance in Lebanon extended its warmest congratulations to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, and the Iranian nation on the 46th anniversary of the victory of the blessed Islamic Revolution. Led by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the revolution reshaped history, overturned a regime of tyranny and oppression, and laid the foundations of a strong and independent Islamic state—one that refuses to bow to global hegemonic powers and instead relies on the will of its people and its religious and humanitarian principles. A Model of Resilience and Sovereignty In a statement issued on Monday, Hezbollah reaffirmed that, under its visionary leadership, the revolution has steered the Iranian nation toward establishing a formidable and pioneering state—one that has attained political sovereignty, scientific innovation, and industrial advancement across multiple domains, despite enduring persistent sanctions, hostilities, and subversive plots. 'More than forty years later, the Islamic Republic stands as a deeply entrenched regional power, solidifying its influence on the international stage and asserting itself as a key force in shaping regional and global affairs.' 'Since its founding, the Islamic Republic of Iran has been a pillar of resistance for just causes across the region. It has unwaveringly supported oppressed nations, emerged as a cornerstone of strength for resistance movements, and remained a resolute advocate for the Palestinian cause—now facing intensified attempts by imperialist forces to eradicate it. This is particularly evident in the policies of the current US administration, which continues to advance schemes designed to erase Palestine from the consciousness of the Muslim world,' the statement continued. An Unwavering Ally in Victory Hezbollah also underscored Iran’s vital role in backing resistance movements, particularly in Lebanon. Since Hezbollah’s inception in 1982, the Islamic Republic has stood firmly by its side, offering extensive support to facilitate the liberation of occupied territories and the defeat of aggressors. This steadfast commitment has been instrumental in shifting power dynamics and securing pivotal victories that have redefined the region’s strategic equation. Late Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Khomeini’s powerful quote in unwavering support of the righteous Palestinian cause Upholding the Revolution’s Core Values Hezbollah concluded its statement by extending its best wishes to the Islamic Republic, under the leadership of Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei, for continued strength, progress, and stability. It reaffirmed that the revolution’s foundational principles—rejecting domination by imperialist powers, championing the Palestinian cause, and fostering unity within the Muslim world—remain the essential safeguards for the future of the nation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2335654	2025-02-10T05:06:35-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-02494310017391924926.jpg
Demolition Devastation: Israeli occupation Forces Raze Palestinia...	Israeli occupation forces have issued a demolition order against a house under construction in the village of Al-Malha, east of Bethlehem. According to a local source, an army unit stormed the Al-Mashamis area and posted the demolition notice on the facade of the unfinished home. Suhail Khaliliya, the director of the Settlement Monitoring Unit at the ARIJ Institute for Applied Research in Jerusalem, warned that the decision by extremist Israeli Minister Smotrich to expand settlements east of Bethlehem could lead to the demolition of around 3,000 homes and other facilities in the area.

Local sources reported that the troops subjected the mother of detainee Mohammed Rafiq Nakhleh to field investigation. The forces also closed her son's shop on the main street and raided a place prepared to receive Nakhleh, who has been imprisoned by the occupation for 20 years. Demolition Notices Issued for Homes and Facilities Near Jerusalem Israeli occupation authorities have also notified the demolition of multiple houses and structures in Silwan, south of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and the village of Al-Issawiya, northeast of occupied Jerusalem.

The occupation forces also destroyed the main and secondary electricity and water networks in Khallet al-Dabaa and bulldozed the surrounding trees and crops. The owners of the demolished homes and lands have appealed to national, human rights, and international institutions to intervene and put an end to these barbaric practices and the ongoing attacks by settlers against Palestinians and their property in the area. Israeli Settlers Rampage against Palestinians Amid Ongoing Raids In the wake of the recent Gaza ceasefire, the occupied West Bank has descended into chaos, with Israeli settlers launching a campaign of violence against Palestinian communities. This 'all-out war' on the Palestinian people continues unabated, according to the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem. 'Since the ceasefire began on January 19, we have been seeing more military raids on cities and villages in the West Bank, so far killing dozens of people,' B'Tselem said in a statement on Sunday. 'This is not what ceasefire looks like.' The group reported that settlers have 'attacked communities almost every night last week, sometimes with soldiers standing by.' In the latest incident, Israeli settlers physically assaulted Palestinians and destroyed olive trees in the town of Khirbet al-Marajem, south of Nablus. The escalating aggression comes as the Israeli occupation military launched a major offensive in the occupied West Bank on January 21, just two days after the Gaza ceasefire took effect. ‘Israel’ claimed the raids were targeting 'resistance fighters,' but the crackdown has resulted in the deaths of at least three Palestinians on Sunday alone.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2335533	2025-02-10T04:40:46-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-03354770017391912404.jpg

Israeli Occupation Forces Withdraw from Netzarim, Enemy’s Scheme ...	The Israeli occupation military has completed its withdrawal from Gaza’s Netzarim Corridor – a requirement under phase one of the ceasefire deal between 'Israel' and Hamas agreed last month. 'Israeli forces have dismantled their positions and military posts and completely withdrawn their tanks from the Netzarim Corridor on Salaheddin Road, allowing vehicles to pass freely in both directions,' a Hamas official said on Sunday, referring to Salah al-Din Street. The so-called Netzarim Corridor refers to a strip of land that cut off northern Gaza from the rest of the Strip. According to the ceasefire agreement, the deadline for withdrawal was February 9. The full withdrawal of Israeli troops from the corridor took place a day after Hamas and 'Israel' conducted their fifth captive-prisoner swap, which saw the Palestinian group release three Israeli captives in exchange for 183 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. In a statement, Hamas said Israel’s complete withdrawal from the corridor signals a 'continuation of the failure of the goals of the war of extermination against the Palestinian people'. It said the return of displaced Palestinians to their homes and the continuation of the exchange of captives and prisoners refutes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s 'lie' about achieving victory in the 15-month war on the enclave. 'Gaza will remain a land liberated by the hands of its people and its fighters, and forbidden to the occupying invaders and any external force,' it said. Israel created the corridor at the beginning of its war on Gaza. It is a closed-off military zone that stretches from Israeli settlements boundary with Gaza to the Mediterranean Sea and is about 6km (3.7 miles) wide. More than half a million Palestinians were obliged by the Zionist occupation forces to depart norther Gaza in the first month of the war under the pretext of having safer areas in southern Gaza; however, the Israeli massacres chased them across the Strip.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2334873	2025-02-09T03:57:45-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07008640017391022592.jpg
Israeli Enemy Expands Aggression on Occupied Tulkarm, West Bank	The Israeli occupation's aggression on the city of Tulkarm and its refugee camp has entered its 14th day, with Israeli forces escalating their offensive to include Nour Shams refugee camp, located to the east of the city. This escalation has led to widespread destruction of infrastructure and forced residents to flee their homes. Early on Sunday morning, Israeli occupation forces deployed large military reinforcements, including heavy machinery and bulldozers, to Nour Shams camp. They conducted raids on dozens of homes surrounding the camp, accompanied by heavy gunfire and massive explosions, while reconnaissance planes flew at low altitudes overhead. بالفيديو | تعزيزات لقوات الاحتلال برفقة جرافات عسكرية باتجاه مخيم نور شمس شرق #طولكرم pic.twitter.com/Xp2vJASig1 — قناة المنار (@TVManar1) February 9, 2025 The occupation forces also imposed a strict siege on the camp, sealing off all access points and seizing residential buildings in the nearby neighborhoods of Dhannaba, Iktaba, and Al-Salam. In these areas, residents were evicted from their homes, their vehicles taken, and they were forced to walk out of the city under harsh, perilous conditions in the freezing cold. The Israeli forces converted these homes into military outposts and sniper positions. Furthermore, eyewitnesses reported that Israeli forces raided homes in the Al-Nasr and Al-Salihin neighborhoods in the Nour Shams refugee camp. Residents were forced to leave under threat of gunfire and were directed toward the nearby town of Kafr al-Labad. These areas were also transformed into military outposts, and a curfew was imposed. The situation worsened as bulldozers began demolishing roads leading to the camp, including the Nablus Street near the entrance to the camp. They also destroyed the already damaged infrastructure from previous incursions, and deliberately interfered with local internet networks to disrupt communication. The Palestine Red Crescent Society reported that Israeli forces prevented its medical teams from entering the camp, despite receiving alerts about casualties. Israeli forces also detained several residents in the Iktaba neighborhood after raiding their homes. Meanwhile, in Tulkarm refugee camp, Israeli troops continue to deploy large numbers of infantry throughout the area, raiding homes that have mostly been vacated or destroyed after the residents were expelled. The military continues to seize high-rise buildings and convert them into sniper positions while indiscriminately firing live ammunition. Additionally, Israeli infantry forces have spread along Nablus Street, which runs parallel to the entrances of Tulkarm camp, conducting thorough searches in agricultural lands, between homes, and around local facilities. They have also seized a residential building in the area and turned it into a military outpost. In the city of Tulkarm itself, Israeli occupation forces intensified their presence in the eastern district of the city. They raided dozens of homes, particularly in the Al-Diab, Al-Maslakh, and Al-Muqataa neighborhoods, looting contents, inspecting the identities of residents, and seizing surveillance camera footage. Meanwhile, the siege on Thabet Thabet Governmental Hospital remains in place, with Israeli soldiers stationed at both of its entrances, obstructing the movement of ambulances and medical staff. A 23-year-old Palestinian woman, Sundus Jamal Shalabi, and her unborn child were killed today by Israeli occupation forces during their assault on Nour Shams camp east of Tulkarm. The Ministry of Health reported that Sundus, who was eight months pregnant, was killed alongside her baby, and her husband sustained critical head injuries from live gunfire. Israeli occupation forces have continued their assault on the city of Jenin and its refugee camp for the 20th consecutive day, leaving behind 25 fatalities and dozens of injuries since the beginning of the assault.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2334763	2025-02-09T01:20:12-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-09291680017390928051.jpg

Netanyahu Office Threatens ‘Action’ as Hamas Conveys 'Tough Messa...	Israeli Prime Minister’s office threatened an 'action' on Saturday as Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades conveyed 'tough messages' during the handover of three Israeli captives held in Gaza for 16 months. In exchange of the three Israeli captives, 183 Palestinian prisoners are due to be released throughout the day. Saturday’s swap is the fifth under the truce agreement, which took effect on January 19, and is part of the first phase of the truce, which lasts for 42 days and runs until early March. Handover Ceremony Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades set up a stage for the handover to the Red Cross in Deir al-Balah, decorated with a sign declaring 'total victory,' the catchphrase used by Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu throughout the war. Banners on the stage read: 'We are the flood, we are the war’s day after.' The three captives appeared on the stage ahead of the handover, surrounded by Al-Qassam Brigades fighters and holding up release certificates.

As has now become a regular part of the proceedings, representatives of the International Red Cross sat at desks on the stages to sign the handover documents produced by the Palestinian resistance group. 'Tough Messages' Commenting on the handover ceremony, Hamas Spokesman Hazem Qassem said: 'Today’s handover carries a clear message by Al-Qassam that the people and resistance are the ones who shape 'the day after' not any external force.' On the other hand, Israeli Channel 13 quoted sources as saying that the Israeli side conveyed a 'tough message' that 'today’s scene won’t go unnoticed.'

'The shocking images we saw today will not pass without response,' the statement said. 'The government, together with security officials, will support them and their families. Israel is committed to bringing back all the hostages and missing.' A second statement, released a short time later by Netanyahu’s office, said ‘Israel’ would take unspecified actions in response to the conditions of the three Israeli captives. 'Due to the harsh condition of the three hostages and the repeated violations of the Hamas terror groups, the prime minister has ordered that Israel will not gloss over this and will take action as needed,' the statement read.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2334037	2025-02-08T05:32:11-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-065527900173902121610.jpg
Imam Khamenei Hails Gaza Victory, Calls for Continued Resistance	In a meeting with a senior Hamas delegation, Iran's Supreme Leader Imam sayyed Ali Khamenei Khamenei praised the Palestinian resistance for defeating ‘Israel’ and the United States in the recent Gaza war, describing the ceasefire agreement as a 'great achievement.' Imam Khamenei received Hamas Shura Council chairman Muhammad Ismail Darwish and other members of the group's political bureau in Tehran on Saturday. He told the visiting delegation that 'God Almighty granted you and the people of Gaza honor and victory' against the Zionist regime and the US. Ayatollah Khamenei receives senior Hamas delegation — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) February 8, 2025 'You overcame the Zionist regime and, in fact, the US and by the grace of God, you did not let them achieve any of their goals,' the Leader added. He called on the Palestinian resistance to stay resolute, saying it is 'necessary to plan for cultural works and continue the current path of PR works alongside military affairs and the reconstruction of Gaza.' Imam Khamenei highlighted the 'suffering of the Gazan people for a year and half of the Israeli war,' stating that the ultimate result is 'the victory of right over wrong.' He described faith as the main 'asymmetric weapon' of the resistance front against the enemy. The Supreme Leader also praised the Hamas negotiators, saying their ceasefire deal forcing ‘Israel’ to halt its 'brutal war on Gaza and release thousands of Palestinian prisoners is a 'great achievement.'' The first phase of the agreement calls for the release of 33 Israeli captives and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Imam Khamenei stressed that the issue of Palestine is a 'resolved' matter for Iran, and the 'ultimate victory belongs to the Palestinian people.' He urged the resistance to move forward with the 'strength of faith and hope for divine assistance' despite any challenges. On Thursday, the United States imposed its first sanctions on Iran after Trump revived his so-called maximum pressure strategy against the Islamic Republic. Imam Khamenei said there is no question in the minds of the Iranian people about defending Palestine and supporting the Palestinian people, and the issue is a 'resolved' matter. 'Palestine is a major issue for us and the victory of Palestine is also a definite issue for us,' the Leader said. The Shura Council is the main consultative body of Hamas that elects the resistance movement's politburo. The visit to Tehran by Darwish and his team is part of their regional tour which has already taken them to Egypt and Turkey.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2333894	2025-02-08T04:16:57-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00635950017390170057.jpg

On the 21st day of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, the 'Al-Qassam Brigades' handed over three Israeli captives to the Red Cross in Deir al-Balah.

Meanwhile, the Israeli army warned Palestinian families against celebrating the release of their relatives, with the occupation forces summoning the families of Jerusalemite prisoners for investigation. In the same context, Red Cross vehicles arrived in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, to receive the three Zionist prisoners from the 'Al-Qassam Brigades' (the military wing of Hamas). Regarding the place of handover, the Israeli 'Channel 12' pointed out that 'Hamas chose a populated area this time, perhaps as a signal to Trump, who claimed that the Strip is completely destroyed and uninhabitable.' Earlier, Palestinian sources indicated that the occupation forces opened fire along the Salah al-Din axis in the central Gaza Strip.

The enemy army said that its air force had completed its preparations to receive the prisoners returning to the occupied territories from the Strip. According to the Prisoners' Information Office, the occupation is supposed to release 18 prisoners with 'life sentences', 54 prisoners with high sentences, and 111 prisoners from the Gaza Strip who were 'not involved', according to the enemy's description, in the events of October 7, 2023. According to the list published yesterday evening, 7 of the prisoners will be deported outside Palestine. 38 of those included in the fifth batch belong to Hamas, 30 to Fatah, one to Islamic Jihad, and 3 do not belong to organizations. The prisoner exchange process has been a point of contention, with the Israeli government threatening to prevent West Bank celebrations. This comes as the Israeli delegation is expected to head to Doha to discuss the implementation of the ceasefire agreement's second phase. Hamas has expressed its commitment to the agreement, while warning that the failure to bring equipment into Gaza will make it impossible to retrieve the dead Israeli prisoners from under the rubble of destroyed buildings. The swap deal has also sparked political tensions, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commenting on the establishment of a Palestinian state, calling it 'a huge prize for terrorism.' The Mossad chief is expected to lead the Israeli delegation to the negotiations, with reports suggesting Netanyahu may seek to postpone the implementation of the second phase.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2333751	2025-02-08T02:41:48-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-05641850017390112992.jpg
US Approves Massive $7 Billion Arms Deal with ‘Israel’ Amid Gaza ...	The US State Department has approved a major $7 billion arms sale to ‘Israel’, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) announced on Friday. The sale includes a wide range of munitions, guidance kits, fuzes, and related support equipment. Additionally, the US has approved the sale of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and related equipment to Israel, valued at approximately $660 million. The approval follows continued US military support for the Israeli occupation amid its ongoing aggression on the Gaza Strip and occupied Palestine, in addition to Lebanon and Syria. This latest arms deal comes as the Biden administration had previously suspended a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs due to concerns over Israel's expected assault on Rafah. Trump Calls for Mass Expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza The approval of the arms deal coincides with former President Trump's recent endorsement of Israel's war on Gaza. In remarks aboard Air Force One last month, Trump described Gaza as a 'demolition site' and called for the mass expulsion of its population. Israeli army ‘seriously doubts’ success of Trump’s plan to ethnically cleanse, control Gaza — The Cradle (@TheCradleMedia) February 7, 2025 'I'd like Egypt to take people. And I'd like Jordan to take people. We just clean out that whole thing,' Trump stated, framing this forced displacement as a step toward 'Middle East peace.' This position was echoed by Trump's son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner, who suggested Gaza's waterfront would be 'very valuable' if its Palestinian residents were removed. Continued Bipartisan Support The sales are subject to congressional review, but approvals of such deals have historically faced little resistance. This latest arms deal follows an earlier $8 billion weapons package initially proposed under the Biden administration. Although some Democratic lawmakers have attempted to delay its approval, Washington's military support for Israel has remained unwavering.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2333729	2025-02-08T01:00:26-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07169730017387823318.jpg

Hezbollah Strongly Denounces Trump’s Call for Displacing Palestin...	Hezbollah strongly denounced former US President Donald Trump’s call for the forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, describing it as 'a blatant expression of racist, fascist ideology that threatens humanity at its core.' In a statement issued on Friday, the group asserted that 'the right of people to their land is a fundamental principle enshrined in all international laws and conventions—an inalienable right that cannot be revoked, violated, or relinquished under any form of coercion.' US History of Settler Colonialism The statement further criticized the 'arrogance and delusions of grandeur' guiding US policies, arguing that Trump and his administration believe they can replicate 'the dark history of the US' founding—built on the organized extermination of Indigenous populations and the replacement of native peoples with settlers.' Hezbollah warned that the same model is now being pursued in Palestine through forced displacement, stating that 'after the US-Israeli war machine, backed by Western powers, failed to break the will of the Palestinian people, Trump and his allies now seek to uproot them entirely and hand their land to the Zionists.' However, the group emphasized that 'the resilience of the Palestinian resistance and the people of Gaza has proven that they will not be erased.' ‘What the Israeli enemy Failed to Achieve Through War, It Will Not Achieve Through Deception’ Hezbollah asserted that 'what the enemy could not seize through war, it will not obtain through deceptive slogans about offering Gazans a ‘better life’ outside their homeland.' The party described Trump’s proposal as 'a dangerous scheme that defies logic and nature, revealing the extent of ongoing conspiracies against the Palestinian people.' Call for Unified Resistance Hezbollah reaffirmed its belief that 'those who thwarted the war of extermination will also defeat the war of ethnic cleansing.' The party warned that 'Trump and his backers will come to realize that this sacred land will never yield to American madness.' It called on 'all honorable people across the Arab and Muslim world, and beyond, to stand together in rejecting this disgraceful plot.' Warning to Arab and Muslim Nations Hezbollah urged Arab and Muslim countries to take concrete steps to counter 'this colonial project,' warning that 'if this scheme succeeds, it will bring catastrophic consequences—no independence, no resources, and no sovereign nations.' The party cautioned that 'any leniency in confronting this plan will pave the way for the mass expulsion of West Bank residents and, eventually, all Palestinians in the occupied 1948 territories.' ‘Gaza Will Remain for Its People, Palestine Will Remain for Its People’ Concluding its statement, Hezbollah declared that 'this latest aggression against Palestine and its people is doomed to total failure.' It stressed that 'the Palestinian people, alongside all those who stand for justice, will remain steadfast in their land.' The group asserted that 'neither Trump’s power nor his conspiracies will break Palestinian resolve—rather, his plan will collapse, while Gaza and Palestine will remain in the hands of their rightful people.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2333366	2025-02-07T10:20:26-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-04165050017056142612.png
Hezbollah MP Slams US Envoy Ortagus’ Remarks as ‘Blatant Interfer...	The head of Hezbollah’s loyalty to resistance parliamentary bloc, MP Mohammad Raad, denounced the remarks made by US Deputy Special Envoy to the Middle East, Morgan Ortagus, during her visit to Baabda Palace, calling them 'a blatant interference in Lebanese sovereignty' and 'a violation of diplomatic norms and international protocols.' He described her statements as 'filled with hatred and irresponsibility' and an attack on 'a national political entity that is an integral part of Lebanon’s political and national consensus.' Commenting on the official response from the Lebanese Presidency, which distanced itself from Ortagus’ remarks, MP Raad said, 'The Presidential Palace’s statement distancing itself from her remarks is sufficient. There is no need to dwell further on her words.' Criticism of US, Israeli Enemy Policies Hezbollah's Raad went on to criticize the US stance, stating, 'Those who claim to fight corruption should not be harboring terrorism. The 'Israeli' regime, which enjoys US political backing, undermines the very credibility of the democracy that Washington claims to uphold.' 'The atrocities committed by the Israeli enemy in its wars on Gaza and Lebanon are more than enough for the world to judge who truly supports, funds, and arms terrorism—who displaces people from their land and deprives them of their rights, all while violating international law and global humanitarian standards,' Raad added. MP Raad dismissed further discussion on those who openly express hostility toward Hezbollah, emphasizing, 'The true victor is the one who has exposed the brutal reality of the aggressor, a regime engaged in genocide—targeting civilians, destroying homes, hospitals, and entire neighborhoods. This is an occupying force that has no legitimate right to claim self-defense.' Defending the Resistance Concluding his remarks, MP Raad reaffirmed Hezbollah’s commitment to Lebanon’s defense, stating, 'We place our trust in the will of our people, who remain steadfast in their choice of resistance. This is the reality that safeguards Lebanon’s sovereignty through the equation of the army, the people, and the resistance—a formula Lebanon can take pride in as a means of protecting its sovereignty.' During her visit to Baabda, Morgan Ortagus voiced US support for Lebanon, linking growing American and diaspora interest to what she called 'Hezbollah’s defeat by Israel.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2333223	2025-02-07T09:03:20-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01890960017389475937.png

'We are grateful to our ally Israel for defeating Hezbollah,' Ortagus said in a press conference, following a meeting with President Aoun. 'It is thanks to the Lebanese President Aoun and the Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam and everyone in this government who is committed to an end of corruption, who is committed to reforms and who is committed to making sure that Hezbollah is not a part of the new government in any form,' the US diplomat added.

If it had been accepted then, he insisted, ‘Israel’ could have brought back more living hostages while releasing fewer Palestinian security prisoners. 'In practice, we could have gotten the same deal with more hostages, and at a lower price, because 110 terrorists serving life sentences were not in discussions then,' Gallant said, referring to Palestinian prisoners who were freed by the Israeli occupation authorities as part of the swap deal.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2333014	2025-02-07T04:03:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-09840080017389293224.jpg

Imam Khamenei Warns: Any US Threat to Iran’s Security Will Be Met...	On the anniversary of the historic 'Homafaran Allegiance' in which Iranian Air Force commanders pledged loyalty to Imam Khomeini, Imam sayyed Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, issued a stern warning to the United States. In a meeting with senior military commanders on February 7, 2025, Khamenei made it unequivocally clear that Iran will not hesitate to respond forcefully if the U.S. threatens Iran's security. 'If the US threatens our security, we'll respond by threatening its security,' Khamenei stated. Leader dismissed past negotiations with the US as futile, noting that 'Negotiating with the United States is not smart, not wise, nor honorable, and experience has proven this.' Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei warns of a tit-for-tat move against the US, in case Washington violates the Iranian nation’s security. Follow us on Telegram: pic.twitter.com/YXFMolUvLk — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) February 7, 2025 Imam Khamenei accused the US of arrogantly attempting to 'redraw the map of the world,' dismissing such rhetoric as empty posturing. However, he made it plain that Iran will defend its sovereignty at all costs. 'If they threaten us, we will threaten them in return. If they carry out their threat, we will act on ours. If they attack our nation's security, we will attack their security without hesitation.' The Iranian leader's remarks come against the backdrop of the US withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal, which Khamenei said saw Iran making 'generous concessions' that were ultimately disregarded by Washington. This experience has left Iran deeply skeptical of future negotiations with the United States. Imam Khamenei's uncompromising stance sends a clear message that any attempt by the US to undermine Iran's security will be met with a swift and decisive response. The war of words between Tehran and Washington appears to be escalating, raising concerns about the potential for a dangerous confrontation in the region.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2332948	2025-02-07T03:06:06-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07130110017389263593.jpg
Israeli Air Raids Target South Lebanon, Bekaa	The Zionist enemy launched late Thursday a large-scale aerial aggression on Lebanon in a flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement in accordance with the UN Resolution 1701. In this context, Al-Manar TV correspondent reported that 'the Zionist warplanes raided the area between Azza and Rumin in southern Lebanon.' The Israeli enemy's warplanes also launched a series of raids targeting the Bekaa region, and intensive flights of the Zionist warplanes at low altitude were recorded in the skies of Bekaa, Beirut, and other coastal cities. It is worth to recall that the United States and France sponsor the ceasefire in South Lebanon, but do not take any measure to prevent the Israeli enemy from attacking Lebanon.

Gaza Faces Cold Threat due to Israeli Hindrance of Aid Flow	The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) warned today that heavy rains and strong winds in the Gaza Strip are putting hundreds of thousands of Palestinian citizens at risk of severe cold. This comes after their homes were destroyed during Israel's 15-month-long genocidal war. In a post shared on X, the agency stated that many Palestinian families are still living in temporary shelters due to the widespread destruction across the Gaza Strip, with the recent intense weather, including torrential rain and harsh winds, significantly exacerbating the situation. 'Heavy rain and strong winds in Gaza have left hundreds of thousands exposed to cold and wet conditions in the past 24 hours. Many families remain in makeshift shelters due to widespread destruction,' said the UNRWA. UNRWA further noted that its teams are continuing to provide much-needed urgent assistance, including tents, mattresses, blankets, and clothing for the displaced population throughout the region. The agency also released a video showing strong winds ripping apart the makeshift tents of the displaced, made from cloth and nylon, scattering their belongings in the Al-Mawasi area, northwest of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. It is worth noting that the Israeli hindrance of the aid flow to Gaza has exacerbated the humanitarian conditions in the Strip.

Witnesses reported that the forces assaulted a fifth detainee, leaving him bleeding. At the same time, the occupation forces deployed additional military reinforcements, including infantry units and vehicles, towards Tulkarm and its refugee camp. They also continued to impose a siege on the Thabet Thabet Government Hospital, while taking control of the adjacent Al-Adawiya commercial complex, turning it into a military outpost and surveillance point. Furthermore, the Israeli occupation forces seized the Al-Burhan building in the eastern neighborhood of the city, located near the southwestern entrance to the Tulkarm refugee camp.

US-Israeli Circles Describe Trump’s Gaza Plan as Unrealistic: Sav...	An overwhelming joy pervaded in the Zionist entity after the shocking remarks of the US President Donald Trump about the displacement of Gaza residents and the American control of the Strip. However, considerable statements were issued in Washington and Tel Aviv to cast doubts on the unrealistic approach of the American proposal. NYT paper quoted Trump's advisers as saying that Gaza displacement plan is not applicable despite the celebratory polls in the occupation entity which showed that most of the Israelis favor the scheme. The newspaper also quoted the former US ambassador to the occupation entity Dan Shapiro as considering that Trump's plan is not serious and endangers the release of the rest of the Zionist captives in Gaza. US sources, according to NYT, added that the plan even shocked the Trump administration's officials, noting that it lacks a feasibility study. The former Israeli military intelligence commander Amos Yadlin said that the chance for the implementation of Trump's plan is very low. Moreover, Maariv newspaper mentioned that security chiefs in 'Israel' considered that announcing the plan during the ceasefire and the prisoner swap deal is problematic. Based on all the given data, observers wonder about the real motives behind Trump's plan. Among the basic interpretation's of the US President's move is saving Netanyahu's coalition from further collapses in light of the implementation of Gaza ceasefire. Trump says 'Israel' will hand over Gaza to US after fighting ends 'The Gaza Strip would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting,' Trump said on Thursday. He reiterated that the idea would mean resettling Palestinians, and that no US soldiers would be needed. Trump's resettlement idea has prompted accusations that he is planning ethnic cleansing, and has drawn condemnation from the UN, human rights groups and Arab leaders. Analysts doubt it will ever happen. After Trump's first comments on the issue, his officials suggested any relocation would be only temporary. Under his plan, Trump wrote on Truth Social, Gazans 'would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region'. The US would then be part of an effort to redevelop the enclave, he said. His post did not make clear whether the two million residents of the Palestinian territory would be invited to return. Under international law, attempts to forcibly transfer populations from occupied territory are strictly prohibited. Netanyahu 'This is the first good idea that I’ve heard,' Netanyahu said in an interview with Fox News. 'It’s a remarkable idea. And I think it should be examined, pursued, and done because I think it will create a different future for everyone.' 'I don’t think he talked about sending US troops,' he said. 'I also don’t think he said he’s going to fund it. He said that neighboring states, wealthy states, would do it.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a video message issued June 19, 2024. Katz Israel's defense minister said Thursday that he had instructed his military to prepare a plan to allow Palestinians to voluntarily leave the Gaza Strip. Welcoming what he called Trump's 'bold initiative,' Israel Katz said in a statement Thursday that Palestinians in Gaza 'should be granted the freedom to leave and emigrate, as is customary everywhere in the world.' He said the plan would include 'exit options' for Palestinians to leave Gaza via land crossings, with the possibility of 'special arrangements' for departures by sea and air. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz (image from archive), Opposing Stances Britain will oppose any attempts to forcibly remove Palestinians from Gaza, a Foreign Office minister has said, confirming for the first time that the government will block Donald Trump’s controversial plans for the enclave. Development minister Anneliese Dodds said the future of Gaza must be determined by Palestinians with the support of neighboring countries and the international community. And, in a rebuke to the US president, Ms Dodds said: 'We would oppose any effort to move Palestinians in Gaza to neighboring Arab states against their will.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2332519	2025-02-06T13:11:09-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-05221510017388762573.jpg
Lebanon: PM-designate Insistence on Naming Fifth Shiite Minister ...	It is unprecedented in Lebanon that the President of the Republic hosts the Speaker of the Parliament and the prime minister-designate in addition to other officials concerned with the cabinet formation at Baabda Palace, and the meeting ends before the new government is born. On Thursday, President Jospeh Aoun welcomed House Speaker Nabih Berri and PM-designate Naw3af Salam to announce the governmental line-up; however, their meeting withered before any breakthrough is reached. Before the end of the tripartite meeting, Speaker Berri left. Five minutes later, Salam left Baabda Palace without making any statement. According to Al-Manar reporter, Salam insisted on naming the fifth Shiite minister, rejecting the proposal of choosing one from a list proposed by the national duo (Hezbollah and Amal Movement). Hezbollah and Amal Movement named four of the five Shiite ministers and provided a list of suggestions for the PM-designate to choose the fifth member of the cabinet in accordance with the Constitution and the political norms. The reporter noted that the consultations are underway for the sake of announcing the new government on Friday or Saturday.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2332409	2025-02-06T08:24:33-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-09635610017388590635.png
