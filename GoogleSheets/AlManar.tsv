Hezbollah on Martyr’s Day: 100K Fighters to Avenge Sayyed Nasrall...	Head of Hezbollah Media Relation Department Hajj Mohammad Afifi held on Monday a press conference at Sayyed Al-Shuhada Complex in Ruweis, Beirut's Dahiyeh, on the occasion of the Resistance Group's Martyr Day which falls every November 11. Afif recalled how every year the former Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah attends the Complex in order to address the eager crowds on martyrdom and narrate the great stories of the martyrs. This year the scene is different, and Sayyed Nasrallah has been martyred, yet still leading the battle of the 'Formidable in Might', Afif stressed. Hezbollah designates November 11 as Martyr’s Day, a solemn occasion commemorating the sacrifice of all martyrs and especially Ahmad Kassir, who valiantly orchestrated a pivotal operation against the Israeli military command in Tyre back in 1982, reshaping the course of history Marking the anniversary of Martyr Kassir this year is done by achieving victory in the battle field, Afif stressed. Afif stressed that valiant fighters of Hezbollah are eager to meet the enemy and avenge the martyrdom of their master, adding that the Resistance fight will determine the fate of the nation and the entire Middle East. Afif added that around 65 thousand Israeli soldiers have failed to control any of the Lebanese border villages after 45 days of fierce clashes with Hezbollah fighters. Hezbollah has the Husseini will to fight till martyrdom, enough time till the advent of the winter season when it will submerge the Zionist tanks in the Lebanese mud, and the land which it knows well and where the Resistance fighters can perform free movements and maneuvers. Afif noted that the air force supremacy cannot grant the enemy victory, adding that, if the Israeli occupation forces fail to control the ground, Tel Aviv will not be able to impose its terms in politics. 'Along with more 'home' front cracks, there will be a turning point which will prove again that 'Israel' is weaker than a spider web.' Afif maintained that Hezbollah has enough weapons, equipment and supplies to engage in a long battle, adding that the Resistance use of heavy and precision missile barrages, including Fateh-110, answers the Zionist claims about the deficiency of Hezbollah rocket stockpiles. Hezbollah official underlined the firm ties between Hezbollah and the Lebanese Army, recalling the martyrdom of martyr Sayyed Hadi Nasrallah along with the Army officer Jawad Azar in addition to the martyrdom of the army officer Mohammad Farhat in the border village of Aitaroun as well as his funeral in Zgharta which turned to be a national wedding. This reflects the real role of the army in protecting Lebanon, Afif affirmed. Some Lebanese parties who fought the Army in the civil war allege now to defending the army by opening the political fire at the Resistance raising a normal question about the Israeli landing operation in Batroun, Afif said, emphasizing that those will fail to strike the relation between Hezbollah and the Resistance. Afif highlighted the malicious pro-Israeli propaganda against the Resistance and its social milieu, adding that it witnessed a come-back after Hezbollah restored its power. The Israeli aggression dates back to the thirties of the past century and has started before the emergence of Hezbollah, according to Afif who wondered about the intentions behind this reality distortion. Afif indicated that Hezbollah acknowledges the high cost of the resistance against the occupation and aggression, asking about the alternative choice and maintaining that patience will certainly lead to victory. Afif underscored that the battlefield was portrayed by Maariv which said that 50K Zionist soldiers have failed to occupy any Lebanese village. Hezbollah official praised Amsterdam protests against the Zionist hooligans, adding that, despite the governmental complicity in the West, the public can highlight Israeli's isolation. After the press conference, Afif led the reporters in a tour to inspect the massive destruction caused by the barbaric Zionist aggression on Beirut's Dahiyeh.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2263472	2024-11-11T10:05:01-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-02866230017313482725.jpeg
Yemeni Forces Launch Ballistic Missile Strike on Israeli Military...	The Yemeni Armed Forces (YAF) have targeted the Israeli Nahal Sorek military base located southeast of occupied Yafa (Tel Aviv). YAF spokesperson Brigadier General Yahya Saree announced that the hypersonic ballistic missile, codenamed 'Palestine 2,' was successfully deployed and struck its target with precision.

General Saree reiterated Yemen's commitment to supporting the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples, vowing that YAF operations will continue until the Israeli aggression ends, the blockade on Gaza is lifted, and attacks on Lebanon cease. This strike comes just days after the YAF announced to have targeted and hit the Nevatim airbase in southern occupied Palestine. The Yemeni forces also recently announced downing a US MQ-9 drone that was conducting hostile operations in Yemeni airspace over the al-Jawf province.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2263318	2024-11-11T04:38:19-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/04/manar-09219370016189056621.jpg
Iraqi Resistance Unleashes 6 Drone Strikes on Occupied Israeli Ta...	The Islamic Resistance in Iraq launched a series of six drone strikes targeting strategic sites in the occupied territories on Monday. This latest round of attacks comes as part of the group's ongoing efforts to support the people of Palestine and Lebanon and resist the Israeli occupation. According to statements from the Islamic Resistance, the first operation involved a drone strike on a vital target in the southern region of the occupied territories. This was followed by two more strikes against significant locations in the north, marking a successive operation in that area. Later, a fourth drone strike was launched against a vital target in southern occupied Palestine, the second such attack in that region since midnight. 🔻مشاهد من اطلاق المقاومة الاسلامية في العراق لطيران مسير باتجاه هدف حيوي في شمال الاراضي المحتلة. بتاريخ ١١-١١-٢٠٢٤ pic.twitter.com/vFcFfF1fpK — قناة المنار (@TVManar1) November 11, 2024 On Monday morning, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq announced that its fighters had carried out two additional operations, using drones to strike two separate vital targets in northern occupied Palestine. This brings the total number of operations conducted overnight to six, and eight since last night, as the Iraqi Resistance vowed to escalate its retaliation against Israeli aggression in Palestine and Lebanon. 🔻مشاهد من اطلاق المقاومة الاسلامية في العراق لطيران مسير باتجاه هدف عسكري في شمال الاراضي المحتلة بتاريخ ١١-١١-٢٠٢٤ pic.twitter.com/1jIHoi1aBp — قناة المنار (@TVManar1) November 11, 2024 These actions are in direct response to the massacres committed by the Israeli occupation against Palestinian civilians, including children, women, and the elderly. The Resistance has emphasized its commitment to continuing and intensifying these operations to strike at enemy strongholds. This latest wave of drone strikes follows a previous announcement by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq on November 6, when its fighters launched three separate drone strikes targeting an Israeli military site in northern occupied Palestine.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2263296	2024-11-11T04:15:21-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-021635200172940795210.png
Israeli Settlers in Northern ‘Israel’ Voice Doubts over Security ...	Israeli settlers in northern occupied territories are expressing deep concern and skepticism toward their government and military’s assurances about returning to their homes, as resistance rocket fire continues to strike the area. Many settlers are questioning the future of settlement in northern ‘Israel’, warning of the war’s potential long-term impact on the region. Despite the Israeli army's expanded operations against Lebanon, settlers in the north remain unconvinced. The continuing rocket fire and lack of 'apparent safety' have left many pessimistic about returning, especially as Hezbollah maintains a fortified presence in the Galilee, creating uncertainty about the future. 'It is said that many will not return to the north; a lot of the displaced have moved elsewhere because we feel isolated. There’s nothing here—no shops, no infrastructure. We travel to Nahariya weekly for necessities. There’s little to encourage people to build a life here,' said Zohar Levi, a resident of Netu’a. Another settler, who preferred anonymity, Israeli media said, highlighted the dangers faced by children in the region: 'Why would I expose my children to such danger? I grew up like this, with my father killed in Lebanon and the constant threat of rockets. I don’t want my children to live this way.' ⚡️JUST IN: Haifa is turning into a ghost town, and the Israeli army radio reports that more than a million settlers ran to shelters after Hezbollah launched a rocket at Haifa and the north, just a short while ago. pic.twitter.com/x2QQ9jBmrl — Suppressed News. (@SuppressedNws) September 29, 2024 Benny Cohen, a soldier from Netu’a, expressed resistance to evacuation: 'I don’t believe in leaving. If we abandon our homes, it signals the end of the Zionist project. We must stay here, even under threat, to ensure the future of settlements.' Ron Avman, a former IOF commander, echoed the loss of confidence: 'Before October 7, parents in the north trusted the IDF for protection. Now, that trust is broken. If we don’t investigate this thoroughly and learn, we may never rebuild it.' Local northern authorities have rejected military calls for settlers to return, deeming them irresponsible and endangering lives. Ongoing attacks from Hezbollah underscore the fragility of Israeli assurances, casting doubt on any notion of peace and security in the region, Israeli media reported. Resistance Strengthens Its Grip on Northern Occupied Territories Islamic Resistance forces continue their attacks, dispelling Israeli leaders' promises to settlers about returning safely. Statements by Israeli officials paint a picture of stability, but field realities suggest otherwise, as the Resistance exerts control over the northern border. IOF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi recently suggested a gradual return of residents in the coming months, yet these remain 'pipe dreams' given the Resistance’s determination to disrupt them. In northern occupied territories, many settlers are hesitant to return, citing the continuous threat of rocket fire and lack of reliable protection. Halevi’s meetings with local leaders failed to assuage fears or encourage resettlement, as heavy rocket barrages persist. Just yesterday, resistance fire rained on Haifa Bay and Sharon, with around seventy missiles and numerous drones targeting strategic locations despite Israeli airstrikes. Israeli Media Highlights Security Concerns in the North Israeli news channel correspondent Uria Keshet noted that Hezbollah has managed to maintain its attacks despite intensified Israeli ground and air operations. Meanwhile, Channel 13 military correspondent Or Heller reported that while the ground operation is nearing its end, a strategic deadlock remains. Israeli forces are hesitant to conclude their ground operation without political progress, aware that northern residents are unlikely to return without robust security guarantees. The ongoing resistance operations cast doubt on Israel’s efforts to secure its northern regions. With the possibility of a ceasefire being discussed, Israeli leaders are insisting on the right to intervene, signaling an uncertain path ahead for northern settlements.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2262834	2024-11-10T11:57:51-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/11/manar-08607740016993491181.jpg

The Syrian Ministry of Defense reported that an Israeli airstrike targeted a residential building in the Sayyida Zeinab area near Damascus on Sunday resulting in civilian casualties and significant damage. According to the ministry, the attack took place around 5:00 PM local time and was launched from the occupied Syrian Golan Heights.

A Syrian military source confirmed that these attacks resulted in injuries to several soldiers and caused material damage. Explosions were heard near the al-Safira area southeast of Aleppo, where multiple sites were targeted. The Syrian Foreign Ministry condemned the repeated Israeli attacks, asserting that the continued targeting of civilian areas by the Israeli Occupation Forces reflects a lack of serious international efforts to curb such aggression. The ministry renewed its call for the United Nations to take immediate action to halt these assaults and hold those responsible to account.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2262779	2024-11-10T09:58:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-00847950017312614597.jpg
Israeli Occupation Forces Carry Out More Massacres in Northern Ga...	On the 401st day of Israel’s aggression against Gaza, it has become clear that the enemy is committing acts of extermination against the people of the north, witnessed by the world. Even Israeli media has admitted this, with Haaretz reporting that the commander of the 162nd division confirmed executing 'ethnic cleansing' operations in northern Gaza, preventing Palestinians from returning under orders from the military and political leadership. For 37 days, nothing has been spared from destruction—people, homes, and even animals—amid the use of internationally banned weapons. In this context, Hamas' Al-Qassam Brigades announced on Sunday that its fighters targeted and killed a 15-soldier Israeli patrol with RPGs and light weapons west of Sheikh Zayed, in northern Gaza. The brigades also hit two Israeli military vehicles with 'Yassin 105' and 'Tandem' rockets and destroyed a bulldozer near the Al-Qassam mosque in Jabaliya camp.

A young man was martyred in the ongoing Israeli shelling of the camp. Additionally, five Palestinians were martyred and others injured in an Israeli airstrike on a house near Al-Salam Mosque in the Sabra neighborhood, south of Gaza City. Rescue operations are still underway for missing persons. On the other hand, Israeli warboats fired several shells towards the shores of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip. A Palestinian martyr was reported and others injured as a result of an Israeli airstrike on a house in the Old Gaza Street in northern Gaza City. Israeli enemy warboats also targeted the area west of the Nusseirat Refugee Camp in central Gaza. Additionally, a young man from the Al-Shaboura Refugee Camp was martyred due to Israeli shelling on the city of Rafah. Hamas Urges Arab Leaders to Act Against Gaza Genocide Hamas condemned the Alloush family massacre in Jabalia as further proof of Israeli enemy's ethnic cleansing efforts against the besieged population in northern Gaza. The group called on Arab and Islamic leaders to take a firm stance, demanding urgent international intervention to halt the genocide and hold Israeli war criminals accountable. Popular Front: Jabalia Massacre a Stain on Arab Regimes The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced the Jabalia massacre as a shameful mark on Arab governments and the international community. It accused the US of playing a central role in the ongoing genocide, as the global silence and complicity continue. Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor Warns of Imminent Hunger Crisis The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor demanded that the famine be recognized officially, emphasizing that 'Israel' continues to use starvation as a weapon. The group noted that 'more than 50 days have passed since the occupation blocked aid to the besieged people in the north,' adding that 'tens of thousands of Palestinians in the north are facing the imminent threat of death by hunger.' The Monitor stressed that 'the world bears responsibility for the hunger crisis created by the occupation in Gaza,' warning that 'the famine crisis in Gaza has reached a point of no return.' This comes as Israeli Channel 11 reported that Netanyahu’s government is concerned that a potential famine declaration by the World Health Organization could lead to sanctions on 'Israel' and an arms export ban.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2262735	2024-11-10T09:11:38-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-03554820017312583591.png
Day 49: Israeli Enemy Commits Massacres Across Lebanon to Conceal...	The Israeli enemy persisted for the 49th day in its relentless assault on Lebanon, unleashing a deadly campaign against innocent civilians, marked by unmatched brutality and senseless destruction. Yet, even by its own admission, it has spectacularly failed to achieve its main goal: ensuring the safe return of northern settlers. Highlighting this failure, the head of the settlement council in Zar’it, northern occupied Palestine, admitted, 'We do not feel safe, and the army’s operations in Lebanon are insufficient to give us a sense of security and allow us to return home.' Horrific Maacre in Almat, Jbeil District Even in so-called 'safe areas,' where hundreds of displaced people have sought refuge from its aggression in the Bekaa Valley, the south, and Beirut's southern suburbs, the Israeli enemy continues to perpetrate horrific massacres. On Sunday, Israeli warplanes targeted a house sheltering displaced families in the town of Almat (Jbeil district), resulting in a massacre that claimed 24 lives, including seven children, and left several others injured. Video Captures Aftermath of Israeli Strike on Almat, Jbeil The Lebanese Ministry of Health issued a statement updating the toll: 24 martyrs, including seven children, and six wounded. The ministry added, 'Efforts to clear the rubble are still ongoing.' Israeli Aggression on South Lebanon Israeli occupation warplanes also launched an airstrike on the town of Adloun, targeting an Islamic Health Organization vehicle, resulting in the martyrdom of three paramedics. Meanwhile, Israeli enemy aircraft bombed the town of Sarafand in the Sidon district. In the town of Jdeidet Marjeyoun, Israeli occupation airstrikes targeted two vehicles, while Israeli jets also attacked the town of Al-Wazzani. Since morning, the town of Khiyam has been subject to intermittent artillery shelling, while the towns of Beit Leif and Ain Ebel in the Bint Jbeil district were also shelled by Israeli forces. An Israeli occupation drone also carried out a guided missile strike on the area between the towns of Kfarsir and Sir Al-Gharbiyeh. In the Nabatieh district, another Israeli drone targeted the area between the towns of Kfar Tibnit and Arnoun. Additionally, enemy aircraft launched a strike on a house in the Al-Saha neighborhood of Zawtar Al-Gharbiyeh, completely destroying it. Additionally, the southern and eastern outskirts of the town of Yohmor Al-Shakif were shelled, with the attack hitting the center of the town.

Hezbollah’s Martyred Leader Sayyed Nasrallah Exposed Futility of ...	Iran's Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf has asserted that the martyrdom of former Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has revealed the futility of compromise in the face of the Zionist regime.

Israel’s Attorney General Gives Authority to Investigate Netanyah...	Israeli Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara permitted authorities to investigate Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office for the leak of secret security documents from his office, local media said Friday. The security scandal comes as Netanyahu's government is facing a series of political and security crises, including the dismissal of defense chief Yoav Gallant, which has triggered significant opposition, as well as Israel’s attacks against the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. The Maariv newspaper said the green light by Baharav-Miara means that investigating authorities are also allowed to investigate Netanyahu. If the investigation finds involvement by Netanyahu in any security-related cases, investigators must halt the probe until they obtain permission again to continue from the Attorney General, according to Israeli legal procedures. Netanyahu's office is yet to comment on the report by Maariv. Israeli domestic security agency, Shin Bet, announced the arrest Sunday of four people, including a spokesperson for Netanyahu, concerning security documents leaks related to the war on Gaza. The Haaretz newspaper also published Sunday details of a scandal involving Netanyahu that is related to the appointment of a spokesperson who took part in 'sensitive security sessions.' An aide to Netanyahu is one of several suspects arrested for an alleged security breach that involved leaking top secret intelligence, Israeli officials said. 'Israel' has continued a devastating offensive on Gaza since an attack by the Palestinian resistance group, Hamas, on Oct. 7, 2023. The ensuing Israeli war has killed more than 43,500 people and rendered the enclave almost uninhabitable. 'Israel' faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its actions in the blockaded enclave.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2261294	2024-11-08T14:27:05-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-03862980017311048201.jpg

He said the operation not only demonstrated Iran's overwhelming missile capabilities, but also its unwavering support for the Palestinian resistance, even in the face of adversity. The strikes were in retaliation for Israel's assassinations of senior Hamas and Hezbollah leaders. 'In the course of Operation True Promise II, we even attacked the Zionists' base at Netzarim in the heart of Gaza,' Salami said, emphasizing that all these territories belong to the Muslim world. The IRGC chief warned that attacks on Israeli ports and disruption of the Mediterranean Sea could cripple the Israeli economy, which he said is heavily dependent on maritime trade. He claimed the U.S. has been unable to provide sufficient support to prop up its 'vassal regime' in Israel, whose military is now a 'drained force.' Salami boasted that Iran has only utilized a small portion of its military capacities, while its enemies have exhausted theirs. He suggested the results of the recent U.S. presidential election showed that the Palestinian resistance has the power to influence American politics, as voters rejected candidates who 'armed the Zionists' killing machine.' The IRGC commander concluded that the new US administration's only option is to scale down aid to ‘Israel’, as any expansion of the conflict will further erode America's credibility and interests.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2260975	2024-11-08T05:26:44-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/04/manar-06334020017123167677.jpg

In a post on X, Schoof said he spoke with his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu and assured him 'the perpetrators will be tracked down and prosecuted'. Geert Wilders, an anti-Muslim and pro-Israel leader of the largest party in the Dutch government, called the riots a 'pogrom' and a 'Jewish hunt'. He also failed to mention the attacks by the Israeli hooligans and instead called for the arrest and deportation of what he described as the 'multicultural scum' involved in the clashes. Israeli occupation authorities ordered that two planes be sent to the Dutch capital to bring the Israelis to the Zionist entity. 'The Prime Minister has directed that two rescue planes be sent immediately to assist our citizens,' said a statement from Benjamin Netanyahu's office Following the incidents in Amsterdam, Israeli occupation army said it was barring soldiers from flying to the Netherlands until further notice.

Sayyed Houthi: Neither Trump, Nor Any World Criminal Can Prevent ...	Head of Yemen's Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi stressed Thursday that the Yemeni attacks on the US-UK-Zionist vessels in addition to the Israeli targets in Occupied Palestine would continue despite the attempts to disguise the possession of the ships. In a televised speech, Sayyed Houthi underscored that this decision is resolute regardless of the results of the US elections, adding that some Arab regimes are raising their people fears of the US President-elect Donald Trump. 'We, in Yemen, had an experience with Trump, and he failed to impose his terms on Iran, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine. Trump only managed to reap billions of dollars from the rich Arab states.' All the US presidents have just served the Israeli interests, recalling the failure of the 'deal of the century'. Yemen insists on supporting the Palestinian people regardless of any military escalation against it, Houthi said, adding that the best choice for the US administration is to end the Zionist wars on Lebanon and Gaza, while aggression and sedition are futile. Sayyed Houthi also underlined the crisis plaguing the Zionist entity manifested by the economic deterioration, dismissal of the defense minister, and the military recruitment after the loss of thousands of soldiers and officers in the battles. Houthi highlighted Hezbollah's remarkable support for Gaza, adding that the Israelis were surprised by Hezbollah great capabilities in the ground battle. The Yemeni leader reiterated that the former Secretary General of Hezbollah Martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah is a rare and historical figure, adding that, on His Arbaeen, the Islamic Resistance carried out a major operation against Tel Aviv. Houthi also stressed that the operations carried out by the Iraqi resistance groups would continue despite all the media and political pressure aimed at stopping them. Sayyed Houthi also maintained that the reluctance of the Arabs and Muslims in supporting Gaza reflects the moral and humanitarian deterioration, stressing that the West would respect the Umma if it assumed its responsibilities. Yemeni Armed Forces spokesperson Brigadier General Yahya Saree has announced that the naval blockade on Israeli interests will remain in effect until military actions in Gaza and Lebanon end.

Leader Hails Sayyed Nasrallah for Growing Hezbollah Too Strong	The Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, has attributed Hezbollah's extraordinary transformation from a small group of fighters into a formidable organization to the bravery, tactics, patience, and faith of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Khamenei hailed the late Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah for his bravery and wisdom to make the movement grow too powerful. — Mehr News Agency (@MehrnewsCom) November 7, 2024 Imam Khamenei praised Nasrallah's exceptional leadership, noting that despite the enemy's material and propaganda weapons, Hezbollah has achieved remarkable evolution, forcing the 'enemy to retreat and defeat it.' Dismissing rumors of Hezbollah's weakening after the martyrdom of its leaders, Khamenei asserted that the resistance group remains strong and continues its fight. The Leader also paid tribute to other resistance martyrs, including Hezbollah Head of Executive Council Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, and Abbas Nilforoushan, stating that they have bestowed upon Islam dignity, honor, strength, and power. 'During these many years and nearly 40 years, Hezbollah once forced the Zionist regime to retreat from Beirut, once from Saida, once from the city of Tyre, and once from southern Lebanon and entirely from the cities, villages and highlands of Lebanon, which means its capability has increased over time,' the Leader said. Imam Khamenei also praised Hamas, saying the Palestinian resistance group's continued fight against Israel indicates the regime has been defeated. 'The Zionist regime intended to eliminate Hamas but has been unable to do so after massacring so many people, and showed their ugly face to the whole world, and proved their wickedness to everyone. 'They think they have martyred Hamas and resistance leaders, and that Hamas is finished but Hamas is still fighting and resisting. This means the failure of the Zionist regime,' the Leader added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2259699	2024-11-07T06:23:15-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-09081710017309893906.jpg
Violent Strikes on Day 46 of Israeli Aggression on Lebanon	The Israeli enemy went ahead with its brutal aggression on Lebanon, with violent raids targeting regions of south Lebanon, Dahiyeh, Mount Lebanon and Bekaa. After a deadly day in Bekaa that claimed lives of at least 40 people and wounded 53 others on Wednesday, Israeli warplanes stage violent raids on Dahiyeh (Beirut’s southern suburb) overnight. The strikes on Dahiyeh targeted areas of Haret Hreik, Al-Qaem, Tahweetat Al-Ghadeer and Al-Ouza’i near Beirut International Airport. The raids were violent that they were heard in Beirut and Mount Lebanon, local media reported. The video below shows several scenes that were taken to the powerful strikes on Dahiyeh early on Thursday.

Islamic Resistance Operations Room Vows Commitment to Path of loy...	The Islamic Resistance fighters continued their stand against the 'Israeli' aggression on Lebanon, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy army in both equipment and personnel, from officers to soldiers, along the front lines and into the depths of occupied Palestine, according to a statement issued by the Islamic Resistance Operations Room regarding the field developments in the 'The Formidable in Might' battle. The statement detailed the achievements, made by the Resistance fighters repelling the ground offensive of the Zionist enemy against South Lebanon border villages, as well as the long-range missile and drone attacks on the Zionist occupation's military camps, settlements and cities, as follows. 1- Ground Engagements: • On 28-10-2024, the 'Israeli' enemy army initiated a large-scale advancement towards the town of Al-Khiam, with extensive personnel and vehicles, under heavy air cover over the surrounding area. Enemy forces positioned themselves on forward posts in Tel Nahas, Al-Hamames, and Al-Majidiya Plain. In line with pre-established defense plans and after closely monitoring potential advancement routes, the Islamic Resistance fighters implemented a defensive fire strategy, anchored in synchronized and concentrated rocket and artillery strikes. More than 70 targeting operations were executed over three consecutive days (50 of them on the town's southern and eastern edges), resulting in the destruction of four tanks with guided missiles, killing and injuring their crews. A soldier position in Al-Metula settlement was targeted with a guided missile, causing fatalities and injuries, in addition to targeting a security group in Tel Nahas. The Military Media showcased footage documenting the hit. The most significant of these operations was the accurate rocket barrage that struck large gatherings of enemy soldiers and vehicles in the Wadi Al-Asafir area, southeast of the town, using high-precision missiles with warheads weighing 250 kg of high-explosives. The massive explosions and numerous casualties triggered panic and disorder among the enemy ranks. In addition to targeting enemy movements within Lebanese territory, strategic strikes were conducted in the rear areas supporting the enemy assault, specifically: - Targeting the enemy's security forces in Al-Metula and surrounding orchards with 11 concentrated rocket barrages and artillery shells, resulting in confirmed hits. - Striking a training camp, fire bases, and command centers in Ayelet HaShahar, rocket fire bases in Yesud HaMa'ala, an armored gathering in Sha'al, and command centers in Shamir with 23 rocket barrages. - On the night of Thursday, 31-10-2024, the 'Israeli' forces were forced to retreat beyond the borders, evacuating their dead and wounded via helicopters and deploying special vehicles to extract the destroyed tanks. • During an attempted 'Israeli' advancement towards the village of Houla on Saturday, our fighters detected a full battalion-sized convoy of 40 military vehicles (including tanks, armored carriers, and troop transports) led by two bulldozers aimed at clearing paths for advancing into the town center. Upon reaching our fighters' range, the bulldozers were struck by two Kornet anti-armor missiles, destroying them and resulting in casualties. Under heavy 'Israeli' artillery cover, the convoy retreated to the town's eastern border. Once the convoy regrouped, it was struck by three rocket barrages at five-minute intervals with over 60 rockets, achieving the intended results. • Due to repeated and severe strikes by the Resistance, 'Israeli' forces were unable to establish stable positions within the border villages, prompting a withdrawal to positions behind the borders. These villages, such as Aita al-Shaab, Ramiya, Meiss Al-Jabal, Blida, and Al-Khiam, are now subject to extensive sweeping operations from border sites, artillery bases, and airstrikes.  Meanwhile, ongoing confrontations are being managed in response to persistent 'Israeli' attempts to encircle the town of Naqoura in the western sector, as well as a thwarted infiltration attempt in the Wazzani area in the eastern sector, which was targeted with a rocket barrage that forced the enemy to withdraw.  2. Khaibar Operations Series: - Despite intense surveillance and continuous activity by the 'Israeli' Air Force, the Resistance has intensified its precise and deliberate strikes against strategic 'Israeli' centers, facilities, and bases as part of the 'Khaibar' operations series, reaching a depth of up to 145 km within occupied Palestine using advanced missiles and drones. - These focused and calculated strikes are executed with a clear plan, complete control over the field, and a measured evaluation of the front’s developments. - Since the launch of the 'Khaibar' series on 01-10-2024, 56 operations have been carried out, with 18 of them occurring in the past week. - These operations have achieved military objectives, and over 2 million settlers across an area of more than 5,000 km², reaching up to 145 km inside occupied Palestine, have been repeatedly forced into shelters, halting education, work, and air traffic with each operation. 3. The Islamic Resistance Operations Room emphasized the following: - The 'Khaibar' operations series continues to escalate with a clear vision and management that ensures effective targeting as specified by the Resistance leadership. - Settlers who have been warned to evacuate their settlements are advised not to return, as these areas have become military targets, housing command centers, barracks, factories, artillery stations, rocket bases, and logistical service stations for forces attacking Lebanese lands. - The only achievement by the 'Israeli' army in what it calls the 'ground maneuver' is the destruction of civilian homes, infrastructure, and the leveling of agricultural lands in border towns. - Recent weeks have proven that the Resistance’s formations have successfully organized their structures at various levels, as evidenced by the increased frequency of missile and assault drone launches at various targets within the temporary entity, reaching as far as Tel Aviv. - Our fighters on the southern frontline have, through their precise and repeated strikes and high capacity to counter the enemy’s advances and destroy their tanks and vehicles, forced the 'Israeli' enemy forces to remain restricted to the frontline villages, preventing them from advancing toward the second-tier villages or approaching the Litani River. On the fortieth commemoration of our most revered and honored martyr, His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, may his pure spirit be blessed, the Islamic Resistance affirms its steadfast commitment to the blood of its martyrs. It remains resolute in achieving the objectives for which they sacrificed, foremost among them the dignity of its resilient people, and the freedom and sovereignty of its nation. The Resistance pledges to its Secretary-General, His Eminence Sheikh Naim Qassem, may Allah preserve him, to remain unwavering on the path of loyalty until victory is achieved by Allah's permission. On Martyr Sayyed Nasrallah’s Arbaeen, the Islamic Resistance conspicuously showed its capability and readiness to defend Lebanon against the barbaric Zionist war, bombarding Tel Aviv with waves of heavy rockets and striking Israeli military bases and gatherings in the occupied North and Golan.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2259215	2024-11-06T14:19:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-08559660017297117333.jpg

Israeli PM Netanyahu Fires Defense Minister Gallant; Opposition, ...	Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he has fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who is set to be replaced by Israel Katz, Israel's foreign minister, Haaretz reported. In a statement, Netanyahu stated that while there had been productive cooperation in the early months of the war, significant differences in strategy had emerged between him and Gallant in recent months. 'At a time of war, full trust between the prime minister and the defense minister is critical,' Netanyahu said. 'Unfortunately, this trust has eroded, and attempts to bridge the gaps have failed.' He noted that the differences were not only made public in an 'unacceptable manner' but had also reached Israel's enemies, who had 'derived great benefit' from the situation. Netanyahu announced that Israel Katz, a veteran politician and former minister of foreign affairs, finance, and intelligence, would replace Gallant as defense minister. Describing Katz as a 'bulldozer' with a combination of 'responsibility and quiet determination,' Netanyahu praised his extensive experience and leadership, saying Katz was well-equipped to lead the defense effort during this critical period. Gideon Sa'ar, who was a minister without a portfolio, will assume the role of foreign minister, it added. The Israeli media mentioned that Netanyahu informed Gallant that he would sack him 10 minutes before issuing the decision, adding that the meeting between the two Zionist officials lasted only for three minutes. Israeli media mentioned that, following the dismissal of 'Defense Minister' [War Minister] Yoav Gallant, calls were made to take to the streets as of 9:00 pm. The headquarters of the families of 'Israeli' captives in the Gaza Strip considered that the dismissal of the 'Defense Minister' [War Minister] is a direct continuation of efforts to sabotage the captive exchange deal. Head of the Israeli opposition, Yair Lapid, said that Gallant dismissal endangers entire 'Israel' for the sake of shameful political leverage. Former 'Israeli' War Minister 'Avigdor Lieberman' said that, if the Defense Minister can be replaced in the midst of a war, then it is also possible to replace a Prime Minister who has failed in his duties and neglected 'the country’s' security, and certainly to establish a governmental investigative committee. Yair Golan, who heads Israel's new center-left party The Democrats, took to X to urge Israelis to take to the streets in protest. In late March, thousands protested spontaneously against Netanyahu's decision to fire Gallant, which was ultimately rescinded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2257147	2024-11-05T11:24:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-082230800173083465010.png

What to Know About US Knife-Edge Presidential Race: Harris or Tru...	Millions of voters across the United States gear up to cast their ballots on Tuesday as Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump go head-to-head in a race that remains too close to call. With the country stretching across six time zones, Election Day is a massive undertaking – and voting will begin as early as 5am EST (10:00 GMT) and go as late as 1am (06:00 GMT) on Wednesday. Polls show Harris, 60, who is the current vice-president and Trump, 78, who is a former president, running neck and neck nationally and in the battleground states or the 'swing states' (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin). More than 78 million voters have already cast ballots, according to Election Lab at the University of Florida. Voters will also elect 34 US senators (out of 100) and all 435 members for the US House of Representatives, among other posts that are up for grabs. Final Calls In the final days of their campaigns, both hopefuls were flooding social media sites, TV and radio stations with a last round of campaign ads, and racing to knock on doors and make calls. Harris ended her campaign in Philadelphia, where she doubled down on the economy, and outlined her plan to 'build an economy where we bring down the cost of living'. Harris speaks during a final rally in Pennsylvania (November 4, 2024). Among the measures she intends to implement, she listed a ban on corporate price gouging on groceries; cutting taxes for workers, middle-class families and small businesses; and lowering healthcare costs, including the cost of home care for seniors. Trump predicted the 'greatest victory' in his closing argument in Michigan. He linked immigration to a high crime rate, blending claims about voter fraud with warnings about migrants committing crimes and promises to revitalize the United States. 'Over the past four years, Americans have suffered one catastrophic failure, betrayal and humiliation after another,' Trump said. Trump speaks during his final campaign rally at Michigan (November 5, 2024). Positions on Foreign Policy The presidential candidates diverge on most of the policies related to key issues including economy, immigration, foreign policy, democracy, abortion and many others. Harris and Trump offer two starkly different visions for the US’ foreign policy. The Democratic candidate has fully aligned herself with the Biden administration’s response to the Russia-Ukraine war, while the republican candidate vowed to 'fundamentally re-evaluate' the country’s approach on the US aid to Ukraine and claimed that he will end the nearly three-year war on his first day in office On the situation in Palestine and Lebanon, or what the US calls the 'Middle East crisis', Harris vowed to back the Zionist entity’s so-called 'right to defend itself', and ensure ‘Israel’ has the ability to do so, rejecting the arms embargo. She also pledged to work to end the war in Gaza and to 'allow Palestinians to realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.'

Nothing. pic.twitter.com/kvnp6I4fEh — Globe Eye News (@GlobeEyeNews) November 1, 2024 When is Election Result Expected? In some presidential elections the victor has been named late on election night, or early the next morning. However, the Presidential hopefuls are running neck and neck in this year’s race, meaning that in many states media outlets may wait longer before projecting who has won. Narrow victories could also mean recounts. In the key swing state of Pennsylvania, for example, a state-wide recount would be required if there’s a half-percentage-point difference between the votes cast for the winner and loser. In 2020, the margin was just over 1.1 percentage points. Legal challenges are also possible. More than 100 pre-election lawsuits have already been filed, including challenges to voter eligibility and voter roll management, by Republicans.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2256685	2024-11-05T03:30:26-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-04635410017308061888.jpg

The Israeli occupation has been scaling up the attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank, with arrest campaign in several areas and assaults on the Palestinian olive season going ahead.

Similar attacks were reported south of Al-Khalil (Hebron), with Palestinian media saying the Israeli occupation army prevented two families from reaching their land in the area. Olive cultivation is crucial in the Palestinian economy and is used for oil, soap and table olives among other things. About 80,000 to 100,000 Palestinian families rely on the olive harvest for their income, which takes place between October and November. Earlier, Israelis settlers raided the West Bank city of Al-Bireh overnight and set around 15 vehicles on fire, Palestinian media reports.

'This assault is viewed as an extension of widespread settler crimes across the West Bank, including occupied Jerusalem, and as a replication of the genocide and forced displacement campaign endured by the Palestinian people in Gaza, which has persisted unabated for 395 days,' it said.

‘Israel’ Officially Terminates UNRWA Work, Informs UN	Israeli Foreign Ministry on Monday officially has informed the United Nations that the Zionist entity is withdrawing from the 1967 agreement recognizing the Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, a new proof that the occupation regime takes no account of the international bodies run by the United Nations. Foreign Ministry Director-General Jacob Blitshtein sent the letter to UN General Assembly President Philemon Yang of Cameroon, informing him of the Israeli move. 'Israel will continue to work with international partners, including other United Nations agencies, to ensure the facilitation of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not undermine Israel’s security. Israel expects the United Nations to contribute to and cooperate in this effort,' the letter read.

The bill takes effect in three months, according to Israeli media. Commenting on the Israeli move, the UN agency said on Monday that the Israeli ban on its operations would lead to the 'collapse' of humanitarian work in the war-torn Gaza Strip. 'If this law is implemented, it would be likely to cause the collapse of the international humanitarian operation in the Gaza Strip - an operation of which UNRWA is the backbone,' Jonathan Fowler, a UNRWA spokesman, told AFP. The Zionist entity has been for months launching a campaign aimed at defaming the UNRWA, by propagating allegations that the international body has links to October 7 attacks. Last January, Carrie Keller-Lynn, who served in the Israeli occupation army, wrote an article claiming alleged connections between UNRWA staff and fighters who took part in October 7 Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. The story prompted many countries to halt funding to the UN agency.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2255849	2024-11-04T04:24:19-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/03/manar-00602030017100139095.jpeg

What’s New in the Ongoing Israeli 42-Day Offensive on Lebanon?	Following over a month of operations in southern Lebanon, Israel’s military offensive has shown limited success, as indicated by recent events in Khiyam, South of Lebanon. On Sunday, Al-Manar correspondent confirmed that the town was completely cleared of Israeli soldiers after a week of intense clashes with Lebanese resistance forces. Amid this military stalemate, Israeli forces have escalated attacks against civilian areas across Lebanon, spanning from southern villages to Baalbek and the Bekaa Valley, as well as the southern suburbs of Beirut. The aerial raids have left dozens dead, hundreds injured, and caused widespread destruction to homes and infrastructure. In the Bekaa region, the Israeli military threatened to strike five buildings within Baalbek and Douris. This threat materialized when Israeli forces launched air raids on Baalbek, hitting Douris near the old municipality building and the Al-Rida Restaurant near the governmental hospital. Additional raids were reported on the outskirts of Mashghara and Labaya in western Bekaa. Baalbek Governmental Hospital’s director, Dr. Abbas Shukr, assured the public that despite damage from nearby airstrikes, the hospital remains fully operational. 'We will replace the shattered glass within 24 hours, and our work continues without obstruction,' he stated. In southern Lebanon, Israeli warplanes carried out intensive airstrikes, targeting areas like Qaq’iyat al-Sanbar and al-Bissariyeh. According to the Ministry of Public Health’s Emergency Operations Center, a raid on Haret Saida resulted in three fatalities and nine injuries. Another airstrike on a house in Joaya killed two and wounded others, who were transferred to Tyre Hospital. Additional strikes hit the outskirts of Al-Bazouriya and Al-Burj Al-Shamali in Tyre District. Reports from local sources detail further casualties in Jabal Al-Batm, where two individuals lost their lives. Additional raids targeted homes in Arabsalim and Ghazieh, Sidon District, leaving one dead and others injured. In Tyre District, attacks continued, including raids on Tyre Park, Qana, and nearby towns, as well as the Burj al-Shamali-al-Bazourieh highway, though no injuries were reported. In al-Bazourieh, a center for the Islamic Health Authority was also struck, prompting a response from Islamic Message Scouts ambulances to assess the scene. In Khiyam, where resistance forces made advances, the International Red Cross and Lebanese Red Cross began evacuating two families, about 20 people, whose home was destroyed in an airstrike last week. At least 20 confirmed dead at the scene of a massacre in the southern Lebanese town of Khiam. Any prior attempt to rescue them was impossible until 3 Nov., as Israel 'refused to grant access.' — مهى 🍉 🇱🇧 🇵🇸🇾🇪 (@Taltool11) November 3, 2024 The Lebanese Red Cross has also started recovering bodies from the rubble in Wata al-Khiam, where 15 Lebanese and one Syrian victim remain.

Horrifying Situation in Northern Gaza on Day 394 of Brutal Israel...	The Israeli genocidal war on Gaza, today in its 394th day, hasn’t spared a polio vaccination center, as the occupation tightens the siege on the strip’s north. The UN announced on Sunday that polio vaccination center and the car of UN aid official involved in this weekend’s vaccination campaign came under Israeli fire despite a promised 'humanitarian pause' in bombardment. Catherine Russell, the executive director of the UN child support and protection agency UNICEF, said: 'At least three children were reportedly injured by another attack in the proximity of a vaccination clinic in Sheikh Radwan, while a polio vaccination campaign was under way.' This has already been a deadly weekend of attacks in North Gaza. Attacks on civilians, including humanitarian workers, and what remains of Gaza’s civilian facilities and infrastructure must stop. My statement👇 — Catherine Russell (@unicefchief) November 2, 2024 She added that the personal car of a UNICEF employee working on the polio vaccine campaign 'came under fire by what we believe to be a quadcopter'. Russel said that in the previous 48-hour period, more than 50 children had been martyred in the Jabalia refugee camp, a focus of Israeli military operations over the past month. 'The attacks on Jabalia, the vaccination clinic and the UNICEF staff member are yet further examples of the grave consequences of the indiscriminate strikes on civilians in the Gaza Strip,' Russell said. Meanwhile, media reports described the situation in northern Gaza Strip as horrifying, with people have been for at least three week left without food, medicine or even clean water, amid heavy bombardment of the area. Palestinian media reported that some people in Beit Lahia and Jabalia were still under rubble, as the Israeli occupation have been preventing health workers from reaching the scene of the attacks. Palestinian Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmoud Basal told Al Jazeera on Sunday that Israeli forces have been preventing medical supplies and their equipment from reaching northern Gaza. 'We call on the world to work to enable the civil defense to reach the northern Gaza Strip,' he said.

Gaza Under Siege: Israel’s Relentless Assault on Palestinian Live...	As the Israeli military's aggression against the besieged Gaza Strip continues unabated, a devastating toll is being extracted on the Palestinian people. In the central Gaza region, five Palestinians were martyred and many more were injured in the latest Israeli bombardment of several homes in the Nuseirat refugee camp. Palestinian media outlets reported the arrival of three martyrs and a number of wounded individuals at the al-Awda Hospital after the Israeli occupation forces shelled the Al-Assar family's residence in Nuseirat's Camp 5.

Two of these operations were focused on the occupied Syrian Golan, an area of critical importance to the Israeli regime. The remaining strikes were spread throughout the northern occupied territories, often referred to as al-Jalil, where two vital targets were successfully engaged. Further south, the Resistance also targeted sites in the occupied Umm al-Rashrash, or Eilat, region along the Red Sea coast. The final two operations struck at the heart of the central occupied territories, demonstrating the Resistance's ability to reach deep into the enemy's strongholds.

Leader: US and ‘Israel’ Will Receive Jaw-Breaking Response	The Leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, has issued a stark warning to the United States and ‘Israel’, declaring that they will 'definitely receive a teeth-breaking response' for their atrocities. 'The enemies, both the US and the Zionist regime, should know that they will definitely receive a teeth-breaking response for what they are doing against Iran and the resistance front,' he said in a meeting with students on Saturday. 📸 Meeting with students Imam Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, met with a group of students of all ages including university students from across the country in the Imam Khomeini Hussainiyah on Nov. 2, 2024. 🔽 pic.twitter.com/40Ujedtz7t — Khamenei Media (@Khamenei_m) November 2, 2024 Iranian officials have pledged to avenge Israel’s act of aggression targeting two Iranian border cities, Ilam and Khuzestan, as well as central Tehran in the early hours of October 26. 'This is not merely a matter of revenge but a logical action—an approach aligned with religion, ethics, and the Sharia, in accordance with international regulations,' Ayatollah Khamenei said. The Leader made the statements during the occasion to mark the US embassy takeover by Iranian students on November 4, 1979, known as the National Day of the Fight against Global Arrogance. 'We are certainly doing everything necessary to prepare the Iranian nation to stand against arrogance, whether in terms of military readiness, armaments, or political actions, and thank God, our officials are currently engaged in this,' the Leader said. The overall movement of the Iranian people and the country’s officials, he said, is 'definitely and justly aimed at confronting global arrogance and the criminal apparatus that rules today’s world order. Rest assured, there will be no negligence in this regard.' 'The Iranian people and the country’s officials will not hesitate or neglect this course. Rest assured.' He also referenced the US embassy takeover, saying it was not merely a site for diplomatic and intelligence activity, but rather the headquarters of plotting to destroy the Islamic Revolution. Iranian students took over the embassy in Tehran, also known in Iran as the 'Den of Espionage,' less than a year after the Islamic Revolution toppled the US-backed Pahlavi dictatorship in 1979. Every year on the 13th day of the Iranian month of Aban, the Iranian nation, particularly the students, commemorate the event by staging rallies across the country, calling on all Muslims and freedom-seeking nations to resist against arrogant powers and not to succumb to their bullying. 'For the Iranian nation, inspired by Islamic teachings, standing up against oppression is a duty. Confronting arrogance is a duty. Arrogance means comprehensive economic, military, and cultural domination and the humiliation of nations,' Ayatollah Khamenei noted. He added that the Iranian people had been humiliated for years and, therefore, will certainly continue their struggle against global arrogance. Imam Khamenei emphasized that the Iranian nation's rational, wise, and logical movement, aligned with human, Islamic, and international principles in confronting arrogance, must continue. 'The continuation of the Iranian nation’s path in confronting arrogance requires knowledge, thought, technology, and a roadmap,' the Leader said. Imam Khamenei also touched on longstanding US enmities toward the Iranian nation, saying, 'The effort of historians who distort facts is to claim that the conflict between Iran and the United States began on November 4, 1979. This is a lie. The Americans clashed with the Iranian nation from the very start of the Revolution, even from years before, doing everything they could against Iranian nation.' 'American involvement and efforts in Iran were extensive, even before August 19, 1953,' he said, referring to a CIA-orchestrated coup in Iran that overthrew the democratically elected government of Dr. Mohammad Mosaddeq. 'However, the clearest evidence was on August 19. A national, popular government was in power in Iran, but the Americans entered the field, betraying the trust of a government that had naively trusted them. They overthrew that government and established the oppressive rule of the Shah. For many years, the Iranian nation directly experienced America’s enmity.' He said that the Americans staged a coup in Iran, set up SAVAK in the 1950s, and established a center of torture and pressure on fighters and freedom-seekers. So many young people, faithful individuals, and freedom-lovers were either killed, mutilated, or tortured by SAVAK’s criminal agents—the so-called Shah’s intelligence agency, he added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2253880	2024-11-02T04:08:02-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-01044380017305456783.jpg
New Scandal Engulfs Netanyahu after Close Aide Arrested for Alleg...	An aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is one of several suspects arrested for an alleged security breach that involved leaking top secret intelligence, Israeli officials said. The arrests are at the center of what is likely to be the biggest scandal inside the Israeli government since the beginning of the war in Gaza, Axios reported. Whether Netanyahu knew or was involved in the leaks, which appear to be intended to influence Israeli public opinion to support Netanyahu's hardline position about a deal to release hostages being held by Hamas and establish a ceasefire in Gaza. The episode was under a gag order for several days until a judge released some details on Friday. Israeli officials said that a few weeks ago the Israel Army asked the Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency, to open an investigation after a top secret raw intelligence report was leaked to the German tabloid, Bild. The Bild published a story in early September that referred to a document that was allegedly drafted by Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and contained Hamas' strategy about the hostage and ceasefire deal negotiations. A joint investigation by the Shin Bet, the Israeli police and the IOF has led to the arrest of several suspects. The investigation focused on a 'concern of a security breach due to the unlawful provision of classified information' that has put at risk 'sensitive information and intelligence sources, as well as harmed the efforts of achieving the goals of the war in the Gaza Strip,' according to information the judge released for publication on Friday. Netanyahu denied his office was involved. 'No one from the Prime Minister's Office was questioned or arrested,' he said in a statement. He added that there was no leak from the Prime Minister's Office and accused other government bodies, which he didn't name, of leaking classified information. 'Nobody else was questioned. I wonder why,' Netanyahu said. Israeli officials said one of the suspects is Netanyahu's closest aides. The Israeli public broadcaster Kan reported the aide, who worked closely with Netanyahu since the beginning of the war, participated in sensitive security meetings and was exposed to highly classified information even though he failed has security background check. As a result, he didn't have the security clearance needed to work at the Prime Minister's Office and wasn't officially hired by the office. At the same time, he actively advised Netanyahu. According to Axios, the scandal will likely deepen the mistrust and tension between Netanyahu and the IOF and intelligence services, which has been growing since the security failures around the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on 'Israel'. 'It also comes as Netanyahu battles Israel's legal system and the attorney general. In just a few weeks the prime minister is expected to take the stand for the first time in his corruption trial.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2253473	2024-11-01T14:52:13-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2016/09/manar-03504870014730944247.jpg
Iran Fully Capable of Building Nuclear Weapons: Official	Head of Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations Kamal Kharrazi says that the country is fully capable of building nuclear weapons and the only thing preventing this issue is the fatwa issued by the Leader. In an exclusive interview for Al Mayadeen, Kharrazi articulated Iran's stance on regional tensions, emphasizing the nation’s preparedness to respond to any escalation while expressing a desire to avoid further war. He highlighted Iran's military capabilities and the potential for changes in its nuclear policy in response to perceived 'existential threats,' framing the discussion within the broader context of Iran’s geopolitical stance and its commitment to national sovereignty. In this context, Kharrazi emphasized that Iran has showcased its deterrence capabilities through Operation True Promise II, during which it launched hundreds of ballistic missiles on Israel, noting that in the time being, it is up to the Zionists; if they choose to continue their hostile actions, Iran will respond accordingly. In response to questions about potential changes to Iran's nuclear doctrine, Kharrazi indicated that such changes are possible, especially if Iran encounters an 'existential threat'. He asserted that Iran has the technical capabilities to produce nuclear weapons and encounters no significant obstacles in this regard. However, he emphasized that the Fatwa issued by the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei serves as the sole constraint preventing Iran from pursuing nuclear armament. The Iranian official also mentioned that policy changes would apply to projectiles. Kharrazi noted that Iran's missile capabilities are well-known, having been demonstrated in various operations. He stated that the current focus is on the ranges of the missiles used thus far, in which they [the Iranians] have considered the concerns of Western countries. However, Kharrazi maintained that, if Western nations do not acknowledge Iran's concerns, particularly regarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity, Iran then will disregard the concerns of Western countries. Therefore, it is likely that Iran will develop and extend the range of its missiles. Kharrazi addressed the 'unequal' war in the region, telling Al Mayadeen that it is 'led by Israel, which perpetrates ethnic cleansing and the extermination of people,' and is fighting those who are defending their lives, existence, and land. He expressed hope that the war would come to a swift conclusion, asserting that Israel is engaging in 'horrific ethnic cleansing' while mistakenly believing it has achieved victory. Kharrazi emphasized that such actions cannot be perceived as a true victory but rather as a profound violation of human rights. He also highlighted Israel's recent actions in blocking the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) from delivering essential supplies, stating that the agency 'wants to provide water and food to the besieged people of Gaza, but they have been blocked from doing so.' He emphasized that this move represents 'the climax of anti-humanitarian values.' He called on the international community to 'wake up and exert pressure on Israel,' adding, 'Unfortunately, we still see the West, including European countries and the United States, continue to support such a brutal and criminal entity and defend its actions by funding it and sending weapons.' Kharrazi concluded that the implications of the situation and its eventual outcome are evident: the will of the people and their Resistance cannot be suppressed. He asserted that both the Palestinians and Lebanese are steadfast in their determination to resist, endure this oppression, and confront these atrocities until victory is achieved. Within the context of ceasefire negotiations, Kharrazi emphasized that Iran does not intervene, asserting that it is the Lebanese and Palestinians' right to negotiate and reach a ceasefire deal. Moreover, he affirmed his country's support for any decision the countries make. The Iranian official added that Iran remains committed to its previous agreements, provided that the other party also upholds its commitments. He expressed disappointment that the opposing side has not adhered to their obligations and, instead of engaging in negotiations, continues to impose sanctions on the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Iranian official also discussed Iranian-Russian relations and broader regional dynamics, telling Al Mayadeen that Russia and China are 'seeking to build a new international system to free themselves of Western dominance,' an objective Iran upholds. He emphasized that emerging powers, including Iran, should play a prominent role in shaping a new world order that promotes more democratic governance, away from Western colonialism. Kharrazi clarified that the steps taken so far within the frameworks of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BRICS, and the New Development Bank all align with this vision. He pointed out that Iran is a member of these organizations and is actively working toward establishing a new world order. He also highlighted that the agreement between Iran and the Russian Federation is ready and it encompasses all aspects of bilateral relations and cooperation. Kharrazi noted that the agreement was originally scheduled to be signed during the recent BRICS meeting in Kazan, Russia, but the Russians preferred to finalize it during a bilateral visit to emphasize its significance, which will occur soon. Kharrazi explained that all neighboring countries are aware of Iran's strategic policy and are currently moving in that direction. He acknowledged that those who may not be pleased with this approach may resort to disseminating biased media narratives that do not serve regional interests.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2253451	2024-11-01T12:21:00-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2018/01/manar-06632340015163625584.jpg
Speaker Berri: ‘Israel’ Rejected Lebanon’s Ceasefire Roadmap, Gaz...	The Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri indicated that the Israeli enemy's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the ceasefire roadmap adopted by the Lebanese government in agreement with the US presidential envoy Amos Hochstein. Netanyahu obliterated the latest ceasefire opportunity in Lebanon, Speaker Berri said in an interview with the Saudi newspaper, Asharq Al-Awsat. Speaker Berri noted that the political endeavor aimed at concluding a ceasefire in Lebanon had been postponed till after the US presidential elections, adding that the battlefield would have its say and voicing its concerns and fears of Gaza scenario recurrence in Lebanon. Hochstein promised to contact us in case of observing positive indications during his meetings in Tel Aviv, Speaker Berri said, adding that the US envoy left without telling us about the results of his visit to the occupation entity. Speaker Berri reiterated Lebanon's commitment to the implementation of the UN Resolution 1701 without any amendment. Meeting with Force Commander of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), Major General Aroldo Lazaro, Speaker Berri stressed that 'Israel' has wasted, at least since last September, more than one tangible opportunity to cease fire, implement Resolution 1701, restore calm and return the displaced persons on both sides of the border.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2253264	2024-11-01T10:45:59-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-00377440017304830087.jpg

Mikati: ‘Israel’ Rejects Ceasefire, Evacuation Warnings Additiona...	Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati accused the Zionist entity on Friday of rejecting any ceasefire with Lebanon or any commitment to the UN Resolution 1701. In a meeting with UNIFIL Head of Mission and Force Commander Lt. Gen. Aroldo Lázaro at the Grand Serail, the acting Lebanese premier condemned the expansion of Israeli attacks, saying they signaled a Tel Aviv’s refusal to engage in truce efforts. 'The Israeli enemy's renewed expansion&#8230; and its renewed targeting of Beirut’s Dahiyeh with destructive raids are all stark indicators that confirm the Israeli enemy's rejection of all efforts being made to secure a ceasefire,' he said. Lebanon PM Najib Mikati in a meeting with UNIFIL's Lt. Gen. Aroldo Lázaro at the Grand Serail (November 1, 2024) Mikati denounced the Israeli regime’s evacuation warnings for Baalbek and the southern city of Tyre as an additional war crime. Meanwhile, he condemned the Israeli assaults on UNIFIL and the threats directed at its personnel, commending 'the determination of many friendly nations to support the continuation of UNIFIL’s work in south Lebanon.' Mikati insisted on the need to preserve the tasks and operational protocols assigned to UNIFIL, which are executed in close cooperation with the Lebanese Army. The Lebanese PM further reaffirmed Lebanon's ongoing commitment to the United Nations resolution and its provisions, asserting that 'Israeli statements and the diplomatic signals received by Lebanon reflect the enemy's obstinacy in rejecting proposed solutions and its insistence on a path of killing and destruction. This places the entire international community before its historical and moral responsibilities to stop this aggression.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2252923	2024-11-01T04:58:37-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-07260790017286522724.jpg

Daring Drone Strikes: Iraqi Resistance Attacks 6 Israeli Targets ...	The Islamic Resistance in Iraq announced that its fighters conducted seven long-range drone attacks on Israeli targets across occupied territories on Thursday. The operations, carried out from dawn until midnight, utilized one-way attack drones to strike vital infrastructure in the occupied Syrian Golan as well as targets in northern, central, and southern Israeli-occupied areas. Two of the attacks targeted strategic sites in the occupied Golan, while the remaining strikes were spread throughout the occupied Palestinian and Lebanese territories. The northern attacks reportedly hit areas in al-Jalil, while the southern strikes focused on the occupied town of Umm al-Rashrash (Eilat) on the Red Sea coast. The Iraqi Resistance factions vowed to continue these operations in support of Palestine and Lebanon, promising that the attacks will only continue to escalate. In a follow-up announcement on Friday, the Resistance reported launching three additional drone strikes on vital targets in southern occupied Palestine, as well as two more attacks in the Golan region, in the wake of increased Israeli air defenses over Eilat overnight.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2252692	2024-11-01T02:03:15-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-03950240017304517901.jpg
Islamic Resistance Operations Room: Fronts Are Being Securely Sup...	The Islamic Resistance Operations Room issued a statement which summarizes the latest developments of the battle against the Israeli occupation army, confirming inflicting heavy losses upon the enemy troops in the border villages and within the occupied Palestinian territories. Regarding that the ground confrontation, the statement indicated that the Israeli occupation forces tried to advance into several positions, yet faced a firm resistance. The Israeli military units attempted to advance into Shihin and Al-Jebbin villages as well as Wadi Hamoul area as the Resistance fighters repelled them and forced them to withdraw into Labbouneh area, according to the field summary. The statement added that the Resistance fighters bombed the IOF gatherings in Ramya-Aita Shaab-Aitaroun axis, amid Zionist attempts to advance towards central Aitaroun and Aita Al-Shaab. The Israeli enemy refrained from advancing in the area between Blida and Houla due to the heavy losses inflicted by the Resistance upon its occupation soldiers last week, according to the statement. The Islamic Resistance also confronted an Israeli attempt to advance troops from Kfar Kila towards Tal Al-Nahas, killing or injuring a number of Israeli officer and soldiers, the statement read. The statement pointed out that the resistance fighters confronted Zionist attempts to advance towards the outskirts of Kfarchouba area in order to control the heights, repelling an attempt to advance troops into the southeastern sides of Khiam town. The rocketry force of the Resistance continued bombarding the Israeli border sites and barracks as well as the bases in the northern cities of occupied Palestine with various types of missiles and ranges which reach Tel Aviv suburbs, carrying out 655 launch operations so far, including 63 during the past 3 days, according to the statement. The statement noted that the Islamic Resistance has launched more than 170 drones since September 17, 2024, hitting various targets, including the southern suburbs of Tel Aviv. According to the statement, the Islamic Resistance has fired 20 surface-to-air missiles at Zionist war jets and drones since September 17, 2024. The statement highlighted that, since the beginning of the 'ground maneuver', has lost 95 soldiers and officers, adding that more than 900 of others were injured. The Operations Room highlighted that the Islamic Resistance has so far destroyed 42 Merkava tanks, 4 military bulldozers, 2 Hummer vehicles, an armored vehicle, and an armored personnel carrier and downed 3 Hermes 450 and one Hermes 900 drones. The statement noted that the above-mentioned losses do not include those inflicted upon the Zionist settlements, bases, barracks, and sites within occupied Palestine. Finally, the statement noted that: The enemy forces avoid moving and positioning within the fields of vision of the Resistance fighters for fear of being targeted. They create invisible crossings and paths and rely on infiltrating at night into the border villages and withdrawing from them after destroying civilians' homes and sabotaging the infrastructure. The supply lines to the front and the axes of engagement have not been disrupted since the beginning of the aggression on Lebanon, and the fronts are still being supplied with weapons and the necessary equipment according to the plans prepared in advance. Despite the enemy's full intelligence control of the skies of the south, the resistance fighters are still able to position, arm and launch hundreds of rocket barrages towards enemy soldiers' positions deep inside the entity on a daily and continuous basis, round the clock. This is confirmed by the videos published by the war media. The enemy has not been able to thwart any launching operation from Lebanese territory. The Islamic Resistance continued on Thursday heroically fighting the elite units of the Israeli occupation army near Lebanon border, inflicting heavy losses upon the enemy troops.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2252527	2024-10-31T16:31:31-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-01168670017304174405.jpg
Sayyed Houthi: Hezbollah Resilience Shocked Israeli Enemy	Head of Yemen's Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Houthi stressed Thursday that over a month of ground aggression on southern Lebanon has revealed the tremendous resilience of the Lebanese Resistance, contrary to the enemy’s expectation of an easy conquest. In a televised speech, Sayyed Houthi maintained that the Israeli enemy is shocked by the resilience of Hezbollah fighters and has suffered significant losses and repeated defeats. 'The Israeli enemy, in its ground aggression on Lebanon, is defeated in every aspect, suffering around a thousand casualties, though they keep this concealed.' Houthi added that, despite heavy firepower, the Israeli enemy has clearly failed to achieve any field breakthroughs in its ground aggression on Lebanon, noting that the enemy finds itself in a genuine dilemma in its ground assault on Lebanon. The enemy attempted to modify its tactics f used in the July 2006 aggression by using infiltration forces and few armored vehicles, but failed, he stressed. Any tactic the Israeli enemy employs in the ground aggression on Lebanon results in significant losses and ends in failure, he added. 'The ground battle in southern Lebanon presents a true opportunity, as the enemy relied on air force to kill from a distance and then flee.' Houthi maintained that the operation targeting the criminal Netanyahu in his bedroom was impactful and effective, adding tha Hezbollah’s operations have forced millions of occupying Zionists to spend most of their time in shelters, living in fear and terror without enjoying a normal life. 'The Leader congratulated Sheikh Naim Qassem upon his appointment as Secretary-General of Hezbollah, describing him as a distinguished leader and one of the party's prominent founders. We in Yemen stand by Sheikh Naim Qassem, alongside our brothers in Hezbollah and the Lebanese people, with all that we can.' 'The increasing performance of our dear brothers, the fighters in Iraq, is noticeable, bringing pride and posing a significant threat to the Israeli enemy,' Houthi said. Yemen’s operations at sea to target ships linked to the 'Israeli,' American, and British enemies continue, with limited movement in the Red Sea, he added. In continuation of the support of the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and resistance against the Israeli oppression, and retaliation to the American-British aggression against Yemen, the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out three military operations as part of the continuation of imposing a naval blockade on the Israeli enemy. 'The targeting of four ships this week was highly significant, and we are working to increase pressure, tracking them to the far east of the Arabian Sea and into the Indian Ocean, God willing. For the first time, Israeli enemy interests have been targeted this way in the Red Sea and Bab El-Mandab over an extended period of more than a year.' Despite their frustration, the Americans are trying to stop the maritime operations through their continuous aggression, Houthi noted. 'The Americans carry out weekly airstrikes and maintain political and economic pressure on our country. The Americans consistently attempt to involve others, particularly the Saudi-Emirati coalition, in escalation to serve the Israeli enemy’s interests.' We continuously monitor American activity against our country and nation, and we are always preparing for any level of escalation, he stressed. The Saudis and others know that their involvement in Yemen and direct alliance with the Americans to support the 'Israeli' enemy would bring disgrace and shame, Houthi affirmed. No one will be able to halt our operations until the aggression is stopped, the siege on Gaza is lifted, and the assault on Lebanon ends, Houthi confirmed. 'The Security Council is a council for the security of the oppressors, not for the weak and oppressed. The so-called courts of justice and criminal courts have done nothing for our nation.' Organizations and institutions claimed to represent our nation have, in reality, caused more harm to our people and forces than they have to the enemy, Sayyed Houthi stressed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2252439	2024-10-31T13:16:32-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-00573720017304057817.jpg

Declaring that they would rather die than enlist in the Israeli military, dozens of ultra-Orthodox demonstrators protest at a military induction center in an attempt to disrupt the drafting of a number of yeshiva students to the occupation army. Israeli occupation security forces work to remove members of the extremist Jerusalem Faction, some of whom tried to lie down in front of buses at the Tel Hashomer base, the Ynet news site reports. 🏴‍☠⚔🏴‍☠ Haredi settlers demonstrate in front of the recruitment headquarters in Tel Hashomer, rejecting their compulsory recruitment and saying: We will die rather than enlist pic.twitter.com/E3x1rUQ4BX — Military Observer (@MilitaryObs2222) October 31, 2024 The protest comes against the backdrop of bitter disagreements in the Knesset over the issue of Haredi enlistment to the Israeli army, after the High Court of Justice ruled in June that there was no longer any legal framework allowing the state to refrain from drafting ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students into compulsory service. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly reassured his ultra-Orthodox coalition partners that his government will advance a bill facilitating sweeping exemptions for Haredi men from mandatory military service. The dispute over the ultra-Orthodox community serving in the military is one of the most contentious in the Zionist entity, with decades of governmental and judicial attempts to settle the issue never achieving a stable resolution. The issue has grown in urgency as the occupation military suffers from a lack of troops and pressure on reservists increases over the past year of war. Ultra-Orthodox Jews protest against the draft (September 29, 2024). A group of Israeli army reservists recently sent on Wednesday a letter to Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi criticizing the continued failure to draft members of the ultra-Orthodox community, a move that they said would have helped reduce the large number of days they have been required to serve since the start of the war in Gaza over a year ago. The letter accused the Israeli military of having 'failed' its reserve soldiers who are frustrated and burnt-out after multiple stints in Gaza, on the northern border, and now in southern Lebanon amid the ongoing ground offensive there. Earlier on Saturday (October 28), Israeli army radio reported that less than four percent of the 3,000 Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) Israelis who received recruitment orders since July to join the military have done so.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2252065	2024-10-31T03:13:12-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-05825860017303694772.jpg

Hezbollah Heroically Repels New Israeli Infiltration Attempts, Pr...	Nearly a month on the Israeli ground offensive on south Lebanon, a new Israeli infiltration attempt into the Lebanese border town of Khiam has failed as Hezbollah fighters valiantly confronted the invading forces.

Iran Denies Report on Breach of Iran’s Airspace by Israeli Jets	Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Aziz Nasirzadeh has vehemently rejected media reports that Israeli warplanes violated Iran's airspace during a recent military attack. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, General Nasirzadeh dismissed the rumors, stating that no Israeli fighter jets had entered Iranian airspace on October 26. 'According to the United Nations Charter, whenever the airspace of a country is violated, that country will be entitled to respond to the violation and act of aggression,' the defense minister declared, warning that Iran would not hesitate to retaliate. Nasirzadeh also dismissed reports that a military site in Iran's northern city of Shahrud had been damaged in an alleged Israeli strike from the country's northern borders. He insisted that while the enemy had attempted to target Iran's defense systems, their efforts had failed as Iran had made the necessary civil defense arrangements in advance. Iran would respond to any Israeli aggression against its soil, even if the action is as tiny and ineffective as throwing an arrow toward one of the country's deserts, the Iranian defense chief says. — Mehr News Agency (@MehrnewsCom) October 30, 2024 The minister stressed that Iran's production of offensive capabilities, such as missiles, remained uninterrupted. He emphasized that Iran would respond even to a single bullet being fired at its territory, let alone the latest act of aggression by the Zionist regime. In a separate statement, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei, underscored the necessity of disrupting the 'flawed calculations' of the Zionist regime regarding Iran, warning that the enemy must 'realize who the Iranian people are and what the Iranian youth are like.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2250525	2024-10-30T06:09:33-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-05296280017302937676.jpg

Israeli Army Runs Away from Ground Battle with Hezbollah Fighters...	Media reports indicated that Israeli occupation forces had withdrawn from the areas they had advanced to in various villages and towns on the southern border with occupied Palestine, especially Houla, Markaba, Mays Al-Jabal, Blida, and Odaisseh. The Israeli occupation army withdrew its vehicles from the Lebanese areas it had entered as part of its ground offensive that began a month ago. UNews Agency quoted media reports as saying that the Israeli army redeployed its forces inside the Israeli settlements, 5 to 10 km away from the Lebanese border, on Monday, attributing the move to fears that the resistance will target the Israeli forces with concentrated rocket barrages and combat drones, which will inflict heavy losses on them. The Islamic Resistance drones conducted an aerial scan of the front edge areas in southern Lebanon, confirming the withdrawal of Israeli forces behind the border. The aerial photos showed the Israeli army closing some of the gaps it had opened in order to infiltrate through them into Lebanese areas. The Zionist occupation forces failed to impose its control on the Lebanese towns it had invaded because of Hezbollah attacks on its officers, soldiers, tanks and vehicles.

Islamic Resistance Operations Room: Israeli Enemy Has so far Fail...	The Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance issued a summary of the latest developments of the battle with the Israeli enemy, confirming that the Zionist troops have failed to control any of the Lebanese border towns. The Islamic Resistance fighters continued, based on accurate intelligence data, to confront the 'Israeli' aggression against Lebanon, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy army in terms of personnel and equipment across various confrontation fronts at the front lines, im addition to their positions in the depths of occupied Palestine, according to the statement. 'The past few days have witnessed a notable increase in the number of daily operations carried out by the Islamic Resistance, reaching a new record of 48 operations on Friday, October 25, 2024, since the beginning of Al-Aqsa Flood Battle.' The statement gave sufficient details about the ground confrontations, as follows. 1. Ground confrontations: The vicinity and some neighborhoods of the front-line villages in southern Lebanon along the Lebanese-Palestinian border have seen numerous attempts by the 'Israeli' enemy army to advance towards these villages with the aim of occupying and controlling them. The Islamic Resistance fighters have confronted these attempts across multiple fronts as follows: • First Front: Area of operations of the enemy's 146th Division, extending from Al-Naqoura in the west to Marwahin in the east. The enemy forces made several attempts to infiltrate towards the southern neighborhoods of the villages of Marwahin, Dhayra, Yarin, and Al-Matmura, aiming to rig houses with explosives and destroy them for fear they might be used by the fighters. They also set fire to the forests between the towns of Alma Al-Shaab and Dhayra. The Islamic Resistance fighters repelled these attempts and targeted the enemy's concentrations and advance routes on the outskirts of Marwahin and southern Dhayra with appropriate weapons, inflicting heavy losses on their personnel and vehicles, forcing the enemy's leadership to significantly reduce the number of troops in the 146th Division in this front. • Second Front: Area of operations of the enemy's 36th Division, extending from Ramya in the west to Rmeish in the east (including Aita Al-Shaab), and from Rmeish to Aitaroun in the east. Following precise intelligence surveillance of the movements of the 'Israeli' enemy around the town of Aita Al-Shaab and some of its neighborhoods, the Islamic Resistance fighters ambushed an 'Israeli' force that advanced towards the 'Abu Al-Laban' hill east of the town early on Thursday, October 24, 2024.
