Over 15,000 Ukrainian Troops Engaged in Kurakhovo, Says Russian T...	The Ukrainian military command has turned Kurakhovo in the Donetsk People’s Republic into a fortified stronghold over the past 10 years, the Russian Defense Ministry said. 'Over ten years, the Kiev regime turned it into a powerful fortified area with the developed network of permanent firing positions and underground communications,' the ministry noted. According to the military agency, the Ukrainian army has amassed over 15,000 troops in Kurakhovo, including elite units, nationalist formations and foreign mercenaries. After liberating Kurakhovo, Russian forces break out of bridgehead Russian units have more room for maneuvering following the taking of Kurakhovo which aids in increasing the rates of liberating the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), the Russian Defense Ministry said. 'After the liberation of Kurakhovo, Russian forces have broken out of the bridgehead. This will help to increase the rates of liberating the Donetsk People’s Republic,' it said in a statement. Control over Kurakhovo hinders supplies to Ukrainian troops Establishing control over the town of Kurakhovo in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has substantially hindered combat service support to the Ukrainian armed forces, the Russian Defense Ministry said. 'Taking control over this important logistics hub has significantly hindered combat service support to the Ukrainian military grouping in the Donetsk area, depriving the Kiev regime of the opportunity to use artillery systems to shell civilians in the city of Donetsk, the capital of the DPR,' the ministry said in a statement.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2307813	2025-01-06T07:04:33-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-063171300173617586210.jpg
IRGC Commander: Resistance Front Reaches Apex of Power as Hezboll...	Major General Hossein Salami, the chief commander of Iran's elite Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), declared that the regional Resistance Front has attained an unprecedented level of strength and influence. Salami emphasized that while the Resistance Front continues to grow in power, their enemies have become objects of scorn and fear, a trend he believes will persist. The commander specifically praised Lebanon's formidable Hezbollah movement for its unwavering resolve in the face of grave threats. Resistance Front at 'peak of its power'; Hezbollah imposed its will on worn-out Israel: IRGC — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) January 6, 2025 'The fact that Hezbollah stays on its course, despite those heavy dangers, is down to the struggles of [the group’s former secretary-general] the Greatest Martyr His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and [former senior official] Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, who managed to plant the roots of Jihad within the Lebanese youths’ beliefs,' Salami elaborated. Salami asserted that Hezbollah's steadfast determination allowed it to impose its will on a worn-out Israel, compelling the entity to accept the terms of a truce deal following its failed aggression against Lebanon. During the ceremony honoring the late General Qassem Suleimani, Salami commended the former anti-terror commander for his tireless efforts in leading the fight against Western- and Israeli-backed Takfiri terrorist groups, sacrificing himself for the sake of regional Muslim nations.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2307648	2025-01-06T05:33:40-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/12/manar-067219500170375961910.jpg
Israeli Occupation Army Warns Soldiers of Arrest Risk Abroad over...	An investigative report by the Israeli Kan broadcaster highlights a surge in legal attempts to prosecute Israeli occupation army soldiers abroad since the war on the Gaza Strip began. Approximately 50 complaints have been filed against reserve soldiers, leading to 10 formal investigations in various countries. However, no arrests have been reported. Social Media Risks and Cautious Travel Data from the Israeli occupation army's Information Security Division indicates that soldiers post nearly one million pieces of content daily on social media, increasing the risk of exposure and legal action. While no official travel bans to specific countries have been issued, authorities are exercising caution, particularly for dual-nationality soldiers or those traveling to high-risk nations like South Africa. Intelligence suggesting targeted efforts against soldiers has heightened vigilance. Security officials have recommended reassessing high-risk travel and incorporating legal risk evaluations into decision-making. Consequently, Zionist soldiers have also been instructed to reduce their social media activity. Experts have raised alarms over the lack of a comprehensive strategy to address this growing threat, despite ongoing efforts to mitigate exposure and legal risks. High-Profile Cases and Warnings In a recent incident, Israeli media reported that a Zionist soldier wanted in Brazil managed to leave the country before authorities could arrest him. Brazilian authorities had issued an urgent arrest warrant following a complaint by a human rights organization accusing him of crimes in Gaza. Meanwhile, Haaretz reported that the Israeli occupation army has warned reserve soldiers abroad about the risk of arrest due to their involvement in the Gaza war. Human rights organizations have been actively collecting evidence, including videos documenting alleged war crimes, to pressure local authorities to pursue legal action. Soldiers’ Families Demand Legal Protection According to Israel Hayom, the mothers of Zionist soldiers sent a strongly worded letter to Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, demanding legal protection for their sons. The letter expressed concerns about international tribunals, particularly in light of the erosion of the Israeli occupation’s so-called judicial independence.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2307417	2025-01-06T05:29:22-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/08/manar-02566110017249333574.jpg
Day 458 | Rocket Fired from Gaza Hits Sderot as Israeli Aggressio...	Daily events in Gaza reflect an ongoing war of attrition described in a recent report by the Hebrew newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. The Israeli occupation forces withdraw from an area only to see Palestinian resistance fighters return, launching precision operations that inflict direct casualties among enemy fighters. Explosions in Sderot Amid Rocket Attacks Israeli sources reported on Monday explosions in 'Sderot' and its surroundings following rocket sirens in the area. An Israeli Army Radio correspondent confirmed the rockets were launched from Beit Hanoun.

Israeli enemy Mossad chief David Barnea headed to Doha on Monday to pursue indirect negotiations on a prisoner exchange and a ceasefire with Hamas. Axios reported that Brett McGurk, senior advisor to US President Joe Biden, also arrived in Doha to join the talks. Progress in Ceasefire Talks A Palestinian source told The New Arab news outlet that mediators have bridged gaps between the parties through compromise solutions. Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a late-night meeting on Sunday with ministers and officials to finalize a response, which Barnea is expected to deliver in Doha. Israeli media, however, noted that Netanyahu's security cabinet will not address the issue of hostages during these discussions, according to Kan 11. Escalating Aggression: Rising Civilian Casualties in Gaza The ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza has led to mounting civilian casualties. Over 20 Palestinians were injured when an Israeli drone targeted a school sheltering displaced individuals near Al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza. In Rafah, two children were martyred in an Israeli airstrike, while the Ministry of Health reported the martyrdom of a 35-day-old infant due to severe weather conditions and freezing temperatures. This brings the death toll of children succumbing to the cold in Gaza to eight. Brutal Israeli Airstrikes Across Gaza An Israeli occupation airstrike in Rafah’s Khirbet Al-Adas claimed the life of one Palestinian and injured two others. In Khan Younis, shelling in the Al-Mawasi area, which houses displaced individuals, caused additional injuries.

Another airstrike in Jabalia camp killed one civilian, while a volunteer nurse at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital lost her life in a strike on a home in Al-Nuseirat. In Rafah, two farmers were martyred while sleeping in their field, and two more were martyred in an Israeli strike targeting northeastern Rafah. Humanitarian Crisis in Northern Gaza The northern Gaza region has endured a relentless siege and bombardment for 94 consecutive days, leaving it isolated and devastated. Israeli enemy forces have paralyzed civil defense operations in northern Gaza for 74 days, preventing vital humanitarian and medical aid. Thousands of residents remain without essential care amid the continuing aggression.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2307362	2025-01-06T03:39:08-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-00626040017361631478.jpg

Hamas Says List of 34 Captives Submitted for Prisoner Swap	The Palestinian resistance group Hamas has reportedly approved a list of 34 captives it is willing to exchange with ‘Israel’ as part of ongoing ceasefire negotiations. However, the two sides remain at odds over the terms of a broader truce. According to a Hamas official who spoke to Reuters on Sunday, the list of prisoners was handed over to Israeli intermediaries on Sunday. The official emphasized that any final agreement would be contingent on Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and a permanent ceasefire. 'There has been no progress from ‘Israel’ on the matters of withdrawal from Gaza or a permanent ceasefire,' the Hamas official stated. But the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu disputed Hamas' statement, claiming that the group has not provided any names for a proposed prisoner swap. 'Up to this moment, Hamas has not delivered a list of hostage names,' a statement from Netanyahu's office said. These reports come as intensified Israeli airstrikes over the weekend killed over 100 Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip. Efforts to broker a ceasefire and secure the return of Israeli captives are ongoing in Doha, with Qatari and Egyptian mediators playing a key role.

New Arms Sale: Even in Its Final Days, Biden Administration Enabl...	Even in its last days, the tenure of US President Joe Biden was marked by unwavering support for the Israeli colonial regime. The US State Department has informed Congress of a planned $8 billion (€7.7 billion) weapons sale to the Zionist entity, which has been pressing forward with its brutal war on Gaza. The sale includes medium-range air-to-air missiles, 155 mm projectile artillery shells for long-range targeting, Hellfire AGM-114 missiles, 500-pound bombs and other weaponry. Palestinian father holds his injured child following an Israeli strike on Gaza (January 2025). The weapons package would add to a record of at least $17.9 billion (€17.3 billion) in military aid that Washington has provided the Zionist entity with since the start of the war on Gaza in October 2023. Some of the arms in the package could be sent through current US stocks but the majority would take a year or several years to deliver, AP reported, quoting two anonymous US officials. The informal notice to Congress isn’t the final notification before a sale. Now the leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee or the Senate Foreign Relations Committee can review the package. The Biden administration has faced criticism over the mounting Palestinian civilian death toll - more than 45,500 Palestinian martyrs - with demonstrations on college campuses pressing to block sales of offensive weapons to ‘Israel’. Protesters have for months demanded an arms embargo against the Zionist entity, but US policy has largely remained unchanged. In August, the United States approved the sale of $20 billion in fighter jets and other military equipment.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2306581	2025-01-05T02:06:21-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-08506260017360714536.jpg
Sheikh Qassem: Resistance Patience May Run Out before End of '60 ...	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem stressed on Saturday that the Resistance is 'our choice to liberate the land, preserve sovereignty, and support Palestine in face of the occupation.' Resistance is a cultural, faith-based, political, and jihadi choice that opposes the surrender to the enemy's will, according to Sheikh Qassem who underlined the importance of faith and preparation in the confrontation. In a televised speech on the fifth anniversary of the two martyred leaders Qassem Suleimani and Abu Mahdi Al-Muhandis, Sheikh Qassem said that in the past, 'Israel' reached Beirut within days, but during the 2024 aggression, it couldn’t advance more than a few hundred meters along the front edge. ''Israel' failed to progress because the resisting fighters held firm and steadfast against it.' His eminence asked, 'Does this not indicate that the Resistance is strong, possesses deterrence, and has thwarted the enemy’s objectives? Due to steadfastness and sacrifices, the enemy was forced to seek a ceasefire agreement, Hezbollah leader maintained. 'The enemy was compelled to request a ceasefire because of the Resistance’s strength, and we agreed through the Lebanese state.' 'We broke Israel's arrogance, preventing it from achieving its goals, and through these sacrifices, the Resistance will continue, God willing.' According to Sheikh Qassem, after the Battle of 'The Formidable in Might', Lebanon cannot exist without the Resistance. This battle shattered 'Israel's' hopes of achieving ambitions in Lebanon, he added. 'The leadership of the Resistance decides when, how, and with what weapons to resist. There is no fixed timeline dictating the Resistance’s actions. Our patience is tied to the appropriate timing to confront the enemy. Our actions may precede or exceed 60 days, and when we decide to act, you will witness it directly.' Sheikh Qassem emphasized that the agreement exclusively pertains to south of the Litani River, and the state, alongside mediators, is responsible for restraining 'Israel' and enforcing the agreement. 'The Resistance began recovering just days after the martyrdom of His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and everyone has witnessed this.' Sheikh Qassem underscored that, in 1982 invasion, the Israeli enemy reached Beirut in few days, and the resistance fought it for 18 years to expel it from the Lebanese territories. 'Whereas, in 2024. 72 thousand Israeli soldiers could not reach Litani river because of the steadfast, powerful and epic resistance.' In 64 days, the occupation forces advanced for only hundreds of meters in the border area, and the Resistance strikes inflicted heavy losses upon its officers and soldiers, Sheikh Qassem said. Lebanon suffered big humanitarian and materialistic losses inflicted by the Israeli aggression, yet those sacrifices fortify the national dignity, Hezbollah leader underscored. When the ceasefire took into effect, the Islamic Resistance capabilities were still there, Sheikh Qassem stressed. The ceasefire took place, not because the Resistance lost its weapons, but the enemy requested the deal due to its ground failure. Sheikh Qassem affirmed that the Israeli schemes against Lebanon are doomed to failure, mentioning that the military invasion, establishment of a buffer zone, and the construction of settlements are impossible. His eminence also called for observing the Israeli invasion of south Syria and how the enemy troops controlled an area equal to 1.5 that of Gaza, highlighting the Israeli airstrikes on the military capabilities of the Syrian army. 'We believe that in the future, the Syrian people will play a role in confronting 'Israel' because they are honorable and dignified people,' Sheikh Qassem noted. In response to the hostile propaganda that targets the Resistance and its social incubation, Sheikh Qassem stressed that the Resistance is still powerful and possesses great capabilities, citing the Israeli request of the ceasefire. Sheikh Qassem also underlined the power of faith that enhances the military victories despite the great sacrifices made by the martyrs, injuries, prisoners and their families. We passed the divine exam, and the materialistic losses will be compensated, Sheikh Qassem said, stressing the hostile propaganda is run by people who had dreamed of the defeat of the Resistance. Hezbollah Secretary General stressed that the Palestinian people are the loftiest in the world with respect to the sacrifices, underling that 155 thousand martyrs or injuries have been left so far by the Zionist war amid the silence of the international community. Sheikh Qassem stressed that the Palestinian resistance would persist despite the Israeli crimes of killing women and children in Gaza. Hezbollah leader also greeted Yemen's people, command and army, haling their achievements in face of the Israeli enemy, US, Britain and their allies despite the meager capabilities. The Yemeni support for Gaza puts the Arab and Islamic states' reluctance under question of capabilities and choices, his eminence said. 'The martyr Hajj Qassem Suleimani was a strategic leader on intellectual and political levels. Hajj Qassem drew from the essence of Islam, the pure Mohammadi Islam, following the path of Imam Khomeini (may Allah's blessings be upon him) and Imam Khamenei (may his shadow endure).' Sheikh Qassem indicated that martyr Suleimani exposed America, its plans, and its support for ISIL, and thwarted America's shifting projects in the region, adding that he also unveiled 'Israel's' expansionist schemes, delivering harsh blows by redirecting focus to occupied Palestine, restoring its prominence. Martyr Souimani also worked to connect the region's arenas to benefit from one another, playing a vital role in restoring the Palestinian cause as the central issue of the region, he added. Sheikh Qassem borrowed the words of his beloved companion in fight, the Leader of the Resistance, His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who said, 'The dear brother Hajj Qassem Suleimani achieved his greatest wish and earned the high honor of being rightfully called the Master of the Martyrs of the Resistance Axis.' 'The martyr commander Abu Mahdi Al-Muhandis was a towering figure in Iraq, with a significant role in its liberation from the cursed Saddam and from ISIL, which sought to occupy Iraq. Abu Mahdi played a pivotal role under the banner of the religious authority in establishing the Hashd Shaabi and driving out the American occupation of Iraq.' Regarding the Lebanese presidential elections, Sheikh Qassem stressed that Hezbollah is keen on the success of the constitutional entitlement on the basis of cooperation among the parliamentary blocs concerned with the vote, away from the foreign dictates. 'The abolitionists have no chance; those who rely on foreigners cannot pass this entitlement with their support,' he continued, 'We want to accomplish January 9 entitlement by choosing a new president for a new, positive and cooperative phase that leads to stability, and we work on the basis of consolidating and dedicating national unity, Islamic unity, and all forms of internal cooperation in order to develop reconstruct our country.' Sheikh Qassem started his speech by congratulating the Islamic nation on the beginning of the blessed month of Rajab and the birth of Imam Ali Al-Hadi (peace be upon him), and we also offer condolences on his martyrdom according to some narrations.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2306372	2025-01-04T12:18:43-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-03957560017360218414.jpg

The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Ground Force has launched a large-scale and specialized drill in Iran’s western province of Kermanshah, as part of attempts to raise its combat preparedness and get further ready to confront potential security threats against the country. The drills, codenamed Payambar-e-A’azam (Great Prophet) 19, kicked off in a combat zone in western Iran on Saturday, with the participation of various specialized divisions and units of the IRGC Ground Force, particularly from the Mirza Kuchak Khan Brigades. During the first stage of the war game, different rapid response operation scenarios were exercised. The quick transfer of troops and military hardware to the exercise area was carried out in the first part of the drills. Iranian military forces hold routine exercises according to a detailed schedule in various parts of the country in order to test their weaponry and equipment and evaluate their combat preparedness. The country’s officials have repeatedly underscored that the country will not hesitate to strengthen its military capabilities, including its missile power, which are entirely meant for defense, and that Iran’s defense capabilities will never be subject to negotiations.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2305888	2025-01-04T04:21:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-05253160017359932792.jpg

In response to the raid, Saraya al-Quds, the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement, announced that its fighters had confronted the Israeli forces storming the eastern areas of Balata camp. The resistance group said it unleashed heavy gunfire and explosive devices at the Israeli occupation troops and military vehicles. According to local sources, Israeli occupation forces entered the outskirts of Balata camp from the nearby Awarta checkpoint and deployed snipers on the roofs of buildings. The troops opened fire on residents, injuring several. Ambulances were reportedly prevented from entering the camp to evacuate the wounded.

Lebanese Parliament Set to Elect New President After Two-Year Vac...	Lebanon's Parliament will convene on January 9, 2025, to elect a president, ending a vacancy that has persisted for over two years following the expiration of former President Michel Aoun's term. Role of the President Article 49 of the Lebanese Constitution defines the president as the head of state and a symbol of national unity. The president is responsible for upholding the constitution, safeguarding Lebanon's independence, and preserving its territorial integrity. As the supreme commander of the armed forces, the president operates under the authority of the Council of Ministers and presides over the Higher Defense Council. Election Process The president is elected by secret ballot in Parliament. In the first round, a two-thirds majority (86 of 128 MPs) is required. If subsequent rounds are needed, a simple majority (more than 50%) suffices. The presidential term lasts six years, with reelection prohibited until six years after the end of the initial term. To qualify for candidacy, individuals must meet the eligibility criteria for parliamentary membership and face no legal impediments. Judges and senior civil servants are ineligible to run for office while serving and for two years after their resignation, retirement, or cessation of duties. Lebanon's 12th parliamentary session aimed at electing a new president (June 14, 2023). Political Consensus and Constitutional Norms In Lebanon, there is no formal nomination process for presidential candidates as seen in parliamentary elections. Instead, the presidency typically results from political consensus among domestic factions, often influenced by external support or approval. Since the Taif Agreement of 1990 and the subsequent constitutional amendments, presidential elections have rarely featured multiple candidates. Instead, Parliament votes on a single agreed-upon name, a stark contrast to the competitive elections seen before the 1975 civil war. Maronite Presidency and Fixed Terms A longstanding, unwritten convention reserves the presidency for a Maronite Christian, a tradition upheld since Lebanon's independence in 1943. The president serves a single six-year term without renewal or extension unless a constitutional amendment is made, as occurred with Presidents Elias Hrawi and Émile Lahhoud, whose terms were exceptionally extended by three years each. Eligibility Restrictions Article 49 of the constitution bars judges, senior civil servants, and military officials from running for the presidency during their tenure. Exceptions require constitutional amendments, as was the case for President Lahoud, when such a change allowed his election despite serving as Commander of the Lebanese Army. Election of Michel Sleiman and Absence of Const. Amendments On May 25, 2008, General Michel Suleiman was elected president without a constitutional amendment, unlike his predecessor, President Lahoud. He received 118 votes, ensuring his election through political consensus and national parliamentary agreement. A presidential election can be contested before the Constitutional Council within 24 hours, requiring a third of Parliament's members (43 out of 128). However, this was not the case with Suleiman's election, as he secured overwhelming support, with only 10 MPs opposing him. The national settlement reached in Doha, with external backing, resolved the debate over amending the constitution for his election. The question remains: Could such a scenario unfold again? In the coming days, it will become clearer whether a presidential election will take place or if the election of a candidate from the civil service will require a constitutional amendment.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2305745	2025-01-04T02:57:34-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-099261700173599138310.jpg
Gaza: Israeli Airstrikes Target Displaced Civilians, Destroy Crit...	The Israeli occupation forces (IOF) have intensified their devastating assault on the Gaza Strip, committing further atrocities against the civilian population. In a series of airstrikes and bombardments over the weekend, the IOF targeted the tents of displaced residents in the cities of Deir al-Balah and Rafah, resulting in injuries. The attacks began on Saturday at dawn, when the IOF bombed a tent housing displaced people along the street of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. Injuries were also reported following an IOF attack on the Ghoul family's house in the Shuja'iyya neighborhood, east of Gaza City. Simultaneously, IOF aircraft targeted the western part of the Sabra neighborhood, south of Gaza City.

In the southern Gaza Strip, an IOF attack on a house in the al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis resulted in the death of a child and the injury of 10 individuals, with three others reported missing.

Alongside these attacks on civilian targets, the IOF have intensified their assault on Gaza's medical sector. On Friday, the IOF issued a threat to those present at the Indonesian Hospital in the northern Gaza Strip, demanding their immediate evacuation. This came after the forces had already destroyed the hospital's oxygen and electricity stations and continued to bulldoze the surrounding area, systematically dismantling essential infrastructure.

The ongoing Israeli aggression in the Gaza Strip, which began on October 7, 2023, has resulted in a population decline of approximately 6%. This devastating war has led to the martyrdom of around 45,581 Palestinians and left 108,438 others injured, according to initial figures.

US Plans $8 Billion Arms Sale to ‘Israel’: Reports	The Biden administration has informed Congress of a proposed $8 billion arms sale to ‘Israel’, further bolstering the Zionist regime’s military capabilities. This latest package comes on the heels of over $22 billion in US military aid provided to ‘Israel’ since October 2023. According to a report by Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom, the US has significantly ramped up its military support for Israel in recent months. Initially, 10,000 tons of ammunition valued at $2.4 billion were sent, but this amount has since quintupled, reaching 50,000 tons by August 2024. Scoop: Biden notifies Congress of $8 billion arms sale to Israel — Axios (@axios) January 4, 2025 The aid package encompasses a wide array of advanced weaponry, including missiles for the Iron Dome defense system, precision-guided bombs, heavy-lift helicopters, attack helicopters, artillery shells, bunker-buster bombs, and armored vehicles. Notably, the report highlights a 15% surge in the total revenues of Israel's three major arms manufacturing companies following the onset of the aggression on Gaza, reaching a staggering $13.6 billion. The latest arms deal, which requires approval from both House and Senate committees, comes at a time when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested that a prisoner exchange deal and an end to the war on Gaza would not be approved 'unless it comes as a directive or clear order from the US president.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2305591	2025-01-04T00:41:18-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/08/manar-09806660016301811925.jpeg
Withdrawal: The Only Option for ‘Israel’ in South Lebanon	As the 60-day deadline for the Israeli withdrawal from occupied Lebanese territories approaches, reports and actions since the recent ceasefire on 27 November have raised serious doubts about the Zionist entity’s intentions to comply. This possibility has become a pressing concern, fueling debates over its implications and potential consequences for Lebanon and the broader region, Al-Akhbar Lebanese daily reported on Friday. This hypothesis of Israel’s 'non-withdrawal' has gained traction due to the consistent violations in areas south of the Litani River. Such violations include airstrikes, destruction of homes, and other aggressive acts. Observers suggest these actions reflect a strategic calculation by Israeli leadership, banking on Hezbollah’s apparent reluctance to reignite hostilities. Hezbollah’s commitment to upholding the ceasefire agreement, despite provocations, is seen by 'Israel' as a factor emboldening such brazen aggression, Al-Akhbar’s Ali Haidar wrote. A critical variable in the Israeli strategy appears to be the situation in Syria, which has impacted Hezbollah’s strategic depth. The fall of the Syrian regime and Israeli subsequent expansion into Syrian territories, occupying approximately 400 square kilometers, further demonstrates its offensive stance. This has occurred without any Syrian instigation and went by without a single military response, according to the report. Israeli occupation forces set fire to a house in the town of Bani Hayyan, south of Lebanon.#Bani_Hayyan #Lebanon @qudsn pic.twitter.com/ZSBt4OIBAt — ⚡️🌎 World News 🌐⚡️ (@ferozwala) January 3, 2025 Should 'Israel' fail to withdraw by the 27th of January, it would again be violating the terms of the ceasefire agreement it signed, undermining the credibility of both the Lebanese state and the agreement’s supervisory committee. Such a scenario would erode trust in the Lebanese government among residents of southern Lebanon and prove without doubt the inefficacy of diplomacy in the face of the Israeli barbarism. All of this would again pit Hezbollah’s resistance efforts as the only legitimate means to enforce Israeli compliance, which may mean a reignition of war, Al-Akhbar reported. Domestically, the persistence of the Israeli occupation complicates Lebanon’s political landscape. It greatly undermines arguments by resistance opponents that the Lebanese state, through international relations and diplomacy, can safeguard the nation without military resistance. The situation exposes weaknesses in Lebanon’s government, particularly in its handling of sovereignty and reconstruction efforts, Haidar added. He wrote that attempts by certain political leaders to shift blame onto the resistance, accusing it of monopolizing government decisions, further highlight Lebanon’s internal divisions. For Hezbollah, according to the Lebanese writer and analyst, the occupation represents an ongoing challenge that demands strategic responses. While the group has not disclosed specific plans, its leadership maintains that Israeli occupation of Lebanese land has no future. Any silence on this issue, they argue, would misrepresent the post-agreement reality and embolden further Israeli transgressions. The timing and nature of any response by the resistance will likely depend on its assessment of conditions on the ground, he added. However, Hezbollah has emphasized that its enhanced capabilities and experience since the liberation of the year 2000 make it well-prepared for renewed confrontations, that which was proven during the most recent battles, should they become necessary, according to Al-Akhbar. Hezbollah fighters in a photo released by the group's Military Media (image from archive). As the situation develops, the prospect of continued Zionist occupation poses a significant risk on the integrity of the ceasefire agreement, and stands as proof to opponents of armed resistance that the only language the Zionist enemy understands is that of the sword, Al-Akbar’s Haidar concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2305261	2025-01-03T13:24:06-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-06482690017359393356.jpg
Yemeni Armed Forces Strike Power Station, Military Target in 'Tel...	The Yemeni Armed Forces announced on Friday the successful execution of two military operations targeting the occupied city of Tel Aviv in the heart of occupied Palestinian territory. The operations involved a hypersonic ballistic missile, 'Palestine-2,' and a drone strike using the 'Jaffa' model. In a statement made during mass rallies in support of Gaza, held in the capital, Sana'a, Yemeni Armed Forces spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Saree outlined the operations. He confirmed that the missile, launched by Yemen's missile forces, accurately struck a power station east of the occupied Jaffa region. Brigadier Saree also revealed that the Yemeni Air Force, using the 'Jaffa' drone, carried out a successful military operation targeting an Israeli military site in the same area. He noted that the drone strike achieved its objective. 'These operations represent a victory for the Palestinian people and their fighters,' Saree stated, emphasizing that they serve as a response to the ongoing Israeli massacres in Gaza. He also clarified that these strikes are part of the fifth phase of Yemen’s support operations in the 'Promised Conquest and Sacred Jihad' campaign, directly retaliating against Israeli aggression on Yemen. Brigadier Saree reaffirmed the Yemeni Armed Forces' readiness to confront any potential aggression from U.S. and Israeli forces or their allies, stressing that Yemen is fully capable of defending its sovereignty and legitimate rights. He concluded by renewing his call for the Arab and Islamic worlds to take decisive action to end Israeli massacres against the people of Gaza. Yemeni Armed Forces Israeli Occupation Admits Failure to Intercept Yemeni Missile In a rare admission, Israeli media acknowledged the failure of both the Israeli enemy and US defense systems to intercept a missile launched from Yemen early this morning. According to reports from the Israeli enemy's media, the missile caused widespread panic, with its launch forcing approximately 5 million Zionists into bomb shelters. Failed Interception Attempts and Widespread Panic The Israeli occupation army admitted to failing in its attempts to intercept the Yemeni missile, which was launched towards the central area in occupied territories. As the missile was tracked, alarm sirens blared across 'Tel Aviv' and more than 150 cities and towns in the occupied areas. A spokesperson for the Israeli occupation army confirmed that the missile was detected as it entered occupied airspace, triggering the activation of warning systems in multiple regions, including central and southern areas. Explosion and Casualties The missile caused explosions near the occupied city of Al-Quds (Jerusalem) and its surrounding areas. Israeli reports confirmed that the missile struck a military base near Modiin, located west of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. Israeli emergency services reported injuries among settlers, particularly during their rushed attempts to seek shelter. Twelve settlers were injured while running for cover, and nine others were affected by panic following the activation of the alarm systems. Impact on Aviation In response to the missile strike, French airlines announced the suspension of flights to Tel Aviv until January 17. Moreover, air traffic at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv was halted once again following the Yemeni missile attack.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2305140	2025-01-03T09:31:58-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-01195600017359231906.png

Israeli occupation forces have continued their violations of the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon, launching a series of attacks on southern areas. On Thursday evening, the Israeli enemy conducted airstrikes on the outskirts of Jbaa and Mount Al-Rihan in the Iqlim Al-Tuffah region. Simultaneously, Israeli enemy troops carried out sweeping operations throughout the night and into Friday morning, targeting villages near the southern border, including Maroun Al-Ras, Tallousa, Markaba, and Al-Naqoura. Explosions were reported in Bani Hayyan and Kfar Kila, as well as in Wadi Muzlim, an area between Beit Lif and Ramiya, where Israeli occupation forces had advanced earlier.

Notable incidents included operations near Marwahin, opposite the Zionist Zar'it barracks, and in Aita Al-Shaab, adjacent to the Israeli Al-Raheb military site. Persistent Airspace Violations Israeli surveillance drones and reconnaissance aircraft have maintained a constant presence over southern Lebanon, conducting round-the-clock monitoring and intelligence-gathering operations, further breaching the ceasefire terms. In Beirut's Dahiyeh, reconnaissance drones have been observed flying at low altitudes throughout the day. Lebanese Army Deployment to Al-Naqoura Delayed Plans for the Lebanese Army to deploy in Al-Naqoura have been postponed indefinitely due to Israeli enemy delays in withdrawing from the area. According to Al-Akhbar newspaper, the Lebanese Army had coordinated with the UN’s oversight committee, led by US officer Gasper Jeffers, who reportedly requested more time for Israeli occupation forces to leave. A source familiar with the matter revealed that the Lebanese Army had initiated the deployment plan, urging the committee to pressure the Israeli enemy for a complete withdrawal from the western sector. However, no decision was reached. The Lebanese Army informed the committee of its intention to enter Al-Naqoura after completing its deployment in Shama. Despite this, Israeli enemy forces have employed delaying tactics, appearing to maintain control over the situation. According to Al-Akhbar, the Israeli enemy’s maneuvering undermines Lebanese initiatives and perpetuates its hold over the border region.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2305008	2025-01-03T06:29:22-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-08801580017359143249.jpg

Massive demonstrations have erupted across Yemen in support of the Palestinian people and their resistance against Israeli aggression.

‘Israel’ Launches Airstrikes on Syrian Defense Sites Amid Ongoing...	Israeli warplanes carried out targeted strikes on Syrian defense production facilities located in the eastern countryside of Aleppo late Thursday night. The airstrikes, which aimed to cripple Syria's arms manufacturing capabilities, came amidst an ongoing Israeli ground offensive that has seen Israeli forces push deep into Syrian territory. According to reports, Israeli troops have advanced as far as the strategically important al-Mantara Dam in the Quneitra countryside, effectively seizing control of the buffer zone east of the Golan Heights. This area includes six critical bodies of water and the tactically valuable Mount Hermon peak. The scale of Israel's military activities in Syria is said to be equivalent to the deployment of two full brigades, underscoring the seriousness of the situation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2304656	2025-01-03T00:16:44-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-06051240017343434558.jpg

Iranians Commemorate Martyrdom Anniversary of General Suleimani a...	Ceremonies have been held across Iran to commemorate the martyrdom anniversary of anti-terror icon Lieutenant General Qassem Suleimani, the commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) who was assassinated by the US in Iraq on January 3, 2020. The ceremonies were held on Thursday in different Iranian cities including the capital Tehran where people as well as top military and state officials gathered at the Grand Mosalla Mosque to pay tribute to General Soleimani and other martyrs who lost their lives in fighting against terrorism and defending holy shrines in the West Asia region in the past years. Participants in the Tehran ceremony carried pictures of Hajj Qassem Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a senior commander of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) who was martyred alongside the top Iranian general in a US drone strike near Iraq’s capital Baghdad. The participants also carried pictures of resistance leaders including Lebanon’s Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and Palestine’s Hamas leaders Ismail Haniyeh and Yayha Sinwar, all assassinated by the Israeli regime in a span of several months in 2024. 'Resistance will continue' Yemen’s Ambassador to Tehran Ibrahim Mohammad al-Deilami was in attendance as well, making a speech in which he promised that the Resistance Axis will continue to fight despite Israeli crimes. He also hailed the Iranian people for their support of the Resistance Axis and the Palestinian people in their struggle to liberate their land from the Israeli occupation. Najaf commemoration ceremony A ceremony was also held on Thursday in Iraq’s holy city of Najaf to commemorate the martyrdom anniversary of General Soleimani and al-Muhandis. Iran’s Supreme Leader’s Representative to Iraq Ayatollah Sayyed Mojtaba Hosseini made a speech in Najaf, emphasizing the need for continuing the path of the martyrs who defended the dignity of the Islamic Ummah. He also spoke about the Israeli regime’s crimes in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria, saying that Israeli authorities should stand trial over those crimes including the killing of civilians and the destruction of infrastructure. The cleric said that the Israeli regime and its supporters are responsible for the war crimes committed against the oppressed people in the region.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2304458	2025-01-02T14:27:19-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-03761680017358568295.jpg
Houthi Vows Inflicting More Pain on ‘Israel’ in Support of Gaza d...	Head of Yemen's Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi stressed on Thursday that the confrontation with the Zionist enemy in support of Gaza would continue despite all the conspiracies of the United States and the rest of the Western states. 'The Israeli enemy realizes that no matter how much it attacks, with the Americans and the British, and even if whoever joins it, it will not affect the Yemeni position.' In a televised speech, Sayyed Houthi affirmed that Yemen has achieved a great victory, vowing inflicting more pain upon the Zionist entity in support of Gaza. 'Our operations are continuing intensively to target the Israeli enemy in support of the Palestinian people and their mujahideen.' Tackling the latest developments, Sayyed Houthi indicated that the recent Yemeni attacks on the Zionist entity included the strategic targets of Jaffa (Tel Aviv), Ben Gurion airport, electric plant in south of Al-Quds, and Nevatim airbase. Houthi underlined the Yemeni missile and drone attack on the US aircraft carrier Truman, adding that the operation frustrated a US aggression on Yemen and led to Truman withdrawal. Sayyed Houthi also underscored the importance of jihad and weaponry possession, stressing that the aggression will never prevent the Yemenis from supporting Gaza. 'The battle we are fighting with the Americans is at a level that necessarily pushes us to develop our military capabilities, and this is what has been done.' US-British aggression aircraft launched on Tuesday air strikes on the capital, Sanaa. Yemeni sources reported that 10 raids targeted the 22 May Complex in Al-Thawra District and two raids hit Al-Ardi Complex in Al-Safiyah District.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2304337	2025-01-02T12:49:41-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-08973250017358509744.jpg
Imam Khamenei Welcomes Families of Resistance Front Martyrs on Fi...	Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei has paid tribute to Iran’s top anti-terror commander Lieutenant General Qassem Suleimani ahead of his fifth martyrdom anniversary. 'Martyr Suleimani’s constant strategy was to revive the Resistance Front,' Ayatollah Khamenei said during a meeting with a group of families of martyrs, veterans, and resistance activists on Wednesday morning. He said if it were not for the endeavors of the late commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), the fate of all holy sites would have been the same as the shrine of Samarra in Iraq, arguing that the martyrs of the fight against terrorism did not lose their precious lives in vain. 'Some people, due to a lack of proper analysis, understanding, and knowledge of the issues, imagine and say, and perhaps promote, that with the recent events in the region, the blood [of martyrs] defending the shrine was wasted,' he lamented. 'They are making a grave mistake,' he asserted. 'If these lives had not been sacrificed and this struggle had not been fought and Hajj Qassem Suleimani had not moved with such courage in the mountains and deserts of this region and had not taken [these martyrs] with him, there would be no holy [shrine] today.' According to Ayatollah Khamenei, General Suleimani was a man of the battlefield who played an irreplaceable role in the region. 'He himself did not say or write much. I do not think that anyone else has written about these characteristics and these details for posterity,' he said. 'This is one of the things that are a source of regret.' ‘Ultimate victory belongs to truth front’ Elsewhere in his remarks, the Supreme Leader argued that if countries make the mistake of removing their forces of stability and strength, who are the faithful youth, from the scene, they will become like Syria. However, he noted that the ultimate victory of the front of truth against the enemies is certain, adding, 'Know that those who are running wild today will one day be trampled under the feet of the believers.' The American bases in Syria will be trampled upon under the feet of the Syrian youth, he predicted. Ayatollah Khamenei described Lebanon and Yemen as symbols of resistance, saying they will emerge victorious. He also said that the events of these past few years and the anti-terror victories of the 'defenders of the shrine' have shown that the Islamic Revolution is alive. Al-Manar TV Al-Manar TV corresponded attended the event, reporting the sincere moments of the meeting between the Leader and the members of the sacrificing families. Zeinab Qassem Suleimani said that the Resistance, Hezbollah and Palestine are alive, adding that the successors of Martyr Qassem Suleimani will follow his path.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2304271	2025-01-02T11:57:23-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-08209610017358467426.png

Multiple violations of the ceasefire agreement were reported on Thursday in the western villages of southern Lebanon, near the border with occupied Palestine. Notably, Israeli forces, including armored units and infantry, advanced towards the outskirts of Beit Lif. According to Al-Manar correspondent, this Israeli enemy military movement occurred between the villages of Ramia and Beit Lif, heading towards Wadi Muzlem, originating from the border region of Al-Salhani. Al-Manar correspondent Ali Shouaib captures 8 Israeli Merkava tanks, a bulldozer, Hummers, and infantry advancing towards the area, clearing land in the valley Heavy Gunfire and Shelling In conjunction with this advance, Israeli occupation forces conducted a thorough sweep of the area, using machine guns to fire heavy bursts towards the village.

Al-Manar correspondent stated that over the past week, Israeli enemy forces withdrew a significant number of their vehicles and troops from the Al-Naqoura vicinity, moving towards Alam Al-Shaab and then into the occupied Palestinian territories. The Lebanese Army has confirmed its readiness to enter various southern areas previously vacated by Israeli forces. While there is no specific date set for the Lebanese Army's entry into Al-Naqoura, the situation remains fluid, with operations unfolding without prior scheduling, as witnessed in previous withdrawal and deployment actions along the border.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2304040	2025-01-02T05:00:57-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-00307230017358222884.jpg
Hamas Commemorates Saleh Al-Arouri’s Martyrdom, Vows Unwavering R...	Hamas reaffirmed its commitment to steadfastness and resistance against the Israeli occupation on the first anniversary of the assassination of Saleh Al-Arouri, Deputy Head of Hamas' Political Bureau and its leader in the West Bank, along with other cadres. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the movement emphasized that such assassinations have failed and will continue to fail in breaking the will of the Palestinian people and their unwavering resistance. A Beacon of Sacrifice 'The pure blood of martyr Sheikh Saleh Al-Arouri and his comrades mingled with the blood of tens of thousands of martyrs from Gaza, the West Bank, and the diaspora, as well as the blood of the nation’s martyrs in Operation Al-Aqsa Flood for Palestine and the sacred Al-Aqsa Mosque, and will forever serve as a guiding beacon for every fighter and resistor on the path to liberation,' Hamas affirmed. The movement praised Al-Arouri's life as one dedicated to sacrifice, jihad, and unwavering commitment to the Palestinian cause, particularly Al-Quds (occupied Jerusalem) and Al-Aqsa Mosque. 'He and his comrades achieved the highest aspiration of martyrdom in the struggle, leaving behind steadfast men to carry the banner, defend our people, and continue the journey until liberation and return, God willing.' Hamas reiterated that it remains unshaken despite the loss of its leaders and founders, noting that figures such as Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, Sheikh Ahmad Yassine, and Dr. Abdel Aziz Al-Rantisi have all embraced martyrdom for the dignity of the Palestinian people and the nation. 'This movement, which has offered its leaders and founders as martyrs, will never be defeated.' Call to Action The movement urged Palestinians to follow the example of these great leaders by intensifying resistance against the Israeli occupation, which it described as having surpassed all bounds of human rationality with its crimes. It also called for escalating confrontation and solidarity with the Palestinian cause, its sacred sites, and its prisoners. Commitment to Victory Hamas concluded by affirming its unwavering dedication to the path of its martyred leaders. 'We march on this path until victory and liberation, unafraid of the occupation's terrorism or the support it receives from some Western nations for its criminal regime.' Martyr Sheikh Saleh Al-Arouri was assassinated on Tuesday, January 2, 2024, in an Israeli airstrike targeting an apartment and a car in Beirut’s Dahiyeh. Two commanders of Al-Qassam Brigades, Samir Fandi and Azzam Al-Aqraa, were also martyred in the attack.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2303941	2025-01-02T04:11:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-046699200170427526610.jpg

Abu Hamza, the spokesperson for Saraya al-Quds, the armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, disclosed that an Israeli captive attempted suicide three days ago due to his deteriorating mental state.

In response to this development, Saraya al-Quds has tightened security measures to ensure the safety of the Israeli captives. The news of the suicide attempt comes amidst growing discontent among the families of Israeli captives held in Gaza, who have been staging protests across the occupied territories, criticizing their government's handling of the prisoner swap talks. The incident has further underscored the urgency and sensitivity of the issue, as the mental well-being of the captives hangs in the balance. Concurrently, the Israeli military has acknowledged a significant rise in suicide cases among its own ranks, particularly among mobilized reserve troops, as the ongoing war takes a heavy toll on soldiers' mental health. The army's data reveals that 38 soldiers committed suicide in 2023 and 2024, with a staggering 28 of these cases occurring after October 7, 2023, coinciding with the escalation of the conflict. The surge in suicides is attributed to the unprecedented mobilization of approximately 300,000 reservists during the war.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2303930	2025-01-02T03:42:40-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/02/manar-05345980016772342712-e1677234357952.jpg

At least 10 people were killed and as many as 35 injured after a truck drove into a large crowd on Bourbon Street in New Orleans' French Quarter early on Wednesday during a New Year's celebration, according to the FBI and city leaders. The pick-up truck crashed into the crowd at high speed around 3:15 a.m. and within moments the driver started firing on police officers from inside the vehicle, New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said at an early morning news conference. Two officers were shot and are now being treated in stable condition. CNN and ABC News, citing unnamed officials, said the gunman was killed at the scene. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell told reporters that the driver was on a mission to kill as many people as possible. 'He was hell bent on creating the carnage and the damage that he did . . . This man was trying to run over as many people as he possibly could. It was not a DUI situation,' Cantrell said. Hundreds of police officers were in the city for New Year's Eve duty when the assault happened, Cantrell said. The driver of the truck swerved around barricades on his way into the crowd, she said. 'Last night, we had over 300 officers out here, and because of the intentional mindset of this perpetrator who went around our barricades in order to conduct this,' the mayor said.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2303281	2025-01-01T06:31:18-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-01282770017357418649.png
Imam Hails Martyr Suleimani’s Unique Sacrifices in Reviving Resis...	The Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, has praised the 'unique' sacrifices of Iran's top anti-terror commander, Lieutenant General Qassem Suleimani, who was assassinated by the United States in 2020. Addressing a gathering of families of martyrs, veterans, and resistance activists, Imam Khamenei described Martyr Suleimani's role in the fight against terrorism as 'matchless' and said his sacrifices and services 'must remain in our political teachings.' The Leader emphasized that Martyr Suleimani's 'constant strategy was to revive the Resistance Front,' and he 'always tried to revitalize the resistance' across the region. Defending the holy sites was a tenet for the revered commander, who invariably referred to Iran as a 'sacred shrine.' Imam Khamenei said Suleimani's global perspective and refusal to adopt a 'closed and limited outlook' were crucial characteristics that enabled him to detect and prevent dangers from beyond Iran's borders. 📹 Imam Khamenei in commemoration ceremony of the fifth anniversary of the martyrdom of Gen. Qasem Soleimani: The power of faith in #Lebanon and #Yemen will ultimately prevail pic.twitter.com/erIIOgxrdY — Khamenei Media (@Khamenei_m) January 1, 2025 The Leader underlined that the developments in the past few years, including the defense of holy shrines in Iraq, Syria, and across the region, have proven that the Islamic Revolution is 'alive.' He promised that 'the truth front will definitely emerge victorious,' with the 'flag of resistance' still flying high despite the efforts of 'ill-wishers.' Touching on the US assassination of Suleimani and his companion, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, Imam Khamenei emphasized that the IRGC's missile attack on the US-run Ain al-Asad base in Iraq was just the 'first slap' in retaliation. He also vowed that American bases in Syria would be 'trampled upon under the feet of Syrian youth,' as the country belongs to its people. The Leader's powerful tribute to Martyr Suleimani's legacy and the unwavering resilience of the Resistance Front has once again underscored the enduring impact of the Iranian commander's sacrifices in the fight against terrorism and the defense of the Islamic Republic's interests in the region.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2303215	2025-01-01T05:51:28-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-040528700173573947910.jpg
The American Role in Post-Regime Syria: Geopolitical Stakes and S...	Translated and edited by Al-Manar English Website The United States has long viewed Syria as a critical piece in its West Asian foreign policy. Geographically situated at the crossroads of vital regions, Syria’s strategic importance encompasses economic, political, and security interests. With the fall of the Syrian government in 2024, the United States has intensified efforts to move in on what many describe as its new 'golden opportunity' to secure a permanent place in the administration of the country. Strategic Importance of Syria Syria’s proximity to occupied Palestine, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey grants it a central role in shaping regional dynamics. Protecting 'Israel' remains a cornerstone of US policy, positioning Syria’s governance as a crucial factor in ensuring Tel Aviv’s security and its ability to conduct massive aggressions throughout the region with impunity. As a transportation hub and a regional bridge for various alliances, Syria influences both resistance movements and US takeover strategies. Efforts to undermine the Syrian state trace back to 2003, following the US invasion of Iraq. Under the 'domino effect' theory, Washington viewed Iraq as a gateway to transforming Syria and eroding resistance in Lebanon and Palestine to the Zionist project. Despite setbacks such as the failure of these initiatives in 2006 and 2007, the US pursued regime change in Syria, again during the Arab Spring in 2011, involving itself in the civil war in multiple ways during the term of Barack Obama who was president then. This culminated in the rise of opposition forces, with the support of 'Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham' (HTS) being their most recent initiative, leading to HTS’ seizing control of Damascus in 2024. US Goals and Regional Strategies The regime’s collapse presented Washington with an opportunity to reshape West Asian alliances and block rivals like Russia and China from leveraging Syria’s Mediterranean access. Key US objectives include preventing Syria from serving as a base for 'fundamentalist terrorism' or resistance movements targeting 'Israel'. Drawing parallels to the 'Camp David' framework that realigned Egypt, US policymakers aim to distance Syria from the Israeli genocidal war on Gaza and resistance networks. US occupation forces in Syria (photo from archive). Security expert Ali Rizk highlights, to Al-Manar, US efforts to sideline Iranian influence in Syria while engaging Turkey in shared security goals. However, tensions remain over issues such as the Kurdish autonomy. Turkey, a NATO ally, prioritizes neutralizing Kurdish militias and managing refugee repatriation, while 'Israel' reportedly prefers a fragmented Syrian state. Additionally, economic strategies—such as the proposed Qatari gas pipeline to Europe and the 'Indian corridor' trade initiative—reflect broader US ambitions to entrench its economic control. HTS and US Dynamics The rise of HTS in Damascus has highlighted a behind-the-scenes relationship with Washington. HTS seeks international recognition, leveraging security and political concessions to gain US favor. Leader Abu Mohammad Al-Joulani, now known as Ahmad Al-Shara’ has publicly aligned with American narratives, targeting Iran and Russia while downplaying the illegal US military presence in Syria, including key bases like Al-Tanf. Critics argue that US cooperation with HTS is transactional, reflecting America’s broader pattern of subordinating allies to its strategic interests. HTS’s silence on the 'Israeli' actions in southern Syria and the Palestinian plight underscores its pragmatic alignment with US priorities, even as it seeks relief from sanctions such as the Caesar Act to stabilize Syria’s economy. NEA A/S Leaf met today with HTS officials to discuss principles agreed upon by the U.S. and partners in Aqaba - support for an inclusive Syrian led political process that results in representative government, which respects the rights of all Syrians. — U.S. Embassy Syria (@USEmbassySyria) December 20, 2024 Challenges to US Influence Despite its gains, obstacles still remain preventing the US from consolidating its influence. Regional players like Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE vie for sway in Syria, complicating Washington’s efforts to reconcile competing interests which may force it to withdraw on some issues. Kurdish relations remain a contentious point, with potential conflicts further straining US leverage. Domestic dynamics, including HTS’s consolidation of power, risk alienating the Syrian populace, potentially undermining long-term stability. Regardless, the future of Syria’s governance will no doubt involve heavy US involvement, whether through strategic partnerships or economic integration, Washington’s role in post-regime Syria will reshape West Asia’s geopolitical landscape.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2303116	2025-01-01T04:43:10-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-05497840017357349751.jpg
Sheikh Qassem: Hezbollah Has Recovered, Resistance Persistent	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem said on Wednesday that Hezbollah has recovered and regained its strength, stressing that the resistance in Lebanon endures. During the Fourth International Conference to Honor Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi Mesbah Yazdi in Tehran, Sheikh Qassem stated the resistance’s deep-rooted faith and loyal manpower enable it to become stronger.

New US-UK Aggression Targets Sanaa as Israeli Circles Reflect Des...	US-British aggression aircraft launched on Tuesday air strikes on the capital, Sanaa. Yemeni sources reported that 10 raids targeted the 22 May Complex in Al-Thawra District and two raids hit Al-Ardi Complex in Al-Safiyah District. Multiple Israeli air raids on Yemen targeted on Thursday Sanaa and Hodeidah governorates, according to Yemeni media outlets. Meanwhile, the Zionist reports indicated that the enemy attacked certain targets in Yemen. Yemeni Strikes The Yemeni Armed Forces (YAF) executed two high-profile operations targeting key Israeli infrastructure on Tuesday, while simultaneously foiling a planned aerial assault by US forces. Brigadier General Yahya Saree, spokesperson for the YAF, revealed that the missile force launched a sophisticated hypersonic ballistic missile, dubbed Palestine-2, which struck its intended target of Ben Gurion Airport in the city of Yafa (Tel Aviv) with pinpoint precision. Yemeni Armed Forces Spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Sarea Concurrently, a Zulfiqar-type ballistic missile was deployed to strike a critical power station in southern occupied al-Quds, causing significant damage. The strikes sent shockwaves through the region, underscoring Yemen’s resolve to defend itself against foreign aggression. In a remarkable feat of coordination, the YAF’s naval, missile, and UAV forces also conducted a joint operation targeting the USS Harry S. Truman, an American aircraft carrier preparing to launch a major aerial attack against Yemen. Deploying a swarm of drones and cruise missiles, the Yemeni forces successfully thwarted the impending assault, dealing a blow to US military ambitions in the region. Saree emphasized that these operations serve as a clear message to ‘Israel’ and its allies, stating that Yemeni forces will continue to strike until the aggression against Gaza ceases and the suffocating blockade on the Palestinian strip is lifted. On Monday, sirens sounded across several city settlements and Israeli-occupied areas in central Palestine, amid a Yemeni missile attack. The attack, which came just hours after American and British forces launched strikes on Yemen’s al-Tuhayta district south of the port city of Hodeidah, sent shockwaves through the region. Israeli Circles The Yemeni strikes have formed a front of attrition amid the continuation of the missile and drone fire from Yemen faced by Israeli failure to cope with the peril, which drives the Zionists into despair. Zionist circles recommended pushing the Yemenis into an internal sedition in order to undermine their military capabilities threatening 'Israel', blockading Yemen, bombing Iran, without providing any guarantee that such steps could stop their Gaza support front. Israeli Channel 13 indicated that Tel Aviv does not the military capabilities needed to face the Yemeni threat, adding that the 'Houthis' have the ability to fire missiles every day and night.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2302808	2024-12-31T09:29:32-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-00471340017356661528.jpg
Lebanese Army Deploys Troops in Shamma Town after Withdrawal of I...	The Lebanese Army announced on Tuesday that it deployed its troops in Shamaa town, Tyre district, South Lebanon, after the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces. The Army Command posted that the move came in coordination with the United Nations and the withdrawal of the occupation forces followed contacts conducted by the ceasefire monitor committee. On November 27, 2024, a ceasefire took into effect in implementation of an indirect deal brokered by the United Nations, US, and France and ended a 66-day Israeli war on Lebanon. The Lebanese military units deployed at the Shamaa site they evacuated just before the war in light of the Zionist groun incursion. UNIFIL troops had scanned the area to detect unexploded munitions in preparation of the Lebanese Army deployment which precedes the return of the civilians. The Lebanese Army called on Shamma locals to avoid returning to their town before it allows them to do that in order to shun any Israeli attack on them. تمركزت وحدات الجيش حول بلدة شمع - صور بالتنسيق مع قوة الأمم المتحدة المؤقتة في لبنان - اليونيفيل ضمن إطار تعزيز الانتشار في المنطقة، وبدأت الدخول إليها بالتزامن مع انسحاب العدو الإسرائيلي منها، وذلك بعد الاتصالات التي أجرتها اللجنة الخماسية للإشراف على اتفاق وقف إطلاق النار… pic.twitter.com/Fbz38Yv0kw — الجيش اللبناني (@LebarmyOfficial) December 31, 2024 Al-Manar correspondent indicated that the Lebanese occupation forces are still controlling overlooking hills and may attack civilians in several towns as what happened in Khiam and Teir Harfa.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2302753	2024-12-31T08:43:48-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-03922130017356634002.jpg
Israeli Brutality Against Palestinian Prisoners Reaches New Heigh...	Hamas has slammed the Israeli regime for its savagery and blatant disregard for human rights following the deaths of five Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody. The Palestinian resistance movement asserted that the alarming rise in rights violations against the heroic Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons, including forced concealment, medical neglect, torture, and harassment, is a direct result of international inaction and the unwavering support provided to the Israeli occupiers by the United States. Hamas called upon the entire Palestinian nation to take to the streets in widespread rallies to show solidarity with the detainees who are repeatedly subjected to acts of aggression by the occupying forces. This call to action comes amidst the ongoing genocide and ethnic cleansing being perpetrated by Israel in Gaza. Hamas also urged all human rights organizations to take proactive measures in condemning the brutal policies of the occupying regime's officials.

Gantz: Gov’t Survival More Important to Netanyahu from Releasing ...	Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is concerned with the survival of his government rather than releasing the Israeli captives held by Hamas Palestinian resistance group in Gaza. For Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 'the survival of his government is more important… than the return of the abducted here and now,' Gantz stated at a conference organized by the Calcalist financial daily. 'Of the three goals of the war that concern the Gaza Strip, two have not yet been achieved – the collapse of Hamas’s rule and the return of our hostages,' the chairman of the so-called National Unity alliance noted, as quoted by The Times of Israel. 'It is more important for the prime minister to survive politically than to allow another civilian government in the Gaza Strip, and therefore the IDF will continue to wallow there for a long time.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a video message issued June 19, 2024. Turning to Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir whom he called the 'minister of chaos' — both of whom have been outspoken in their opposition to an agreement with Hamas — Gantz said that 'the truth is that both of you will not resign from the government even if there is a full and painful deal.'

‘Israel’ to Spend $150 mn on Hasbara to Polish Image	The Israeli Foreign Ministry’s budget for the so-called 'public diplomacy' in 2025 is expected to include massive allocation: $150 million — over 20 times what it was before the war began in 2023, Israeli media reported earlier last week. The dramatic expenditure comes as public opinion about the Zionist entity around the world has been intensely battered as a result of the brutal war on Gaza that has killed has killed more than 45,000 people and left the strip in ruins with much of its population facing displacement, disease, and hunger. Under the new budget, Israel’s Foreign Ministry will receive $150 million, on top of what it gets for its existing activities, for what’s officially known as public diplomacy, or in Hebrew, hasbara, The Jewish News of Northern California reported. This massive increase is aimed at reshaping international opinion through aggressive propaganda campaigns targeting American college campuses, social media platforms, and the foreign press. The effort will be coordinated with American Jewish organizations and the Israeli Diaspora Affairs Ministry, according to Drop Site News. 🚨Breaking: Israel announces a dramatic expansion to its ‘Hasbara’ (propaganda) operations in 2025 budget.

Politician Gideon Saar and his New Hope party agreed to rejoin the coalition in return for the funding and the appointment of Saar as the Zionist entity’s foreign minister. Israeli media reported that Saar doesn’t have a detailed plan for how to spend the money yet, but at the time he signed the coalition agreement with Netanyahu, his office released a statement saying it would be used to influence sentiment in the foreign press and on social media. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar (image from November 2024).

Netanyahu’s Illusion of 'Absolute Victory' Leaves Gaza in Ruins a...	After 452 days of relentless Israeli aggression on the besieged Gaza Strip, it has become painfully clear that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is consumed by a delusional pursuit of 'absolute victory' at any cost. Even as his own prisoners face almost certain death in Gaza, Netanyahu remains fixated on preserving his grip on power, prioritizing his own political survival over the lives of captured Israelis. Benjamin Netanyahu has clarified that the occupation state will resume the genocide in Gaza even if a deal is reached with Hamas. — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) December 30, 2024 Benny Gantz, leader of the so-called 'state camp in 'Israel',' has bluntly stated that Netanyahu 'gives more importance to his rule than to their return.' Meanwhile, informed Zionist sources quoted by Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper ominously warn that 'the war will not end as long as Hamas controls the Gaza Strip militarily and civilly' and threaten a return to fighting even if a deal is reached. As fierce clashes rage in northern Gaza between the Palestinian resistance and occupying forces, the Israeli army continues its genocidal crimes, displacing and starving some 80,000 Palestinians in Jabalia, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia since October 5th. The grim toll stands at over 4,000 martyred, 12,000 wounded, and 1,750 imprisoned.

They point out the dismal track record - only 8 prisoners rescued by 'Israel' over 452 days of bloodshed. Yet Netanyahu and his ministers stubbornly refuse to make any concessions, demanding nothing less than complete Palestinian surrender. This intransigence persists even as the resistance proves its resilience and ability to strike back against the occupation's brutality. Amidst the chaos and carnage, heart-wrenching scenes unfold daily. Hundreds of distress calls pour in from displaced Gazans whose makeshift tents and shelters are inundated by driving rains. The Civil Defense scrambles to evacuate citizens to other woefully inadequate spaces, many left shivering in the open, exposed to bitter cold. Thousands of tents housing the displaced lack even the barest necessities, providing scant protection against raging winds that threaten to uproot them entirely.

Shelling of a sewage pumping station disrupts emergency plans and raises the specter of a looming health and environmental catastrophe. In just the past 24 hours, the Israeli occupation army perpetrated three massacres, slaughtering 27 Palestinians and wounding 149. The total number of martyrs since October 7, 2023 has skyrocketed to a staggering 45,541, with 108,338 injured. Even UNRWA, the UN agency tasked with aiding Palestinian refugees, has not been spared the occupation's wrath. The agency reports 258 of its employees killed in Gaza since the war began, with about 650 attacks on its buildings and facilities. Over two-thirds of UNRWA's buildings, primarily schools, are damaged or destroyed. At least 745 Palestinians have been killed while seeking shelter and protection at UN sites.

Hezbollah Political Council Deputy Chief Mahmoud Komati stressed on Monday that Hezbollah is committed to the ceasefire in South Lebanon during the first 60 days mentioned in the text of the indirect deal. 'Day 61 will be different,' Komati affirmed, indicating that the Islamic Resistance would deal with the Israeli occupation forces if they do not withdraw from South Lebanon accordingly without giving further details. Hajj Komati noted that the Resistance supporters are demanding a swift response to the Israeli violations of the ceasefire. In an interview with Al-Manar TV, the former minister underlined that Hezbollah will not allow any local or foreign party to tamper with the red lines of the Resistance weaponry and the reconstruction program. The rocketry stockpile and the various military capabilities of the resistance are still there, Komati highlighted, adding that the missile fire at Tel Aviv on the last Sunday of the war made the Israeli enemy demand USA to finalize the dea. Hezbollah welcomes any initiative from any country that intends to help Lebanon implement the reconstruction program without political preconditions, Hajj Komati said. Hezbollah official warned that the performance of certain political parties in Lebanon against Lebanon serves the Israeli schemes, calling on them to demand the Zionist withdrawal from South Lebanon. 'Some of them provided the enemy with data about certain institutions, like Al-Qard Al-Hasan Association. Is this the proper war to build the nation?' The political talk about the disarmament of the resistance leads the country into chaos, Komati added, urging national dialogue among the various parties. Komati emphasized that Hezbollah supports the election of a new president in Lebanon, pointing out that those who used to demand the parliament to convene are not calling for postponing the vote session. Hezbollah official also underscored that the Resistance Party wants to have decent relations with the Arab countries without any political provocation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2301983	2024-12-30T12:57:46-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-02633150017355922524.jpg

It is worth noting that the Israeli occupation army failed to reach Taybeh town during the war which was ended by November 27 truce that stipulates the withdrawal of the enemy troops in two months.

Gaza Resistance Proves Resilient Despite Israeli Onslaught; Occup...	The indomitable spirit of the Palestinian resistance in the northern Gaza Strip continues to shine through despite the relentless onslaught of attacks by Israeli occupation forces. Even in the face of genocidal tactics, widespread home demolitions, forced displacement of civilians, and the deliberate destruction of hospitals and medical facilities, the resistance has only grown stronger and more resolute. The legitimacy of their struggle is undeniable after 451 days of enduring these egregious war crimes in the absence of any meaningful intervention from the international community or global human rights organizations. The occupation army itself has been forced to acknowledge the heavy toll inflicted upon it by Palestinian fighters, announcing that one of its officers from the Givati Brigade was seriously wounded in recent battles in northern Gaza. This comes on top of the army's admission hours earlier that a soldier was killed in the same area, with another gravely injured in a separate incident - bringing the total number of Israeli occupation soldiers killed in the latest operation in Jabalia to 40. Meanwhile, the Al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, revealed that it had carried out missile strikes targeting Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and illegal Israeli settlements surrounding Gaza over the past 48 hours. In a desperate bid to crush the resistance, the occupation forces have only intensified their attacks on the besieged enclave's already crippled healthcare system. Occupation troops raided hospitals, arresting four patients, one of them in critical condition, as they were being transferred from the Indonesian Hospital to Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. The Israeli military also issued orders for the complete evacuation of Beit Hanoun in the north.

Some Israeli officials have expressed cautious optimism about reaching a deal, emphasizing the need for an immediate full or partial ceasefire to avoid undermining supposed 'achievements' of the assault on Gaza. However, the Netanyahu government swiftly denied any progress. As the aggression grinds on, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to deepen. Seven Palestinians displaced by the fighting have died due to the severe cold, with more deaths expected amid deteriorating conditions and flooding of makeshift shelters. The municipality of Gaza highlighted the immense suffering of the displaced, lamenting the lack of resources to assist them as the city grapples with the aftermath of massive damage to critical infrastructure.

Yemen Strikes Back: 13 Missile Operations Target ‘Israel’ in 10 D...	The Yemeni Armed Forces have launched a blistering series of missile attacks against Israeli targets over the past 10 days. Brigadier General Yahya Saree, spokesman for the Yemeni military, revealed on Sunday that the country's missile units conducted at least 13 separate operations, primarily targeting the heart of Israel in Tel Aviv, using advanced hypersonic ballistic missiles. #معركة_الفتح_الموعود_والجهاد_المقدس pic.twitter.com/MUQZ4qJDav — أمين حيان Ameen Hayyan (@AmeenHa2024yan) December 28, 2024 The strikes, carried out between December 19 and 28, aimed to defend Yemen while sending a powerful message of support to Palestinians enduring Israel's devastating war on Gaza since October. In one notable attack on Saturday, Yemeni forces scored a direct hit on the strategic Nevatim Airbase in the Negev Desert with a cutting-edge Palestine-2 hypersonic missile. The Yemeni resistance movement Ansarullah has also joined the fray, targeting Israeli, American and British ships to pressure an end to the Gaza onslaught, effectively shutting down the crucial Eilat port and dealing a major economic blow to Israel. As the Palestinian death toll soars past 45,000, mostly women and children, with over 108,000 wounded, Yemen has vowed to keep up its missile barrage until Israel ceases its relentless aerial and ground assaults on the beleaguered Gaza Strip. The Yemeni counterattack underscores the growing regional outrage against Israel's genocidal campaign and the unwavering support for Palestinian resistance against occupation and oppression.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2301279	2024-12-30T00:32:32-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-07574720017345809391.jpg

Israeli Occupation Forces Intensify Ceasefire Violations in Leban...	Israeli occupation forces persist in violating the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon, conducting excavation and sabotage operations in villages they failed to penetrate during their recent aggression. These incursions are seen as attempts to compensate for setbacks faced due to Hezbollah's steadfast resistance, which forced Israeli forces to retreat in several areas. Today, Israeli enemy troops, including two Merkava tanks and additional military vehicles, advanced from their positions near the border town of Adaisseh towards Al-Taybeh and Deir Siryan, causing damage in those areas. The Lebanese Army maintained its deployment in the region, while Israeli forces reportedly warned UNIFIL against operating in the vicinity, subtly threatening the safety of international peacekeepers. UNIFIL's Stance and International Concerns Candice Ardell, Deputy Director of UNIFIL’s Public Information Office, emphasized that the safety of peacekeeping forces is a top priority. She reiterated the Israeli enemy's obligations under Resolution 1701 to ensure the freedom of movement and safety of UNIFIL personnel across southern Lebanon. Despite these assurances, the Israeli occupation forces conducted movements in both eastern and western sectors of southern Lebanon, including between Al-Naqoura and Alma al-Shaab. This follows recent Israeli gunfire over Naqoura and controlled detonations in nearby villages. Additionally, Israeli enemy aircraft breached Lebanon's airspace multiple times. Expert Analysis: A Strategic Shift? Lebanese military expert Brigadier General Dr. Hasan Jouni views these violations as attempts by the Israeli enemy to project power following its inability to claim victory during its aggression on Lebanon. Jouni suggested that Israel might be leveraging reported US guarantees granting it operational freedom in Lebanon, although such arrangements hold no legitimacy for the Lebanese state. Three Scenarios Ahead In a press interview, retired Brigadier General and military expert Mounir Shehadeh outlined potential scenarios in light of the ongoing Israeli enemy's violations and the responses from the resistance and international actors to this escalation. According to Shahadeh, military projections indicate three possible scenarios by the end of the 60-day review period: Retired Brigadier General Mounir Shahadeh outlined three potential scenarios as tensions continue: Israel’s withdrawal and cessation of violations. Israel’s withdrawal with continued sporadic violations. Escalation, with no withdrawal and sustained aggression. Shehadeh warned that if violations persist, Hezbollah might resort to force, underscoring that political and international measures have been insufficient to deter Israeli aggression.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2301070	2024-12-29T07:38:52-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-05168890017354867693.jpg
Israeli Enemy Justifies Haniyeh Assassination Over Alleged Role i...	The Israeli Channel 12 report claims that documents found in Gaza tunnels early in the war implicated Martyr Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas' political bureau, in orchestrating the October 7 'Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.' The report alleges that Martyr Haniyeh’s involvement placed him at the top of Israel's assassination list. Planning and Surveillance in Tehran According to the report, Mossad prepared extensively for the operation, tracking Martyr Haniyeh’s movements and identifying his residence in a heavily guarded facility belonging to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Tehran. Former Israeli occupation military intelligence chief Tamir Hayman described Martyr Haniyeh as a symbolic political figure whose targeting marks a shift in the Israeli occupation's approach. 'Previously, Haniyeh was seen as a public figure, with military leaders Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif being primary targets,' Hayman stated. Alleged Coordination and Tehran Operation Ronen Bergman, a Zionist intelligence analyst for the 'Yedioth Ahronoth' daily, claimed that captured documents revealed deep military coordination between Martyr Haniyeh and Hamas leadership in Gaza. Martyr Haniyeh, who had been based in Doha, reportedly traveled frequently to Istanbul, Moscow, and Tehran. Mossad decided to act in Tehran, avoiding potential diplomatic fallout with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan or Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. The report alleges Mossad identified Martyr Haniyeh's specific room in the IRGC facility, planting a large explosive device that was detonated at 1:30 AM on July 31, 2024. Hamas Rejects Allegations Meanwhile, the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has denied the Israeli enemy's claims surrounding the assassination of its political bureau chief, martyr Ismail Haniya. In a statement issued Sunday, Hamas refuted these claims, emphasizing that investigations conducted by a joint committee comprising its security apparatus and Iranian counterparts concluded the assassination was executed with a guided missile. The missile, weighing 7.5 kilograms of explosives, reportedly targeted Martyr Haniya’s mobile phone directly. Condemnation of Violations The group described the Israeli enemy's allegations as a desperate attempt to divert attention from what it termed a 'compound crime,' involving the violation of Iran’s sovereignty through the use of a missile to strike an official site within the country. Details of the Incident Martyr Haniya and his aide, Waseem Abu Shaaban, were martyred in late July in Tehran after attending the inauguration of Iran's new president. The strike targeted Haniya at his location in the Iranian capital. Israeli Enemy Admits Last Monday, Zionist War Minister Yisrael Katz publicly admitted for the first time to the Israeli enemy's role in Martyr Haniya’s assassination. Speaking during a broadcast by the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation, Katz also issued threats against leaders of the Yemeni Ansar Allah movement.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2300982	2024-12-29T07:13:50-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/07/manar-02916120017223999614.jpg
Hospital Attacks Escalate on Day 450 of Israeli Aggression on Gaz...	For 450 consecutive days, Israeli occupation forces have carried out systematic atrocities in Gaza’s northern regions of Jabalia, Beit Hanoun, and Beit Lahia. Since last October 5, over 80,000 Palestinians remain trapped, facing relentless bombardment, forced displacement, and starvation. The attacks have claimed more than 4,000 lives, with over 12,000 wounded and 1,750 detained. Health Sector in Crisis The latest assault saw the destruction of Kamal Adwan Hospital, rendering northern Gaza devoid of operational medical facilities. Today, an airstrike targeted Al-Wafa Rehabilitation Hospital in Gaza City, killing seven Palestinians.

Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office dismissed reports of a 'mini-deal' before US President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. Meanwhile, Zionist hostage families issue an urgent plea to US President-elect Donald Trump, accusing Netanyahu of 'deception' and urging him to push for a comprehensive deal. Israeli media quoted Yehuda Cohen, father of hostage soldier Nimrod Cohen, saying in his message to Trump: 'Netanyahu is trying to deceive you. You might be the last hope to pressure him. Do not agree to a partial deal—it would be a death sentence for the remaining hostages.'

Aerial assaults targeted houses in Khan Younis and Rafah, leaving multiple casualties. Medical sources confirmed the martyrdom of Hani Abu Khater, 38, from wounds sustained in a previous strike. Recently released prisoners from Israeli detention were transferred to Gaza hospitals for treatment, many having been arrested during the ongoing military campaign. Director of Gaza’s health services, Dr. Mounir Al-Barsh, condemned Israel’s justification for targeting medical facilities, describing them as baseless and inhumane. This unrelenting aggression highlights the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, as international calls for a halt to the Israeli occupation’s brutality grow louder.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2300883	2024-12-29T04:24:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-09818920017354787144.jpg
Russia’s Sergey Lavrov Warns NATO and US of 'Decisive Response' t...	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has issued a stern warning to the United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), stating that Moscow will respond decisively with 'military-technical countermeasures' if new missile threats are posed to Russia. Prepared for Any Scenario In an interview with the RIA Novosti news agency, Lavrov emphasized that Russia is ready for any eventuality, noting that any actions taken will aim to establish conditions conducive to balanced dialogue. He underscored Moscow's focus on comprehensive measures to reduce the risk of conflict while addressing the root causes of fundamental security contradictions. 'We are prepared for any scenario while considering measures to create acceptable conditions for equal dialogue,' Lavrov stated. NATO Expansion: A Persistent Threat Lavrov highlighted NATO's eastward expansion as a longstanding and critical factor in the current security crisis. 'This very issue largely triggered the Ukrainian crisis and continues to pose a direct threat to Russia’s security,' he said. He suggested that arms control discussions could be on the table but only as part of a broader agenda to address security concerns comprehensively. Revisiting NATO’s Double-Track Decision When asked about the possibility of NATO repeating its 'double-track decision,' Lavrov refrained from speculation. The double-track decision, made in the late 1970s, involved deploying US medium-range missiles in Europe while negotiating disarmament with the Soviet Union. Lavrov pointed out that Russia might abandon its unilateral moratorium on deploying ground-based intermediate- and short-range missiles. 'This decision has become practically untenable despite still being in effect,' he remarked. US Ignoring Warnings Lavrov accused the United States of disregarding warnings from Russia and China and proceeding to deploy such weapons globally. 'The US has arrogantly ignored Russia’s and China’s warnings and is actively deploying weapons of this type in various parts of the world,' he said. ❗️LAVROV: US AND NATO WILL BE REBUFFED IF THEY THREATEN RUSSIA WITH MISSILES 🧵 The US and NATO will receive a decisive rebuff in the form of military-technical countermeasures from Moscow if they create new missile threats for Russia, Russian FM Sergey Lavrov told RIA Novosti. pic.twitter.com/pddzrgTQ4E — Sputnik (@SputnikInt) December 29, 2024 Oreshnik Missile Test Highlights Russian Resolve Lavrov concluded by referencing the recent successful test of Russia’s advanced 'Oreshnik' medium-range hypersonic missile system.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has also emphasized that any response to these developments will be proportional and resolute, solidifying Russia's stance in the face of escalating global tensions,' he affirmed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2300828	2024-12-29T03:41:20-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/09/manar-09607150016947106646.jpg

UN Envoy Voices Concern over Rising Violence in Syria, Calls for ...	United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen expressed serious concerns about intensifying violence in several Syrian regions, stressing the necessity for upholding Syria's sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity. During a closed session of the UN Security Council reiterated the Security Council Resolution 2254 as a 'framework for moving forward', Associate Spokesperson for the UN Secretary General Stephanie Tremblay stated in a press conference on Saturday. 'The key principles of Security Council Resolution 2254 have wide consensus,' Tremblay said. 'The transition there should be Syrian-led and owned, and ensuring inclusive, non-sectarian governance, including also constitutional reform, the holding of free and fair elections, and the meaningful women's participation,' the statement added. Last week, Pedersen urged for 'free and fair elections' to coincide with the end of the transitional period in Syria, expected in about three months. He also expressed hope for a political solution that would include the Kurdish self-administration. During a press conference in Syria, Pedersen underlined the urgent need for humanitarian assistance while highlighting long-term goals. UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher urged for a massive aid boost by donor countries to respond to 'this moment of hope' for Syria. 'Across the country, the needs are huge. Seven in 10 people are needing support right now,' Fletcher told AFP in a telephone interview as he visited Syria.

Hamdan noted that Hamas had proposed a deal which stipulates a complete ceasefire, gradual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and a full prisoner swap. 'However, Netanyahu's government rejected the proposal.' The Palestinian resistance continued on Friday attacking the Zionist occupation forces in Gaza. A Qassam fighter managed to blow himself up with an explosive belt in a Zionist force of 5 soldiers, killing and wounding them. As soon as the rescue forces arrived at the scene, Al-Qassam Brigades fighters sniped two of them and showered them with a number of Zionist-made hand grenades in the Tel Al-Zaatar area, east of the Jabalia camp, north of the Strip. Al-Quds Brigades fighters, for their part, targeted the Israeli occupation forces in Jabalia camp with artillery shells.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2299981	2024-12-27T13:10:12-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/05/manar-07193760017146371346.jpg

Al-Manar correspondent in South Lebanon, Ali Shoeib, inspected on Friday Wadi Hujeir area, South Lebanon, after the withdrawal of the Zionist occupation forces. The main highway which links several towns in South Lebanon was vandalized and bulldozed by the Israeli occupation forces that destroyed restaurants in the area. ‘Israel’ continued to violate the ceasefire agreement in southern Lebanon, with incursions into the areas of Qantara, Adshit al-Qusayr and Wadi al-Hujeir. Meanwhile, the member of the Loyalty to Resistance parliamentary bloc, Dr. Hasan Fadlallah, stressed that the Israeli enemy is trying to take the advantage of the ceasefire agreement in order to destroy the Lebanese border villages and towns. MP Fadlallah stressed that the sponsor states as well as the United Nations and the Lebanese government have to deter the Israeli enemy, adding that the supporters of the resistance in South Lebanon, Dahiyeh and Bekaa are not in need of any proof that highlights the need for its weapons and roles. Brigadier General Mounir Shehadeh, former Lebanese government coordinator with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), has raised concerns over ongoing Israeli enemy violations since the ceasefire was declared. He warned that these actions reflect Israeli efforts to impose a new status quo on Lebanon and its resistance.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2299849	2024-12-27T09:14:13-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-05587310017353196303.png
Lebanese Brigadier General Warns of New Status Quo as Israeli Ene...	Brigadier General Mounir Shehadeh, former Lebanese government coordinator with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), has raised concerns over ongoing Israeli enemy violations since the ceasefire was declared. He warned that these actions reflect Israeli efforts to impose a new status quo on Lebanon and its resistance. Exploiting International Cover In an interview with Al-Manar Website, Shehadeh explained that the Israeli enemy is leveraging international cover provided by a US-led committee to consolidate its control and achieve objectives it failed to secure during the war. He highlighted that the Zionist enemy continues its military maneuvers, including airstrikes on Lebanese territory and ground incursions, without facing any effective deterrent. 'The international committee has shown no effectiveness in curbing these serious violations or pressuring the Israeli occupation to halt its repeated aggressions,' Shehadeh stressed. Critical Violations Undermine the Ceasefire Brig. Shehadeh pointed to a particularly alarming incident last Wednesday when Israeli occupation forces advanced near the southern town of Al-Naqoura while the international committee was holding a meeting in the area. Simultaneously, Israeli enemy troops destroyed homes in nearby villages. Additionally, settlers have set up tents in the Maroun Al-Ras region, signaling clear aggressive and expansionist intentions. The brigadier general also described a recent provocation in Wadi Al-Hjeir, where Israeli forces built an earthen barrier separating it from Wadi Al-Slouki. This action aims to alter the geographical landscape, pursuing what the Israeli enemy could not achieve during the war. Video shows Israeli occupation bulldozers plow and destroy the main road in Wadi Al-Hjeir and Al-Slpouki during withdrawal (Dec 26, 2024) Hezbollah Maintains Ceasefire Commitment Despite these provocations, Shehadeh confirmed that Lebanon’s resistance remains committed to the ceasefire agreement, giving the international committee a chance to fulfill its role. However, the Israeli enemy continues its blatant violations by bombing southern villages and targeting areas deep into the Bekaa Valley, disregarding international resolutions. The Israeli occupation forces bomb Kfar Kila and Taybeh, south Lebanon (Dec 22, 2024) Regional Developments Fuel Israeli Aggression Brigadier Shehadeh noted that the regional situation, including Syria’s destabilization, has emboldened the Israeli enemy to push its northern frontiers closer to Lebanon. 'Israel’s advance to just 12 kilometers from the Masnaa crossing on the Lebanese-Syrian border, near Damascus, marks a seismic shift in the region’s dynamics,' he said. The Israeli occupation is exploiting this turmoil to evade international agreements and maintain unrestricted military activity in southern Lebanon, expanding its violations. Resistance Offers International Community a Chance 'Despite these developments, the resistance continues to adhere to the ceasefire agreement, granting the international community a chance to pressure Israel into compliance,' Shehadeh explained. However, with the 60-day ceasefire window still active, doubts remain about the international committee's and Lebanese authorities' ability to enforce the Israeli enemy's commitments. Brigadier General Mounir Shehadeh concluded by referencing a report in Israeli Haaretz, which stated that the Israeli army plans to remain in southern Lebanon even after the ceasefire deadline expires. This stance underscores the Israeli enemy’s determination to pursue its aggressive policies, reaffirming that only resistance and strength can effectively counter its ambitions.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2299717	2024-12-27T06:17:53-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-07888840017353086731.png
‘Israel’ Burns Kamal Adwan Hospital, Resistance Strikes Back in t...	on the 448th day of the Israeli aggression on Gaza, the Palestinian resistance has struck back against the Israeli occupation forces, even as the latter continue their brutal attacks on hospitals and civilians in the besieged territory. Israeli occupation forces stormed Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza, once again on Friday morning, forcing patients, the wounded, and medical staff to leave and arresting others. Here’s what happened. — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) December 27, 2024 The Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, announced that one of its fighters carried out a suicide bombing against an enemy force of 5 Israeli soldiers east of Jabalia camp in northern Gaza, killing and wounding them. The Al-Qassam Brigades also reported sniping two soldiers from the rescue force that advanced towards Tel al-Zaatar and showering them with Israeli-made hand grenades. Concurrently, the Al-Quds Brigades, the military wing of the Islamic Jihad Movement, announced that it had destroyed an enemy military vehicle with a barrel bomb during its incursion south of the Al-Awda Towers in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza. The Martyr Omar Al-Qassem Forces also reported shelling an occupation army command and control headquarters in the Netzarim axis in central Gaza with mortar shells. These qualitative strikes by the resistance come as the occupation continues its brutal aggression and siege in the north, with the latest development being the burning of the Kamal Adwan Hospital by the Israeli occupation forces. This follows the earlier bombing of the hospital's surroundings by Israeli aircraft in the Beit Lahia project, after storming it earlier today.

Yemen: Targeting Ben Gurion Airport in A Specific Operation	The Yemeni Armed Forces announced the launch of a 'qualitative military operation' targeting Ben Gurion Airport in the occupied Jaffa area. This attack involved the use of a hypersonic ballistic missile of the 'Palestine 2' type. Additionally, the Yemeni drone air force carried out a separate operation, successfully striking a 'vital target of the Israeli enemy' in the occupied Jaffa region. The Yemeni forces also targeted the Santa Ursula ship in the Arabian Sea east of Socotra Island, with a direct hit from multiple drones. According to the Yemeni military statement, these operations were in response to the 'Israeli aggression on civilian facilities in Sana'a and Hodeidah.' The statement warned that the attacks would continue until the 'aggression on Gaza stops and the siege on it is lifted.' بيان القوات المسلحة اليمنية بشأن استهداف مطار بن جوريون بصاروخ فرط صوتي وهدفا حيويا في منطقة يافا المحتلة بطائرة مسيرة واستهداف سفينة (Santa Ursula) بعدد من الطائرات المسيرة - 27-12-2024م pic.twitter.com/oz2dfJGahr — أمين حيان Ameen Hayyan (@AmeenHa2024yan) December 27, 2024 The missile strike on Tel Aviv resulted in a stampede that left 18 Israelis injured as they rushed to seek shelter.

The Israeli military claimed to have intercepted the missile from Yemen, but sirens still sounded across central occupied Palestine, causing the temporary halt of aircraft landings at Ben Gurion Airport before operations resumed. The World Health Organization Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was about to board a plane at the Yemeni airport when it was attacked, with one of the crew members sustaining injuries. The Israeli occupation forces also reported strikes on military infrastructure in the ports of Hodeidah, Salif, and Ras Katheeb, as well as the bombing of the Haiz and Ras Katheeb power stations in Yemen.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2299365	2024-12-27T02:21:35-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/04/manar-09219370016189056621.jpg
Commander of Sayyed Nasrallah’s Guard Unit Martyr Ibrahim Jezzine...	It was a very reassuring and joyful experience for the guard unit's commander of the former Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, Martyr Ibrahim Jezzine (Hajj Nabil), to be told that His Eminence was satisfied with his performance. Martyr Jezzine was always haunted by the fear that the measures surrounding the Master of the Resistance were bothering His Eminence. Martyr Sayyed Nasrallah once told a close associate, 'I hope the day, when I manage to reward Hajj Nabil.' Hezbollah Military Commander Hajj Imad Mughniyeh tasked Martyr Jezzine to guard Sayyed Nasrallah in 1994, The measures taken by Hajj Nabil used to prevent Sayyed Nasrallah from appearing in person in public occasions, the experience which His Eminence used to be always eager for. Martyr Jezzine used to spend days and nights preparing for Sayyed Nasralla's public appearances which were a source of worries for the loyal guardian. Hajj Nabil used to keep with Sayyed Nasrallah as his shadow, and the harmony between them was remarkable as they shared numerous experiences during their common jihadi journey. The confidentiality of Martyr Jezzine was permanent and constant to the extent that he did not even grant his own family the chance to meet with His Eminence. It would be a loftier case when we encounter the 'international leader with the Imam-Ali-like appearance,' a description that Hajj Jazini nodded his head in agreement with its accuracy, and as the 'guardian' has devoted his life out of love, passion and voluntarily to the Secretary-General of Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, 'out of complete belief in the doctrine of Wilaya.: Martyr Jezzine used to develop and foster his skills pertaining the guardianship and security skills. Hajj Nabil used to always talk about the Ahl Al-Bayt trait possessed by Sayyed Nasrallah, which is firmness and leniency of the leader who is always concerned about tackling the people's issues. Hajj Nabil used to miss Sayyed Nasrallah when he, ordered by His Eminence, used to accompany Hajj Qassem Suleimani in Syria. Without Sayyed Nasrallah, life would be void of beauty and goodness, Hajj Nabil used to reiterate always, asking Holy God to let him embrace martyrdom when His Eminence does. This was the main wish of Martyr Jezzine that came true on September 27, 2024. This was Sayyed Nasrallah's greatest gift to Hajj Nabil, a close associate concluded.

Hezbollah Reaffirms Full Solidarity with Yemeni People against Is...	Hezbollah strongly condemned on Thursday the large-scale Israeli aggression on Dear Yemen with American-British involvement, which targeted civilian, economic and vital facilities. In a statement, Hezbollah considered that the Zionist campaign is a blatant violation of international and humanitarian laws, an attempt to pursue its arrogance as well brutality, and persistence on its open wars against the peoples of our Arab and Islamic region, especially in Palestine, Lebanon and Syria. This new aggression on Yemeni territory came as a result of the enemy’s failure to confront the Yemeni military strikes, the steadfastness of the Yemeni position courageously supporting the Palestinian people’s cause and right to their land and freedom, and the Yemenis insistence on supporting and standing by steadfast Gaza, according to the statement. 'Hezbollah reaffirms its full solidarity and stands by the dear and steadfast Yemeni people, who continue their resilience and steadfastness in this cause. We reaffirm our confidence in this resistant people, who continue the path of endurance and dignity with their wise and courageous leadership to confront this aggression.' Hezbollah called on all free people of the world and all honest and resistance forces in our Arab and Islamic region to unite in facing this aggression, raising their voices loudly in face of the international community's silence and its institutions that are helpless and submissive to American will. 'We emphasize that in the face of this Zionist enemy and its supporters, our peoples have no choice but to continue with more steadfastness and resistance.' Multiple Israeli air raids on Yemen targeted on Thursday Sanaa and Hodeidah governorates, according to Yemeni media outlets. Meanwhile, the Zionist reports indicated that the enemy attacked certain targets in Yemen.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2298859	2024-12-26T10:10:14-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-027725400166239486010.jpg

Meanwhile, the Zionist reports indicated that the enemy attacked certain targets in Yemen. The airport in the capital, Sanaa, and the adjacent Al-Dailami Air Base were targeted on Thursday along with a power plant in the port city of Hodeidah, media reports mentioned. The Israeli news website, Walla, reported that dozens of war jets participated in the campaign, demanding what he called as 'Israel's allies' to help it prepare a target bank in Yemen. Menahwile, Head of Yemen’s Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi stressed that the Israeli enemy is frustrated by the Yemeni drone and missile attacks, underlining its failure to intercept them. Sayyed Al-Houthi stressed that the Israeli deterrence and air defense systems have failed to confront the Yemeni power, confirming that the Yemeni strikes would never stop before the end of the Zionist war on Gaza despite all threats and temptations. Houthi underlined that the Zionist entity is perplexed with the Yemeni strikes, highlighting the economic losses of the enemy, including the decline of the value of the stock market. Houthi maintained that the Yemeni attack on the US aircraft carrier is unprecedented since the World War II, adding that it lasted for several hours. Sayyyed Houthi warned against the Israeli plots in Syria, adding that the Zionist enemy is trying to fabricate a victory in Lebanon after its failure to eradicate Hezbollah. What the Israeli enemy is committing in Lebanon highlights the important role of the resistance, he affirmed. On Wednesday, the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out three drone and missile attacks on Israeli targets in Tel Aviv and Ashkelon, according to the spokesman for the Yemeni military General Yahya Saree,	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2298771	2024-12-26T08:53:31-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-012929700173523200410.png
Lebanon: Double Standards Emerge among Resistance Critics amid Co...	The debate over Lebanon's resistance has resurfaced as critics, including politicians, media figures, and activists, accuse it of pursuing foreign agendas contrary to national interests. This rhetoric, amplified during times of conflict, contrasts sharply with the same critics' tolerance of western influence in Lebanon’s political affairs, particularly the selection of its new president. Critics argue that the resistance undermines Lebanon’s sovereignty, yet many of them openly engage with American and Arab envoys who impose specific candidates or criteria for the presidency. This obvious double standard has drawn scrutiny, as it suggests a willingness to accommodate western pressures while rejecting a homegrown defense strategy against Israeli aggression. Historically, opposition to the resistance has been consistent, spanning from its early days before Hezbollah’s establishment in the 1980s through key milestones such as the liberation of southern Lebanon in 2000, the 2006 July War, and the 2024 Israeli aggression as well as the ongoing Zionist violations that followed it. Critics have frequently targeted the resistance’s weapons, calling for their removal even as Israeli violations of the ceasefire agreement persist. Dr. Zakaria Hamoudan, director of the Lebanese National Institute for Studies and Statistics, highlighted this tension during an interview with Al-Manar, stating that 'during Israeli attacks, some Lebanese factions have sought to undermine the resistance rather than support its efforts to defend the country'. He emphasized that the resistance’s arsenal has consistently served as a deterrent, preventing deeper Israeli incursions and safeguarding Lebanon’s sovereignty. director of the Lebanese National Institute for Studies and Statistics Zakaria Hamoudan in an interview with Al-Manar (image from August 2022). Hamoudan warned that efforts to weaken the resistance align with broader regional projects favoring Zionist interests, such as economic exploitation and normalization deals that have impoverished nations like Egypt and undermined Jordan’s sovereignty. He argued that dismantling the resistance would leave Lebanon vulnerable to similar outcomes. Amid these challenges, Hamoudan underscored the importance of the 'people, army, and resistance' equation, a strategy credited with shielding Lebanon from numerous threats. He called for preserving this integrated approach, which has proven effective against Israeli aggression and remains a cornerstone of Lebanon's defense. As Lebanon navigates this historic phase of regional tension, the debate over the resistance's role and its weapons continues to reflect deeper questions about true sovereignty, national security, and the country’s path forward.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2298782	2024-12-26T08:48:02-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-00419630017352316554.jpg
Zionist Settlers in Occupied Territories Rally Against Surging Li...	A new campaign led by Lucille Blackerman has emerged in response to skyrocketing prices and a rise in value-added tax (VAT) across the occupied territories. During an interview with the Hebrew Ynet, Blackerman encouraged fellow Zionist settlers to stock up on essentials by the end of the year and boycott supermarkets during the first two weeks of 2025. Campaign Gains Momentum Amid Economic Struggles The campaign, launched a few days ago and running until December 31, comes at a time when prices across all sectors are rising sharply. The cost of goods is expected to increase further following the VAT hike, which will make essential products even more expensive. Blackerman, the Zionist protest leader, expressed the collective frustration felt by many, stating, 'There is a sense of despair in the country.' However, she acknowledged receiving skepticism from settlers, many of whom believe her initiative will not succeed. In a statement, Blackerman addressed importers and major corporations directly, highlighting the internal economic crisis: 'I understand that there is an ongoing war, but the real battle is within. The projected 2025 prices, coupled with the VAT increase and soaring water and electricity bills, are simply unsustainable.' Protest ad distributed on social media Rent Prices Continue to Climb Adding to the economic strain, the Hebrew-language daily evening financial newspaper Globes recently reported a significant rise in rental costs across the occupied territories. The average rent for a four-room apartment now ranges from $822 to $2,330, depending on the city, further exacerbating financial pressures on residents. This dual challenge of rising living costs and taxation has fueled widespread discontent, with campaigns like Blackerman’s striving to make a statement against what many view as unsustainable economic policies.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2298540	2024-12-26T05:38:00-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-03844360017352202523.jpeg
‘Israel’ Continues to Violate Ceasefire Agreement in Southern Leb...	‘Israel’ continues to violate the ceasefire agreement in southern Lebanon, with incursions into the areas of Qantara, Adshit al-Qusayr and Wadi al-Hujayr, according to reports from the region. The Israeli enemy has not stopped violating the ceasefire every day since the agreement on November 27, demonstrating their arrogance and impudence, which the resistance says can only be deterred by force. On Thursday morning, Israeli occupation forces penetrated the town of Qantara, reaching the spring of Wadi al-Hujayr, and cut off the road leading to Wadi al-Saluqi, which connects to the district of Bint Jbeil. This prompted some residents of Qantara to flee to the nearby towns of al-Ghandouriya and Srifa. The Lebanese army has strengthened its deployment in the affected areas and is coordinating with UNIFIL, the UN peacekeeping force, to monitor the situation. The Majdal Selm Municipality has warned citizens not to use the Salouqi-Hajeir road due to the 'new security conditions.' In the morning, the Lebanese army closed the road leading to Wadi al-Hajeir, while 'Merkava' tanks patrolled the valley and conducted intensive searches of the surrounding forests. Reconnaissance aircraft and drones from the Israeli enemy were also reported flying over the central and western sectors of southern Lebanon, including the airspace of Naqoura, Bint Habil, Taloussa, Qantara, Wadi al-Hajeir and Salouqi. On the other hand, the 'National News Agency' reported that enemy reconnaissance aircraft and drones were flying in the airspace of the central and western sectors, especially over Naqoura in the south and up to the airspace of Bint Habil, reaching the Taloussa, Qantara, Wadi al-Hajeir and Salouqi in the east.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2298397	2024-12-26T02:52:19-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-00015080017352099987.jpg
IRGC: Yemeni Attacks Shift Israel’s Calculations Amid Syria Turmo...	In a major development, a spokesman for Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) has stated that recent 'prompt' missile attacks by Yemen's Ansarullah resistance movement have significantly altered Israel's strategic calculations. This comes as the Israeli regime was previously buoyed by the situation in Syria. Brigadier General Ali Mohammad Naeini, who heads the IRGC's Public Relations Department, made these remarks on Thursday amidst Israel's ongoing aggression against Syria and Yemen's sustained missile barrages targeting the occupied territories. بيان القوات المسلحة اليمنية بشأن تنفيذ سلاح الجو المسير عمليتين عسكريتين بطائرتين مسيرتين الأولى استهدفت هدفا حيوياً حساساً للعدو الإسرائيلي في منطقة يافا المحتلة، والأخرى استهدفت المنطقة الصناعية للعدو الإسرائيلي في منطقة عسقلان جنوبي فلسطين المحتلة. pic.twitter.com/6kCgJxOGSY — أمين حيان Ameen Hayyan (@AmeenHa2024yan) December 25, 2024 'The powerful measures by Yemen's Ansarullah movement showed that the resistance front is self-reliant and independent in various fields, and enjoys unparalleled capabilities to respond to the crimes of the Zionist regime,' Naeini stated. The IRGC commander further emphasized that global media outlets are actively targeting the resistance movement and disseminating propaganda in an effort to silence its voice. He stressed the need to form a broad media front to confront those opposing the resistance in an innovative manner. Yemenis have openly declared their support for Palestine's struggle against the Israeli occupation since the regime launched its devastating war on Gaza on October 7, 2023, which has so far claimed the lives of at least 45,361 Palestinians, mostly women and children. Ansarullah has also been targeting ships linked to ‘Israel’, the United States, and the United Kingdom in a bid to force an end to Tel Aviv's ongoing aggression against Gaza. The Yemeni Armed Forces have vowed to continue their attacks until Israel's ground and aerial aggression in Gaza come to an end.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2298375	2024-12-26T02:16:27-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/11/manar-00920140016988726696.jpg
Mossad Chief Warns against Escalating Yemen Attacks, Push for Ira...	Mossad chief David Barnea has been reportedly pushing the Israeli leadership to concentrate on attacking Iran as a way to stem attacks from Yemen. According to the Haaretz newspaper, Barnea raised the option during a series of discussions on the lack of results from three earlier rounds of strikes in Yemen. The report stated that the Mossad chief believes it would be more effective to go after Iran, which the Israeli officials claim it funds and arms the revolutionary group in Yemen. 'We need to go head-on against Iran,' he told security officials, according to Israeli Channel 13. 'If we only attack the Houthis, it’s not certain that we’ll be able to stop them.' A mock missile bearing a portrait of former Hezbollah S.G. Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah during a pro-Gaza rally in Sanaa (December 25, 2024). The stance reportedly adopted by Barnea contrasts the opinion of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz, who prefer to keep carrying out strikes against Yemen rather than against Iran. The reports by Haarets and Channel 13 cited unnamed sources with knowledge of the discussions. Netanyahu, according to Channel 13, disagreed with Barnea’s assessment, and instead surmised that Iran was 'a different issue, which will be dealt with at the appropriate time.' Netanyahu’s estimation was shared by senior members of the security establishment, Channel 13 reported, without providing further details.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2298298	2024-12-26T00:42:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-00400420017352022666.jpg
Israel’s Deadly Assault on Gaza: Journalists Martyred, Civilians ...

Gaza Resistance Groups Score New Operations against Israeli Milit...	Palestinian resistance groups in Gaza wracked up on Wednesday new successes in their long list of operations targeting Israeli occupation forces invading the besieged strip. Al Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s military wing, announced four different operations via their social media platforms. The first involved the successful targeting of a Merkava tank accompanied by the destruction of an 'Evo Max' Israeli combat drone in the Al-Mukhayam Al-Jadeed area north of Nuseirat, in central Gaza. #شاهد.. كتائب القسام: استهداف دبابة 'ميركفاه' صهيونية واسقاط طائرة مسيرة من نوع 'Evo Max' في منطقة المخيم الجديد شمال النصيرات وسط القطاع#طوفان_الأقصى pic.twitter.com/QM2hyCT8px — Newpress | نيو برس (@NewpressPs) December 25, 2024 A second operation targeted a group of occupation soldiers in the Jabalia refugee camp north of the strip wherein an Al-Qassam fighter threw a grenade into their midst, injuring them heavily. Al-Qassam fighters also attacked an 'Apache' combat helicopter using a handheld 'Sam-7' surface-to-air missile, as well as releasing footage of a sniping operation against a Merkava tank crew, all within Jabalia. For its part, Al-Quds Brigades, the Islamic Jihad’s armed wing, released a video of a drone that the resistance fighters seized control of while conducting surveillance mission over Khan Younis. سرايا القدس تعرض مشاهد لطائرات صهيونية بدون طيار سيطرت عليها خلال تنفيذها مهام استخبارية في سماء مدينة خانيونس.#اليمن #العراق #ترامب #طهران #لبنان#السعوديه_اليمن pic.twitter.com/1HyI20RqKU — ياسر الفاضلي🇵🇸🇾🇪 (@Yasser222200) December 25, 2024 Earlier on Tuesday, Al-Quds Brigades reported on multiple points of engagement with the Zionist enemy on the Northern Gaza front specifically in Beit Hanoun. In a statement shared through their social media platforms Al-Quds Brigades said, 'after our Mujahideen returned from the frontlines in the northern Gaza Strip, they reported that, on Sunday evening, they had caught a Zionist infantry force of 12 soldiers in an ambush, blowing up a house - in which they had barricaded themselves - in the Al-Izba area, west of Beit Hanoun'. The statement mentioned that the house had been booby-trapped in advance with a number of anti-personnel explosives. Al-Quds added that they also targeted a Merkava tank crew who were on their way to reinforce the first group of 12 with a 'Thaqib' anti-tank explosive. The resistance group’s fighters also reported heavy infantry clashes with the Zionist enemy in a house in the 'Abdul Dayem' area, west of Beit Hanoun. The ongoing developments underscore the resilience and tactical capabilities of Gaza's resistance groups, who continue to engage Zionist forces across multiple fronts despite the escalating intensity of the conflict. Both Al-Qassam and Al-Quds Brigades have vowed to persist in their operations, emphasizing their determination to defend Gaza against aggression and further entrench their presence in the resistance narrative.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2298012	2024-12-25T11:14:35-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-09988580017351533156.jpg

Hamas: New Israeli Terms Delayed Gaza Ceasefire Agreement	Islamic Resistance Movement - Hamas issued on Wednesday a statement which indicated that the negotiations for a ceasefire and captive exchange were underway in Doha with Qatari and Egyptian mediation in a serious manner. The movement has shown responsibility and flexibility, the statement added. 'However, the occupation has introduced new issues and conditions related to withdrawal, ceasefire, captives, and the return of displaced persons, which has delayed reaching the agreement that was previously possible.' The Israeli enemy's premier Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly hindered the conclusion of a ceasefire agreement in Gaza over political interests and considerations. The Zionist security agencies' chiefs have always blamed Netanyahu for the delay which, according to them, endangers the lives of the Israeli captives held by the Palestinian Resistance in the Strip facing the 15th month of the enemy's all-out war. Dozens of Palestinians were martyred or injured on Wednesday due to the Israeli continuous bombardment of the residential and civilian targets in the various cities of Gaza. Since early Wednesday, over 14 martyrs were claimed by the Zionist aggression, starving the northern sector of the Strip for the 82nd consecutive day. The overall toll of the Zionist aggression on Gaza since October 7, 2023, has reached 45,338 martyrs and 107,764 injuries.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2297792	2024-12-25T05:25:53-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-09459540016632347435.jpg

‘Israel’ Struggles to Deter Threat by Yemen’s Ansarullah	Facing the escalating challenges from Yemen's Ansarullah revolutionary group, the Zionist entity weighs its options, with no clear resolution yet to the significant threat posed by the intensified actions in support of Gaza over the past year. Zionist officials and experts are deliberating strategies to counter these threats, with recent military responses proving ineffective at best, Al-Akhbar Lebanese newspaper reported on Monday. Ansaruallah, having pledged its support to the Palestinian resistance, has disrupted maritime activity by targeting commercial ships heading to Israeli ports through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, the Gulf of Aden, and the Arabian Sea. This strategy aims to pressure Israel to stop its genocidal war on Gaza. Israel initially relied on US intervention, citing limited resources due to the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) spreading themselves thin across the northern and southern fronts. However, US responses have remained tactical, with strikes limited to retaliation for disruptions to trade and supplies, their insufficiency as deterrence is highlighted by a recent friendly fire incident that destroyed one of their own jets. Remarking on the US aggression, Yemen’s Defense Minister Mohammed Nasser Al-Atifi warned Washington that the country was capable of sinking the US’s naval fleets, and was in possession of weapons yet to be revealed. Despite Israeli airstrikes on Yemen, analysts agree these efforts have failed to deter Ansarullah, Al-Akhbar’s Yahya Dbouk wrote. The group has intensified its operations, reiterating its support for Gaza and vowing further action unless ‘Israel’ halts its genocide against Palestinians. Israeli experts suggest alternative strategies, including targeting Yemeni leadership in Sanaa, weapon production facilities, and economic hubs such as ports and energy sites, as well as bombing Saada for its symbolism in the Yemeni public’s consciousness according to Dbouk, who added that proposals to strike Sanaa and Saada aim to weaken Ansarullah's influence and mobilize opposition forces within Yemen.

However, doubts remain about its feasibility, given the previous failures of the coalition to secure a military victory during the war waged by the Saudi-led coalition on the Arab impoverished country since March 2015, according to the author. Another debated approach involves targeting Iran, viewed as Ansarullah’s so-called 'primary supporter', Dbouk reported, noting that this strategy, however, raises questions about the Zionist entity’s capacity to address broader regional threats in wartime. On the other hand, a ceasefire in Gaza has been proposed as a potential solution to ease Yemeni attacks. Ansarullah themselves have said on multiple occasions that as long as the war on Gaza continues, so will the attacks from Yemen and the maritime trade disruptions. Such option 'seems likely to break quickly, due to a possible failure in the second phase of a potential swap deal between Gaza and ‘Israel’, which is widely believed in Tel Aviv will never see the light,' Dbouk wrote. The Zionist entity continues to weigh its options, with no clear resolution yet to the significant threat posed by Ansarullah and its broader implications for regional security.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2297132	2024-12-24T02:47:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-08337000017350371954.jpg

The military spokesperson for Al-Qassam Brigades, Abu Ubaida, stressed on Monday that the heroism of our fighters and their performance on the northern front of the Gaza Strip serve as an inspiring model for all the free people of the world. In a series of social media posts, Abu Ubaida underlined that the enemy conceals its true losses and the dire condition of its soldiers in the north to preserve the image of its army. The genocide and ethnic cleansing in the northern Gaza Strip target innocent civilians to cover up the scandals and failures of the Zionist army, he added. The fate of some enemy captives is tied to the occupation army's advance by hundreds of meters`in certain areas under attack, Abu Ubaida affirmed.
