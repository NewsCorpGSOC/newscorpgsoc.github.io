Israeli Occupation Forces Conduct Airstrikes in Bekaa, Burn House...	In a blatant violation of ceasefire agreement, the Israeli occupation aircraft carried out on Saturday an airstrike on the outskirts of the eastern Lebanese mountain range in the 'Al-Shaara' area within the villages of Baalbek district. Six people were martyred and two others were injured, in a new Israeli aggression on Lebanon, in an Israeli drone raid on the outskirts of Janta, in the eastern region of Bekaa. The village of Janta area lies close to the Syrian border and the area was already hit by Israeli strikes on January 31st. Additionally, Israeli enemy forces carried out an operation involving the explosion and burning of houses in the town of Adaisseh, South Lebanon. Al-Manar correspondent shared a video showing the so-called UNIFIL peacekeepers patrolling near Israeli occupation forces as they burn civilians' houses in the town of Adaisseh: The skies over the south witnessed intensive flights of Israeli warplanes at medium altitude. This repeated Israeli aggression against Lebanon raises many questions directed at the international committee overseeing the ceasefire agreement, as well as the guarantor countries, specifically the United States and France.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2334565	2025-02-08T09:35:54-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00033750017390361253.png

Netanyahu Office Threatens ‘Action’ as Hamas Conveys 'Tough Messa...	Israeli Prime Minister’s office threatened an 'action' on Saturday as Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades conveyed 'tough messages' during the handover of three Israeli captives held in Gaza for 16 months. In exchange of the three Israeli captives, 183 Palestinian prisoners are due to be released throughout the day. Saturday’s swap is the fifth under the truce agreement, which took effect on January 19, and is part of the first phase of the truce, which lasts for 42 days and runs until early March. Handover Ceremony Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades set up a stage for the handover to the Red Cross in Deir al-Balah, decorated with a sign declaring 'total victory,' the catchphrase used by Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu throughout the war. Banners on the stage read: 'We are the flood, we are the war’s day after.' The three captives appeared on the stage ahead of the handover, surrounded by Al-Qassam Brigades fighters and holding up release certificates.

As has now become a regular part of the proceedings, representatives of the International Red Cross sat at desks on the stages to sign the handover documents produced by the Palestinian resistance group. 'Tough Messages' Commenting on the handover ceremony, Hamas Spokesman Hazem Qassem said: 'Today’s handover carries a clear message by Al-Qassam that the people and resistance are the ones who shape 'the day after' not any external force.' On the other hand, Israeli Channel 13 quoted sources as saying that the Israeli side conveyed a 'tough message' that 'today’s scene won’t go unnoticed.'

'The shocking images we saw today will not pass without response,' the statement said. 'The government, together with security officials, will support them and their families. Israel is committed to bringing back all the hostages and missing.' A second statement, released a short time later by Netanyahu’s office, said ‘Israel’ would take unspecified actions in response to the conditions of the three Israeli captives. 'Due to the harsh condition of the three hostages and the repeated violations of the Hamas terror groups, the prime minister has ordered that Israel will not gloss over this and will take action as needed,' the statement read.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2334037	2025-02-08T05:32:11-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-065527900173902121610.jpg
Imam Khamenei Hails Gaza Victory, Calls for Continued Resistance	In a meeting with a senior Hamas delegation, Iran's Supreme Leader Imam sayyed Ali Khamenei Khamenei praised the Palestinian resistance for defeating ‘Israel’ and the United States in the recent Gaza war, describing the ceasefire agreement as a 'great achievement.' Imam Khamenei received Hamas Shura Council chairman Muhammad Ismail Darwish and other members of the group's political bureau in Tehran on Saturday. He told the visiting delegation that 'God Almighty granted you and the people of Gaza honor and victory' against the Zionist regime and the US. Ayatollah Khamenei receives senior Hamas delegation — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) February 8, 2025 'You overcame the Zionist regime and, in fact, the US and by the grace of God, you did not let them achieve any of their goals,' the Leader added. He called on the Palestinian resistance to stay resolute, saying it is 'necessary to plan for cultural works and continue the current path of PR works alongside military affairs and the reconstruction of Gaza.' Imam Khamenei highlighted the 'suffering of the Gazan people for a year and half of the Israeli war,' stating that the ultimate result is 'the victory of right over wrong.' He described faith as the main 'asymmetric weapon' of the resistance front against the enemy. The Supreme Leader also praised the Hamas negotiators, saying their ceasefire deal forcing ‘Israel’ to halt its 'brutal war on Gaza and release thousands of Palestinian prisoners is a 'great achievement.'' The first phase of the agreement calls for the release of 33 Israeli captives and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Imam Khamenei stressed that the issue of Palestine is a 'resolved' matter for Iran, and the 'ultimate victory belongs to the Palestinian people.' He urged the resistance to move forward with the 'strength of faith and hope for divine assistance' despite any challenges. On Thursday, the United States imposed its first sanctions on Iran after Trump revived his so-called maximum pressure strategy against the Islamic Republic. Imam Khamenei said there is no question in the minds of the Iranian people about defending Palestine and supporting the Palestinian people, and the issue is a 'resolved' matter. 'Palestine is a major issue for us and the victory of Palestine is also a definite issue for us,' the Leader said. The Shura Council is the main consultative body of Hamas that elects the resistance movement's politburo. The visit to Tehran by Darwish and his team is part of their regional tour which has already taken them to Egypt and Turkey.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2333894	2025-02-08T04:16:57-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00635950017390170057.jpg

On the 21st day of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, the 'Al-Qassam Brigades' handed over three Israeli captives to the Red Cross in Deir al-Balah.

Meanwhile, the Israeli army warned Palestinian families against celebrating the release of their relatives, with the occupation forces summoning the families of Jerusalemite prisoners for investigation. In the same context, Red Cross vehicles arrived in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, to receive the three Zionist prisoners from the 'Al-Qassam Brigades' (the military wing of Hamas). Regarding the place of handover, the Israeli 'Channel 12' pointed out that 'Hamas chose a populated area this time, perhaps as a signal to Trump, who claimed that the Strip is completely destroyed and uninhabitable.' Earlier, Palestinian sources indicated that the occupation forces opened fire along the Salah al-Din axis in the central Gaza Strip.

The enemy army said that its air force had completed its preparations to receive the prisoners returning to the occupied territories from the Strip. According to the Prisoners' Information Office, the occupation is supposed to release 18 prisoners with 'life sentences', 54 prisoners with high sentences, and 111 prisoners from the Gaza Strip who were 'not involved', according to the enemy's description, in the events of October 7, 2023. According to the list published yesterday evening, 7 of the prisoners will be deported outside Palestine. 38 of those included in the fifth batch belong to Hamas, 30 to Fatah, one to Islamic Jihad, and 3 do not belong to organizations. The prisoner exchange process has been a point of contention, with the Israeli government threatening to prevent West Bank celebrations. This comes as the Israeli delegation is expected to head to Doha to discuss the implementation of the ceasefire agreement's second phase. Hamas has expressed its commitment to the agreement, while warning that the failure to bring equipment into Gaza will make it impossible to retrieve the dead Israeli prisoners from under the rubble of destroyed buildings. The swap deal has also sparked political tensions, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commenting on the establishment of a Palestinian state, calling it 'a huge prize for terrorism.' The Mossad chief is expected to lead the Israeli delegation to the negotiations, with reports suggesting Netanyahu may seek to postpone the implementation of the second phase.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2333751	2025-02-08T02:41:48-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-05641850017390112992.jpg
US Approves Massive $7 Billion Arms Deal with ‘Israel’ Amid Gaza ...	The US State Department has approved a major $7 billion arms sale to ‘Israel’, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) announced on Friday. The sale includes a wide range of munitions, guidance kits, fuzes, and related support equipment. Additionally, the US has approved the sale of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and related equipment to Israel, valued at approximately $660 million. The approval follows continued US military support for the Israeli occupation amid its ongoing aggression on the Gaza Strip and occupied Palestine, in addition to Lebanon and Syria. This latest arms deal comes as the Biden administration had previously suspended a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs due to concerns over Israel's expected assault on Rafah. Trump Calls for Mass Expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza The approval of the arms deal coincides with former President Trump's recent endorsement of Israel's war on Gaza. In remarks aboard Air Force One last month, Trump described Gaza as a 'demolition site' and called for the mass expulsion of its population. Israeli army ‘seriously doubts’ success of Trump’s plan to ethnically cleanse, control Gaza — The Cradle (@TheCradleMedia) February 7, 2025 'I'd like Egypt to take people. And I'd like Jordan to take people. We just clean out that whole thing,' Trump stated, framing this forced displacement as a step toward 'Middle East peace.' This position was echoed by Trump's son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner, who suggested Gaza's waterfront would be 'very valuable' if its Palestinian residents were removed. Continued Bipartisan Support The sales are subject to congressional review, but approvals of such deals have historically faced little resistance. This latest arms deal follows an earlier $8 billion weapons package initially proposed under the Biden administration. Although some Democratic lawmakers have attempted to delay its approval, Washington's military support for Israel has remained unwavering.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2333729	2025-02-08T01:00:26-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07169730017387823318.jpg

Hezbollah Strongly Denounces Trump’s Call for Displacing Palestin...	Hezbollah strongly denounced former US President Donald Trump’s call for the forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, describing it as 'a blatant expression of racist, fascist ideology that threatens humanity at its core.' In a statement issued on Friday, the group asserted that 'the right of people to their land is a fundamental principle enshrined in all international laws and conventions—an inalienable right that cannot be revoked, violated, or relinquished under any form of coercion.' US History of Settler Colonialism The statement further criticized the 'arrogance and delusions of grandeur' guiding US policies, arguing that Trump and his administration believe they can replicate 'the dark history of the US' founding—built on the organized extermination of Indigenous populations and the replacement of native peoples with settlers.' Hezbollah warned that the same model is now being pursued in Palestine through forced displacement, stating that 'after the US-Israeli war machine, backed by Western powers, failed to break the will of the Palestinian people, Trump and his allies now seek to uproot them entirely and hand their land to the Zionists.' However, the group emphasized that 'the resilience of the Palestinian resistance and the people of Gaza has proven that they will not be erased.' ‘What the Israeli enemy Failed to Achieve Through War, It Will Not Achieve Through Deception’ Hezbollah asserted that 'what the enemy could not seize through war, it will not obtain through deceptive slogans about offering Gazans a ‘better life’ outside their homeland.' The party described Trump’s proposal as 'a dangerous scheme that defies logic and nature, revealing the extent of ongoing conspiracies against the Palestinian people.' Call for Unified Resistance Hezbollah reaffirmed its belief that 'those who thwarted the war of extermination will also defeat the war of ethnic cleansing.' The party warned that 'Trump and his backers will come to realize that this sacred land will never yield to American madness.' It called on 'all honorable people across the Arab and Muslim world, and beyond, to stand together in rejecting this disgraceful plot.' Warning to Arab and Muslim Nations Hezbollah urged Arab and Muslim countries to take concrete steps to counter 'this colonial project,' warning that 'if this scheme succeeds, it will bring catastrophic consequences—no independence, no resources, and no sovereign nations.' The party cautioned that 'any leniency in confronting this plan will pave the way for the mass expulsion of West Bank residents and, eventually, all Palestinians in the occupied 1948 territories.' ‘Gaza Will Remain for Its People, Palestine Will Remain for Its People’ Concluding its statement, Hezbollah declared that 'this latest aggression against Palestine and its people is doomed to total failure.' It stressed that 'the Palestinian people, alongside all those who stand for justice, will remain steadfast in their land.' The group asserted that 'neither Trump’s power nor his conspiracies will break Palestinian resolve—rather, his plan will collapse, while Gaza and Palestine will remain in the hands of their rightful people.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2333366	2025-02-07T10:20:26-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-04165050017056142612.png
Hezbollah MP Slams US Envoy Ortagus’ Remarks as ‘Blatant Interfer...	The head of Hezbollah’s loyalty to resistance parliamentary bloc, MP Mohammad Raad, denounced the remarks made by US Deputy Special Envoy to the Middle East, Morgan Ortagus, during her visit to Baabda Palace, calling them 'a blatant interference in Lebanese sovereignty' and 'a violation of diplomatic norms and international protocols.' He described her statements as 'filled with hatred and irresponsibility' and an attack on 'a national political entity that is an integral part of Lebanon’s political and national consensus.' Commenting on the official response from the Lebanese Presidency, which distanced itself from Ortagus’ remarks, MP Raad said, 'The Presidential Palace’s statement distancing itself from her remarks is sufficient. There is no need to dwell further on her words.' Criticism of US, Israeli Enemy Policies Hezbollah's Raad went on to criticize the US stance, stating, 'Those who claim to fight corruption should not be harboring terrorism. The 'Israeli' regime, which enjoys US political backing, undermines the very credibility of the democracy that Washington claims to uphold.' 'The atrocities committed by the Israeli enemy in its wars on Gaza and Lebanon are more than enough for the world to judge who truly supports, funds, and arms terrorism—who displaces people from their land and deprives them of their rights, all while violating international law and global humanitarian standards,' Raad added. MP Raad dismissed further discussion on those who openly express hostility toward Hezbollah, emphasizing, 'The true victor is the one who has exposed the brutal reality of the aggressor, a regime engaged in genocide—targeting civilians, destroying homes, hospitals, and entire neighborhoods. This is an occupying force that has no legitimate right to claim self-defense.' Defending the Resistance Concluding his remarks, MP Raad reaffirmed Hezbollah’s commitment to Lebanon’s defense, stating, 'We place our trust in the will of our people, who remain steadfast in their choice of resistance. This is the reality that safeguards Lebanon’s sovereignty through the equation of the army, the people, and the resistance—a formula Lebanon can take pride in as a means of protecting its sovereignty.' During her visit to Baabda, Morgan Ortagus voiced US support for Lebanon, linking growing American and diaspora interest to what she called 'Hezbollah’s defeat by Israel.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2333223	2025-02-07T09:03:20-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01890960017389475937.png

'We are grateful to our ally Israel for defeating Hezbollah,' Ortagus said in a press conference, following a meeting with President Aoun. 'It is thanks to the Lebanese President Aoun and the Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam and everyone in this government who is committed to an end of corruption, who is committed to reforms and who is committed to making sure that Hezbollah is not a part of the new government in any form,' the US diplomat added.

If it had been accepted then, he insisted, ‘Israel’ could have brought back more living hostages while releasing fewer Palestinian security prisoners. 'In practice, we could have gotten the same deal with more hostages, and at a lower price, because 110 terrorists serving life sentences were not in discussions then,' Gallant said, referring to Palestinian prisoners who were freed by the Israeli occupation authorities as part of the swap deal.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2333014	2025-02-07T04:03:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-09840080017389293224.jpg

Imam Khamenei Warns: Any US Threat to Iran’s Security Will Be Met...	On the anniversary of the historic 'Homafaran Allegiance' in which Iranian Air Force commanders pledged loyalty to Imam Khomeini, Imam sayyed Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, issued a stern warning to the United States. In a meeting with senior military commanders on February 7, 2025, Khamenei made it unequivocally clear that Iran will not hesitate to respond forcefully if the U.S. threatens Iran's security. 'If the US threatens our security, we'll respond by threatening its security,' Khamenei stated. Leader dismissed past negotiations with the US as futile, noting that 'Negotiating with the United States is not smart, not wise, nor honorable, and experience has proven this.' Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei warns of a tit-for-tat move against the US, in case Washington violates the Iranian nation’s security. Follow us on Telegram: pic.twitter.com/YXFMolUvLk — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) February 7, 2025 Imam Khamenei accused the US of arrogantly attempting to 'redraw the map of the world,' dismissing such rhetoric as empty posturing. However, he made it plain that Iran will defend its sovereignty at all costs. 'If they threaten us, we will threaten them in return. If they carry out their threat, we will act on ours. If they attack our nation's security, we will attack their security without hesitation.' The Iranian leader's remarks come against the backdrop of the US withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal, which Khamenei said saw Iran making 'generous concessions' that were ultimately disregarded by Washington. This experience has left Iran deeply skeptical of future negotiations with the United States. Imam Khamenei's uncompromising stance sends a clear message that any attempt by the US to undermine Iran's security will be met with a swift and decisive response. The war of words between Tehran and Washington appears to be escalating, raising concerns about the potential for a dangerous confrontation in the region.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2332948	2025-02-07T03:06:06-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07130110017389263593.jpg
Israeli Air Raids Target South Lebanon, Bekaa	The Zionist enemy launched late Thursday a large-scale aerial aggression on Lebanon in a flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement in accordance with the UN Resolution 1701. In this context, Al-Manar TV correspondent reported that 'the Zionist warplanes raided the area between Azza and Rumin in southern Lebanon.' The Israeli enemy's warplanes also launched a series of raids targeting the Bekaa region, and intensive flights of the Zionist warplanes at low altitude were recorded in the skies of Bekaa, Beirut, and other coastal cities. It is worth to recall that the United States and France sponsor the ceasefire in South Lebanon, but do not take any measure to prevent the Israeli enemy from attacking Lebanon. Two people were martyred and ten others were injured early on Friday, in a new Israeli aggression on Lebanon, this time of the eastern region of Bekaa.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2332651	2025-02-06T14:04:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-03385510017388794585.jpg
Gaza Faces Cold Threat due to Israeli Hindrance of Aid Flow	The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) warned today that heavy rains and strong winds in the Gaza Strip are putting hundreds of thousands of Palestinian citizens at risk of severe cold. This comes after their homes were destroyed during Israel's 15-month-long genocidal war. In a post shared on X, the agency stated that many Palestinian families are still living in temporary shelters due to the widespread destruction across the Gaza Strip, with the recent intense weather, including torrential rain and harsh winds, significantly exacerbating the situation. 'Heavy rain and strong winds in Gaza have left hundreds of thousands exposed to cold and wet conditions in the past 24 hours. Many families remain in makeshift shelters due to widespread destruction,' said the UNRWA. UNRWA further noted that its teams are continuing to provide much-needed urgent assistance, including tents, mattresses, blankets, and clothing for the displaced population throughout the region. The agency also released a video showing strong winds ripping apart the makeshift tents of the displaced, made from cloth and nylon, scattering their belongings in the Al-Mawasi area, northwest of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. It is worth noting that the Israeli hindrance of the aid flow to Gaza has exacerbated the humanitarian conditions in the Strip. Medical sources announced Thursday that the death toll in the Gaza Strip has risen to 47,583, the majority of whom are children and women, since the beginning of the Israeli occupation war on October 7, 2023. The same sources added that the death toll has risen to 111,633 since the beginning of the aggression, while a number of victims are still under the rubble and on the roads, and ambulance and civil defense crews cannot reach them. They affirmed that 31 martyred Palestinians and four injuries arrived at Gaza Strip hospitals during the past 24 hours.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2332618	2025-02-06T13:38:45-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00522540017388778988.jpg
Israeli Occupation Forces Continue Military Offensive in Tulkarm,...	Israeli occupation forces detained several young men from the outskirts of Tulkarm this evening, continuing their aggressive offensive against the city and its refugee camp for the 11th consecutive day. According to local sources, Israeli occupation forces detained four young men from the Dannaba neighborhood east of Tulkarm after raiding several homes. Witnesses reported that the forces assaulted a fifth detainee, leaving him bleeding. At the same time, the occupation forces deployed additional military reinforcements, including infantry units and vehicles, towards Tulkarm and its refugee camp. They also continued to impose a siege on the Thabet Thabet Government Hospital, while taking control of the adjacent Al-Adawiya commercial complex, turning it into a military outpost and surveillance point. Furthermore, the Israeli occupation forces seized the Al-Burhan building in the eastern neighborhood of the city, located near the southwestern entrance to the Tulkarm refugee camp. They also raided several homes in the area, conducting searches, checking the identities of residents, and interrogating them on the spot. Witnesses reported that the soldiers forced the residents of the building to leave under the threat of weapons, exposing them to the freezing cold, and proceeded to bring in their military equipment. In addition to the ongoing offensive in Tulkarm city, the Israeli occupation forces continued their siege on the adjacent Tulkarm refugee camp, deploying snipers inside buildings surrounding the camp and raiding homes to turn them into military posts. Meanwhile, Israeli occupation forces also stormed the town of Attil, north of Tulkarm, where they raided and searched several homes. They patrolled the main streets connecting Attil with the neighboring villages and towns. Moreover, a separate Israeli force broke into the town of Kafr al-Labad, east of the governorate, and conducted similar raids, although no detentions were reported. Meanwhile, Palestinian resistance fighters targeted Israeli occupation forces in southwestern Jenin with an IED explosion. The Palestinian resistance fighters also detonated a large explosive device in Al-Faraa camp, south of Tubas, occupied West Bank, according to local reports.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2332596	2025-02-06T13:24:11-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/11/manar-08176640016686074273.png
US-Israeli Circles Describe Trump’s Gaza Plan as Unrealistic: Sav...	An overwhelming joy pervaded in the Zionist entity after the shocking remarks of the US President Donald Trump about the displacement of Gaza residents and the American control of the Strip. However, considerable statements were issued in Washington and Tel Aviv to cast doubts on the unrealistic approach of the American proposal. NYT paper quoted Trump's advisers as saying that Gaza displacement plan is not applicable despite the celebratory polls in the occupation entity which showed that most of the Israelis favor the scheme. The newspaper also quoted the former US ambassador to the occupation entity Dan Shapiro as considering that Trump's plan is not serious and endangers the release of the rest of the Zionist captives in Gaza. US sources, according to NYT, added that the plan even shocked the Trump administration's officials, noting that it lacks a feasibility study. The former Israeli military intelligence commander Amos Yadlin said that the chance for the implementation of Trump's plan is very low. Moreover, Maariv newspaper mentioned that security chiefs in 'Israel' considered that announcing the plan during the ceasefire and the prisoner swap deal is problematic. Based on all the given data, observers wonder about the real motives behind Trump's plan. Among the basic interpretation's of the US President's move is saving Netanyahu's coalition from further collapses in light of the implementation of Gaza ceasefire. Trump says 'Israel' will hand over Gaza to US after fighting ends 'The Gaza Strip would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting,' Trump said on Thursday. He reiterated that the idea would mean resettling Palestinians, and that no US soldiers would be needed. Trump's resettlement idea has prompted accusations that he is planning ethnic cleansing, and has drawn condemnation from the UN, human rights groups and Arab leaders. Analysts doubt it will ever happen. After Trump's first comments on the issue, his officials suggested any relocation would be only temporary. Under his plan, Trump wrote on Truth Social, Gazans 'would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region'. The US would then be part of an effort to redevelop the enclave, he said. His post did not make clear whether the two million residents of the Palestinian territory would be invited to return. Under international law, attempts to forcibly transfer populations from occupied territory are strictly prohibited. Netanyahu 'This is the first good idea that I’ve heard,' Netanyahu said in an interview with Fox News. 'It’s a remarkable idea. And I think it should be examined, pursued, and done because I think it will create a different future for everyone.' 'I don’t think he talked about sending US troops,' he said. 'I also don’t think he said he’s going to fund it. He said that neighboring states, wealthy states, would do it.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a video message issued June 19, 2024. Katz Israel's defense minister said Thursday that he had instructed his military to prepare a plan to allow Palestinians to voluntarily leave the Gaza Strip. Welcoming what he called Trump's 'bold initiative,' Israel Katz said in a statement Thursday that Palestinians in Gaza 'should be granted the freedom to leave and emigrate, as is customary everywhere in the world.' He said the plan would include 'exit options' for Palestinians to leave Gaza via land crossings, with the possibility of 'special arrangements' for departures by sea and air. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz (image from archive), Opposing Stances Britain will oppose any attempts to forcibly remove Palestinians from Gaza, a Foreign Office minister has said, confirming for the first time that the government will block Donald Trump’s controversial plans for the enclave. Development minister Anneliese Dodds said the future of Gaza must be determined by Palestinians with the support of neighboring countries and the international community. And, in a rebuke to the US president, Ms Dodds said: 'We would oppose any effort to move Palestinians in Gaza to neighboring Arab states against their will.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2332519	2025-02-06T13:11:09-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-05221510017388762573.jpg
Lebanon: PM-designate Insistence on Naming Fifth Shiite Minister ...	It is unprecedented in Lebanon that the President of the Republic hosts the Speaker of the Parliament and the prime minister-designate in addition to other officials concerned with the cabinet formation at Baabda Palace, and the meeting ends before the new government is born. On Thursday, President Jospeh Aoun welcomed House Speaker Nabih Berri and PM-designate Naw3af Salam to announce the governmental line-up; however, their meeting withered before any breakthrough is reached. Before the end of the tripartite meeting, Speaker Berri left. Five minutes later, Salam left Baabda Palace without making any statement. According to Al-Manar reporter, Salam insisted on naming the fifth Shiite minister, rejecting the proposal of choosing one from a list proposed by the national duo (Hezbollah and Amal Movement). Hezbollah and Amal Movement named four of the five Shiite ministers and provided a list of suggestions for the PM-designate to choose the fifth member of the cabinet in accordance with the Constitution and the political norms. The reporter noted that the consultations are underway for the sake of announcing the new government on Friday or Saturday.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2332409	2025-02-06T08:24:33-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-09635610017388590635.png
Two Israeli Occupation Soldiers Killed, 8 Wounded in Crane Collap...	Two Israeli occupation soldiers were killed and eight others injured after a crane collapsed in the northern Gaza Strip on Thursday. The Israeli occupation military announced the accident, stating that one of the deceased was a lieutenant colonel serving in the reserves with the 51st Battalion of the Golani Brigade. According to the official Israeli Broadcasting Authority, the crane collapsed due to strong winds and fell on a tent where the occupation soldiers were stationed. The military said it is investigating the 'serious incident that reflects a lack of preparedness for weather conditions.' This incident comes as the Gaza Strip and nearby areas are experiencing a low-pressure system accompanied by rain and strong winds.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2332090	2025-02-06T01:52:52-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-05489260017388355663.jpg
Sheikh Qassem to Wounded Fighters of Islamic Resistance: Your Inj...	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem wrote a letter to the wounded fighters of the Islamic Resistance, describing them as living martyrs. Sheikh Qassem stressed that the wounds of the Islamic Resistance fighters have broken the Israeli enemy's aspirations, defeated its goals, and become voices that resound with the truth. His eminence also affirmed that the resistance would continue and become stronger. What follows is the text of the letter: In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful My beloved wounded mujahideen, men, women and children. Greetings to you, living martyrs, who have attained the status of martyrs and have not yet passed on to the eternal home, to complete your role in advancement and elevation on the path of faith, jihad, guardianship and resistance. You are more afflicted than those who strive in the way of Allah, because your painful wounds accompany you at every moment, without deterring you from continuing to give and sacrifice. You are the followers of Abu al-Fadl al-Abbas (peace be upon him), the protector of the march, led by the Master of Martyrs, Imam Hussein (peace be upon him), at the peak of self-sacrifice in Allah and sacrifice for His sake, in Karbala, martyrdom and support for religion and truth. How wonderful is this description in the visit of Abu al-Fadl al-Abbas, which applies to you: 'The best patient, struggling, supportive advocate and brother defending his brother, the one who responds to the obedience of his Lord, the one who desires that no one else has neglected in terms of the abundant reward and beautiful praise, and may God join you to the level of your fathers in the gardens of bliss.' Your enemy is the Israeli entity and its supporter America, and it is the most brutal tyrant in our world today, but with your wounds you have broken its aspirations, defeated its goals, and become voices that resound with the truth, you are the loyal ones to the master of the martyrs of the nation, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah (may God be pleased with him), and to all the martyrs, prisoners, wounded and believers in this line, and God Almighty has kept you alive so that you can complete your mission and carry out your role as much as you can. The march of resistance and liberation continues, and it will be stronger with the mujahideen, the wounded, the prisoners and the loyal and honorable people, this is the biography of the prophets and imams, the biography of the Imam Al-Mahdi (may Allah hasten his reappearance), the biography of Imam Khomeini (may his shadow be prolonged), the Master of the Martyrs of the Nation, Sayyed Hassan (may Allah be pleased with him) and Sayyed Hashemi (may Allah be pleased with him), and the martyrs, the Almighty said: 'And We desired to bestow favor upon those who were oppressed in the land and make them leaders and make them heirs.' Your reward is reserved with Allah, as Imam Zayn al-Abidin (peace be upon him) said: 'May Allah have mercy on Abbas, for he preferred and sacrificed his brother with his life until his hands were cut off, so Allah the Almighty replaced them with two wings with which he flies with the angels in Paradise, as He made for Ja’far ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon him), and Abbas has a status with Allah the Blessed and Exalted that all the martyrs will envy him for on the Day of Resurrection.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2331903	2025-02-05T14:44:22-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/05/manar-07421790016847652706.jpeg

Israeli Occupation Forces Expel Hundreds of Families from Norther...	Israeli occupation forces Wednesday detained eight Palestinians in the course of the ongoing aggression on Tammun town, south of the northern occupied West Bank city of Tubas, according to the Palestine Prisoner’s Society (PPS). Kamal Bani Odeh, Director of the PPS Office in Tubas, said that the occupying forces rounded up eight residents from the town since the morning hours. He added that the gun-toting soldiers were still conducting house-to-house raids in the town, arresting civilians and subjecting them to interrogation. The Zionist Occupation Army announced on Wednesday it expelled around two thousand residents of Tulkarm camp, during the ongoing offensive in northern West Bank. The occupation forces have continued a massive onslaught on Tammun town and al-Faraa refugee camp for the fourth consecutive day, maintaining a tight siege and causing a shortage of water, a lack of essential supplies such as infant formula, diapers, and medicine. They deliberately ploughed through infrastructure, destroying main water pipelines, leading to a water shortage and causing a power outage in parts of the town and the camp.

This comes as the occupation forces tightened military measures across the occupied West Bank hours after the release of 90 Palestinian prisoners as part of the Gaza ceasefire went into effect, dismembering and isolating cities and governorates one from the other using military gates, barriers and concrete blocks. The Israeli military measures are in parallel with ongoing attacks by Israeli colonists across the West Bank to terrorize Palestinians and displace them from their lands to seize them and build illegal Jewish colonies that separate Palestinian communities. Closures besides to other measures, taken under the guise of security, are intended to entrench Israel’s 58-year-old military occupation of the West Bank and its settler colonial project which it enforces with routine and frequently deadly violence against Palestinians.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2331815	2025-02-05T12:21:23-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-08796390017387866845.jpg
Global Stance on Trump Remarks Highlights Widespread Rejection of...	US President Donald Trump’s statements regarding 'taking over' Gaza and 'relocating' its population have stirred worldwide condemnation, highlighting the widespread rejection of any forced displacement of Palestinians. Leaders from across the political spectrum, human rights organizations, and international institutions have reaffirmed the necessity of upholding international law and ensuring Palestinians’ right to remain in their homeland, an international law that also respects their right to armed resistance against a blatant occupier. Western Countries Beginning with the US’ closest ally in Europe, the United Kingdom, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that the Palestinians of Gaza 'must be allowed a home, they must be allowed to rebuild, and we should be with them in that rebuilding on the way to a two-state solution.' For their part, EU Member state leaders also had their own comments to make. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the Gaza Strip belongs to Palestinians and their expulsion would be unacceptable and contrary to international law. 'It would also lead to new suffering and new hatred&#8230;There must be no solution over the heads of the Palestinians.' French Foreign Ministry Spokesman Christopher Lemoine said that 'France reiterates its opposition to any forced displacement of the Palestinian population of Gaza, which would constitute a serious violation of international law, an attack on the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians, but also a major obstacle to the two-state solution and a major destabilizing factor for our close partners Egypt and Jordan as well as for the entire region.' On the other hand, the Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares Bueno, stated: 'I want to be very clear on this: Gaza is the land of Gazan Palestinians and they must stay in Gaza. Gaza is part of the future Palestinian state Spain supports and has to coexist guaranteeing the Israeli state's prosperity and safety.' At a news conference with Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington on Tuesday, Trump declared that the US 'will take over Gaza, level it and create the Riviera of the Middle East,' after brazenly calling the whole territory a 'demolition zone'. ⚡️🇺🇸BREAKING: Donald Trump announces that the U.S will take over Gaza: 'The US will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too.

(@SuppressedNws) February 5, 2025 Russia, China, Other Countries Commenting on Trump’s remarks, Russia believes a settlement in West Asia is the only possible basis of a two-state solution. 'This is the thesis that is enshrined in the relevant UN Security Council resolution, this is the thesis that is shared by the overwhelming majority of countries involved in this problem. We proceed from it, we support it and believe that this is the only possible option,' Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the matter as well: 'China hopes all parties will take ceasefire and post-conflict governance as an opportunity to bring the Palestinian issue back on the right track of political settlement based on the two-state solution.' 'Trump's comments on a plan to take over Gaza are unacceptable. Any plans leaving Palestinians 'out of the equation' would lead to more conflict'. Turkey’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva expressed shock at Trump’s supposed plan: 'It makes no sense &#8230; Where would Palestinians live? This is something incomprehensible to any human being&#8230;Palestinians are the ones who need to take care of Gaza.'

Any idea of displacing the people of Gaza anywhere else would be in clear contradiction with UN Security Council resolutions.' Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese supported a two-state solution similar to the statements of his European counterparts. 'Australia's position is the same as it was this morning, as it was last year. The Australian government supports on a bipartisan basis a two-state solution.' Int’l Organizations Human rights organizations also condemned Trump’s statements across the board, the UN human rights office stated that, 'It is crucial that we move towards the next phase of the ceasefire, to release all hostages and arbitrarily detained prisoners, end the war and reconstruct Gaza, with full respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights law. 'Any forcible transfer in or deportation of people from occupied territory is strictly prohibited.' 'It would be a moral abomination,' said Omar Shakir, Director of Human Rights Watch's 'Israel' and Palestine branch. 'International humanitarian law forbids the forced displacement of the population of an occupied territory. When such forced displacement is widespread, it can amount to a war crime or a crime against humanity.' 'Any plan to forcibly deport Palestinians outside the occupied territory against their will is a war crime, and when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack on the civilian population, it would constitute a crime against humanity' – Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2331760	2025-02-05T11:06:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07169730017387823318.jpg

The political advisor to the Secretary-General of Hezbollah, Sayyed Hussein Al-Moussawi, commented on the US President Donal Trump's remarks on the displacement of Gaza residents. Al-Moussawi said that, today, the world is witnessing an unprecedented tyrannical behavior by American officials in their dealings with the states and peoples, especially their neighbors in North and South America, highlighting the criminal orders they are directing 'to our people in Gaza and the West Bank, which require them to be expelled from the land of their ancestors and grandfathers to Egypt and Jordan'. 'The silence and indifference of the free Americans and Europeans as well as the entire free world that filled the streets chanting for Palestine and denouncing the war of extermination declared on Gaza may disappoint those who were optimistic about the voices of the free, which we must hear loudly in the face of the new ongoing American-Zionist aggression that the monsters denounce.' As for the cowardly Arabs, they have made us lose all hope in their return to the nation of their noble Prophet (PBUH), which was the best nation brought forth for mankind, Sayyed Al-Moussawi concluded.

Iran to Trump: Another Maximum Pressure, Another Defeat for Washi...	Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has asserted that another round of deployment of the 'maximum pressure' policy on the part of the United States against Iran will only lead to another defeat. 'The policy of maximum pressure has already proven to be a failure, and any attempt to revive it will only lead to another defeat,' the top diplomat told reporters on the sidelines of a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. ‘Doomed to fail again’: Iran dismisses renewed U.S. ‘maximum pressure’ policy pic.twitter.com/5M60vSaWCr — IRNA News Agency (@IrnaEnglish) February 5, 2025 Araghchi was referring to the policy that the US adopted during Donald Trump’s former tenure, as part of which Washington quit a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and world powers, returned the sanctions that the agreement had lifted, and piled up even more illegal and unilateral bans against the Islamic Republic. Retaliating against the measures, Iran took legitimate nuclear steps that have featured its operationalizing advanced centrifuges among other things. The country also explored various means to skirt the sanctions and boost its economy by fostering foreign trade and enhancing domestic production, causing Washington to suffer 'maximum defeat' in adoption of such policy. On Tuesday, Trump promoted new 'tough' measures aimed at, what Washington has called, 'deterring' Iran from obtaining a 'nuclear weapon.' Trump also signed a presidential memorandum, authorizing stricter illegal actions against Iran, while saying, 'They can’t have a nuclear weapon, we’d be very tough if they insist on doing that.' Washington’s adversarial stance comes despite Tehran’s repeated assurances that its nuclear activities remain in full compliance with international regulations, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)’s invariable verification of the peaceful nature of the Islamic Republic’s nuclear energy program. Reacting to Trump’s remarks, Araghchi said, 'If the main issue is that Iran should not pursue nuclear weapons, this is achievable and not a difficult matter.' 'Iran's stance is clear, and it is a member of the NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty), and there is also the fatwa (religious decree) of the Leader, which has clarified the matter for us,' he added. Leader of the Islamic Revolution Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei’s has prohibited pursuance, attainment, and storage of such non-conventional arms through an official decree as per religious and moral grounds. 'The Leader’s fatwa has made Iran’s position crystal clear,' Araghchi concluded. 'Iran has never had, will never have nuclear weapons program' Also on Wednesday, Mohammad Eslami, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), likewise reacted to Trump’s remarks, saying, 'Iran has never had, does not have, and will not have a nuclear weapons program. Iran's approach in this regard is absolutely clear.' He added, 'Iran's peaceful nuclear program is being implemented within the framework of Safeguards [Agreement] and the NPT.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2331375	2025-02-05T03:18:56-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-08391110017387543318.jpg

Palestinian officials and factions have roundly condemned former US President Donald Trump's recent remarks about a potential US takeover of the Gaza Strip. Senior Hamas leaders described Trump's comments as a reflection of 'ignorance' and an 'unwavering alignment' with Israeli interests. Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri dismissed the remarks as 'ridiculous' and 'absurd', warning they could inflame tensions across the region. BREAKING | Trump: 'The US will take over the Gaza Strip.' pic.twitter.com/N1NzzUCvcC — The Cradle (@TheCradleMedia) February 5, 2025 Izzat al-Rishq, a member of Hamas' political bureau, went even further, calling Trump's proposal 'reckless and uninformed.' He stressed that 'Gaza is not an open land for any party to decide its fate' and that any resolution must be based on ending the Israeli occupation, not the 'mindset of a real estate mogul obsessed with power and dominance.' Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif al-Qanou echoed these sentiments, describing Trump's rhetoric as 'dangerous' and aligned with the agenda of Israel's far-right government. He warned that it was part of a broader scheme to 'eliminate the Palestinian cause' and vowed that Palestinians would never accept forced removal from their homeland. 'The people who have withstood the most brutal military assaults for 15 months, facing the world's most lethal army, will not surrender,' al-Qanou said. 'No matter the cost, they will remain steadfast on their land.' Notably, senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk signaled a potential openness to dialogue with Trump's administration, telling Russian media that the group is 'ready to communicate and hold discussions' with the former president's team. However, he emphasized that Hamas remains committed to establishing a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour also reaffirmed Palestinians' unwavering attachment to their homeland, rejecting any suggestion of relocation. 'Our homeland is our homeland,' he stated firmly. 'If part of it is destroyed—the Gaza Strip—the Palestinian people selected the choice to return to it.' Across the board, Palestinian leaders have issued a clear and resounding rejection of Trump's proposal, vowing to resist any attempts at forced displacement or external control over Gaza. The international community has been called upon to uphold Palestinian self-determination and reject the former president's divisive rhetoric.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2331232	2025-02-05T01:27:17-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-01242310016624655728.jpg

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Palestinians have no alternative but to leave Gaza and he would like to see neighboring countries Jordan and Egypt take the displaced Palestinians. 'I do not necessarily support Israeli settlement in Gaza,' Trump said before his meeting with the Zionist prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem rejected the statements of American officials regarding the displacement of Palestinians in from Gaza, saying that the American statements are racist, medieval, and reflect the absence of moral and humanitarian standards. 'Instead of holding the occupation accountable for the crime of genocide and displacement, it is being rewarded, not punished. The extent of the destruction in Gaza is large and unprecedented, and we need a lot for reconstruction.' -'We are being subjected to a psychological war aimed at pushing Palestinians to emigrate by talking about long times for reconstruction,' he said. US completely backed a 15-month Israeli war on Gaza, which left more than 47 thousand Palestinians dead and over 110 thousand of others injured. The war also cause a massive destruction. Trump signed a presidential memorandum reimposing a tough policy on Iran meant to 'block the country from achieving a nuclear weapon and to limit its oil exports'. Speaking at the Oval Office in the White House, Trump said Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and that the U.S. has the right to block the sale of Iranian oil to other nations.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2330979	2025-02-04T12:42:10-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2019/10/manar-079064800156999861810.jpg

Lavrov: 'Israel’ Not Intending to Leave Territories It’s Occupyin...	The Russian foreign minister on Tuesday accused Western nations of attempting to push Russia, China, and Iran into secondary roles in Syria, warning that such efforts are not driven by good intentions. Speaking at the 14th Middle East Conference of the Valdai Discussion Club in Moscow, Sergey Lavrov said these moves reflect the West’s broader goal of diminishing its geopolitical competitors. 'Attempts to remove Russia, China, and Iran from the process of externally supporting a Syrian settlement are hardly motivated by goodwill. Instead, they expose the West’s intention to push its competitors into secondary positions,' he said. Lavrov also accused Western nations, particularly the US, of creating crises and observing the outcomes from a distance. 'The West is used to destroying something, creating crises, and then watching what happens, especially the Americans, who find it interesting to observe from across the ocean,' he said. 'But the Middle East is not a playground, and it should not be treated as one.' Lavrov welcomed the ceasefire agreement between 'Israel' and the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza, acknowledging the efforts to reach an agreement after prolonged negotiations at the UN Security Council. 'Of course, it is good that a ceasefire has been achieved after almost a year of efforts,' he said, noting that despite the truce, casualties continue to rise. He further accused 'Israel' of not intending to leave the territories it is occupying in Lebanon and Syria, saying there are also many 'credible leaks' that, in addition to expelling Palestinians from Gaza, 'Israel' plans to take full control of the northwest bank of the Jordan River. Lavrov stressed the creation of a Palestinian state as 'the key to all the numerous problems' in the Middle East. He also expressed that the US, under President Donald Trump, has not yet clearly stated its position on the topic of a two-state solution in the region. Moscow is receiving signals that there will be problems in the implementation of the second stage of the ceasefire in Gaza, Lavrov added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2330748	2025-02-04T06:15:10-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/09/manar-09607150016947106646.jpg
Hezbollah Denounces Australia’s Unjust Sanctions on Secretary Gen...	Hezbollah issued on Tuesday a statement to condemn the unjust decision by Australia to impose sanctions on Hezbollah's Secretary-General, His Eminence Sheikh Naim Qassem, affirming that this move once again exposes the true face of this state and proving that it is nothing more than a submissive tool serving the American-Zionist project. 'This oppressive decision lacks any legal or moral basis and represents a blatant bias in favor of the Zionist entity, providing cover for its aggression and terrorism,' the statement read. 'The peoples of the world have witnessed the massacres and crimes committed by the Zionist enemy against innocent civilians in Gaza and Lebanon. They now fully understand who the real terrorist is, who engages in genocide and war crimes, and who provides political and legal cover for these massacres, sharing responsibility for them.' The Australian state should have punished the Zionist murderers and stood by the oppressed people of Lebanon and Palestine, according to Hezbollah statement. Hezbollah affirmed that this decision will not affect the morale of the loyal resistance people in Lebanon, nor will it impact Hezbollah's stance, its natural right to resist, defend its country and people, and stand with the just cause of the Palestinian people. Instead, it will only strengthen its determination and steadfastness to continue the path of confronting the occupier, Hezbollah statement concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2330704	2025-02-04T05:11:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-04165050017056142612.png
Gaza Ceasefire Talks at Crossroads as Zionist PM Benjamin Netanya...	The Gaza ceasefire agreement entered its 17th day on Tuesday, as all eyes turn to the outcome of Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s meeting with US President Donald Trump in Washington. The discussions are expected to influence the second phase of the ceasefire negotiations. Netanyahu continues to adopt a strategy of ambiguity and maneuvering regarding the talks, a stance reflected in Israeli media reports. According to Maariv, citing security sources, Netanyahu is considering removing the Shin Bet chief from the negotiating team due to a lack of trust and is attempting to block the second phase of the ceasefire deal. Meanwhile, the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation reported that Netanyahu’s office announced plans to send a delegation to Doha, Qatar next weekend for further negotiations. Netanyahu is also set to hold a ministerial meeting upon returning from Washington to assess the deal's status, with discussions expected to include Trump. His office described his meeting with US National Security Advisor Michael Waltz and special envoy Steve Witkoff as 'positive.' The former Israeli ambassador to the US told Army Radio that Washington is pushing for the second phase of the prisoner exchange agreement and is waiting for progress on a post-war plan for Gaza. However, Avigdor Lieberman, leader of the 'Yisrael Beiteinu' party, claimed that Netanyahu’s primary goal in Washington is to derail the second phase of the deal. He accused Netanyahu of prioritizing his political survival over national interests, stating that his only concern is preserving his governing coalition. Hamas Ready for Next Phase According to sources within the movement, Hamas has informed mediators of its readiness to begin negotiations on the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. A senior Hamas official told AFP that talks were scheduled to start on Monday, emphasizing that Hamas is prepared and fully committed to implementing the deal. The second phase of talks will focus on securing a permanent ceasefire, preventing a return to war, and ensuring a full military withdrawal, including from the Philadelphia Corridor. Discussions will also address the terms for releasing Palestinian prisoners. Hamas stressed that its armed wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, along with other resistance factions, holds several high-ranking Zionist officers and soldiers captive. The agreement also includes provisions for the continued entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. This includes food, medicine, relief supplies, 200,000 tents, 60,000 caravans, materials to restore hospitals and water facilities, bakery operations, and fuel and heavy equipment for rubble removal and body recovery. Meanwhile, Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif Al-Qanou reaffirmed the movement’s commitment to the agreement but warned that its implementation depends on the Israeli enemy fulfilling its obligations under the first phase. He accused the Zionist entity of deliberately delaying the entry of shelters and relief aid, calling it an attempt to pressure and break the will of the Palestinian people. ⚡️🇵🇸JUST IN: 32 trucks carrying tents and tarpaulins have entered the northern Gaza Strip.

(@SuppressedNws) February 4, 2025 'Hamas will not allow the Israeli enemy to obstruct relief efforts or sabotage the agreement,' he stated, adding that the group remains in constant communication with mediators to ensure 'Israel' abides by its commitments, particularly regarding humanitarian aid. Al-Qanou described Gaza’s humanitarian crisis as a 'new Nakba' caused by Israel’s failure to uphold the deal. He urged the international community and mediators to pressure Israel into complying with the ceasefire and ensuring aid reaches those in need. Hamas Warns of Consequences Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan revealed that mediators have proposed measures to enforce the Israeli enemy's compliance with the agreement, with further details expected soon. He warned that if the Zionist entity fails to meet its obligations, Hamas will take its measures. 'Our priority is a permanent end to aggression and Gaza’s reconstruction,' Hamdan emphasized. 🔴 Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan: 'The second phase of negotiations will be significant, as it will include the release of prisoners from all categories: Those serving life sentences, long-term prisoners, Hezbollah prisoners, and Nukh’ba fighters detained after October 7.' pic.twitter.com/EM3SZ67p0V — Voice From The East (@EasternVoices) February 4, 2025 Hamdan stated that the best approach for governing Gaza post-war is establishing a national unity government. Speaking at a political studies forum, he stated that if such a government cannot be established, Hamas remains open to any framework leading to a national administration for the enclave. He also highlighted that the second phase of the ceasefire and prisoner exchange deal will be critical, as it involves negotiations on prisoners with life sentences, high-security detainees, Hezbollah captives, and those from Gaza arrested after October 7. Regarding prisoners released under the 'Operation Al-Aqsa Flood' deal who were deported, Hamdan confirmed that Hamas is in talks with several countries to host them. While the process may take time, he affirmed that a solution is underway. Ceasefire Deal and Diplomatic Efforts Mediated negotiations are set to resume, aiming for the release of all Israeli captives in Gaza and an end to the war. The three-phase ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement stipulates a halt in hostilities and the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces from populated areas. The first phase, lasting six weeks, includes the release of 33 Zionist prisoners (excluding Thai nationals) in exchange for approximately 1,900 Palestinian detainees. Later this week, US envoy Steve Wietkoff is scheduled to meet with Qatar’s Prime Minister and senior Egyptian officials involved in mediation efforts. Meanwhile, on February 11, US President Donald Trump is set to host Jordan’s King Abdullah II as part of ongoing discussions. On Sunday, Trump stated that negotiations involving 'Israel' and other regional players were making progress. He added that Netanyahu’s visit to Washington includes 'major meetings,' with Israel-Saudi normalization being a key agenda item. Netanyahu’s Priorities: Securing Political Survival Over Gaza Talks Israeli Channel 13 reported that during his meeting with US' Donald Trump, Zionist PM Netanyahu aimed to secure more time to maintain his governing coalition. According to the report, Netanyahu intends to stress that confronting Iran is a higher priority than advancing the second phase of Gaza ceasefire negotiations. The Israeli broadcaster noted uncertainty over Netanyahu’s commitment to the Gaza agreement, suggesting he plans to propose a shift in Middle East priorities during his talks with Trump. Meanwhile, The Washington Post, citing a Zionist official, reported that Netanyahu is seeking assurances from Trump that Hamas will not be part of Gaza’s future. The same official claimed that the new US administration is focused on a different regional goal—ending the conflict in Gaza—while discussions about striking Iran are no longer on the table. Before his meeting with Netanyahu, Trump stated that there are 'no guarantees' the Gaza ceasefire will hold. However, his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Wietkoff, who was seated beside him, quickly added that the truce 'remains in place for now,' expressing hope that more hostages will be released and that a peaceful resolution will be achieved. Notably, Netanyahu, who arrived in Washington on Sunday, is the first foreign leader to be received by Trump since his inauguration.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2330682	2025-02-04T05:01:20-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-03098510017386717093.jpg

Iranian Top Military Advisor: Hezbollah Advances Toward Victory a...	General Yahya Rahim Safavi, the senior advisor to the Supreme Leader of Iran for Armed Forces Affairs, stated that Hezbollah’s trajectory across Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria is advancing toward victory. Speaking at a ceremony commemorating the birth of Imam Hussein (PBUH), General Safavi discussed the shifting dynamics in the region and stressed the failure of American policies. US Miscalculations General Safavi pointed out that while the United States believes it has achieved victory in the region, they are gravely mistaken. He drew comparisons to the US defeat in Afghanistan, where, after 20 years, American forces were forced to retreat. 'Just as they were defeated in Afghanistan and fled, they will also be forced to retreat from Iraq,' Safavi remarked. He emphasized that Palestinian resistance significantly challenged the US-Israeli enemy and their allies. Israeli Enemy's Military Struggles Safavi further commented on the Israeli war on Gaza, asserting that the Zionist regime endured its longest war in over 75 years. 'The Zionist entity is now going through the longest war in more than 75 years of its ill-fated life. Its classical wars from 1948 to 2000 with the governments of Egypt, Syria and Jordan did not last more than a few days. However, the unlimited operations and non-classical wars with Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Palestinians after 2000 lasted from 33 to 50 days,' General Safavi continued. Strategic Failure of Netanyahu’s Government According to Safavi, the war between Hamas and Israeli occupation has evolved into a prolonged war of attrition, significantly weakening Israel’s security and the moral standing of its military. He criticized Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for failing to achieve his stated goals, which were the destruction of Hamas in Gaza and the liberation of hostages. Safavi added that the political and military strategy of the Israeli occupation regime had utterly failed. The senior Iranian military advisor concluded by saying that after more than 455 days of indiscriminate killings of children and innocent civilians, the only outcome, he argued, was the Israeli enemy conceding to Hamas' demands. He pointed out that the international community witnessed how the Israeli occupation, after committing atrocities, was forced to accept a ceasefire and comply with Hamas' demands for a prisoner exchange. IRGC Admiral: Iranian Naval Warships to Visit UAE In another context, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy Commander, Admiral Alireza Tangsiri, announced that four warships from the IRGC and the Iranian Army will depart for the UAE to visit the Emirati Navy. 'This is the first time such a meeting is taking place,' he stated, emphasizing that regional countries are fully capable of ensuring their security. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the 14th Malik Ashtar Festival, Admiral Tangsiri reiterated Iran’s stance that foreign presence in the region is unnecessary. Joint Exercises and Maritime Security Regarding military drills with neighboring nations, Tangsiri confirmed that joint exercises with regional countries, including Iraq, are on the agenda. 'We have already engaged in naval cooperation with Oman and participated in joint exercises with the Omani Navy,' he noted. Highlighting the strategic importance of the Strait of Hormuz, Tangsiri stressed that Iran has been safeguarding its security for years and has taken significant measures in this regard. 🔴🇮🇷 IRGC Navy Commander, Alireza Tangsiri: In the near future, a multi-purpose drone carrier will be added to the IRGC Navy pic.twitter.com/HNcTiFrWMG — Observer Report (@Observer1514) February 3, 2025 On Iran’s growing naval capabilities, Tangsiri revealed that the IRGC Navy possesses drone carriers and vessels capable of carrying helicopters and unmanned aircraft.

He also congratulated the Palestinians for the release of prisoners and the achievements they have made. The Struggle Continues Despite Counter Campaigns Sheikh Qassem affirmed that the resistance will persist based on its strategic evaluations and battlefield conditions, pointing to a 'counter campaign sponsored by the United States, Israeli enemy, and foreign countries, alongside an internal team promoting defeat.' 'We have never claimed absolute victory. This battle involves both gains and losses, but the choice of resistance is firm and will not change, his eminence added. Regarding the motorbike incident outside Beirut's southern suburbs, Sheikh Qassem clarified that Hezbollah has no connection with the motorbikes that entered some Lebanese areas, highlighting that this act is rejected and those who carried it out have no relation to us.' 'We are against such forms of expressing joy or sorrow, and we call on the security forces to punish those who fired gunshots or entered areas in a provocative manner,' his eminence concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2329461	2025-02-02T10:40:58-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-011779400173852142410.jpg

'If it had been said that the people of the small region of Gaza would fight against a great power like the US and emerge victorious, no one would have believed it, but this impossible matter has been realized by God’s permission,' he said, as quoted by Tasnim news agency. Elsewhere in his remarks, Imam Khamenei praised Iran’s progress in various domains, saying the country has grown in all directions over the past 40 years. 'The Iranian nation has shown patience and perseverance for over 40 years, while all the arrogant world powers stood against it, working and plotting against it,' the Leader said. 'Yet, not only has the Iranian nation not been harmed, but it has also advanced and grown. Today’s Iran is not the Iran of 40 years ago—we have progressed in every aspect,' he added.

Lebanese Southerners Determined to Liberate Their Villages Despit...	The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) continue their gradual deployment in the southern border towns, allowing the residents to return and assess the conditions of their communities on Sunday. Meanwhile, attacks by the Zionist occupation army persist. Since the early morning on Sunday, large numbers of Lebanese southerners have flocked to towns in the eastern sector, where occupation forces have been staying, in clear violation of the ceasefire agreement, particularly in Mays Al-Jabal, Houla, and the outskirts of Markaba. Citizens spread throughout the area, reaching the farthest accessible points permitted by LAF at the entrances to these towns. مواكبة | مراسل المنار : احتشاد اهالي بلدة حولا في الحي الغربي بالقرب من إجراءات الجيش اللبناني حيث تتواجد دبابات ميركافا على بعد مئة متر من تجمعات المواطنين من دون تسجيل حوادث تذكر pic.twitter.com/h1nIiLravz — قناة المنار (@TVManar1) February 2, 2025 At the same time, families of the martyrs gathered, holding up pictures of their fallen sons to affirm their presence and unwavering connection to the land. Residents reiterated their steadfastness and refusal to retreat, regardless of the sacrifices required. Despite ongoing Israeli aggression, Lebanese civilians and armed forces persist in reclaiming and defending their towns. The continued deployment of the Lebanese army and the unwavering resilience of the people highlight a unified stance against occupation. From mass gatherings to frontline confrontations, the message remains clear: The people of Lebanon refuse to retreat, standing firm in their determination to protect their homeland. Conditions on the Outskirts of Kfar Kila In the same context, a large number of residents gathered at the entrance to Deir Mimas, heading toward Kfar Kila, in preparation to enter and push out the Israeli occupation forces. Al-Manar correspondent reported that Israeli forces remained stationed in the area with their vehicles, preventing residents from advancing. Young men from various Lebanese regions also arrived, including from the Bekaa and the North, determined to share in the joy of victory and liberation with their southern compatriots, according to our correspondent. بالصور | من تجمع أهالي كفركلا عند حدود بلدة ديرميماس في #جنوب_لبنان pic.twitter.com/HcMmZBfhq2 — قناة المنار (@TVManar1) February 2, 2025 Video: A segment from the large public gathering in Mays Al-Jabal The popular movement at the entrance to Mays Al-Jabal’s western neighborhood represents a stark example of the people's commitment to their land and their rejection of the ongoing occupation of their town. MP Elias Jradi: Resistance Not Limited to Any Sect Lebanese parliament member Elias Jradi, who stood alongside the people at the entrance to Kfar Kila, emphasized that the ideology of resistance is rooted in the liberation of the homeland, dignity, and humanity. He stressed that it is the responsibility of all Lebanese to uphold this ideology, which must not be confined to any particular class or sect. Jradi explained that resistance is a universal humanitarian principle, with its foremost cause being the defense of humanity wherever it is needed. He affirmed that the eighteenth of this month is a decisive date with no turning back and called for it to be a moment of national unity—a symbolic Lebanese wedding. He urged not only the residents of the south, Kfar Kila, Marjeyoun, Hasbaya, and Nabatieh to participate, but all Lebanese to come together, stand on the land of dignity in the south, and affirm Lebanon’s unity as one nation. مواكبة | النائب الياس جرادي من ديرميماس: المقاومة فكرة إنسانية وإن لم يكن لدينا هذا الإصرار سنصبح عبيدًا في هذا العالم المتحرك pic.twitter.com/mT2KpEVhqy — قناة المنار (@TVManar1) February 2, 2025 Situation in Yaroun and Maroun Al-Ras Al-Manar correspondent reported that the Zionist enemy opened fire multiple times in the morning toward houses in the southern town of Yaroun, as well as at a home near the gathering point of the town’s residents. Meanwhile, several other residents spent the night among the ruins of their destroyed homes, in valiant resistance to the occupier. The enemy also fired bursts of gunfire at a camera set up to cover the events in the area. The camera, installed on the roof of a destroyed house, appeared to be deliberately targeted in an attempt to intimidate both the residents and anyone else seeking to document the situation, Al-Manar correspondent repored. In Maroun Al-Ras, residents gathered on the road directly facing the Zionist occupation forces, standing just 50 meters away from their position. LAF Enters Aitaroun as Attacks on Other Towns Continue A force from the Lebanese army successfully entered the neighborhoods of Aitaroun amid ongoing enemy attacks on other towns, particularly Taybeh. Following relentless assaults by the enemy and its continued refusal to withdraw from Aitaroun’s southern neighborhoods, the LAF moved into the town via Al-Saluqi Valley road. Their mission was to lift the siege on a group of army personnel who had been trapped in their battalion center by the occupation forces while carrying out their deployment tasks the previous Sunday, as issued in the agreement. The army also sought to reopen the road for residents. Army units reached the vicinity of Aitaroun pond and several other locations vacated by the occupation. Meanwhile, the town’s residents gathered once again at its western entrance. Earlier on Saturday, our correspondent reported that the army extended its deployment to additional neighborhoods in Yaroun and continued its operations in Deir Siryan. As part of its ongoing attacks on border towns and villages, the enemy carried out a massive explosion in Kfar Kila, destroying ten homes. In Rab Thalatheen, Aitaroun, and Adaisseh, the occupation forces continued their scorched earth policy, setting fire to homes and properties. Even during the truce, the enemy targeted bulldozers in Taybeh for the second time, striking them with explosive bombs as they worked to clear rubble and recover the bodies of martyrs. Despite this attack, the town’s municipality remained undeterred, bringing in an additional bulldozer to continue the search.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2328933	2025-02-02T05:21:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-08572480017385018321.jpg
China, Canada and Mexico Vow Response to Trump Tariffs	Canada, Mexico and China have vowed to respond to sweeping new tariffs to their exports to the US announced by President Donald Trump. Trump said a levy of 25% on Canadian and Mexican imports as well as an additional 10% tax on Chinese goods would come into force on Tuesday. Canadian energy faces a lower 10% tariff. The US president said the move was in response to his concerns about illegal immigration and drug trafficking - two of the main promises on which he was elected. In response, both Canada and Mexico said they were preparing similar tariffs on US goods, while China added it would take 'necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests'. The implementation of tariffs and the subsequent retaliation could mark the start of a new era of global trade wars, according to the BBC, which quoted economists as warning that the introduction of the import taxes by the US, and the responses from other countries could lead to prices rising on a wide range of products, from cars, lumber, and steel to food and alcohol.

'Today's tariff announcement is necessary to hold China, Mexico, and Canada accountable for their promises to halt the flood of poisonous drugs into the United States,' the White House said in a statement on X on Saturday. Trump posted on his Truth Social platform: 'This was done through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl.' Together, China, Mexico and Canada accounted for more than 40% of imports into the US last year. Canada, Mexico and the US have deeply integrated economies, with an estimated $2bn (£1.6bn) worth of manufactured goods crossing the borders daily. In its announcement, the White House accused Mexico's government of having 'an intolerable alliance' with Mexican drug trafficking organizations. Mexico Reacts In her response, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called allegations that the Mexican government had alliances with criminal organizations 'slander'. Sheinbaum called on the US to do more to clamp down on the illegal flow of guns south to arm the cartels.

'Problems are not resolved by imposing tariffs, but by talking.' She has instructed her economy minister to respond with tariff and non-tariff measures. They are expected to include retaliatory tariffs of 25% on US goods. Canadian Response For his part, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country will also respond. 'We don't want to be here, we didn't ask for this,' he said at a news conference late on Saturday. 'But we will not back down in standing up for Canadians.' His government will impose 25% tariffs on $155bn worth of American goods - $30bn will come into force on Tuesday and another $125bn in 21 days. The Canadian prime minister pushed back on the suggestion the shared border posed a security concern, saying less than 1% of fentanyl going into the United States comes from Canada. 'Tariffs are not the best way we can work together to save lives,' Trudeau said. He also said he had not spoken to Trump since the inauguration, but would keep lines open with US counterparts. Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil. According to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November last year came from Canada. China to File Lawsauit On the other hand, China said in a statement that it was strongly dissatisfied with the levies and 'firmly opposes' them. The 10% tax will be added over and above tariffs already imposed on China by Trump in his first term and by President Joe Biden. It added that it would file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization against the US for its 'wrongful practice'. 'Trade and tariff wars have no winners,' said a spokesperson at China's Washington embassy. China's Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month that his country was looking for a 'win-win' solution to trade tensions and wanted to expand its imports.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2328867	2025-02-02T04:26:31-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-03197880017384988932.jpg
Newly Appointed Israeli Chief of Staff Faces Tough Task of Rebuil...	New Israeli chief of staff will face the immense challenge of rebuilding the occupation army after months of intense combat, Israeli media reported on Sunday. Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir, the Defense Ministry director general, was tapped by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz on Saturday to become the next chief of staff of the Israeli military. He is to take up the post on March 6, becoming the Israeli 24th chief of staff, following the resignation of Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi. Halevi announced his departure last month after only two years in the role rather than the traditional four. The outgoing chief of staff had long been expected to step down once the war in Gaza began winding down over the 'military failures that enabled the disaster of the October 7, 2023,' the Times of Israeli reported. Palestinian resistance fighters after they captured Israeli soldiers during heroic Op. Al-Aqsa Flood on October 7, 2023. Commenting on Zamir's appointment, Ynet’s Yoav Zitun considered that Zamir 'faces tough task' of rebuilding military amid war. In a report on Sunday, the Israeli journalist elaborated on the challenges facing the newely appointed chief of staff. 'Zamir will face the immense challenge of rebuilding the IDF after months of intense combat, implementing a long-term restructuring plan and preparing the military for multi-front conflicts rather than the traditional two-front model,' Zitun wrote, referring to Israeli occupation forces (IOF).

Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem is to deliver a televised speech on Sunday, in which his eminence will tackle latest developments in south Lebanon and the funeral of late S.G. Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, the group's Media Relations Office announced on Saturday. The speech will be aired via Al-Manar at 18:00 (Beirut time) on Sunday. In his latest speech, Sheikh Qassem hailed the popular rallies which took place last Sunday (January 26), when the deadline for the Israeli enemy forces to withdraw from Lebanon expired. The epic rallies forced the occupation forces to withdraw from several border towns that Israeli troops advanced towards after the ceasefire took effect on November 27, following 66-day Israeli aggression on Lebanon. Late Hezbollah leader Sayyed Nasrallah was martyred on September 27 in a brutal Israeli raid on Beirut southern suburb, Dahiyeh, five days after the aggression on Lebanon started on September 23.

Trump: Nothing Canada, Mexico or China Can Do to Delay Feb 1 Tari...	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he would impose hefty new tariffs of 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada and 10% on imports from China, and nothing could be done by the three countries to forestall them. Trump did, however, reference a potential carve out for oil from Canada, saying that rate would be 10% versus the 25% planned for other goods from the United States' northern neighbor. But he indicated wider tariffs on oil and natural gas would be coming in mid-February, remarks that sent oil prices higher. Trump has been threatening the tariffs for weeks, saying they would be imposed on Feb. 1 and remain in place until the countries did more to stem the flow of both migrants and fentanyl over the U.S. border. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office as he was signing executive orders, Trump said he understood the duties could result in higher costs being passed on to consumers and acknowledged his actions may cause disruptions in the short term. Most economists estimate such sweeping import taxes, and the likely retaliation, would disrupt economic activity around the globe. Asked if there was any opportunity at this stage for the three top U.S. trading partners to win a delay, Trump said: 'No, no. Not right now, no.' He brushed away the notion his threats for levies have been a bargaining tool. 'No, it's not &#8230; we have big (trade) deficits with, as you know, with all three of them.' 'It's something we're doing, and we'll possibly very substantially increase it, or not, we'll see how it is,' Trump said. 'But it's a lot of money coming to the United States.' And more tariffs are on the way, the Republican president said, saying import taxes were being considered on European goods as well as on steel, aluminum and copper, and on drugs and semiconductors. 'We're going to be putting tariffs on steel and aluminum, and ultimately copper. Copper will take a little longer,' he said. Financial markets have been whipsawed by the rapid-fire but still not fully clear developments on Trump's tariff plans, with currency trading showing particular volatility. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both weakened while Treasury bond yields rose, and stocks ended the day lower. Still, he said he was not concerned about the reaction of financial markets to his plans to impose tariffs. 'The President will be implementing tomorrow 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada, and a 10% tariff on China for the illegal fentanyl that they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country, which has killed tens of millions of Americans,' White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told a press briefing.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2328471	2025-02-01T10:55:45-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-04207890017384360988.jpg

Israeli occupation authorities released the fourth batch of Palestinian detainees today as part of the prisoner exchange deal under the ceasefire agreement (Al-Aqsa Flood Deal) in Gaza. According to the Palestinian Commission for Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoner's Society, 183 detainees were released including 111 from the Gaza Strip, who were detained after October 7, 2023. Ahead of the release, Israeli forces declared the area near Ofer Prison a closed military zone, preventing families from gathering to welcome their loved ones. The occupation soldiers further fired sound bombs towards them. Hundreds of local residents and detainees' families gathered since the early morning hours in the Mahmoud Darwish Museum Square in the city of Ramallah to receive the released detainees, raising the Palestinian flags. The release marks a significant development in the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, with emotions running high among families and supporters celebrating the return of their loved ones. The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, handed over two Israeli prisoners to the International Red Cross in Khan Yunis, south of the Gaza Strip, on Saturday morning, as part of the fourth batch of the first phase of the 'Al-Aqsa Flood' deal.

The Lebanese army deployed its troops in Aitaroun border town, South Lebanon, as the Israeli enemy resumed its withdrawal after a recent escalation. According to media reports, the military units advanced into tho western and northern neighborhoods of the town in order to remove the unexploded munitions left by the enemy before withdrawal. Aitaroun municipality issued a statement which calls on the locals to avoid returning to the town before the Lebanese Army secures this moves and gives a formal permission in this regard. On Sunday, January 26, 2025, a popular movement erupted in face of the Zionist occupation of a number of Lebanese border towns, including Aitaroun where a number of returnees to the town were either martyred or injured in the confrontation. The Lebanese Army also continued deploying troops in Yaroun town. It is also expected that the LA deploys its units in Blida town. Meanwhile, the Israeli enemy continued its violations, demolishing houses and sabotaging the infrastructure in Yaroun town. Itis worth noting that the enemy is still occupying the eastern sector of Yaroun, which the Lebanese Army advanced into its western neighborhoods. It is worth to mention that that the large numbers of southerners have returned to their towns and villages, like Taybeh, in order to search for the bodies of the martyrs, inspect their houses and contribute to the process of removing debris. The Israeli enemy also burnt and demolished houses in the two towns of Adaisseh and Rub Al-tlateen.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2328196	2025-02-01T06:39:45-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-03143140017384207685.jpg

(@GlobeWarReport) February 1, 2025 The Israeli occupation army added that the forces in the area responded by returning fire at the source of the gunfire, emphasizing that no injuries were reported and that the IOF continued their operations without interruption. Zionist military radio described the incident as the first of its kind, marking the first such event since the Israeli enemy's ground operations began in the demilitarized zone and southern Syria. The Israeli occupation army has been conducting ground incursions into Syrian territory since early December 2024. The radio noted that, although no casualties occurred, it was too early to determine whether this incident marked the beginning of organized armed resistance against Israeli operations in Syria. The report emphasized 'the need to assess the security of Israeli forces and their readiness for similar events in the future.' Armed Group Claims Responsibility Later, a group calling itself the 'Islamic Resistance Front in Syria' issued a statement on social media claiming responsibility for the attack. In their statement, they announced the launch of their operations against Israeli occupation forces, stating, 'For the first time, we targeted the Israeli occupation army in the Al-Qunaitra countryside and forced them to retreat and withdraw.' The Israeli research center, Alma, reported that this group was formed in early December 2024, following the collapse of the Syrian regime, 'in response to the silence of the new Syrian government and its failure to take action against Israeli forces.' Following the incident, Israeli enemy forces stormed the village of Turnejeh in the Al-Qunaitra countryside and detained two young men, according to local social media networks. -Syria- The Israeli army arrested at least two people in the town of Taranja in the Quneitra region.

However, rumors surfaced Friday suggesting that Israeli occupation forces set the governorate building on fire. Activists on social media circulated videos they claimed documented the building being set alight. Sources have expressed skepticism about the sincerity of the UN-mediated promise, stating that the ongoing actions of the occupying forces indicate that the promise is unlikely to be fulfilled.

Tulkarm: Six Days of Israeli Aggression Leaves Trail of Destructi...	Israeli occupation forces have been wreaking havoc across the occupied West Bank, with a particularly intense focus on the city of Tulkarm and its refugee camp. For the past six consecutive days, these forces have pressed their assault, leaving a trail of widespread devastation in their wake.

The Martyr Thabet Thabet Governmental Hospital and Al-Israa Specialized Hospital remain under siege, severely disrupting the work of ambulances and medical teams. In the Tulkarm refugee camp, Israeli occupation units have enforced a tight blockade, deploying foot patrols in every alley and stationing snipers on surrounding buildings. Eyewitnesses have reported that Israeli occupation soldiers are forcing Palestinians from multiple neighborhoods to leave their homes, further exacerbating the climate of fear and forcible displacement. The Israeli escalation has not been limited to Tulkarm. Across the occupied West Bank, the occupation military continues its aggression, sending additional reinforcements to Jenin in the north and destroying civilian properties and infrastructure. In Jenin, the occupation forces have completely emptied the camp, forcing out its residents, estimated at more than 22,000 people, amid mass detainments.

Zionist PM Netanyahu Faces Pressure as Gaza Ceasefire Holds: Four...	On the 13th day of the Gaza ceasefire, Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu finds himself stuck between the relentless pressure of resistance and mounting criticism from his allies while facing serious challenges to his political future. After over 15 months of devastation and the martyrdom of numerous senior Hamas leaders, Gaza's fighters have emerged from their neighborhoods stronger than ever, still armed and standing firm in the areas that saw the most brutal battles and destruction. They have made one thing clear to their enemy: Israeli captives will return only on their terms, as set by the unyielding resistance. Netanyahu Faces Intense Scrutiny This dramatic turn of events, coupled with the contents of the ceasefire agreement itself, has placed Netanyahu in a difficult position, sparking a key question from day one: What actual objectives has the Israeli enemy achieved? A recent survey by the Hebrew newspaper Maariv revealed that only 4% of Zionists believe 'Israel' has fully achieved its war goals. Many observers see this as part of an American-Israeli effort to contain the growing wave of questions and criticisms facing the occupying government. In response, Netanyahu’s office announced that a security meeting is held on Friday to discuss the possibility of resuming fighting immediately if the Gaza ceasefire agreement collapses. This announcement coincides with the visit of US envoy Steve Witkoff to the occupied city of 'Tel Aviv,' who stated on Thursday evening that he believes Netanyahu is 'committed' to upholding the ceasefire agreement, which he estimates will take 10 to 15 years for full reconstruction. Second Phase of Prisoner Exchange Deal Meanwhile, the Israeli news website Walla reported, quoting the Coordinator of Prisoner Affairs Gal Hirsch, that Netanyahu’s upcoming meeting with US President Donald Trump next week will be crucial for the second phase of the prisoner exchange deal. Preparations are reportedly underway to begin negotiations for this next phase. Israeli Channel 12, citing sources, reported that while 'Israel' does not expect the next phases of the prisoner swap deal to fail, it has not ruled out any potential scenarios. Meanwhile, Channel 14 stated that the Israeli entity’s war goals—namely, the destruction of Hamas' military capabilities and the overthrow of its rule in Gaza—have not been achieved at all. Security Concerns Over Deal's Impact In a related development, the Jerusalem Post reported that Zionist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called the ceasefire deal 'catastrophic and dangerous to Israeli security.' He claimed that he remained in the government only after being convinced that Netanyahu and Trump were committed to removing Hamas as Gaza's ruling force. Smotrich expressed his belief that the Israeli entity would return to battle after the first phase concludes in early March, warning he would push to dissolve the government if the second phase of the agreement ends the war without achieving its objectives. At the same time, hundreds of Israelis protested outside the US Embassy in 'Tel Aviv,' demanding the full implementation of all stages of the agreement. Fourth Phase of Prisoner Exchange Abu Ubaida, spokesperson for the Martyr Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, announced that the group will release three Israeli prisoners tomorrow, Saturday: Ofer Calderon, Keith Shmonsel Sigal, and Yarden Bibas. In exchange, the Palestinian Prisoners' Information Office confirmed that nine Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences, along with 81 others with lengthy sentences, will also be released as part of the fourth phase of the prisoner swap. Prisoners’ Media Office reported that 9 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and 81 prisoners with high sentences will be freed on Saturday as part of the fourth batch of the prisoner exchange deal between the resistance and Israel. pic.twitter.com/HW4rCxq3Tf — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) January 31, 2025 The Israeli Army Radio reported that Netanyahu's office confirmed the three Zionist prisoners set to be freed by Hamas on Saturday are alive. Yedioth Ahronoth cited Israeli sources saying that 'the list we received from Hamas is acceptable and aligns with the agreed-upon terms.' Meanwhile, Israeli Channel 12 reported that sources expect the release of prisoners to begin in the morning, following the same timeline as previous exchange operations. Israeli occupation authorities on Thursday released 110 Palestinian prisoners, including Zakaria Zubeidi, one of the six escapees from Gilboa Prison in the 'Freedom Tunnel' break. This release came as part of the third phase of the ongoing prisoner swap under the ceasefire agreement, with Hamas releasing three Israeli detainees in return. Rafah Border Crossing Open Israeli public broadcaster, citing Palestinian sources, reported that the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt opened on Friday, instead of Sunday as previously planned. The sources indicated that approval had been granted for the exit of injured Al-Qassam fighters for medical treatment, with the condition that they return afterward. However, they cautioned that the opening could be halted if the prisoner exchange doesn’t proceed smoothly tomorrow. Yedioth Ahronoth reported, citing an EU official, that European forces will play a key role in the Gaza ceasefire. The plan is to reopen Rafah during the first phase to allow people to leave Gaza. The source added that Palestinian Authority border officers would manage the crossing, although no official statement has been made by the resistance. The EU is reportedly deploying up to 100 border officers with new security arrangements. Since May 24, humanitarian aid has been entering Gaza via the Karam Abu Salem crossing, controlled by the Israeli enemy, after the Israeli occupation military took control of Rafah and destroyed parts of it during its offensive in May. Humanitarian Aid Numbers and Shortages According to Al Jazeera, 7,926 trucks have entered Gaza since the ceasefire began, with about two-thirds carrying food supplies. However, only 208 trucks of tents have entered, far below the needed amount, and no temporary housing units have been delivered to either the north or south of Gaza. Additionally, 197 fuel trucks have entered, but the Civil Defense, municipalities, and power companies have not benefited from them. In a separate incident, a Palestinian fisherman was martyred by fire from Israeli naval vessels off the coast of Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. 19-year-old Palestinian fisherman Saher al-Qaran was killed in an Israeli attack on a fishing boat in Gaza's Nuseirat Refugee Camp, violating the ceasefire His body was taken to Al-Awda Hospital, where grieving relatives gathered pic.twitter.com/F6C9tVuOUo — Anadolu English (@anadoluagency) January 31, 2025 The ceasefire, which began its first phase on January 19, stipulates that 600 trucks of humanitarian aid will enter Gaza daily, and Rafah will reopen seven days after the agreement’s implementation. The ceasefire and prisoner swap are set to unfold over three phases, each lasting 42 days.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2327547	2025-01-31T11:30:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-03224260017378138647.jpg
Ceasefire Monitoring Committee Adheres to Israeli Demands in Sout...	The five-member ceasefire monitoring committee is adhering to Israeli demands regarding inspection operations in south Lebanon Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar reported on Friday. Deputy US Middle East envoy Morgan Ortagus began her first visit to Lebanon yesterday with a meeting in the US Embassy with General Jasper Jeffers, head of the ceasefire supervision committee, Al-Akhbar’s Amal Khalil reported. However, the committee's meeting, which has been suspended for nearly two weeks, remains unscheduled. Moreover, no assurances have been provided to compel Israeli occupation forces (IOF) to withdraw by February 18 or halt their ongoing attacks. Ortagus, who openly expresses her allegiance to the Zionist entity, and is repeatedly seen donning a Star of David necklace, agreed with Jeffers to initiate 'an intensive work program' in coordination with the Lebanese Army, the report added. This initiative aims to inspect approximately 30 locations allegedly suspected of housing Hezbollah resistance facilities north of the Litani River, particularly in the Zahrani and the Bekaa region. Morgan Ortagus, Deputy US Middle East envoy (image from archive). The committee had previously informed the Lebanese Army command that it possessed intelligence regarding buildings, warehouses, valleys, and forests allegedly used by Hezbollah to store weapons and ammunition—claims that originate from the Zionist entity, according to the report. In this context, sources noted a significant increase in the presence of Israeli reconnaissance drones over several areas in recent days, ranging from the Bekaa to Beirut, Iqlim Al-Kharroub, Zahrani, and the South. Despite protests from Lebanese military officers regarding the committee’s pro-Israel bias and its failure to address the expanding occupation of border towns as well as the murder and kidnapping of residents, their objections have been ignored by both the US and French embassies. Instead, this stance has seemingly emboldened Israeli threats to extend its occupation further under the pretext that the Lebanese Army is 'incapable of enforcing the agreement and UN Resolution 1701,' Al-Akhbar reported. The US on the other hand seeks to use its influence to appoint officers in the Lebanese Army and security forces who align with its interpretation of the ceasefire agreement and have no ties to Hezbollah. The paper quoted sources as saying that Ortagus intends to pressure Lebanese authorities into approving military and security appointments favoring officers endorsed by the US and France. This move is meant to suppress the popular uprising that led to the partial liberation of several towns last Sunday (January 26), and facilitated the Lebanese Army’s deployment. However, despite commitments from the Supervisory Committee and UNIFIL to deploy Lebanese forces in Aitaroun, Blida, Houla, and Mays Al-Jabal earlier this week, these promises have not materialized. Meanwhile, the IOF has expanded its occupation of newly reclaimed areas after being forced out by local resistance last Sunday. Israeli forces continue to carry out systematic demolitions, bulldozing homes, setting fires, and resuming airstrikes, Al-Akhbar’s Khalil added.

The sources suggest, according to the Lebanese journalist, that these developments have led 'Israel' to tighten its grip in southern Lebanon due to growing discontent among settlers in the north. In this context, sources doubt that 'Israel' will adhere to the remaining 18-day deadline, warning that the five positions the Zionist entity initially declared it would retain may increase further. Yesterday, Israeli forces launched two interceptor missiles over the Khiam, claiming to have shot down a Hezbollah drone following sirens in Ghajar and Metula. However, sources believe this may have been a staged incident designed to portray Metula’s security as fragile, justifying Israeli continued occupation of Hamames, Awida, Azzieh, Khiam plain, Adaisseh, and Kfar Kila. Additionally, occupation forces continued targeting vehicles involved in clearing rubble from border villages in search of martyrs’ bodies, using gunfire and drone-dropped bombs to impede their work, the report concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2327437	2025-01-31T08:36:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-04232500017382448008.jpg
Hezbollah: Martyr Mohammad Deif Icon of Resistance	Hezbollah offered on Friday its deeped condolences on martyrdom of top commander of Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades and a number of other commanders during the battle of 'Al-Aqsa Flood' in Gaza. In a statement, Hezbollah’s Media Relations Office said: 'Hezbollah offers its deepest condolences and congratulations on the martyrdom of Al-Qassam Brigades’ Commander Mohammad Deif and a group of his senior comrades from the members of the Military Council.' 'We declare our pride in these honorable leaders who remained in the battlefield until their last moments.' Flags of Lebanon, Hezbollah and Palestine (image from archive). The statement praised commander Deis a senior leader who 'spent his life fighting the Israeli occupation which tasted bitter defeat in the battle of 'Al-Aqsa Flood'.' 'Martyr Deif will remain an icon for the free people who will continue the path of resistance,' Hezbollah stated. The Lebanese resistance group stressed, meanwhile that 'the blood of the martyred leaders along with all martyrs who fell in the battle of 'Al-Aqsa Flood' resulted in the victory which has forced the enemy to cease fire and release a number of Palestinian prisoners.' Earlier on Thursday, Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas Palestinian resistance group, declared martyrdom of commander Deif and other top commanders during the more than 15-month Israeli war on Gaza Strip.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2327393	2025-01-31T06:26:28-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/12/manar-06146220016710254503.jpg

'The Lebanese state, represented by the presidency, the government and the army, is required to take immediate action,' the Hezbollah lawmaker added.

In an interview with Al-Manar, MP Al-Moussawi categorized the performance of the Lebanese media outlets to three levels. The negligent media outlets, he said, referring to the performance of the state TV, which the lawmaker said broadcast cartoons on Sunday, when at least 22 people were martyred and more than 120 others were injured by Israeli attacks in south Lebanon. Lebanese southerners returning to their villages in south Lebanon (January 26, 2025). The second type of media outlets was those which 'lack national immunity', according to Al-Moussawi, who said that they covered Sunday’s event 'in a way that serves the enemy’s agenda by focusing on destruction and blaming the resistance over the tragedy that was a result of the Israeli aggression.' The Hezbollah lawmaker then talked about the third type of Lebanese media outlets, which were 'objective and adhered to the national identity and reflected the true image of the legendary steadfastness of people and resistance.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2327327	2025-01-31T05:53:53-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/12/manar-00559380016384313172.png
Thousands Rally at Egypt-Gaza Border to Reject Trump’s Displaceme...	Thousands of Egyptians from across the country have gathered at the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip to protest US President-elect Donald Trump's recent comments suggesting the forced displacement of Gaza's residents to Egypt and Jordan. آلاف المصريين يحتشدون أمام معبر رفح رفضًا لت هجير الفلسط ينيين من قطاع غز ة.#غرفة_الأخبار pic.twitter.com/GuuviN5L1h — Official_NewsRoom (@NewsDeskroom) January 31, 2025 The mass mobilization, described as the largest of its kind, is a direct response to Trump's controversial rhetoric. Activists have hailed the demonstration as a 'powerful rejection' of the displacement plan and a 'reaffirmation of Egypt's longstanding commitment to Palestinian rights.' Protesters, including political forces, parties, unions, and civil society groups, have condemned Trump's proposal as an 'act of injustice' that would effectively be a 'liquidation of the Palestinian cause.' They stressed that such a move would violate Palestinians' fundamental right to self-determination. Trending on social media was the hashtag #TrumpNoDisplacement, reflecting the public outcry and widespread rejection of the plan. For many Egyptians, the demonstration serves as a reminder of their country's central role in advocating for Palestinian sovereignty. The protests come amid reports that Trump has been pressuring Egypt and Jordan to take in forcibly displaced Palestinians, even hinting at potential aid cuts as leverage. However, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi firmly opposed the suggestion, calling it an 'act of injustice' that would endanger Egypt's security. 'If I asked the Egyptian people about Trump's suggestion, they would take to the streets to reject the displacement of Palestinians,' el-Sisi declared during a press conference. He reaffirmed Egypt's commitment to facilitating a resolution in Palestine based on a 'two-state solution,' a fundamental right that cannot be ignored. The mass mobilization at the Rafah crossing underscores the broader national unity in Egypt in condemning any plans to forcibly displace Palestinians. For the protesters, this demonstration is a powerful message of unwavering support for Gaza and its people.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2327294	2025-01-31T04:13:57-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-08630650017383256318.jpg

The Israeli enemy has been violating the ceasefire with Lebanon since it took effect on November 27, with the occupation army launching aerial and ground attacks targeting several areas across Lebanon, especially the southern region and Bekaa. The Israeli enemy was supposed to complete its army’s withdrawal from Lebanon by January 26 under the ceasefire. However, it refused to do so, prompting the Lebanese southerners to flock into southern border villages on that day and liberate a number of towns in epic confrontations that left at least 24 martyrs on Sunday and Monday (January 26-27).. The withdrawal deadline was then extended to February 18, a move that was announced by Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister, and categorically refused by Hezbollah, as declared by Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem during a televised speech on Monday (January 27).	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2327173	2025-01-31T02:50:35-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-03205880017383205405.jpg

For the 10th consecutive day, the Israeli occupation military has continued its relentless aggression and invasion of Jenin, a city and refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. The assault has included the bulldozing of civilian infrastructure, the burning and bombing of Palestinian homes, and fierce battles between the Israeli occupation forces and the Jenin Battalion of the Al-Quds Brigades, the military wing of the Islamic Jihad Movement.

Conversely, an Israeli soldier was killed and another injured in the clashes. The Israeli occupation military has further tightened its grip on the West Bank, imposing additional restrictions and launching air strikes on Palestinian camps and towns. The Palestinian Ministry of Health confirmed the martyrdom of two citizens, Yazan Hatem al-Hassan from Jenin camp and Amir Ahmed Abu al-Hassan from al-Yamoun, during the Thursday evening violence. Meanwhile, the Israeli media reported that its 'Yamam' unit had assassinated Qassem al-Aklik, a wanted individual, in Nablus, while an Israeli army force was ambushed by the resistance inside Jenin camp. The ongoing Israeli military aggression has also seen the continued destruction of infrastructure and the bombing of homes in Tulkarm and Jenin, as well as a tightening of the siege on the governorates of Qalqilya, Nablus, and Tubas, following a recent massacre in the town of Tamoun that claimed the lives of 10 Palestinians. In response, the Islamic and national forces in Tubas have announced a comprehensive strike mourning the souls of the Tamoun martyrs.

Israeli Occupation Forces Continue Border Violations in Southern ...	The Israeli occupation forces continue violating the ceasefire agreement along the southern Lebanese border, subjecting several towns to ongoing shelling, bulldozing, and systematic destruction of property. According to Al-Manar correspondent, Israeli occupation forces are continuing bulldozing operations in the Al-Mfailah neighborhood of Mays Al-Jabal, near a newly established Lebanese Army position. Meanwhile, Israeli artillery shelled the Shaab Al-Qalb area on the outskirts of Shebaa, launching two shells into the region. Photos show the aftermath of a bulldozing operation carried out by Israeli occupation forces, located 100 meters from the Lebanese Army position at the entrance to the Al-Mufailah neighborhood in Mays Al-Jabal (Jan 30, 2025) Additionally, Zionist forces destroyed several shops and vehicles in the town of Baraj Al-Muluk. They also set fire to a poultry farm and an egg collection facility in the Tal Al-Nahas area, as well as a palace on the outskirts of Talousa. The correspondent further reported that an Israeli occupation drone dropped a bomb near a school in Talousa while a family was inspecting their home. Another Israeli drone dropped a bomb near a motorcycle at the edge of Talousa, injuring two civilians with minor wounds. An interception missile explosion was also recorded above Burj Al-Muluk, in the Marjayoun region. Additionally, Israeli forces continued bulldozing operations in the border town of Al-Dahira. Israeli occupation forces also carried out sweeping operations from their positions in the towns of Jardah and Birkat Risha, advancing toward Lebanese territory. Lebanese Army Operations On the Lebanese side, the Lebanese Army Command announced that specialized units will conduct explosive ordnance disposal operations in the Al-Khiyam area and the Al-Qulay'ah field in Marjayoun between 11:30 AM and 5:00 PM. For the fifth consecutive day, southern Lebanese residents continue their efforts to return to their villages and towns still occupied by Israeli forces, despite the expiration of the 60-day withdrawal deadline under the ceasefire agreement, which went into effect on November 27, 2024. Israeli occupation forces remain stationed in several border regions, directly violating the ceasefire agreement.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2326678	2025-01-30T05:50:43-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-04639670017382449233.jpg
Exclusive | Brigadier Jouni to Al-Manar Website: Lebanese Pressur...	The contours of a US attempt to pass a 'legislative' measure allowing the Israeli occupation forces to remain in Lebanon for an extended period are becoming clearer. The goal is to solidify the Israeli enemy's presence in five border points for an indefinite period. According to media sources, US efforts began approximately ten days ago, with reports emerging that the Israeli enemy intends to request an extension of the 60-day withdrawal deadline, citing 'logistical considerations' related to the situation south of the Litani River. Israeli Strategy in Southern Lebanon: Military Presence as a Political Tool Retired Brigadier General Dr. Hasan Jouni confirmed that the Israel enemy's insistence on holding onto the heights in southern Lebanon, which it still occupies, is not necessarily about the strategic value of these areas themselves. Instead, it is part of a broader strategy aimed at maintaining a permanent military presence in the region. In an exclusive statement to Al-Manar Website, Dr. Jouni explained that the primary goal of this military presence is political. 'The Israeli enemy seeks to pressure the Lebanese state to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701 in a way that guarantees its security and military superiority in the region,' he said. He added that 'Israel' is considering normalization and possibly signing a treaty with Lebanon before its eventual withdrawal. Jouni pointed out that with the strategic shifts in the region following US President Donald Trump’s administration, the Israeli enemy's goals have expanded beyond security, seeking broader political objectives amid ongoing regional tensions. Israeli Hold on Border Heights: Strategic or Symbolic? Regarding the Israeli enemy's persistent presence in the border heights, Brigadier Jouni emphasized that these areas do not hold significant strategic value on their own. However, he noted that 'Israel' might focus on retaining nearby villages, such as Addaisseh and Kfar Kila, as part of its broader efforts to impose military and political dominance in the area. Lebanese Resistance Forces Pressure IOF to Withdraw Jouni also highlighted the key role of local movements in the south, which have seen a strong surge of residents pushing towards their villages and the border. This public momentum, coupled with support from the Lebanese Army, forced the Israeli occupation forces to withdraw from more than 12 Lebanese villages. Video shows the residents of the border town of Yaroun forcefully enter, undeterred by Israeli occupation forces 'This popular surge, backed by the Lebanese military, forced Israel to rethink its strategy. The Israeli enemy was left with two options: either commit atrocities against civilians or pull out of some villages it deemed unnecessary for its occupation,' Jouni explained. Uncertainty in Lebanese Official Position Brigadier Dr. Jouni further noted that there remains ambiguity in Lebanon's official stance, particularly after statements from the Lebanese government calling for an extension of the ceasefire until February 18. He also pointed out that Hezbollah's Secretary-General, Sheikh Naim Qassem, rejected the extension of the ceasefire agreement, arguing that there was no justification for the Israeli enemy's continued occupation. Meanwhile, for the fourth consecutive day, southern Lebanese residents are attempting to return to their villages and towns still occupied by Israeli forces, despite the expiration of the 60-day deadline for withdrawal under the ceasefire agreement, which came into effect on November 27, 2024. While Israeli forces continue to occupy certain border regions in southern Lebanon, this represents a clear violation of the ceasefire agreement.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2326590	2025-01-30T05:34:00-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-04021130017378820763.jpg
Al-Qassam Brigades Release Israeli Captive Soldier in Jabalia Cam...	In a display of resilience and military might, the Al-Qassam Brigades (the armed wing of Hamas) and the Al-Quds Brigades (the military branch of Islamic Jihad) carried out a prisoner exchange in the Gaza Strip on Thursday. The exchange saw the release of a female Israeli prisoner, Agam Berger, from the rubble of the devastated Jabalia refugee camp, as well as two other Israeli prisoners, Arbel Yehud and Gadi Moses, who were handed over in Khan Yunis. مشاهد إضافية من عملية تسليم المجندة الإسرائيلية المحتجزة آغام بيرغر، في مخيم جباليا شمالي قطاع غزة. pic.twitter.com/sYj5iouqlp — Sputnik Arabic (@sputnik_ar) January 30, 2025 The Israeli Channel 13 reported that Tel Aviv was officially notified that the two prisoners, Gadi Moses and Arbel Yehud, will be released from Gaza before 12 noon local time. The Broadcasting Authority reported that the two prisoners, Yehud and Moses, are expected to be handed over from in front of the destroyed house of the head of the Hamas movement in Gaza, the martyr leader Yahya Sinwar, in Khan Yunis in the southern besieged Palestinian Strip. Meanwhile, the Israeli Broadcasting Authority explained that the release of Israeli and foreign prisoners will take place in 3 batches, and that those released will be transferred to a reception site in Ra'im in the Gaza envelope, where they will meet their families there before being transferred to 4 hospitals. The enemy's media confirmed that a military helicopter landed in Ra'im in the Gaza envelope in preparation for the prisoner exchange operation, without it being clear yet where the foreign prisoners will be handed over. The prisoner swap, which was the third such exchange under the recent ceasefire agreement, was marked by a powerful show of the Palestinian resistance's capabilities. The Qassam Brigades released Berger from Al-Razan Square in Jabalia, a site that witnessed heavy Israeli bombardment and destruction during the latest military offensive aimed at displacing the local population. The prisoner exchange held significant symbolic value for the Palestinian people, with the resistance choosing to conduct the handover in the heavily devastated Jabalia camp, a powerful message of defiance against the Israeli occupation. Banners and slogans celebrating the resistance's victories over elite Israeli military units, such as the Givati and Kfir brigades, were prominently displayed during the event.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2326370	2025-01-30T01:17:03-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-01778430017382286154.jpg

President Joseph Aoun Vows to Implement Inaugural Address, Calls ...	President of the Republic, Joseph Aoun, on Wednesday reaffirmed his commitment to implementing the vision outlined in his inaugural address, emphasizing that 'what the Lebanese people need is to live with dignity.' President Aoun called for an end to political bickering and sectarian power struggles, asserting that 'all ministries belong to Lebanon, as does the Cabinet.' He also stressed that sectarian representation in government should come through independent, competent elites rather than partisan affiliations. Aoun’s remarks came during his meeting at Baabda Palace with Rev. Joe Kassab, President of the Supreme Council of the Evangelical Community, who was accompanied by a delegation. Kassab expressed confidence that Lebanon was entering a new phase in its history, recalling the Evangelical community’s role in the nation’s foundation, including its representation in the first Lebanese parliament in 1920. He praised Aoun’s leadership, likening his vision for the country to his past efforts in the Lebanese Armed Forces. President Aoun also met with World Bank Regional Vice President for the Middle East and North Africa, Ousmane Dione, with whom he discussed ongoing financial and developmental assistance to Lebanon. The President assured Dione that Lebanon was committed to necessary reforms and that the new government’s priority was to draft and implement legislation addressing economic and administrative restructuring. Dione reiterated the World Bank’s support for Lebanon and revealed that the institution has allocated $736 million in long-term loans, pending parliamentary approval. He also highlighted plans for a rapid damage assessment and emergency aid to support Lebanon’s post-war reconstruction efforts. Separately, Indian Ambassador to Lebanon, Mohamed Noor Rahman Sheikh, conveyed a message from Indian President Droupadi Murmu, congratulating Aoun on his election and expressing optimism for strengthened Indo-Lebanese relations. The Indian President commended Aoun’s leadership and expressed hope for Lebanon’s stability and institutional development under his presidency.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2325974	2025-01-29T09:20:47-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-06379990017381710827.jpeg
Israeli Aggression Fails to Break Lebanese Resolve, Southern Vill...	On the fourth day of the heroic popular movement, aimed at liberating southern border villages from occupation, the Israeli enemy sought to retaliate against the fierce stand of the southern Lebanese people, undeterred by tanks or treacherous gunfire. In a blatant violation of the ceasefire, Israeli enemy warplanes launched an aggressive attack on Nabatieh Al-Fawqa late Tuesday night, targeting areas north of the Litani River. Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar reported that this Zionist action, backed by the United States, aims to expand the geographical scope of Resolution 1701 in defiance of Lebanon’s stance, despite the firm rejection by the resistance. This escalation can also be viewed as an attempt by the enemy to alter the victorious narrative that the Lebanese have created, attempting to impose a contrasting image. Meanwhile, the Israeli enemy continues to violate the ceasefire agreement and refuses to withdraw from southern villages, even after the 60-day ceasefire expired. This highlights its insistence on extending the ceasefire until February 18, a demand that was conveyed to the Lebanese government through its American ally. However, the Lebanese people and resistance forces remain resolute, ready to confront these actions head-on. Protests and Clashes in Kfarkila and Other Southern Areas Residents of Kfarkila set up on Wednesday a tent on the road to Khardali, at the intersection of Deir Mimas and Qleiaa, near the Morkos station, declaring their intention to remain there until the Israeli occupation forces withdraw from their town. Meanwhile, reports emerged of two civilians injured after an Israeli enemy drone dropped sound bombs on a gathering of citizens at the Shaqra-Majdal Selem-Houla triangle. Al-Manar correspondent confirmed that the Israeli occupation army released three prisoners but kept one in custody after detaining them earlier in the day in the border town of Maroun Al-Ras. Two others were also injured while attempting to advance into the town. In another incident, a Zionist drone dropped a bomb on a vehicle clearing remnants of the occupation from the obstacles and barricades in the Wadi Al-Slouqi area, injuring four civilians. Video shows a Merkava tank chasing Lebanese civilians on the Ramia-Marwahin road in southern Lebanon Israeli Troops Advance Towards Lebanese Positions According to Al-Manar correspondent, Israeli enemy forces retreated behind earthen barriers in the Al-Mfailah area, west of the village of Mays Al-Jabal. Prior to that, Zionist troops had advanced to within 100 meters of a Lebanese army position in the town, bypassing a UNIFIL center while accompanied by a Merkava tank firing at the surrounding area.

In remarks carried by the local media, the Hezbollah lawmaker stressed that the right of resistance against the Israeli enemy is legitimate and sacred, calling for an action against the repeated Israeli attacks on Lebanon.

What follows is the text of the message: Peace be upon your minds, hearts, souls, blood and wounds. Greetings to your feet, which sanctify the earth wherever they tread, cleansing it from the filth of criminals and the small and large beasts. Your enemy has tested the weapon of your resistance on the battlefield, and yesterday it faced the weapon of your will and determination, understanding its essence and nature. This weapon is known only to Allah, the deeply knowledgeable, and the faithful believers. You, the men, women, and children, are the most honorable and purest of people. Among you, there are no cowards, no submissive, no surrendering souls. You are the elite, the crown of heads. Pride belongs to those who are associated with you. And to the enemy, I say: Have you now realized that your crimes have brought you no victory? That your weapons and bombs have only written for you a history of defeats? That the blood of the martyrs you killed has transformed into faith, courage, willpower, and strength rarely matched in this world? It will inspire and guide the peoples of the world and become a place of pilgrimage. The time will come when your structures in the region crumble, and the peoples of the world will emulate the greatness of this nation in Lebanon, from its south to every corner of the earth. As for Palestine, the scene, the image, the people, the blood, the victory, the dignity, and the honor are unified. Finally, I say to all our brothers and sisters in the homeland: This is a rare and historic opportunity for unity. Let us, for once, cast aside the hatred, conflicts, and disputes fabricated for the interests of our enemies. Let us establish and impose our sovereignty on both foes and friends. Let us prove to the world that we are not a people for rent or exploitation, but a people deserving of life with merit, dignity, and honor.

Ayatollah Khamenei: US is leading evil powers that have eye on resources of nations Follow Press TV on Telegram: pic.twitter.com/beYgHGvCUh — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) January 28, 2025 'The US embodies the very essence of colonialism,' Khamenei declared, warning that these 'bullying and evil powers' are eyeing the natural resources, culture, and identity of oppressed nations. 'They are intent on plundering our lands,' he continued, referencing the pervasive influence of financial cartels in shaping Western policies. The Leader highlighted the role of resistance movements, noting how the spirit of defiance that began in Iran has emboldened many across the Muslim world and even resonated with non-Muslims. He commended the recent developments in Gaza, where, despite being heavily armed and supported by the US, the Israeli regime has faced significant setbacks. Elsewhere in his remarks, the Leader said friends and foes thought that the martyrdom of the Hezbollah leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, had eliminated Lebanon's resistance movement. However, he added, 'Hezbollah showed that not only was it not terminated, but it was further inspired to stand up to the Zionist regime.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2324742	2025-01-28T03:13:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-03684290017380627987.jpg
Deadly Israeli Aggression on Jenin Leaves 16 martyred, Hundreds I...	The Israeli occupation military has been engaged in an aggressive 8-day assault on the city of Jenin and its refugee camp, leaving a devastating toll. According to reports, the onslaught has claimed the lives of 16 Palestinians, with dozens more injured. Approximately 100 homes have been destroyed or burned down within the camp. The city of Jenin and its refugee camp have been under a major Israeli military offensive for the past 8 days. The assault primarily targets the camp, where the Israeli army is systematically demolishing homes and forcing residents to leave in order to facilitate future raids. pic.twitter.com/VY1zvKs4MX — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) January 28, 2025 Yesterday, the occupation forces notified the family of martyr Nidal Al-Amer that their multi-story home in the Jenin camp will be demolished. The military is also working to divide the camp into four separate sections by destroying streets and blowing up homes.

They detained a group of people, and a child was injured by gunfire near the Cinema Roundabout during violent clashes. Occupation Troops have also set up positions on Nazareth Street, the industrial area, and several roundabouts, interrogating and detaining more Palestinians. Arrests have been reported across the camp and city. The Israeli occupation army continues to send military reinforcements, including bulldozers, into Jenin, with vehicles stationed outside the Jenin Governmental Hospital. Warplanes and drones have also been spotted flying over the city and refugee camp.

Zionist Captive Arbel Yehud Urges Netanyahu, Trump to Ensure Retu...	Al-Quds Brigades published on Monday a video which shows the Zionist captive Arbel Yehud asking the enemy's premier Netanyahu and the US President Donald Trump to ensure the continuation of the ceasefire as planned so that all the captives can return to 'their homes' safely and the Palestinian captives can be freed and return to their homes safely. Yehud, who appears fine, said that served in the Zionist army from October 2013 to October 2015. The Israeli enemy demanded that the Palestinian resistance release Yehud in the latest exchange operation; however, the mediators said that she would be released before Friday, while Gazans were allowed to return to the north of the Strip.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2324368	2025-01-27T14:13:02-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-05794320017380159348.jpg
Islamic Resistance Fighters Salute Noble Returnees to South Leban...	The Islamic Resistance issued on Monday a statement that hailed the popular return to South Lebanon villages which consecrated Lebanon's steadfastness and victory in face of the Zionist enemy. What follows is the text of the statement: O our people&#8230; O the noblest of Allah's creation, the most honorable of people; today, the will of determination in you has risen, and the will of the enemy has been broken. You have crossed, despite the cowardice of their soldiers, towards your villages, where the enemy's objectives shattered at their walls, and their tanks burned by the hands of your sons, the fighters of the Islamic Resistance. The bodies of the martyrs, planted in the soil, today feel the sound of your footsteps, and their pure souls hover around the banner that has not been broken, the banner under which you march towards victory, a victory that you truly deserve, just as you have always been worthy of all victories. O our people and our families&#8230; Your crossing yesterday and today, seen by our vigilant eyes, was that of confident conquerors. And here we bow our heads, extending the salute of arms, fight, and resistance to every mother, father, brother, sister, elder, and child, in the name of every fighter among us and in the name of the souls of the martyrs who irrigated the soil of the homeland with their blood. Peace be upon you, your patience, your loyalty, your victory, and Allah's blessings upon you. All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds. Raising Hezbollah flags, Lebanese southerners on Sunday defied Israeli threats and return to their villages as the 60-day deadline set by the ceasefire agreement for the Israeli enemy to withdraw from southern Lebanon expired at dawn. Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem highlighted on Monday that Lebanon is facing an occupier who is aggressing and refusing to withdraw, stressing that the resistance has the right to act, as it sees fit, regarding the form, nature, and timing of the confrontation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2324335	2025-01-27T13:03:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-01998700017380117833.jpg
Sheikh Qassem: Hezbollah Will Set Proper Form and Timing of Confr...	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem highlighted on Monday that Lebanon is facing an occupier who is aggressing and refusing to withdraw, stressing that the resistance has the right to act, as it sees fit, regarding the form, nature, and timing of the confrontation. In a televised speech, Sheikh Qassem affirmed that the continued occupation is an aggression against Lebanese sovereignty, and everyone is responsible for confronting this occupation: the people, the army, the state, the resistance, and the various political forces. Sheikh Qassem held the United Nations, the United States, France, and 'Israel' responsible for the consequences of the delaying the withdrawal. ''Israel' must withdraw after 60 days, and we do not accept any excuse for extending even one day, nor do we accept an extension of the deadline. President Joseph Aoun cannot give 'Israel' a single gain, and no one in Lebanon will accept extending the aggression against Lebanon with the enemy.' The Zionist occupation cannot remain in Lebanon with such proud people who may never be defeated, his eminence added. Sheikh Qassem pointed out that the tripartite army-people- resistance equation, which prevented 'Israel' from reaching Beirut and the south of the Litani River, is as clear as the sun adding that the problem lies with those who cannot see it. Those who possess dignity stand and march towards the frontline positions, undeterred by their policies and American support for them, Sheikh Qassem maintained. 'The scene of return on November 27 at 4:00 am to the South, Dahiya [Beirut’s southern suburb], and Bekaa was a victory scene. Celebrations of triumph spread across all regions as the resistance fighters remained steadfast in the field with their heads held high, firm and strong.' We achieved victory because we returned, and the occupier will be forced to leave and withdraw,' his eminence affirmed, 'The resistance fighters never left the battlefield, and the resistance remains steadfast and strong.' The American sponsor of the agreement is the same one who sponsors the 'Israeli' aggression and failed to play his role, yet we decided not to give any pretext, Sheikh Qassem said. The breach of the agreement proves Lebanon's need for the resistance, Hezbollah leader affirmed. 'We were subjected to a counter-campaign, part of which was internal, aimed at portraying us as defeated. Some may have had a heart attack because their dreams of defeating the resistance did not come true.' The resistance emerged victorious clearly and obviously, Sheikh Qassem underlined. Hezbollah Secretary General confirmed that the resistance emerged victorious with this people who surged towards the frontline villages even before the Israeli withdrawal and amid the Zionist aggression as well as violations. The popular return challenged the Israeli live bullets, and the returnees relied on their religious belief, personal dignity and national honor to confront the enemy attacks, his eminence said. Sheikh Qassem noted that the aggressor requested a ceasefire under conditions, and Hezbollah agreed because it neither initiated the war nor sought it. 'We accepted the ceasefire agreement as the state took the decision to defend the borders and remove 'Israel'.This is an opportunity for the state to fulfill its duties and test its political capabilities.' We remained committed and chose patience, refraining from responding to 'Israeli' violations despite feelings of humiliation over the retaliatory actions, Sheikh Qassem said. Israeli enemy violated the ceasefire 1350 times, Sheikh Qassem highlighted, adding that Hezbollah abstained from responding in order not to give the enemy and the pact sponsors to blame the resistance. Hezbollah Secretary General pointed out that the aggression against Lebanon, as with Gaza, was an unrestrained act of hostility backed by the U.S. and the West. 'The U.S. and 'Israel' sought to eliminate the resistance, deploying five divisions comprising 75,000 soldiers and officers, with excessive brutality, to achieve this goal,' his eminence added, 'The resistance, in all its forms, stood firm with legendary resolve and martyrdom-driven determination.' 'The world witnessed the heroes of the resistance. Our people bore significant sacrifices, showcasing resilience. The resistance emerged united and strong, regaining control within ten days, fueled by the spirit instilled by the Master of the Martyrs of the Nation, His Eminence Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah.' Sheikh Qassem affirmed that the resistance operations escalated, and the 'Israeli' forces advanced only a few hundred meters on the frontlines, hindered by the steadfastness of the fighters, adding that, meanwhile, the displaced supported the resistance with their cohesion, and the diverse Lebanese population remained loyal in their solidarity. Hezbollah Chief baldly said that the resistance supporters were shocked by the massive blow and the losses inflicted by the enemy during the war because of the successive military victories of the resistance in 2000 (Liberation), 2006 (July's War) and 2017 (Second Liberation). The resistance supporters thought that the resistance weapons, missiles, drones and information capabilities will certainly lead to victory, his eminence added. 'The balance of deterrence Hezbollah maintained over 17 years against the enemy has led people to believe in the sustainability of our military strength. Our supporters did not expect us to lose this number of leaders in such a short period and across this wide spread.' Sheikh Qassem explained that the enemy's informational dominance, control over communications, artificial intelligence, and airforce were critical factors in the strikes directed at the resistance. Hezbollah is conducting an investigation into this significant exposure, his eminence underscored. Sheikh Qassem asserted that the resistance remains strong in its decisions, willpower, and believers, and it is even stronger with its continuity. On the Lebanese politics, Shekh Qassem said that the National Duo [Hezbollah and Amal Movement] achieved the consensual presidential choice through the election of President Joseph Aoun, adding that. without the participation of the National Duo, the president would not have been elected in such a way that expresses national unity, which is a strength for the national duo. 'We acted wisely because we want sustain the country and government and cooperated with the designated Prime Minister Nawaf Salam; the complexities of forming the government are not with us.' The matters between us, the designated Prime Minister, and the President are clear, with no obstacles. Hezbollah Chief also hailed the victory in Gaza as a triumph for the Palestinian people, the region's supportive nations, and all the free people worldwide who endorsed and backed the cause. 'The goal of Al-Aqsa Flood was achieved, and Israel's project to destroy the resistance and Hamas was defeated,' hsi eminence said. 'We extend gratitude to dear Yemen for its sacrifices, to Iraq for its people, religious authority, and Al-Hashd Al-Shaabi, and to Lebanon, which gave the Master of the Martyrs of the Nation, His Eminence Sayyed Nasrallah.' Sheikh Qassem started his speech by indicating that the treacherous culprits in the assassination of Sheikh Mohammad Hammadi, Hezbollah leader in Western Bekaa, remain under investigation, but that suspicion points towards the Zionists.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2324280	2025-01-27T11:07:41-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-02780950017380048536.jpg
Southern Lebanese Defy Israeli Occupation, Continue Return to Lib...	For the second consecutive day, the resilient people of southern Lebanon return to their border villages, demonstrating defiance against the Israeli occupation and external dictates. Their steadfast resolve comes despite the Israeli enemy’s declaration, following the expiration of the 60-day truce, that it would not withdraw. The United States has reportedly attempted to prolong the ceasefire until February 18, seeking to circumvent Resolution 1701 and the ceasefire agreement. This scene conveys a powerful message that the people themselves are the resistance. Any attempt by the Israeli occupation to 'eradicate the resistance' would require targeting an entire nation—a reality the Israeli enemy is beginning to grasp. David Azoulay, head of the council for the destroyed settlement of Metula, acknowledged this, criticizing the agreement with Lebanon as a 'surrender deal,' stating, 'Netanyahu signed an agreement of capitulation to Hezbollah, which is now returning.' Determined Advances Following Sunday's fierce resistance, the Lebanese Ministry of Health announced today that 24 people were martyred and 134 others were injured in Israeli enemy attacks on southern Lebanon. Despite this brutality, the spirit of liberation continues to shine as people pursue their journey. On Monday morning, citizens entered the village of Houla following the deployment of the Lebanese army in several neighborhoods. In Ayta Al-Shaab, the Lebanese army, alongside returning villagers, advanced to reclaim the area from occupation forces. Similarly, the army led convoys of returning families to Mays Al-Jabal, where Israeli forces are expected to withdraw despite ongoing gunfire. From the western neighborhoods of Mays Al-Jabal, Al-Manar reporter Ali Shoaib described the gathering crowds, led by the army, preparing to reclaim the village's center as Israeli occupation forces retreat. Mobilizing from Universities to Southern Villages Lebanese students also joined the movement, with gatherings reported at the entrance to the Lebanese University campus in Hadat. Groups mobilized to head toward southern villages, with a parallel rally at Hezbollah’s Educational Mobilization Center in Sfeir. Yaroun and Marwahin: A Bold Return Amid Challenges The Lebanese Army and residents of Yaroun reached the town square despite the ongoing presence of Israeli forces. Meanwhile, residents of Marwahin made their way back home on foot, passing through the Um Al-Tout area. In Maroun al-Ras and Yaroun, residents displayed remarkable resilience, standing firm against Israeli forces hiding behind tanks, creating a powerful image of defiance and solidarity. In Markaba, large crowds gathered at the entrance to the town near Bani Hayyan, waiting to enter alongside the Lebanese Army. The influx of residents into villages in the western sector, including Al-Naqoura, continues to underline the widespread support for the liberation efforts. Israeli Drone Attacks in Bani Hayyan Amid the liberation efforts, Israeli enemy drones targeted a municipal team in Bani Hayyan while they worked on opening and paving roads at the town’s entrance. A bomb was dropped near the team, which narrowly escaped unharmed. Another bomb was dropped near the town’s cultural center, causing no injuries. However, Lebanon’s Ministry of Health confirmed two injuries in the area, one in critical condition, following Israeli attacks on civilians. The unified determination of the Lebanese people, supported by the army and resistance forces, underscores their resolve to reclaim their land and protect their sovereignty despite continuous aggression.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2323774	2025-01-27T04:40:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-02153900017379813207.jpg
Iranian Parliament Speaker: Hamas Is Still Alive and Humiliating ...	In a powerful address to the Iranian Parliament, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, the speaker of the Parliament, commended Hamas and the Palestinian resistance forces for their resounding victory against the Zionist regime. He emphasized the failure of Israel's cognitive war and their futile attempts to deceive the world by suggesting that they had overcome resistance in Palestine and Lebanon. Qalibaf declared that Hamas is not only alive but thriving, and the resilience of the resistance is stronger than ever, causing humiliation for the enemy. He emphasized that Palestine's endurance in the face of over 15 months of Israeli genocidal crimes will only be complete when the Zionists fully withdraw from the Gaza Strip and the displaced Palestinians can return to their homes. The speaker's remarks echoed the sentiments expressed by Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, after the martyrdom of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in combat with Zionist forces in October 2024. Khamenei affirmed that Hamas, the symbol of Palestinian resistance, remains alive and will continue to thrive. This unified stance from Iranian leadership serves as a powerful message of solidarity and support for the Palestinian cause. It reinforces the determination of the resistance forces and sends a clear message to ‘Israel’ that their aggression will not go unchallenged. The world watches as Hamas and the Palestinian people stand firm, refusing to be silenced or defeated.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2323785	2025-01-27T04:27:28-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/01/manar-01793550016744851686.jpg

Hezbollah’s MP Mohammad Raad Calls for National Unity, Reaffirms ...	In a passionate statement, Head of the Loyalty to the Resistance Bloc, MP Mohammad Raad, called on the Lebanese people to stand united and celebrate their steadfastness and resistance. MP Raad hailed the return of southern Lebanese residents to their villages, acknowledging the resilience of the people who have remained unwavering in their commitment to the land despite the brutal occupation. The statement highlighted the powerful symbolism of the returning residents, carrying the images of martyrs and resistance flags as a testament to their unyielding spirit. Hezbollah's MP Raad emphasized the importance of the 'Army-People-Resistance' equation, describing it as the true foundation of Lebanon’s sovereignty and security. The group reiterated that the resistance, in partnership with the Lebanese army and people, remains the only effective way to defend the nation and its territory against ongoing Israeli occupation and aggression. The statement also condemned Israeli violations and called on the international community to ensure Israel's full withdrawal from southern Lebanon, respecting the will of the people and the principles of international law. Hezbollah affirmed its commitment to liberating the land and safeguarding Lebanon’s dignity and sovereignty. As MP Raad honored the martyrs and the sacrifices made by the people of Lebanon, he reminded all that this ongoing struggle is not only about protecting Lebanon but also defending the entire region from the looming threat of Israeli occupation. The statement concluded with a call to continue the fight for freedom and justice with unwavering resolve until complete liberation is achieved.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2323312	2025-01-26T11:18:17-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2016/08/manar-08251680014726505203.jpg
Hezbollah Hails ‘Glorious Day of God,’ Reiterates People, Resista...	Hezbollah described Sunday, January 26, 2025, as a 'Glorious Day of God' and a 'majestic scene of honor and dignity crafted by the people of resistance.' In a statement issued Sunday evening, the group praised the resilience of the Lebanese people, highlighting their deep connection to their land, their unwavering attachment to every grain of its soil, and their steadfast role as guardians of national sovereignty, standing resolutely against all threats and aggression. 'Since 2000, this scene has repeated itself. Through their heroic resistance, our people continue to drive out the enemy, reaffirming once again that there is no place for an occupier in this blessed land, watered by the blood of martyrs,' the statement added. Lebanese citizens return to their border towns as the deadline for Israeli withdrawal expires (January 26, 2025). Hezbollah further highlighted the powerful symbolism of returning residents, carrying images of martyrs and resistance flags, as a testament to perseverance, steadfastness, and victory. 'This unyielding will and indomitable spirit form the strongest weapon of the resistance,' the statement noted. It also recalled the words of the late sacred martyr, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, who described this strength as an 'unbeatable point of power.' The group reiterated that the resistance remains loyal to the sacrifices of its martyrs and that no force, no matter how mighty, can withstand the blessed popular wave seeking liberation and the ultimate defeat of the occupier. Hezbollah also underscored the enduring value of the 'Army-People-Resistance' equation, describing it as a tangible reality rather than a mere slogan. This unity, it said, shields Lebanon from the treachery of its enemies and is embodied daily through the sacrifices of its people. The statement called on all Lebanese to stand united with their southern compatriots, reaffirming the values of national solidarity and striving together for true sovereignty defined by liberation and victory. Hezbollah urged the international community, especially the nations sponsoring recent agreements, to hold Israel accountable for its violations and crimes and to ensure its full withdrawal from Lebanese territories.

Israeli Circles Worried about Return of Lebanese Southerners: How...	The Israeli circles followed up the consequences of the popular return to South Lebanon, specifically the border towns, where the Israeli enemy insisted on keeping its occupation despite the end of the withdrawal deadline in accordance with the ceasefire agreement. Despite the Israeli threats and the ongoing occupation in some villages, which constitutes a violation of the terms of the agreement, the scene remains a clear source of concern to the Zionist analysts. Israeli News 24’s correspondent in the north, Oreh Keshet, commented: 'The scenes coming from Lebanon worry the northern settlers and reinforce their fears of the return of Hezbollah fighters, which poses a challenge to our security capabilities and exposes the IDF forces to danger.' He added, 'The Lebanese tried to cross the earthen berms and army checkpoints, chanting slogans praising (Sayyed) Nasrallah, in an attempt to challenge the forces present there.' For his part, the correspondent of the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper in the north, Yair Kraus, said: 'After 15 months of fighting, these are the scenes that the residents of the north are afraid of &#8230; The people of southern Lebanon are returning to the border area, raising Hezbollah flags.' The two Zionist websites of Walla and Hadashot Bezman underlined the scene of the Lebanese returnees approaching the Israeli soldiers and vehicles, indicating that saying 'Israel' will lose the chance of achieving a complete victory when it withdraws from southern Lebanon. Haaretz newspaper reported that reservists criticized the Army decision to stay in South Lebanon without any justification amid questions about the timing of the return of the settlers to the North. 'In southern Lebanon, they are returning to the villages, but the question is: How will the Israelis return to the north?' Raising Hezbollah flags, Lebanese southerners on Sunday defied Israeli threats and return to their villages as the 60-day deadline set by the ceasefire agreement for the Israeli enemy to withdraw from southern Lebanon expired at dawn.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2322894	2025-01-26T07:52:01-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-07374390017379066942.jpg
Explainer on Deadline of Israeli Withdrawal from Lebanon: Repercu...	The Zionist enemy exploited the 60-day deadline granted for a full withdrawal from the territories it occupied during its last belligerent invasion of Lebanon to commit breaches and attacks that blatantly violated the terms of the truce. The enemy intensified its crimes, including bulldozing roads, destroying civilian infrastructure, burning homes, and demolishing mosques and buildings across southern Lebanon. Targeting Hezbollah’s infrastructure was merely a pretext used by the Israeli enemy to justify its aggression. Member of Hezbollah’s Loyalty to Resistance bloc MP Ali Fayyad confirmed this to Al-Manar website, stating that the situation in the border area extends beyond merely targeting infrastructure. The Zionist Enemy Turns the South into a Disaster Zone Fayyad elaborated: 'The enemy seeks to turn the border area into a disaster zone, burned and uninhabitable. What is the connection between the Wazzani orchards—a modern agricultural area spanning 10,000 dunams, featuring almond orchards, grapevines, and vegetables—and the pretexts claimed by the Israelis? Why are they completely destroying them?' He continued, 'The looting and theft taking place are systematic and ongoing. What connection exists between these brutal practices and the Israeli claims about military infrastructure? These actions aim to render the area uninhabitable, complicating its reconstruction and revival for many years to come.' Israeli breaches in south Lebanon (January 2025). How Did Hezbollah Deal with the Violations? MP Fayyad reiterated Hezbollah’s commitment to the Lebanese government’s directives concerning the area south of the Litani River, emphasizing: 'We have adhered from the start to the Lebanese government’s directions and respected its commitments toward the area south of the river.' However, Fayyad criticized the government’s response, describing it as weak and insufficient, and said it has failed to utilize all available tools to deter Israeli attacks. He added, 'Formal objections and limited political contacts are not enough. We need an international campaign where the Lebanese government employs every tool at its disposal to stop and deter Israeli aggression'. 'Furthermore, the government’s stance must be clear and resolute. There can be no compromise, we will not accept the Zionist enemy remaining in our land, not even a single day beyond the sixty-day deadline. The government must declare its categorical rejection of this situation and adopt a firm policy to safeguard Lebanon's rights and sovereignty'. Repercussions of Israeli Violations Ali Haidar, an expert in Israeli affairs, explained to Al-Manar that the Israeli enemy’s reversal of its commitments under the agreement was unsurprising, as it began violating the terms from the very outset. He noted that the Israeli pretexts concerning security in certain geographical areas could be addressed through alternative measures without resorting to these violations. Haidar suggested the possibility of deploying international forces in geographically sensitive areas and emphasized that the deployment of the Lebanese Army and international forces south of the Litani River, as per the agreement, eliminates any justification for the enemy’s actions. Asked about the risk of an Israeli attack at any moment, Haidar asserted that the enemy could justify any aggressive move citing 'intelligence-gathering' or 'security threats.' However, he pointed out that the real issue lies in the actors who align with and adapt to such pretexts, noting that these attacks are part of broader US-backed pressure tactics targeting the resistance in Lebanon. Lebanese writer and expert in Israeli affairs Ali Haidar in an interview with Al-Manar (AUgust 2024). Haidar remarked that the United States is aware the war failed to achieve its strategic objective of eliminating the resistance. He added, 'Faced with popular and political obstacles hindering the American plan, the US resorts to pressure tactics such as continued occupation of certain areas and repeated attacks.' Haidar concluded by stating that the resistance would not tolerate the prolonged occupation, explaining that its timing and methods of action depend on appropriate circumstances and data. Sunday marks 60 days since the ceasefire between ‘Israel’ and Hezbollah took effect on November 27. According to the agreement, the Israeli army was required to withdraw from the territories it occupied in southern Lebanon by this deadline. The Israeli army has violated the agreement over 1,000 times since it came into effect. These violations aim to project a false sense of victory to its domestic audience and distract from its failure to achieve its objectives during the war. The Zionist entity seeks to convince settlers to return while continuing its aggression. If these attacks persist, will the Lebanese government take decisive action to protect Lebanon’s sovereignty?	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2322740	2025-01-26T05:38:20-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-08641080017378716636.jpg

Hezbollah MP: People, Army Secured Today’s Victory in South Leban...	Member of Hezbollah’s Loyalty to Resistance parliamentary bloc MP Hasan Fadlallah lauded on Sunday the Lebanese southerners and the Lebanese Army, stressing that they secured the victory today as they defied the Israeli threats. In an interview with Al-Manar from south Lebanon, MP Fadlallah said the tripartite formula of Army-People-Resistance is written today by people on the ground rather being written in the ministerial statement. He noted that the Israeli enemy 'does not attach importance to any agreements, and does not recognize the international community, which is complicit and covers this occupation, especially the United States.' 'The great victory is secured today by the people. The people, on top of whom are the families of the martyrs, offered sacrifices and confronted the enemy.' 'If you ask about victory, come and look here, and don't just look at the price we paid,' the Hezbollah lawmaker added. بالفيديو | من بلدة عدشيت القصير pic.twitter.com/5Ps5Tcpu5Y — قناة المنار (@TVManar1) January 26, 2025 Meanwhile, MP Fadlallah hailed the role of the Lebanese Army whose units deployed across border towns, defying the Israeli intention to stay in the Lebanese territory even after the 60-day deadline for Israeli withdrawal expired on Sunday.

Trump Floats Controversial Plan to Expel Palestinians from Gaza t...	Former US President Donald Trump has suggested a highly controversial plan to forcibly expel the population of Gaza to neighboring Egypt and Jordan, framing it as a step towards 'Middle East peace.' Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Trump described Gaza as a 'demolition site' in the aftermath of the recent Israeli assault, suggesting that 'probably a million and a half people' could be relocated. BREAKING: Trump says he is pressing Jordan, Egypt to take in Palestinians from Gaza, floats plan to 'just clean out' territory. — The Associated Press (@AP) January 26, 2025 'I'd like Egypt to take people. And I'd like Jordan to take people,' Trump said, adding that he had discussed the idea with Jordan's King Abdullah II and planned to speak with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Labeling Gaza a site of 'many, many conflicts over the centuries,' Trump said, 'We just clean out that whole thing and say, 'You know it's, over.'' He suggested the relocations could be temporary or potentially permanent. Trump proposed collaborating with Arab nations to 'build housing at a different location where they can maybe live in peace for a change.' However, both Jordan and Egypt have long rejected proposals to absorb large numbers of Palestinians, a position that was accepted by the previous administration under President Joe Biden.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2322091	2025-01-25T23:33:42-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2020/11/manar-020327400160587036110.jpg
Caution Prevails in South Lebanon as 60-Day of Israeli Withdrawal...	The 60-day deadline set by the ceasefire agreement for the Israeli enemy to withdraw from southern Lebanon expired at 4:00 a.m. (Beirut time) on Sunday, amid calls by the Lebanese citizens to return to their border towns despite Israeli procrastination to pull out troops. A state of caution and anticipation prevailed on Sunday morning as the Lebanese southerners are determined to return to their hometowns at the border area with occupied Palestine. The 60-day agreement, which was brokered by the US and France, stipulated the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon. However, the Israeli enemy has been stubborn on the issue, announcing that the occupation forces will remain in several points in the Lebanese territory, in a flagrant violation of Lebanon’s sovereignty. The Zionist move to stay in Lebanon comes amid continuous violations by the Israeli occupation army across Lebanon, including drone movement, strikes, shelling and advance of infantry forces and vehicles. As stipulated in the ceasefire agreement, which took effect on November 27, following a 66-day Israeli aggression, the Lebanese Army is set to deploy across south Lebanon, including the area south of Litani River. However, the national army’s deployment has been delayed as the Israeli enemy refuses to abide by the deal. On Saturday, the Lebanese Army blamed the Israeli enemy over the delay of its units’ deployment south of Litani River. In a statement, the army command said: 'There has been a delay in a number of stages as a result of Israeli procrastination in withdrawal, which complicates the army’s deployment mission.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2321772	2025-01-25T22:10:47-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-08641080017378716636.jpg
Toddler Succumbs to Wounds Inflicted by Israeli Gunfire near Jeni...	A Palestinian toddler Saturday night succumbed to an injury sustained earlier from Israeli occupation gunfire in Muthalath Ash-Shuhada village, south of the occupied West Bank city of Jenin, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The Ministry confirmed that 2-year-and-a-half-old Layla Mohammad Ayman Al-Khatib died of the injury she had sustained earlier in the course of an Israeli army raid in the village. Al-Khatib had sustained an injury in the head from live ammunition shot by Israeli occupation forces, as reported by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS). She was rushed to a hospital in critical condition. PRCS added that a woman sustained an injury to the hand from live ammunition fired by Israeli soldiers. She also was injured in the head by bullet shrapnel. Earlier this evening, special Israeli occupation forces barged their way into the village and besieged a house. The occupation forces deployed snipers around the house and ordered the occupants to come out via loudspeakers, triggering confrontations. Israel has been launching a massive raid on the Jenin city and refugee camp for the fifth consecutive day, killing 14 Palestinians and forcing 1,800 Palestinian residents to leave the refugee camp. A 42-year-old Palestinian man, Ahmad Mahmoud Hashash, succumbed to his injuries on Saturday evening after being shot by Israeli occupation forces during a raid on Balata refugee camp, east of Nablus. This comes as the occupation forces have tightened military measures across the occupied West Bank hours after the release of Palestinian prisoners as part of the Gaza ceasefire went into effect, dismembering and isolating cities and governorates one from the other using military gates, barriers, and concrete blocks.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2321607	2025-01-25T14:18:32-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-09370750017378433882.jpg
Hezbollah MP Underlines Right to Liberate Occupied Territories If...	Member of Hezbollah's Loyalty to Resistance parliamentary bloc MP Ibrahim Al-Moussawi stressed that the Resistance is powerful and proud of its fighters as well as martyrs, pointing out that all those who believe in the preciousness of dignity support this path. Addressing a funeral ceremony to commemorate the Islamic Resistance martyr Youssef Awdah in Al-Khodr town, MP Al-Moussawi underlined that the Israeli enemy must withdraw by Sunday from the last inch of Lebanese land as the 60-day ceasefire deadline ends. It is worth noting that the deadline will end on Sunday, January, 26, 2025, at 4 a.m. Thus, few hours separate the border area from dramatic developments if the Israeli enemy insists on keeping its troops occupying territories in South Lebanon. MP Al-Moussawi recalled that heavy sacrifices were made for the sake of liberating the occupied territories, affirming that the families of the martyrs and all the resistance supports have the right that all the public institutions in Lebanon and the international community assume their responsibilities regarding the Israeli withdrawal. 'If Israel does not withdraw for any reason within the specified period, it is proving to the world once again that it does not abide by any charters, agreements, understandings, or international laws.' If the international community does not press the Israeli enemy to withdraw, it would be considered as a partner and an accomplice to the Zionist occupation, he added. The people have every right, according to the United Nations Charter and the Taif Agreement, to take all measures and work by all methods and means to defend themselves and liberate their land, MP Al-Moussawi confirmed. 'We will be where The Master of the Martyrs of the Nation (Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah) asked us to be.' The enemy must understand and will understand inevitably and truly, MP Al-Moussawi emphasized.

President of the Republic, General Joseph Aoun, continued Saturday his intensive contacts and consultations to follow up on the situation in the south, in light of the serious Israeli developments and practices. In this context, President Aoun received a call this afternoon from French President Emmanuel Macron, during which he discussed the developments in the south, the efforts made to control the escalation and find appropriate solutions that ensure the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, and the measures that must be adopted to defuse any escalation. The French President assured that he is making contacts to maintain the ceasefire and complete the implementation of the agreement. In turn, President Aoun stressed to his French counterpart the necessity of obligating Israel to implement the provisions of the agreement to preserve stability in the south, and to stop its successive violations especially the destruction of villages adjacent to the southern border and the bulldozing of lands, which will hinder the return of residents to their areas.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2321486	2025-01-25T09:54:30-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-00716220017378276585.jpeg
