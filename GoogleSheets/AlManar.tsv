‘Israel’: Artificial Intelligence with Strategic Stupidity (Video...	In light of the Israeli cyber attack on Lebanon last Tuesday and Wednesday which left thousands of martyrs and injuries, the foreign media outlets followed up its repercussions with awe. Frontline Magazine reported that the explosions, which left at least nine dead and over 2,800 injured, have exposed a new frontier in modern warfare. 'Experts agree this attack marks a pivotal moment in how warfare is conducted in the 21st century. Cyber attacks are often invisible, leaving no trace, no debris, and no smoking gun. They target essential systems—communication networks, power grids, financial institutions—bringing entire nations to their knees without a single conventional weapon being deployed.' 'Military strategies must now account for cyberspace as a key battleground, where attacks can disrupt societies, economies, and critical infrastructure without firing a shot.' Reuters highlighted that role of the Israeli cyber intelligence unit 8200 in the attack, mentioning the incidents of the unit's failure, including October 7, and underling its unethical activities regarding spying individual privacy. The New York Times said that the Israeli intelligence planted explosives in the communication devices which exploded in Lebanon, mentioning much alleged details about the source of the pagers. The Washington Post asked about the timing of the Zionist attack, wondering about the cause of this escalation if it is not part of an all-out war. The Guardian reported the Israeli unease after the cyber attack on Lebanon, quoting Israeli analysts as saying that it would return the Zionist settlers to northern Palestine and questioning its feasibility without a strategic context. Hezbollah secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah stressed, in a televised speech on Thursday, that the painful cyber attack will fail to overthrow the resistance and return the residents of the North.

RGC Chief Warns ‘Israel’ of 'Crushing Response' For acts of terro...	The chief commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) says ‘Israel’ will face 'a crushing response from the axis of resistance' for its acts of terror in Lebanon which are the result of the regime's despair. In a letter to Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on Thursday, Major General Hossein Salami condemned 'the terrorist crime of the occupying regime, which resulted in the martyrdom and mass injury of beloved Lebanese nationals and Hezbollah fighters'. 'I declare that such terrorist acts, that are undoubtedly due to the desperation and successive failures of the Zionist regime, will soon be met with a crushing response from the resistance front and we will witness complete destruction of this cruel and criminal regime,' he said. Salami praised Sayyed Nasrallah and Hezbollah resistance fighters as well as the Lebanese nation for supporting the Palestinians in their struggle against the Israeli occupation. Salami touched on Hezbollah's operations over the past year, especially Operation Arbaeen Day last month in response to Israel's assassination of top military commander Fuad Shukr, saying they have shaken the security, intelligence and military bases of the 'treacherous and usurping regime'. 'The enemy, incapable of face-to-face confrontation, commits crimes behind the front line and magnifies the achievement of the crime in order to delay its demise and hide the scandal of its successive defeats from the world. He said IRGC servicemen, together with the great Iranian nation, laud the numerous sacrifices made by Hezbollah fighters, pay homage to the victims of recent device explosions in Lebanon, offer condolences to their families, and pray for the quick recovery of the injured. Salami said ‘Israel’ has not achieved any of its goals in Gaza after nearly a year of war and resorting to all kinds of crimes, despite the 'ignorant and unwavering support of the Western governments'. 'The humiliated enemy which is under the daily strikes of the resistance in the center, north, east and south and besieged will get nowhere with the new massive terrorist attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday using pagers and electronic systems against women, men and children of Lebanon.' The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has denounced the detonation of pagers and wireless devices in Lebanon, saying it is a blatant violation of international law. The organization said the attack did not only target Hezbollah members but also indiscriminately exploded devices used by civilians.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2202895	2024-09-20T01:59:46-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/12/manar-067219500170375961910.jpg

Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah said clear on Wednesday: The devices massacres that killed or injured thousands in Lebanon will be met with a difficult reckoning and won’t force the Lebanese resistance group from assuming its religious and moral duty of supporting the oppressed people of Gaza and Palestine.
