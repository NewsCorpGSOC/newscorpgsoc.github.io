Israeli Occupation Forces Continue Border Violations in Southern ...	The Israeli occupation forces continue violating the ceasefire agreement along the southern Lebanese border, subjecting several towns to ongoing shelling, bulldozing, and systematic destruction of property. According to Al-Manar correspondent, Israeli occupation forces are continuing bulldozing operations in the Al-Mfailah neighborhood of Mays Al-Jabal, near a newly established Lebanese Army position. Meanwhile, Israeli artillery shelled the Shaab Al-Qalb area on the outskirts of Shebaa, launching two shells into the region. Photos show the aftermath of a bulldozing operation carried out by Israeli occupation forces, located 100 meters from the Lebanese Army position at the entrance to the Al-Mufailah neighborhood in Mays Al-Jabal (Jan 30, 2025) Additionally, Zionist forces destroyed several shops and vehicles in the town of Baraj Al-Muluk. They also set fire to a poultry farm and an egg collection facility in the Tal Al-Nahas area, as well as a palace on the outskirts of Talousa. The correspondent further reported that an Israeli occupation drone dropped a bomb near a school in Talousa while a family was inspecting their home. Another Israeli drone dropped a bomb near a motorcycle at the edge of Talousa, injuring two civilians with minor wounds. An interception missile explosion was also recorded above Burj Al-Muluk, in the Marjayoun region. Additionally, Israeli forces continued bulldozing operations in the border town of Al-Dahira. Israeli occupation forces also carried out sweeping operations from their positions in the towns of Jardah and Birkat Risha, advancing toward Lebanese territory. Lebanese Army Operations On the Lebanese side, the Lebanese Army Command announced that specialized units will conduct explosive ordnance disposal operations in the Al-Khiyam area and the Al-Qulay'ah field in Marjayoun between 11:30 AM and 5:00 PM. For the fifth consecutive day, southern Lebanese residents continue their efforts to return to their villages and towns still occupied by Israeli forces, despite the expiration of the 60-day withdrawal deadline under the ceasefire agreement, which went into effect on November 27, 2024. Israeli occupation forces remain stationed in several border regions, directly violating the ceasefire agreement.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2326678	2025-01-30T05:50:43-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-04639670017382449233.jpg
Exclusive | Brigadier Jouni to Al-Manar Website: Lebanese Pressur...	The contours of a US attempt to pass a 'legislative' measure allowing the Israeli occupation forces to remain in Lebanon for an extended period are becoming clearer. The goal is to solidify the Israeli enemy's presence in five border points for an indefinite period. According to media sources, US efforts began approximately ten days ago, with reports emerging that the Israeli enemy intends to request an extension of the 60-day withdrawal deadline, citing 'logistical considerations' related to the situation south of the Litani River. Israeli Strategy in Southern Lebanon: Military Presence as a Political Tool Retired Brigadier General Dr. Hasan Jouni confirmed that the Israel enemy's insistence on holding onto the heights in southern Lebanon, which it still occupies, is not necessarily about the strategic value of these areas themselves. Instead, it is part of a broader strategy aimed at maintaining a permanent military presence in the region. In an exclusive statement to Al-Manar Website, Dr. Jouni explained that the primary goal of this military presence is political. 'The Israeli enemy seeks to pressure the Lebanese state to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701 in a way that guarantees its security and military superiority in the region,' he said. He added that 'Israel' is considering normalization and possibly signing a treaty with Lebanon before its eventual withdrawal. Jouni pointed out that with the strategic shifts in the region following US President Donald Trump’s administration, the Israeli enemy's goals have expanded beyond security, seeking broader political objectives amid ongoing regional tensions. Israeli Hold on Border Heights: Strategic or Symbolic? Regarding the Israeli enemy's persistent presence in the border heights, Brigadier Jouni emphasized that these areas do not hold significant strategic value on their own. However, he noted that 'Israel' might focus on retaining nearby villages, such as Addaisseh and Kfar Kila, as part of its broader efforts to impose military and political dominance in the area. Lebanese Resistance Forces Pressure IOF to Withdraw Jouni also highlighted the key role of local movements in the south, which have seen a strong surge of residents pushing towards their villages and the border. This public momentum, coupled with support from the Lebanese Army, forced the Israeli occupation forces to withdraw from more than 12 Lebanese villages. Video shows the residents of the border town of Yaroun forcefully enter, undeterred by Israeli occupation forces 'This popular surge, backed by the Lebanese military, forced Israel to rethink its strategy. The Israeli enemy was left with two options: either commit atrocities against civilians or pull out of some villages it deemed unnecessary for its occupation,' Jouni explained. Uncertainty in Lebanese Official Position Brigadier Dr. Jouni further noted that there remains ambiguity in Lebanon's official stance, particularly after statements from the Lebanese government calling for an extension of the ceasefire until February 18. He also pointed out that Hezbollah's Secretary-General, Sheikh Naim Qassem, rejected the extension of the ceasefire agreement, arguing that there was no justification for the Israeli enemy's continued occupation. Meanwhile, for the fourth consecutive day, southern Lebanese residents are attempting to return to their villages and towns still occupied by Israeli forces, despite the expiration of the 60-day deadline for withdrawal under the ceasefire agreement, which came into effect on November 27, 2024. While Israeli forces continue to occupy certain border regions in southern Lebanon, this represents a clear violation of the ceasefire agreement.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2326590	2025-01-30T05:34:00-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-04021130017378820763.jpg
Al-Qassam Brigades Release Israeli Captive Soldier in Jabalia Cam...	In a display of resilience and military might, the Al-Qassam Brigades (the armed wing of Hamas) and the Al-Quds Brigades (the military branch of Islamic Jihad) carried out a prisoner exchange in the Gaza Strip on Thursday. The exchange saw the release of a female Israeli prisoner, Agam Berger, from the rubble of the devastated Jabalia refugee camp, as well as two other Israeli prisoners, Arbel Yehud and Gadi Moses, who were handed over in Khan Yunis. مشاهد إضافية من عملية تسليم المجندة الإسرائيلية المحتجزة آغام بيرغر، في مخيم جباليا شمالي قطاع غزة. pic.twitter.com/sYj5iouqlp — Sputnik Arabic (@sputnik_ar) January 30, 2025 The Israeli Channel 13 reported that Tel Aviv was officially notified that the two prisoners, Gadi Moses and Arbel Yehud, will be released from Gaza before 12 noon local time. The Broadcasting Authority reported that the two prisoners, Yehud and Moses, are expected to be handed over from in front of the destroyed house of the head of the Hamas movement in Gaza, the martyr leader Yahya Sinwar, in Khan Yunis in the southern besieged Palestinian Strip. Meanwhile, the Israeli Broadcasting Authority explained that the release of Israeli and foreign prisoners will take place in 3 batches, and that those released will be transferred to a reception site in Ra'im in the Gaza envelope, where they will meet their families there before being transferred to 4 hospitals. The enemy's media confirmed that a military helicopter landed in Ra'im in the Gaza envelope in preparation for the prisoner exchange operation, without it being clear yet where the foreign prisoners will be handed over. The prisoner swap, which was the third such exchange under the recent ceasefire agreement, was marked by a powerful show of the Palestinian resistance's capabilities. The Qassam Brigades released Berger from Al-Razan Square in Jabalia, a site that witnessed heavy Israeli bombardment and destruction during the latest military offensive aimed at displacing the local population. The prisoner exchange held significant symbolic value for the Palestinian people, with the resistance choosing to conduct the handover in the heavily devastated Jabalia camp, a powerful message of defiance against the Israeli occupation. Banners and slogans celebrating the resistance's victories over elite Israeli military units, such as the Givati and Kfir brigades, were prominently displayed during the event.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2326370	2025-01-30T01:17:03-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-01778430017382286154.jpg
PM-designate Salam Meets President Aoun, Says Committed to Criter...	PM-designate Nawaf Salam visited on Wednesday Baabda Palace to meet President Michel Aoun and tackle the latest developments of the cabinet formation. After the meeting, Salam reiterated commitment to the criteria he set for the cabinet formation, confirming that the chosen ministers must be professionals who are neither parliament members nor candidates for upcoming parliamentary elections.

President Joseph Aoun Vows to Implement Inaugural Address, Calls ...	President of the Republic, Joseph Aoun, on Wednesday reaffirmed his commitment to implementing the vision outlined in his inaugural address, emphasizing that 'what the Lebanese people need is to live with dignity.' President Aoun called for an end to political bickering and sectarian power struggles, asserting that 'all ministries belong to Lebanon, as does the Cabinet.' He also stressed that sectarian representation in government should come through independent, competent elites rather than partisan affiliations. Aoun’s remarks came during his meeting at Baabda Palace with Rev. Joe Kassab, President of the Supreme Council of the Evangelical Community, who was accompanied by a delegation. Kassab expressed confidence that Lebanon was entering a new phase in its history, recalling the Evangelical community’s role in the nation’s foundation, including its representation in the first Lebanese parliament in 1920. He praised Aoun’s leadership, likening his vision for the country to his past efforts in the Lebanese Armed Forces. President Aoun also met with World Bank Regional Vice President for the Middle East and North Africa, Ousmane Dione, with whom he discussed ongoing financial and developmental assistance to Lebanon. The President assured Dione that Lebanon was committed to necessary reforms and that the new government’s priority was to draft and implement legislation addressing economic and administrative restructuring. Dione reiterated the World Bank’s support for Lebanon and revealed that the institution has allocated $736 million in long-term loans, pending parliamentary approval. He also highlighted plans for a rapid damage assessment and emergency aid to support Lebanon’s post-war reconstruction efforts. Separately, Indian Ambassador to Lebanon, Mohamed Noor Rahman Sheikh, conveyed a message from Indian President Droupadi Murmu, congratulating Aoun on his election and expressing optimism for strengthened Indo-Lebanese relations. The Indian President commended Aoun’s leadership and expressed hope for Lebanon’s stability and institutional development under his presidency.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2325974	2025-01-29T09:20:47-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-06379990017381710827.jpeg
Israeli Aggression Fails to Break Lebanese Resolve, Southern Vill...	On the fourth day of the heroic popular movement, aimed at liberating southern border villages from occupation, the Israeli enemy sought to retaliate against the fierce stand of the southern Lebanese people, undeterred by tanks or treacherous gunfire. In a blatant violation of the ceasefire, Israeli enemy warplanes launched an aggressive attack on Nabatieh Al-Fawqa late Tuesday night, targeting areas north of the Litani River. Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar reported that this Zionist action, backed by the United States, aims to expand the geographical scope of Resolution 1701 in defiance of Lebanon’s stance, despite the firm rejection by the resistance. This escalation can also be viewed as an attempt by the enemy to alter the victorious narrative that the Lebanese have created, attempting to impose a contrasting image. Meanwhile, the Israeli enemy continues to violate the ceasefire agreement and refuses to withdraw from southern villages, even after the 60-day ceasefire expired. This highlights its insistence on extending the ceasefire until February 18, a demand that was conveyed to the Lebanese government through its American ally. However, the Lebanese people and resistance forces remain resolute, ready to confront these actions head-on. Protests and Clashes in Kfarkila and Other Southern Areas Residents of Kfarkila set up on Wednesday a tent on the road to Khardali, at the intersection of Deir Mimas and Qleiaa, near the Morkos station, declaring their intention to remain there until the Israeli occupation forces withdraw from their town. Meanwhile, reports emerged of two civilians injured after an Israeli enemy drone dropped sound bombs on a gathering of citizens at the Shaqra-Majdal Selem-Houla triangle. Al-Manar correspondent confirmed that the Israeli occupation army released three prisoners but kept one in custody after detaining them earlier in the day in the border town of Maroun Al-Ras. Two others were also injured while attempting to advance into the town. In another incident, a Zionist drone dropped a bomb on a vehicle clearing remnants of the occupation from the obstacles and barricades in the Wadi Al-Slouqi area, injuring four civilians. Video shows a Merkava tank chasing Lebanese civilians on the Ramia-Marwahin road in southern Lebanon Israeli Troops Advance Towards Lebanese Positions According to Al-Manar correspondent, Israeli enemy forces retreated behind earthen barriers in the Al-Mfailah area, west of the village of Mays Al-Jabal. Prior to that, Zionist troops had advanced to within 100 meters of a Lebanese army position in the town, bypassing a UNIFIL center while accompanied by a Merkava tank firing at the surrounding area.

Head of Hezbollah’s Loyalty to Resistance parliamentary bloc MP Mohammad Raad lashed out at the Israeli enemy on Wednesday over the new aggression that targeted southern towns of Nabatieh and Zawtar a day earlier. In remarks carried by the local media, the Hezbollah lawmaker stressed that the right of resistance against the Israeli enemy is legitimate and sacred, calling for an action against the repeated Israeli attacks on Lebanon. 'The Zionist aggression on Nabatieh and Zawtar is a new example of the permanent threat posed by this entity against our people and our country,' MP Raad said. He slammed the international community’s disregard to the Israeli noting that this international behavior towards the Zionist entity 'led to this rampage that doesn’t care about international laws.' 'The Israeli aggression confirms our belief in the legitimate right to hold the national and moral responsibility of resistance.' 'The right of our people in Lebanon to confront the occupation is a legitimate and sacred right that is practiced in the appropriate time and place,' the Hezbollah lawmaker stated. He called for uniting the popular will of the Lebanese people along with efforts of the Lebanese State and its concerned institutions in a bid to confront the enemy and defend the homeland and the people.

Hezbollah Official to Israeli Enemy: Your Weapons and Bombs Have ...	Head of Hezbollah politburo Sayyed Ibrahim Amin Al-Sayyed sent on Tuesday a message to the southerners returning to the border towns, hailing their will and determination. Sayyed Al-Sayyed addressed the enemy by confirming that its weapons and bombs have only written for it a history of defeats. His eminence also called on the Lebanese political parties to seize the current chance in order to sustain the national unity. What follows is the text of the message: Peace be upon your minds, hearts, souls, blood and wounds. Greetings to your feet, which sanctify the earth wherever they tread, cleansing it from the filth of criminals and the small and large beasts. Your enemy has tested the weapon of your resistance on the battlefield, and yesterday it faced the weapon of your will and determination, understanding its essence and nature. This weapon is known only to Allah, the deeply knowledgeable, and the faithful believers. You, the men, women, and children, are the most honorable and purest of people. Among you, there are no cowards, no submissive, no surrendering souls. You are the elite, the crown of heads. Pride belongs to those who are associated with you. And to the enemy, I say: Have you now realized that your crimes have brought you no victory? That your weapons and bombs have only written for you a history of defeats? That the blood of the martyrs you killed has transformed into faith, courage, willpower, and strength rarely matched in this world? It will inspire and guide the peoples of the world and become a place of pilgrimage. The time will come when your structures in the region crumble, and the peoples of the world will emulate the greatness of this nation in Lebanon, from its south to every corner of the earth. As for Palestine, the scene, the image, the people, the blood, the victory, the dignity, and the honor are unified. Finally, I say to all our brothers and sisters in the homeland: This is a rare and historic opportunity for unity. Let us, for once, cast aside the hatred, conflicts, and disputes fabricated for the interests of our enemies. Let us establish and impose our sovereignty on both foes and friends. Let us prove to the world that we are not a people for rent or exploitation, but a people deserving of life with merit, dignity, and honor.

Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, Leader of the Islamic Revolution, stated that the Gaza Strip has successfully brought the US-backed Israeli regime to its knees, showcasing the strength of resistance against colonial forces. During a meeting with Iranian officials and Muslim ambassadors in Tehran to commemorate Eid al-Mab’ath on Tuesday, Khamenei characterized the United States as a symbol of colonialism and arrogance in today's geopolitical landscape. He asserted that the US government is heavily influenced by dominant global financial powers, which aim to exploit and undermine other nations for their own gain.

'They are intent on plundering our lands,' he continued, referencing the pervasive influence of financial cartels in shaping Western policies. The Leader highlighted the role of resistance movements, noting how the spirit of defiance that began in Iran has emboldened many across the Muslim world and even resonated with non-Muslims. He commended the recent developments in Gaza, where, despite being heavily armed and supported by the US, the Israeli regime has faced significant setbacks. Elsewhere in his remarks, the Leader said friends and foes thought that the martyrdom of the Hezbollah leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, had eliminated Lebanon's resistance movement. However, he added, 'Hezbollah showed that not only was it not terminated, but it was further inspired to stand up to the Zionist regime.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2324742	2025-01-28T03:13:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-03684290017380627987.jpg

Zionist Captive Arbel Yehud Urges Netanyahu, Trump to Ensure Retu...	Al-Quds Brigades published on Monday a video which shows the Zionist captive Arbel Yehud asking the enemy's premier Netanyahu and the US President Donald Trump to ensure the continuation of the ceasefire as planned so that all the captives can return to 'their homes' safely and the Palestinian captives can be freed and return to their homes safely. Yehud, who appears fine, said that served in the Zionist army from October 2013 to October 2015. The Israeli enemy demanded that the Palestinian resistance release Yehud in the latest exchange operation; however, the mediators said that she would be released before Friday, while Gazans were allowed to return to the north of the Strip.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2324368	2025-01-27T14:13:02-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-05794320017380159348.jpg
Islamic Resistance Fighters Salute Noble Returnees to South Leban...	The Islamic Resistance issued on Monday a statement that hailed the popular return to South Lebanon villages which consecrated Lebanon's steadfastness and victory in face of the Zionist enemy. What follows is the text of the statement: O our people&#8230; O the noblest of Allah's creation, the most honorable of people; today, the will of determination in you has risen, and the will of the enemy has been broken. You have crossed, despite the cowardice of their soldiers, towards your villages, where the enemy's objectives shattered at their walls, and their tanks burned by the hands of your sons, the fighters of the Islamic Resistance. The bodies of the martyrs, planted in the soil, today feel the sound of your footsteps, and their pure souls hover around the banner that has not been broken, the banner under which you march towards victory, a victory that you truly deserve, just as you have always been worthy of all victories. O our people and our families&#8230; Your crossing yesterday and today, seen by our vigilant eyes, was that of confident conquerors. And here we bow our heads, extending the salute of arms, fight, and resistance to every mother, father, brother, sister, elder, and child, in the name of every fighter among us and in the name of the souls of the martyrs who irrigated the soil of the homeland with their blood. Peace be upon you, your patience, your loyalty, your victory, and Allah's blessings upon you. All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds. Raising Hezbollah flags, Lebanese southerners on Sunday defied Israeli threats and return to their villages as the 60-day deadline set by the ceasefire agreement for the Israeli enemy to withdraw from southern Lebanon expired at dawn. Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem highlighted on Monday that Lebanon is facing an occupier who is aggressing and refusing to withdraw, stressing that the resistance has the right to act, as it sees fit, regarding the form, nature, and timing of the confrontation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2324335	2025-01-27T13:03:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-01998700017380117833.jpg
Sheikh Qassem: Hezbollah Will Set Proper Form and Timing of Confr...	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem highlighted on Monday that Lebanon is facing an occupier who is aggressing and refusing to withdraw, stressing that the resistance has the right to act, as it sees fit, regarding the form, nature, and timing of the confrontation. In a televised speech, Sheikh Qassem affirmed that the continued occupation is an aggression against Lebanese sovereignty, and everyone is responsible for confronting this occupation: the people, the army, the state, the resistance, and the various political forces. Sheikh Qassem held the United Nations, the United States, France, and 'Israel' responsible for the consequences of the delaying the withdrawal. ''Israel' must withdraw after 60 days, and we do not accept any excuse for extending even one day, nor do we accept an extension of the deadline. President Joseph Aoun cannot give 'Israel' a single gain, and no one in Lebanon will accept extending the aggression against Lebanon with the enemy.' The Zionist occupation cannot remain in Lebanon with such proud people who may never be defeated, his eminence added. Sheikh Qassem pointed out that the tripartite army-people- resistance equation, which prevented 'Israel' from reaching Beirut and the south of the Litani River, is as clear as the sun adding that the problem lies with those who cannot see it. Those who possess dignity stand and march towards the frontline positions, undeterred by their policies and American support for them, Sheikh Qassem maintained. 'The scene of return on November 27 at 4:00 am to the South, Dahiya [Beirut’s southern suburb], and Bekaa was a victory scene. Celebrations of triumph spread across all regions as the resistance fighters remained steadfast in the field with their heads held high, firm and strong.' We achieved victory because we returned, and the occupier will be forced to leave and withdraw,' his eminence affirmed, 'The resistance fighters never left the battlefield, and the resistance remains steadfast and strong.' The American sponsor of the agreement is the same one who sponsors the 'Israeli' aggression and failed to play his role, yet we decided not to give any pretext, Sheikh Qassem said. The breach of the agreement proves Lebanon's need for the resistance, Hezbollah leader affirmed. 'We were subjected to a counter-campaign, part of which was internal, aimed at portraying us as defeated. Some may have had a heart attack because their dreams of defeating the resistance did not come true.' The resistance emerged victorious clearly and obviously, Sheikh Qassem underlined. Hezbollah Secretary General confirmed that the resistance emerged victorious with this people who surged towards the frontline villages even before the Israeli withdrawal and amid the Zionist aggression as well as violations. The popular return challenged the Israeli live bullets, and the returnees relied on their religious belief, personal dignity and national honor to confront the enemy attacks, his eminence said. Sheikh Qassem noted that the aggressor requested a ceasefire under conditions, and Hezbollah agreed because it neither initiated the war nor sought it. 'We accepted the ceasefire agreement as the state took the decision to defend the borders and remove 'Israel'.This is an opportunity for the state to fulfill its duties and test its political capabilities.' We remained committed and chose patience, refraining from responding to 'Israeli' violations despite feelings of humiliation over the retaliatory actions, Sheikh Qassem said. Israeli enemy violated the ceasefire 1350 times, Sheikh Qassem highlighted, adding that Hezbollah abstained from responding in order not to give the enemy and the pact sponsors to blame the resistance. Hezbollah Secretary General pointed out that the aggression against Lebanon, as with Gaza, was an unrestrained act of hostility backed by the U.S. and the West. 'The U.S. and 'Israel' sought to eliminate the resistance, deploying five divisions comprising 75,000 soldiers and officers, with excessive brutality, to achieve this goal,' his eminence added, 'The resistance, in all its forms, stood firm with legendary resolve and martyrdom-driven determination.' 'The world witnessed the heroes of the resistance. Our people bore significant sacrifices, showcasing resilience. The resistance emerged united and strong, regaining control within ten days, fueled by the spirit instilled by the Master of the Martyrs of the Nation, His Eminence Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah.' Sheikh Qassem affirmed that the resistance operations escalated, and the 'Israeli' forces advanced only a few hundred meters on the frontlines, hindered by the steadfastness of the fighters, adding that, meanwhile, the displaced supported the resistance with their cohesion, and the diverse Lebanese population remained loyal in their solidarity. Hezbollah Chief baldly said that the resistance supporters were shocked by the massive blow and the losses inflicted by the enemy during the war because of the successive military victories of the resistance in 2000 (Liberation), 2006 (July's War) and 2017 (Second Liberation). The resistance supporters thought that the resistance weapons, missiles, drones and information capabilities will certainly lead to victory, his eminence added. 'The balance of deterrence Hezbollah maintained over 17 years against the enemy has led people to believe in the sustainability of our military strength. Our supporters did not expect us to lose this number of leaders in such a short period and across this wide spread.' Sheikh Qassem explained that the enemy's informational dominance, control over communications, artificial intelligence, and airforce were critical factors in the strikes directed at the resistance. Hezbollah is conducting an investigation into this significant exposure, his eminence underscored. Sheikh Qassem asserted that the resistance remains strong in its decisions, willpower, and believers, and it is even stronger with its continuity. On the Lebanese politics, Shekh Qassem said that the National Duo [Hezbollah and Amal Movement] achieved the consensual presidential choice through the election of President Joseph Aoun, adding that. without the participation of the National Duo, the president would not have been elected in such a way that expresses national unity, which is a strength for the national duo. 'We acted wisely because we want sustain the country and government and cooperated with the designated Prime Minister Nawaf Salam; the complexities of forming the government are not with us.' The matters between us, the designated Prime Minister, and the President are clear, with no obstacles. Hezbollah Chief also hailed the victory in Gaza as a triumph for the Palestinian people, the region's supportive nations, and all the free people worldwide who endorsed and backed the cause. 'The goal of Al-Aqsa Flood was achieved, and Israel's project to destroy the resistance and Hamas was defeated,' hsi eminence said. 'We extend gratitude to dear Yemen for its sacrifices, to Iraq for its people, religious authority, and Al-Hashd Al-Shaabi, and to Lebanon, which gave the Master of the Martyrs of the Nation, His Eminence Sayyed Nasrallah.' Sheikh Qassem started his speech by indicating that the treacherous culprits in the assassination of Sheikh Mohammad Hammadi, Hezbollah leader in Western Bekaa, remain under investigation, but that suspicion points towards the Zionists.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2324280	2025-01-27T11:07:41-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-02780950017380048536.jpg
Southern Lebanese Defy Israeli Occupation, Continue Return to Lib...	For the second consecutive day, the resilient people of southern Lebanon return to their border villages, demonstrating defiance against the Israeli occupation and external dictates. Their steadfast resolve comes despite the Israeli enemy’s declaration, following the expiration of the 60-day truce, that it would not withdraw. The United States has reportedly attempted to prolong the ceasefire until February 18, seeking to circumvent Resolution 1701 and the ceasefire agreement. This scene conveys a powerful message that the people themselves are the resistance. Any attempt by the Israeli occupation to 'eradicate the resistance' would require targeting an entire nation—a reality the Israeli enemy is beginning to grasp. David Azoulay, head of the council for the destroyed settlement of Metula, acknowledged this, criticizing the agreement with Lebanon as a 'surrender deal,' stating, 'Netanyahu signed an agreement of capitulation to Hezbollah, which is now returning.' Determined Advances Following Sunday's fierce resistance, the Lebanese Ministry of Health announced today that 24 people were martyred and 134 others were injured in Israeli enemy attacks on southern Lebanon. Despite this brutality, the spirit of liberation continues to shine as people pursue their journey. On Monday morning, citizens entered the village of Houla following the deployment of the Lebanese army in several neighborhoods. In Ayta Al-Shaab, the Lebanese army, alongside returning villagers, advanced to reclaim the area from occupation forces. Similarly, the army led convoys of returning families to Mays Al-Jabal, where Israeli forces are expected to withdraw despite ongoing gunfire. From the western neighborhoods of Mays Al-Jabal, Al-Manar reporter Ali Shoaib described the gathering crowds, led by the army, preparing to reclaim the village's center as Israeli occupation forces retreat. Mobilizing from Universities to Southern Villages Lebanese students also joined the movement, with gatherings reported at the entrance to the Lebanese University campus in Hadat. Groups mobilized to head toward southern villages, with a parallel rally at Hezbollah’s Educational Mobilization Center in Sfeir. Yaroun and Marwahin: A Bold Return Amid Challenges The Lebanese Army and residents of Yaroun reached the town square despite the ongoing presence of Israeli forces. Meanwhile, residents of Marwahin made their way back home on foot, passing through the Um Al-Tout area. In Maroun al-Ras and Yaroun, residents displayed remarkable resilience, standing firm against Israeli forces hiding behind tanks, creating a powerful image of defiance and solidarity. In Markaba, large crowds gathered at the entrance to the town near Bani Hayyan, waiting to enter alongside the Lebanese Army. The influx of residents into villages in the western sector, including Al-Naqoura, continues to underline the widespread support for the liberation efforts. Israeli Drone Attacks in Bani Hayyan Amid the liberation efforts, Israeli enemy drones targeted a municipal team in Bani Hayyan while they worked on opening and paving roads at the town’s entrance. A bomb was dropped near the team, which narrowly escaped unharmed. Another bomb was dropped near the town’s cultural center, causing no injuries. However, Lebanon’s Ministry of Health confirmed two injuries in the area, one in critical condition, following Israeli attacks on civilians. The unified determination of the Lebanese people, supported by the army and resistance forces, underscores their resolve to reclaim their land and protect their sovereignty despite continuous aggression.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2323774	2025-01-27T04:40:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-02153900017379813207.jpg
Iranian Parliament Speaker: Hamas Is Still Alive and Humiliating ...	In a powerful address to the Iranian Parliament, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, the speaker of the Parliament, commended Hamas and the Palestinian resistance forces for their resounding victory against the Zionist regime. He emphasized the failure of Israel's cognitive war and their futile attempts to deceive the world by suggesting that they had overcome resistance in Palestine and Lebanon. Qalibaf declared that Hamas is not only alive but thriving, and the resilience of the resistance is stronger than ever, causing humiliation for the enemy. He emphasized that Palestine's endurance in the face of over 15 months of Israeli genocidal crimes will only be complete when the Zionists fully withdraw from the Gaza Strip and the displaced Palestinians can return to their homes. The speaker's remarks echoed the sentiments expressed by Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, after the martyrdom of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in combat with Zionist forces in October 2024. Khamenei affirmed that Hamas, the symbol of Palestinian resistance, remains alive and will continue to thrive. This unified stance from Iranian leadership serves as a powerful message of solidarity and support for the Palestinian cause. It reinforces the determination of the resistance forces and sends a clear message to ‘Israel’ that their aggression will not go unchallenged. The world watches as Hamas and the Palestinian people stand firm, refusing to be silenced or defeated.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2323785	2025-01-27T04:27:28-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/01/manar-01793550016744851686.jpg

Hezbollah’s MP Mohammad Raad Calls for National Unity, Reaffirms ...	In a passionate statement, Head of the Loyalty to the Resistance Bloc, MP Mohammad Raad, called on the Lebanese people to stand united and celebrate their steadfastness and resistance. MP Raad hailed the return of southern Lebanese residents to their villages, acknowledging the resilience of the people who have remained unwavering in their commitment to the land despite the brutal occupation. The statement highlighted the powerful symbolism of the returning residents, carrying the images of martyrs and resistance flags as a testament to their unyielding spirit. Hezbollah's MP Raad emphasized the importance of the 'Army-People-Resistance' equation, describing it as the true foundation of Lebanon’s sovereignty and security. The group reiterated that the resistance, in partnership with the Lebanese army and people, remains the only effective way to defend the nation and its territory against ongoing Israeli occupation and aggression. The statement also condemned Israeli violations and called on the international community to ensure Israel's full withdrawal from southern Lebanon, respecting the will of the people and the principles of international law. Hezbollah affirmed its commitment to liberating the land and safeguarding Lebanon’s dignity and sovereignty. As MP Raad honored the martyrs and the sacrifices made by the people of Lebanon, he reminded all that this ongoing struggle is not only about protecting Lebanon but also defending the entire region from the looming threat of Israeli occupation. The statement concluded with a call to continue the fight for freedom and justice with unwavering resolve until complete liberation is achieved.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2323312	2025-01-26T11:18:17-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2016/08/manar-08251680014726505203.jpg
Hezbollah Hails ‘Glorious Day of God,’ Reiterates People, Resista...	Hezbollah described Sunday, January 26, 2025, as a 'Glorious Day of God' and a 'majestic scene of honor and dignity crafted by the people of resistance.' In a statement issued Sunday evening, the group praised the resilience of the Lebanese people, highlighting their deep connection to their land, their unwavering attachment to every grain of its soil, and their steadfast role as guardians of national sovereignty, standing resolutely against all threats and aggression. 'Since 2000, this scene has repeated itself. Through their heroic resistance, our people continue to drive out the enemy, reaffirming once again that there is no place for an occupier in this blessed land, watered by the blood of martyrs,' the statement added. Lebanese citizens return to their border towns as the deadline for Israeli withdrawal expires (January 26, 2025). Hezbollah further highlighted the powerful symbolism of returning residents, carrying images of martyrs and resistance flags, as a testament to perseverance, steadfastness, and victory. 'This unyielding will and indomitable spirit form the strongest weapon of the resistance,' the statement noted. It also recalled the words of the late sacred martyr, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, who described this strength as an 'unbeatable point of power.' The group reiterated that the resistance remains loyal to the sacrifices of its martyrs and that no force, no matter how mighty, can withstand the blessed popular wave seeking liberation and the ultimate defeat of the occupier. Hezbollah also underscored the enduring value of the 'Army-People-Resistance' equation, describing it as a tangible reality rather than a mere slogan. This unity, it said, shields Lebanon from the treachery of its enemies and is embodied daily through the sacrifices of its people. The statement called on all Lebanese to stand united with their southern compatriots, reaffirming the values of national solidarity and striving together for true sovereignty defined by liberation and victory. Hezbollah urged the international community, especially the nations sponsoring recent agreements, to hold Israel accountable for its violations and crimes and to ensure its full withdrawal from Lebanese territories. The statement concluded with a tribute to the martyrs and wounded who, through their sacrifices, paved the way for liberation and triumph. Hezbollah emphasized that these historic moments reaffirm Lebanon’s identity as a nation of honor, dignity, and unwavering resistance.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2323224	2025-01-26T10:13:01-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-04165050017056142612.png
Israeli Circles Worried about Return of Lebanese Southerners: How...	The Israeli circles followed up the consequences of the popular return to South Lebanon, specifically the border towns, where the Israeli enemy insisted on keeping its occupation despite the end of the withdrawal deadline in accordance with the ceasefire agreement. Despite the Israeli threats and the ongoing occupation in some villages, which constitutes a violation of the terms of the agreement, the scene remains a clear source of concern to the Zionist analysts. Israeli News 24’s correspondent in the north, Oreh Keshet, commented: 'The scenes coming from Lebanon worry the northern settlers and reinforce their fears of the return of Hezbollah fighters, which poses a challenge to our security capabilities and exposes the IDF forces to danger.' He added, 'The Lebanese tried to cross the earthen berms and army checkpoints, chanting slogans praising (Sayyed) Nasrallah, in an attempt to challenge the forces present there.' For his part, the correspondent of the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper in the north, Yair Kraus, said: 'After 15 months of fighting, these are the scenes that the residents of the north are afraid of &#8230; The people of southern Lebanon are returning to the border area, raising Hezbollah flags.' The two Zionist websites of Walla and Hadashot Bezman underlined the scene of the Lebanese returnees approaching the Israeli soldiers and vehicles, indicating that saying 'Israel' will lose the chance of achieving a complete victory when it withdraws from southern Lebanon. Haaretz newspaper reported that reservists criticized the Army decision to stay in South Lebanon without any justification amid questions about the timing of the return of the settlers to the North. 'In southern Lebanon, they are returning to the villages, but the question is: How will the Israelis return to the north?' Raising Hezbollah flags, Lebanese southerners on Sunday defied Israeli threats and return to their villages as the 60-day deadline set by the ceasefire agreement for the Israeli enemy to withdraw from southern Lebanon expired at dawn.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2322894	2025-01-26T07:52:01-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-07374390017379066942.jpg
Explainer on Deadline of Israeli Withdrawal from Lebanon: Repercu...	The Zionist enemy exploited the 60-day deadline granted for a full withdrawal from the territories it occupied during its last belligerent invasion of Lebanon to commit breaches and attacks that blatantly violated the terms of the truce. The enemy intensified its crimes, including bulldozing roads, destroying civilian infrastructure, burning homes, and demolishing mosques and buildings across southern Lebanon. Targeting Hezbollah’s infrastructure was merely a pretext used by the Israeli enemy to justify its aggression. Member of Hezbollah’s Loyalty to Resistance bloc MP Ali Fayyad confirmed this to Al-Manar website, stating that the situation in the border area extends beyond merely targeting infrastructure. The Zionist Enemy Turns the South into a Disaster Zone Fayyad elaborated: 'The enemy seeks to turn the border area into a disaster zone, burned and uninhabitable. What is the connection between the Wazzani orchards—a modern agricultural area spanning 10,000 dunams, featuring almond orchards, grapevines, and vegetables—and the pretexts claimed by the Israelis? Why are they completely destroying them?' He continued, 'The looting and theft taking place are systematic and ongoing. What connection exists between these brutal practices and the Israeli claims about military infrastructure? These actions aim to render the area uninhabitable, complicating its reconstruction and revival for many years to come.' Israeli breaches in south Lebanon (January 2025). How Did Hezbollah Deal with the Violations? MP Fayyad reiterated Hezbollah’s commitment to the Lebanese government’s directives concerning the area south of the Litani River, emphasizing: 'We have adhered from the start to the Lebanese government’s directions and respected its commitments toward the area south of the river.' However, Fayyad criticized the government’s response, describing it as weak and insufficient, and said it has failed to utilize all available tools to deter Israeli attacks. He added, 'Formal objections and limited political contacts are not enough. We need an international campaign where the Lebanese government employs every tool at its disposal to stop and deter Israeli aggression'. 'Furthermore, the government’s stance must be clear and resolute. There can be no compromise, we will not accept the Zionist enemy remaining in our land, not even a single day beyond the sixty-day deadline. The government must declare its categorical rejection of this situation and adopt a firm policy to safeguard Lebanon's rights and sovereignty'. Repercussions of Israeli Violations Ali Haidar, an expert in Israeli affairs, explained to Al-Manar that the Israeli enemy’s reversal of its commitments under the agreement was unsurprising, as it began violating the terms from the very outset. He noted that the Israeli pretexts concerning security in certain geographical areas could be addressed through alternative measures without resorting to these violations. Haidar suggested the possibility of deploying international forces in geographically sensitive areas and emphasized that the deployment of the Lebanese Army and international forces south of the Litani River, as per the agreement, eliminates any justification for the enemy’s actions. Asked about the risk of an Israeli attack at any moment, Haidar asserted that the enemy could justify any aggressive move citing 'intelligence-gathering' or 'security threats.' However, he pointed out that the real issue lies in the actors who align with and adapt to such pretexts, noting that these attacks are part of broader US-backed pressure tactics targeting the resistance in Lebanon. Lebanese writer and expert in Israeli affairs Ali Haidar in an interview with Al-Manar (AUgust 2024). Haidar remarked that the United States is aware the war failed to achieve its strategic objective of eliminating the resistance. He added, 'Faced with popular and political obstacles hindering the American plan, the US resorts to pressure tactics such as continued occupation of certain areas and repeated attacks.' Haidar concluded by stating that the resistance would not tolerate the prolonged occupation, explaining that its timing and methods of action depend on appropriate circumstances and data. Sunday marks 60 days since the ceasefire between ‘Israel’ and Hezbollah took effect on November 27. According to the agreement, the Israeli army was required to withdraw from the territories it occupied in southern Lebanon by this deadline. The Israeli army has violated the agreement over 1,000 times since it came into effect. These violations aim to project a false sense of victory to its domestic audience and distract from its failure to achieve its objectives during the war. The Zionist entity seeks to convince settlers to return while continuing its aggression. If these attacks persist, will the Lebanese government take decisive action to protect Lebanon’s sovereignty?	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2322740	2025-01-26T05:38:20-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-08641080017378716636.jpg

Hezbollah MP: People, Army Secured Today’s Victory in South Leban...	Member of Hezbollah’s Loyalty to Resistance parliamentary bloc MP Hasan Fadlallah lauded on Sunday the Lebanese southerners and the Lebanese Army, stressing that they secured the victory today as they defied the Israeli threats. In an interview with Al-Manar from south Lebanon, MP Fadlallah said the tripartite formula of Army-People-Resistance is written today by people on the ground rather being written in the ministerial statement. He noted that the Israeli enemy 'does not attach importance to any agreements, and does not recognize the international community, which is complicit and covers this occupation, especially the United States.' 'The great victory is secured today by the people. The people, on top of whom are the families of the martyrs, offered sacrifices and confronted the enemy.' 'If you ask about victory, come and look here, and don't just look at the price we paid,' the Hezbollah lawmaker added. بالفيديو | من بلدة عدشيت القصير pic.twitter.com/5Ps5Tcpu5Y — قناة المنار (@TVManar1) January 26, 2025 Meanwhile, MP Fadlallah hailed the role of the Lebanese Army whose units deployed across border towns, defying the Israeli intention to stay in the Lebanese territory even after the 60-day deadline for Israeli withdrawal expired on Sunday.

Trump Floats Controversial Plan to Expel Palestinians from Gaza t...	Former US President Donald Trump has suggested a highly controversial plan to forcibly expel the population of Gaza to neighboring Egypt and Jordan, framing it as a step towards 'Middle East peace.' Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Trump described Gaza as a 'demolition site' in the aftermath of the recent Israeli assault, suggesting that 'probably a million and a half people' could be relocated. BREAKING: Trump says he is pressing Jordan, Egypt to take in Palestinians from Gaza, floats plan to 'just clean out' territory. — The Associated Press (@AP) January 26, 2025 'I'd like Egypt to take people. And I'd like Jordan to take people,' Trump said, adding that he had discussed the idea with Jordan's King Abdullah II and planned to speak with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Labeling Gaza a site of 'many, many conflicts over the centuries,' Trump said, 'We just clean out that whole thing and say, 'You know it's, over.'' He suggested the relocations could be temporary or potentially permanent. Trump proposed collaborating with Arab nations to 'build housing at a different location where they can maybe live in peace for a change.' However, both Jordan and Egypt have long rejected proposals to absorb large numbers of Palestinians, a position that was accepted by the previous administration under President Joe Biden.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2322091	2025-01-25T23:33:42-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2020/11/manar-020327400160587036110.jpg
Caution Prevails in South Lebanon as 60-Day of Israeli Withdrawal...	The 60-day deadline set by the ceasefire agreement for the Israeli enemy to withdraw from southern Lebanon expired at 4:00 a.m. (Beirut time) on Sunday, amid calls by the Lebanese citizens to return to their border towns despite Israeli procrastination to pull out troops. A state of caution and anticipation prevailed on Sunday morning as the Lebanese southerners are determined to return to their hometowns at the border area with occupied Palestine. The 60-day agreement, which was brokered by the US and France, stipulated the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon. However, the Israeli enemy has been stubborn on the issue, announcing that the occupation forces will remain in several points in the Lebanese territory, in a flagrant violation of Lebanon’s sovereignty. The Zionist move to stay in Lebanon comes amid continuous violations by the Israeli occupation army across Lebanon, including drone movement, strikes, shelling and advance of infantry forces and vehicles. As stipulated in the ceasefire agreement, which took effect on November 27, following a 66-day Israeli aggression, the Lebanese Army is set to deploy across south Lebanon, including the area south of Litani River. However, the national army’s deployment has been delayed as the Israeli enemy refuses to abide by the deal. On Saturday, the Lebanese Army blamed the Israeli enemy over the delay of its units’ deployment south of Litani River. In a statement, the army command said: 'There has been a delay in a number of stages as a result of Israeli procrastination in withdrawal, which complicates the army’s deployment mission.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2321772	2025-01-25T22:10:47-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-08641080017378716636.jpg
Toddler Succumbs to Wounds Inflicted by Israeli Gunfire near Jeni...	A Palestinian toddler Saturday night succumbed to an injury sustained earlier from Israeli occupation gunfire in Muthalath Ash-Shuhada village, south of the occupied West Bank city of Jenin, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The Ministry confirmed that 2-year-and-a-half-old Layla Mohammad Ayman Al-Khatib died of the injury she had sustained earlier in the course of an Israeli army raid in the village. Al-Khatib had sustained an injury in the head from live ammunition shot by Israeli occupation forces, as reported by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS). She was rushed to a hospital in critical condition. PRCS added that a woman sustained an injury to the hand from live ammunition fired by Israeli soldiers. She also was injured in the head by bullet shrapnel. Earlier this evening, special Israeli occupation forces barged their way into the village and besieged a house. The occupation forces deployed snipers around the house and ordered the occupants to come out via loudspeakers, triggering confrontations. Israel has been launching a massive raid on the Jenin city and refugee camp for the fifth consecutive day, killing 14 Palestinians and forcing 1,800 Palestinian residents to leave the refugee camp. A 42-year-old Palestinian man, Ahmad Mahmoud Hashash, succumbed to his injuries on Saturday evening after being shot by Israeli occupation forces during a raid on Balata refugee camp, east of Nablus. This comes as the occupation forces have tightened military measures across the occupied West Bank hours after the release of Palestinian prisoners as part of the Gaza ceasefire went into effect, dismembering and isolating cities and governorates one from the other using military gates, barriers, and concrete blocks.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2321607	2025-01-25T14:18:32-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-09370750017378433882.jpg
Hezbollah MP Underlines Right to Liberate Occupied Territories If...	Member of Hezbollah's Loyalty to Resistance parliamentary bloc MP Ibrahim Al-Moussawi stressed that the Resistance is powerful and proud of its fighters as well as martyrs, pointing out that all those who believe in the preciousness of dignity support this path. Addressing a funeral ceremony to commemorate the Islamic Resistance martyr Youssef Awdah in Al-Khodr town, MP Al-Moussawi underlined that the Israeli enemy must withdraw by Sunday from the last inch of Lebanese land as the 60-day ceasefire deadline ends. It is worth noting that the deadline will end on Sunday, January, 26, 2025, at 4 a.m. Thus, few hours separate the border area from dramatic developments if the Israeli enemy insists on keeping its troops occupying territories in South Lebanon. MP Al-Moussawi recalled that heavy sacrifices were made for the sake of liberating the occupied territories, affirming that the families of the martyrs and all the resistance supports have the right that all the public institutions in Lebanon and the international community assume their responsibilities regarding the Israeli withdrawal. 'If Israel does not withdraw for any reason within the specified period, it is proving to the world once again that it does not abide by any charters, agreements, understandings, or international laws.' If the international community does not press the Israeli enemy to withdraw, it would be considered as a partner and an accomplice to the Zionist occupation, he added. The people have every right, according to the United Nations Charter and the Taif Agreement, to take all measures and work by all methods and means to defend themselves and liberate their land, MP Al-Moussawi confirmed. 'We will be where The Master of the Martyrs of the Nation (Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah) asked us to be.' The enemy must understand and will understand inevitably and truly, MP Al-Moussawi emphasized. The Lebanese army reinforced its positions in South Lebanon as the Israeli occupation forces raised alert in light of the withdrawal deadline end.

The Lebanese Army on Saturday blamed the Israeli enemy over delaying withdrawal from border areas south of Litani River as stipulated in the ceasefire deal which took effect on November 27 (2024) and ends on Sunday. President of the Republic, General Joseph Aoun, continued Saturday his intensive contacts and consultations to follow up on the situation in the south, in light of the serious Israeli developments and practices. In this context, President Aoun received a call this afternoon from French President Emmanuel Macron, during which he discussed the developments in the south, the efforts made to control the escalation and find appropriate solutions that ensure the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, and the measures that must be adopted to defuse any escalation. The French President assured that he is making contacts to maintain the ceasefire and complete the implementation of the agreement. In turn, President Aoun stressed to his French counterpart the necessity of obligating Israel to implement the provisions of the agreement to preserve stability in the south, and to stop its successive violations especially the destruction of villages adjacent to the southern border and the bulldozing of lands, which will hinder the return of residents to their areas.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2321486	2025-01-25T09:54:30-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-00716220017378276585.jpeg
Hezbollah: US Blacklisting Won’t Prevent Noble Yemen from Support...	Hezbollah condemned, in a statement issued on Saturday, the new US administration’s re-inclusion of the Ansarullah movement on the so-called 'US terrorism lists,' and considers it an unjust classification and a direct attack on the oppressed Yemeni people who have suffered from the siege, terrorism, and ongoing US aggression on their land and resources for years. Hezbollah considered that the successive American governments, that have committed acts of terror against the peoples of our nation and support the Zionist entity as well as its terrorist attacks and hideous criminal wars, especially in Lebanon and Palestine, are the first to be blacklisted. 'This unfair American decision, which comes in the context of supporting the faltering Israeli entity, will neither deter honorable Yemen from continuing its support for the Palestinian people in their just cause nor change its convictions and determination to confront American and Israeli ambitions in the region.' Hezbollah expressed its pride and appreciation for the honorable role played by the Ansarullah movement in support of Gaza, as it had a major role in strengthening the steadfastness of the Palestinian resistance and was a partner in the victory over the Zionist enemy, affirming its firm confidence that this people will continue on the path of steadfastness and resistance.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2321376	2025-01-25T07:18:14-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-04165050017056142612.png

Israeli media commented on the scenes of the captives in Palestine Square, with the Times of Israel describing the parade there as a show of force. For its part, the Israeli army could not hide annoyance over the handover ceremony. Military Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari slammed Hamas’s parade as 'cynical'. 'Hamas is a murderous terror group. In the last few hours Hamas proved its cruelty by organizing a cynical ceremony,' he said, as quoted by Israeli media.

US Calls for Urgent Extension of Ceasefire in South Lebanon as ‘I...	US National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a statement Friday that 'a short, temporary ceasefire extension is urgently needed' and the U.S. will work with 'regional partners' to secure it. 'President Trump is committed to ensuring Israeli citizens can safely return to their homes in northern Israel, while also supporting President Aoun and the new Lebanese government,' Hughes said. The Israeli occupation military will not complete its withdrawal from southern Lebanon within the 60-day period set out in the ceasefire deal that ended its war with Hezbollah, the Israeli prime minister's office said Friday. It is worth noting that the deadline will end on Sunday, January, 26, 2025, at 4 a.m. Thus, few hours separate the border area from dramatic developments if the Israeli enemy insists on keeping its troops occupying territories in South Lebanon. The Lebanese statesmen have repeatedly voiced concern over the Israeli occupation plots, calling on the United States, France and the United Nations sponsoring the ceasefire agreement to press 'Israel' to withdraw before the deadline. Hezbollah issued on Thursday a statement which underlines the necessity of the full and comprehensive implementation of the ceasefire agreement as outlined in its terms since the 60-day period for the Israeli enemy to completely withdraw from Lebanese territories is nearing its end. It is also important to note that, unlike Lebanon, the Zionist entity did not respect the obligations of the ceasefire during the 60-day period, launching air raids which left martyrs and injuries, demolishing buildings, scraping lands and roads, and destroying environmental features in several south Lebanon towns. The latest reports indicated that the Israeli occupation forces, guarded by Merkava tanks, advanced from Houla town into Wadi Slouki area. Moreover, the occupation forces carried out an incursion into Aitaroun town and cut its main highway which leads to Bint Jbeuil City. In addition, the Israeli enemy had intensively violated Lebanon's sovereignty and the stipulations of the ceasefire in South Lebanon.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2320760	2025-01-24T13:10:35-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-09347800017377530126.jpeg

'However, we are faced with some particular issues here that require special attention,' Putin continued. 'As you may all know well, for instance, the current head of the regime in Kiev, when he was still a fairly legitimate head of state, inked a decree banning all negotiations with Russia.' Russian President Putin earlier set forth the conditions for resolving the situation in Ukraine, which included Ukraine withdrawing troops from Donbass and Novorossiya and abandoning plans to join NATO. Moscow also believes that all Western sanctions on Russia must be removed and Ukraine’s non-bloc and non-nuclear status must be guaranteed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2320661	2025-01-24T10:14:12-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/06/manar-06264890016876045856.jpg

Israeli Ceasefire Violations in Lebanon Continue Despite Imminent...	Israeli occupation forces continue to violate the ceasefire agreement with Lebanon, despite the 60-day deadline for the withdrawal of Zionist troops set to expire this Sunday. These breaches represent a blatant and deliberate violation of both the ceasefire agreement and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. They raise significant questions about the responsibility of the parties overseeing the agreement and the international body tasked with monitoring its implementation. The violations also place the Lebanese state and UNIFIL forces under increasing pressure to protect Lebanon's sovereignty from Israeli transgressions. This Friday, Israeli enemy forces carried out a series of incursions into several southern border towns.

Hamas to Provide List of Prisoners Soon, Affirms 'Freedom of Move...	The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) announced that, starting Saturday—the seventh day of the ceasefire—internally displaced Gazans will be allowed to return north via Al-Rashid Street, known as the 'Coastal Road.' This follows the conclusion of the prisoner exchange and the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces from the Al-Rashid axis. Civilians can move north without weapons or searches, and unrestricted travel between Gaza's northern and southern regions will be allowed.

OCHA highlighted that aid shipments and workers are now reaching previously inaccessible areas, significantly improving relief efforts. Second Phase of Prisoner Exchange Underway Israeli Channel 14 reported that Hamas will provide the Israeli enemy with a list of prisoners on Friday to be released the next day. In the second phase of the exchange, Hamas will release four Zionist detainees, including three soldiers, in return for 180 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli Enemy to Release 290 Palestinian Prisoners Israeli media reported that 200 of the Palestinian prisoners set to be released in the first phase of the exchange deal are serving life sentences. The prisoners, accused of participating in attacks that caused Zionist casualties, will be deported to Gaza or other unspecified countries. Their names remain undisclosed. According to reports, a total of approximately 290 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences will be released in this phase of the deal. Trump Highlights Ceasefire in Gaza US President Donald Trump underscored the importance of preserving the Gaza ceasefire, cautioning that its breakdown could cause serious problems. Speaking at the Davos Forum, Trump claimed that his administration had been instrumental in facilitating Middle East ceasefire negotiations, asserting that the agreement would not have been achieved without his team's efforts. Meanwhile, Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed his commitment to securing the return of all Israeli prisoners held in Gaza. During a video call with the families of three Israeli women recently released as part of the first phase of the prisoner exchange deal, Netanyahu vowed to continue efforts to ensure the release of the remaining detainees.

During a video call with the families of three Israeli women recently released as part of the first phase of the prisoner exchange deal, Netanyahu vowed to continue efforts to ensure the release of the remaining detainees. The families conveyed a message from the freed detainees, urging the government to press ahead with the deal, stating that doing so would provide 'strength and healing' to them and Israeli society as a whole. Protests in Tel Aviv Over Prisoner Exchange and Judicial Reforms Hundreds of Zionists gathered outside the Ministry of War in the occupied city of Tel Aviv to demand the completion of all phases of the prisoner exchange deal to secure the return of detainees from Gaza. The demonstration also voiced strong opposition to recent actions by the so-called Justice Minister Yariv Levin, who has resumed efforts to implement controversial judicial reforms. Protesters argued that the reforms undermine the principle of separation of powers and weaken the judiciary’s independence. The demonstrators pledged to continue their protests until all Israeli prisoners held in Gaza are returned.

Among voters for Likud, Religious Zionism, and Shas, 59% expressed support for the agreement. The survey also found that 52% of respondents attribute the success of the deal to former US President Donald Trump. However, only 33% of Religious Zionism Party supporters favor a return to war, while just 31% of Likud voters support resuming hostilities after the first phase of the deal. Overall, only 17% of Israelis are restarting the conflict after the first phase is completed. The poll further indicated that the Religious Zionism Party, led by Bezalel Smotrich, would fail to cross the electoral threshold if elections were held today. In contrast, the Democratic Alliance is projected to secure 12 seats in the Knesset, marking a surprising surge in its popularity.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2320254	2025-01-24T04:19:47-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-06424900017377208875.jpg
Prominent Israeli Officials Resign Amid Gaza Defeat, IRGC Chief S...	The chief commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) has declared that the resignations of prominent Israeli officials are a clear indication of the regime's defeat in Gaza. 'All of Gaza was destroyed, but hearts remained strong; in 'Israel', there was less destruction, but hearts were shattered,' Major General Hussein Salami told a local event in the central Iranian city of Kashan on Thursday evening. 'Look at Israeli officials, they are all depressed and disturbed, handing over their resignations. This is a clear sign of defeat as they confess to it.' IRGC Chief Commander Major General Salami: The resignation of Israeli military officials after the end of the Gaza war is a clear sign of their defeat in this war. — IRNA News Agency (@IrnaEnglish) January 24, 2025 ‘Israel’ was forced to agree to a ceasefire in Gaza on January 19 after failing to achieve its objectives in the besieged territory. Palestinians celebrated the ceasefire as a victory, with some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners set to be released from Israeli prisons in exchange for Israeli captives held in Gaza. 'Those who kept their hearts strong emerged victorious, singing songs of triumph amidst the ruins of their homes,' Salami said, noting that despite Israelis, Palestinians are 'joyful' as they 'resisted under fire, in hunger and thirst, but never abandoned God.' The remarks come as the largest Israeli daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth has listed the most high-profile figures from the Israeli military who have resigned over failures in the run-up to the Gaza war and after that. The list includes the chief of the general staff, the commander of the southern region, the commander of the Gaza division, the head of the military intelligence division, the commander of intelligence unit 8200, and the commander of the northern brigade in the Gaza Strip. Salami noted that the United States, Israel and Britain colluded with each other to crush a defenseless nation, but Palestinians withstood the scheme, held firm and emerged victorious. 'Recent events have shown that blood triumphs over the sword, and the Palestinian nation won the battle against the Zionists,' the IRGC chief commander said. He went on to note that arrogant powers, spearheaded by the US and Israel, are sowing the seeds of sedition in the Muslim world. 'All wars that enemies, led by the United States and the Zionist regime, have waged have been in Muslim lands. They destroyed Muslim’s houses, killed men and women and decimated women and children,' said Salami. He went on to praise the steadfastness of Muslim women and women, stressing that enemies would have taken full control of Muslim countries in case Muslims had not put up spirited resistance.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2320265	2025-01-24T04:10:35-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-044897600173772062210.jpg

The dire situation in Gaza is further compounded by the severe damage to the region's education system. The UN agency UNRWA reported that close to 660,000 children are currently out of school, and over 14,500 children have been killed in the ongoing aggression on Gaza. UNICEF has also sounded the alarm over a looming mental health crisis affecting nearly all 1.1 million children in Gaza. The relentless bombardment, loss of loved ones, and worsening humanitarian crisis have left many children grappling with nightmares, severe anxiety, and paralyzing fear. Experts warn that the profound psychological effects of the war could haunt these children for generations.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2320221	2025-01-24T02:37:07-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/08/manar-03094710017251206154.jpg

Markets of Northern Gaza Filled with Joy Again	The Israeli occupation forces violated on Thursday the ceasefire in Gaza, launching an air raid on a house in Rafah, which left a number of Palestinians dead or injured. Meanwhile, the Palestinian locals continued moving back from South Gaza to the Strip's North. However, the massive destruction and the slow flow of humanitarian aid turn the return to be gradual. In Jabalia camp, for example, the locals are exerting much efforts to cope with the cold temperature and the rainfall, amid features of social solidarity. Markets in northern Gaza were filled with joy with the arrival of basic goods, such as food supplies, vegetables, fruits and meat, knowing that the locals were deprived from such products for 15 months. The ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip officially came into effect on Sunday morning, marking the end of 471 days of relentless military aggression by Israeli occupation forces on the besieged enclave.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2319957	2025-01-23T12:49:30-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-09952370017376653613.jpg

Around 50 hours before the end of the 60-day period for the Zionist enemy to withdraw from South Lebanon in accordance with the ceasefire agreement, its forces continued carrying out violations of the truce. In this regard, the Israeli occupation forces executed big explosions in Houla and Kfarkila border towns. A Zionist helicopter dropped bombs on a house in Al-Qantara tiown, South Lebanon.

Hezbollah issued on Thursday a statement which underlines the necessity of the full and comprehensive implementation of the ceasefire agreement as outlined in its terms since the 60-day period for the Israeli enemy to completely withdraw from Lebanese territories is nearing its end. Certain leaks suggesting that the enemy intends to delay its withdrawal and prolong its presence in Lebanon call on everyone—foremost the political leadership in Lebanon and those pressing the agreement's sponsoring nations—to act decisively, the statement maintained. 'It is essential to closely monitor the final days of this timeline to ensure the complete withdrawal, the deployment of the Lebanese Army to every inch of Lebanese territory, the swift return of residents to their villages, and the prevention of any pretexts or excuses for prolonging the occupation.' 'Any breach of the 60-day timeline constitutes a blatant violation of the agreement, an attack on Lebanese sovereignty, and the beginning of a new chapter of occupation,' the statement added, 'This demands that the state confront it using all means and methods sanctioned by international conventions to reclaim the land and wrest it from the grip of the occupation.' As we continue to follow developments, which are expected to culminate in a full withdrawal in the coming days, we affirm that any breach of the agreement or attempt to evade commitments under weak pretexts will not be tolerated, the statement confirmed. Finally, Hezbollah called for strict adherence to the agreement, without concessions.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2319825	2025-01-23T07:31:19-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-027725400166239486010.jpg
Ansarullah Dismisses US ‘Terrorist’ Designation, Calling it a Bad...	Yemen's Ansarullah resistance group has firmly rejected the United States' recent decision to designate it as a 'Foreign Terrorist Organization', calling it a misguided effort that only serves to highlight their unwavering support for the Palestinian people. Nasr al-Din Amer, the deputy head of Ansarullah's press service, stated that being included on the US list of allies would have posed a greater threat than being labeled a terrorist organization. 'Being on the US list of friends is far more provocative than being designated as a terrorist group,' he asserted. Amer emphasized that the US is targeting Yemen due to its support for Gaza, which he described as a 'great honor' for the Yemeni people and integral to their ongoing struggle. He added that Ansarullah's members do not have any investments, bank accounts, or businesses in the United States, nor do they travel to the country. The Palestinian Mujahideen Movement echoed Ansarullah's sentiments, describing the US designation as an 'attack on the Yemeni people' and a 'badge of honor' that confirms Ansarullah is on the right path. The movement highlighted the Yemeni forces' crucial role in supporting Palestinians, characterizing their actions as honorable and essential in the fight against Israel's 'genocide' in the Gaza Strip.

It stressed that the real perpetrators of terrorism are the Israeli leaders, specifically Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet, who stand accused of committing genocide in Gaza. The US President Donald Trump officially designated Ansarullah as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) on Wednesday, threatening to mobilize its regional proxies against Yemen in an attempt to pressure the Yemeni people to abandon their support for Gaza. The designation came in response to the Yemeni army's military operations on Israeli-occupied territories and assaults on US Navy warships and Israel-linked vessels in the region since November 2023, launched in support of Palestinians being killed by Israel in Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2319616	2025-01-23T03:49:40-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/01/manar-06980580016429597565.jpg

Imam Khamenei: Gaza Emerged Victorious, Thanks to Mythical Steadf...	Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei called on Iranian officials to seize the opportunity provided by the country’s membership in BRICS, stressing the need to eliminate dependence on the US dollar. As the Iranian officials have organized the 'Pioneers of Progress' event, a group of domestic manufacturers and private sector owners met with Ayatollah Khamenei at the Imam Khomeini Hussainiyah of Tehran on Wednesday, January 22. In remarks at the meeting, the Leader described Iran’s membership in BRICS as one of the great opportunities that should be thoroughly used to counter the sanctions and contribute to Iran’s economic growth. Calling on Iranian diplomatic officials to assist the economic sector, Ayatollah Khamenei described the financial system of BRICS as a great opportunity for Iran. He said trade exchanges among the BRICS member states in their own currencies will be of great help to Iran, saying one of Iran’s problems at present is dependence on the US dollar. The Leader said a number of the BRICS members do not dare to scrap the US dollar because of political reasons, stressing the need to encourage them to do so through diplomatic activities. 'The purpose is for them (BRICS members) to omit (the US) dollar from the trade exchanges as far as possible. This would be a great and important job. In the economic campaign, this is a very decisive and determining move,' Ayatollah Khamenei stated. Warning against the reactions to the elimination of the dollar from the trade transactions, the Leader said Iran’s economy will gain advantages once the program is implemented and the Central Bank of Iran paves the way for the use of foreign currencies other than the US dollar. 'Today, our war is the economic war,' Ayatollah Khamenei added, emphasizing the need for Iran’s production growth with the help of the private sector. The duty of a country that has been sanctioned is to rely upon its own internal capacities, the Leader noted. He also called on the Iranian government to assist the private sector and remove the obstacles in its way. His Eminence also praised the progress made by the private sector despite years of illegal US-led sanctions targeting the country’s economy. The Leader also pointed to the studies carried out by working groups on the materialization of an 8 percent economic growth in Iran, saying the experts have detected the capacities and capabilities, defined the investment plans, and determined the solutions. Ayatollah Khamenei finally urged the officials to seriously pursue and carry out those solutions to ensure the 8-percent economic growth rate in Iran. Imam Khamenei reiterated that resistance is alive and will endure, and Gaza has emerged victorious, adding that what happened in the war is mythical. Without the US support, the Zionist entity would have been defeated in the first weeks, Imam Khamenei maintained.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2319187	2025-01-22T07:48:09-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-011444700173756087710.jpg
Israeli Media: IOF Plunges into Internal Crisis as Halevi Resigns...	Military analysts in Israeli media on Wednesday described the Israeli occupation army as being 'mired in a severe crisis,' a direct consequence of the events of October 7, 2023. They highlighted that the selection of a new Chief of Staff to replace Herzi Halevi, who announced his resignation on Tuesday, would hinge on the impact of October 7 and the candidate's loyalty to Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Halevi Held Accountable for Intelligence Failures Amos Harel, the military analyst for Haaretz, noted that Halevi, 'as a professional military officer, not only recognized the operational failure during his tenure but also bore significant responsibility for it.' Harel emphasized that Halevi, alongside Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, had convened discussions on the night of October 6-7 based on intelligence indicators suggesting Hamas militants were preparing for an operation after activating Israeli SIM cards on their phones. However, Halevi decided neither to mobilize forces nor issue directives to the Military Intelligence Directorate (Aman) to investigate Hamas' actions further. According to Harel, the outcome of Hamas' attack could have been different. He attributed Halevi's misjudgment to his military upbringing in elite units like the General Staff Reconnaissance Unit and special operations forces. These units, Harel explained, typically operate with a cautious approach, relying on gathering maximum intelligence while minimizing exposure to sensitive sources. 'The special operations personnel are accustomed to preparing for missions over months, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the intelligence picture before making decisions. This caution, rooted in a fear of prematurely exposing intelligence coverage to the enemy, may have contributed to the IOF's inadequate response to the October 7 events,' Harel elaborated. Despite military investigations, Harel noted that the full extent of the failure remains unclear. Internal tensions at various levels of the IOF persist, exacerbating the ongoing crisis. He further highlighted severe challenges within the middle ranks of the permanent officer corps, where many have left the army without being replaced. This has placed an unsustainable burden on reserve forces, compounded by public anger over government policies. Among these policies is a controversial draft exemption law favoring Haredim Zionists, which critics view as entrenching inequality. Top Contenders for IOF Chief of Staff The leading candidates for the position include Eyal Zamir, Director-General of the Ministry of War, who previously served as Deputy Chief of Staff and was a contender for the role currently held by Halevi; the current Deputy Chief of Staff, Amir Baram; and the Northern Command Chief, Uri Gordin. A fourth candidate, backed by right-wing politicians, is Netanyahu's military secretary, Ruman Gofman. However, Gofman is considered to lack sufficient military experience for the role, having been promoted to the rank of general only a year ago. Palestinian resistance fighters as they capture Israeli occupation soldiers during an attack on a militray post in Gaza envelope as part of Op. Al-Aqsa Flood (October 7, 2023). Delayed Resignations of IOF Commanders Deepen Crisis Amid the resignation of IOF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Southern Command Chief Yaron Finkelman, military analyst Yossi Yehoshua from Yedioth Ahronoth described their departures as 'long overdue and irrationally delayed.' Yehoshua emphasized that the nearly 500-day delay following the October 7 events severely damaged both internal trust within the army's senior leadership and public confidence. He stated that the Zionist public still lacks a full understanding of the catastrophic failures of that night and the following day. 'The grim truth will eventually emerge, exposing how the collapse of the IOF’s morale resembled a house of cards. Many disillusioned officers either left the army or retreated to less impactful roles, discouraged by tainted investigations and appointment processes designed to cover up failures,' Yehoshua wrote. He also highlighted Halevi’s statement that there was no 'internal betrayal' on October 7, countering accusations from right-wing factions. However, Yehoshua asserted that what occurred was an unparalleled collapse of command structures, starting with Halevi, Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar, and other top commanders. 'Those who haven’t yet resigned must do so soon, and the sooner, the better,' he stated. Strategic Failures, Tensions Within the IOF Military analyst Yehoshua also pointed out that the war itself carries significant failures for which outgoing Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi must take responsibility. 'While the Israeli army achieved gains in Gaza, it failed to secure a decisive military victory. Political factors played a role, but serious errors were made in the management of battles and operations,' Yehoshua noted. He further criticized Halevi for running the war with a reduced command structure that excluded Deputy Chief of Staff Amir Baram, highlighting the toxic dynamic between the two leaders that surfaced within the occupation army. The Israeli army releases image of the two occupation soldiers killed in Gaza (January 7, 2024). Ceasefire and Military Disappointment Yehoshua concluded by describing the Gaza ceasefire agreement as merely the starting point of fulfilling the moral obligation toward the hostages and their families. However, he also saw it as emblematic of military disappointment, stating, 'The sheer amount of ammunition and forces deployed in Gaza, considering its size, marks an unprecedented event in history—but it failed to deliver the expected results.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2319077	2025-01-22T04:27:44-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-09980910017044580712.jpg

The Washington Post has revealed that Google has been working to provide the Israeli occupation military with the latest artificial intelligence (AI) technologies since the early weeks of the 2021 war on Gaza. According to the report, Google's cooperation with the Israeli Ministry of Defense began in 2021, when the Israeli government requested to expand its use of Google's 'Vertex' AI service for military applications. The Post notes that a Google employee even warned that the Israeli military would turn to Amazon's services if it could not obtain the desired AI capabilities from Google. ⚡️🇮🇱BREAKING: Google provided Israel with AI technology which was used in Gaza and the West Bank.

(@SuppressedNws) January 22, 2025 The newspaper states that the Israeli occupation military sought access to Google's 'Gemini' AI technology to develop its own AI assistant for processing documents and audio. Documents show the military continued utilizing Google's latest AI tools even as the 2021 airstrikes reduced large parts of Gaza to rubble. The Post reports that over 100 Google employees urged the company to reconsider its work with the Israeli military, but Google largely ignored their concerns. While Google claims to distance itself from the Israeli government's national security operations, the company did fire over 50 employees last year who protested the 'Nimbus' cloud computing contract, which they feared would enable military and intelligence uses harmful to Palestinians. Google maintains the Nimbus contract, valued in the billions, does not involve 'highly sensitive, secret, or military functions related to weapons or intelligence.' However, Israeli officials have stated the deal would include collaboration with the military. The Washington Post was unable to determine precisely how the Israeli occupation military employs Google's AI capabilities. But the report cites previous statements from an Israeli cybersecurity official confirming the Nimbus contract directly supports combat applications, stating 'Amazing things happen during combat, and these things play a major role in victory.' The article notes the Israeli occupation military has been expanding its use of AI for years to expedite intelligence processing and target selection, including deploying an internally-developed AI tool called 'Hepsora' during the 2021 Gaza war to identify bombing targets. While some Israeli leaders have raised concerns about Hepsora's accuracy, the military's reliance on advanced AI technologies like those from Google appears to be growing.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2319011	2025-01-22T01:40:49-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-05880190017375388422.jpg

The Israeli Army Radio reported the attack occurred at two locations in Tel Aviv. According to Channel 1, the stabbings took place on Nahalat Binyamin and Kalisher streets. Hamas Movement hailed, in a statement, the stabbing operation in Tel Aviv carried out by the Moroccan martyr hero, stressing that it proves once again that the tide of resistance continues and increases as long as the occupation and its crimes and aggression continue. 'This operation comes as a natural response hours after dozens of martyrs and wounded were killed during the occupation's aggression on Jenin, in an eloquent message that blood for blood and that the hand of the resistance will strike with all its might deep into the usurping entity.' Islamic Jihad MOvement hailed the operation, underscoring that, since it is carried out by a Moroccan citizen, it affirms the Arab solidarity with the Palestinian cause.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2318813	2025-01-21T13:48:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-01406530017374960714.png

Halevi Announces Resignation, Calls on Netanyahu to Take Similar ...	Israeli Chief of Military Staff Herzi Halevi announced on Tuesday his resignation, calling on the Prime Minister Benhjamin Netanyahu and the rest of the members of the Security Cabinet to take a similar action. In his resignation letter, Halevi indicated that he would assume the responsibility for the failure on October 7, 2023, affirming that the Army failed to defend 'Israel'. He acknowledged his failure to protect Israel's security on October 7, which led to great human and material losses. He stressed that he bears full responsibility for this failure, which will haunt him throughout his life. We suffered heavy casualties and the war left many of our soldiers and their families with wounds and scars, Halevi said. Halevi explained that the goals of the war have not yet been fully achieved, stressing the continuation of efforts to dismantle Hamas' capabilities and return all the kidnapped. He pointed out that he has begun extensive investigations to learn lessons and strengthen the army's capabilities, stressing that these investigations are proceeding accurately and comprehensively. According to Israeli media, Halevi's resignation will take effect on March 6. Following the resignation of the Chief of Staff, Yisrael Beiteinu Party Chairman Avigdor Lieberman called on the Prime Minister and the rest of the members of the Security Cabinet to resign 'I call on the Prime Minister and the rest of the members of the Security Cabinet to take responsibility and leave their positions.' In another blow to the Zionist Army, Chief of Southern Military Command, Lieutenant General Yaron Finkelman, submitted resignation, saying failure will remain engraved in his memory for the rest of his life.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2318406	2025-01-21T06:10:15-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-04524870017374686037.png

Watch: Palestinian Surgeon Censures Sky News Host over Oct. 7	Mainstream media goes ahead with its war of information aimed at disinforming the people in the West over the reality of the Israeli genocide which lasted for more than 15 months in Gaza. An operation which killed few hundreds of Israeli colonizers (many of them were killed by their own army) on October 7, 2023, justifies the brutal killing or injuring of more than 146,000 people in Gaza! That’s the equation by the mainstream media. However, many activists, including Palestinians with dual nationalities, counter such propaganda. Palestinian-British surgeon Dr. Ghassan Bu Sitta appeared via Sky News on Sunday, just few hours after the ceasefire in Gaza took effect. He lashed out at the pro-Israeli narrative propagated by mainstream media. 'The UK media refers to Israelis as ‘hostages’, while to Palestinians illegally held by Israel, including children, as ‘prisoners’.' When asked by the Sky News host: 'Do you wish [Oct 7] had never happened?', he gave her a rocket by saying: 'I wish 1948 had never happened.' 🚨British-Palestinian surgeon Dr Ghassan Abu Sittah has blasted Sky News for 'racially othering' Palestinians.

Trump Reverses Sanctions on Israeli Settlers in West Bank	US President Donald Trump has rescinded sanctions imposed by the previous Biden administration on far-right Israeli settler groups and individuals accused of violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. The White House website stated that Trump signed an executive order to rescind Executive Order 14115, which had authorized sanctions on 'Persons Undermining Peace, Security, and Stability in the West Bank.' This marks a reversal of a key decision by the Biden administration, which had slapped sanctions on numerous Israeli settler entities and individuals, freezing their US assets and barring Americans from dealing with them. Israel expects President Trump to lift the Biden administration's hold on the supply of 2,000-pound bombs in his first days in office, outgoing Israeli ambassador to the U.S. Mike Herzog told Axios. — Axios (@axios) January 20, 2025 The move comes as violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank and ongoing land grabs in the occupied territory have raised concerns among some of Israel's Western allies. The decision to lift the sanctions is seen as a significant victory for the pro-settlement lobby and a blow to efforts to rein in settler violence and illegal land seizures in the occupied Palestinian territories.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2318120	2025-01-21T00:20:28-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-09048410017374475824.jpg

Canal 'Is And Will Remain' Panamanian: Panama’s President Tells T...	President Donald Trump on Monday cast himself as a peacemaker in his second inaugural address, but immediately vowed that the United States would be 'taking back' the Panama Canal. Trump issued the threat without explaining details after weeks of refusing to rule out military action against Panama over the waterway, which the United States handed over at the end of 1999. 'Above all, China is operating the Panama Canal, and we didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama. And we're taking it back,' Trump said after being sworn in inside the US Capitol. Panama maintains control of the canal but Chinese companies have been steadily increasing their presence around the vital shipping link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino swiftly denied that any other nation was interfering in the canal, which he said his country operated with a principle of neutrality. 'I must comprehensively reject the words of President Donald Trump,' President Jose Raul Mulino said in a statement published on social media. 'The canal is and will remain Panama's,' he added, dismissing Trump's claim that China is operating the canal. 'There is no presence of any nation in the world that interferes,' Mulino said. The canal was built by the United States and opened in 1914. It was handed to Panama on December 31, 1999, under treaties signed some two decades earlier by then-US president Jimmy Carter and Panamanian nationalist leader Omar Torrijos.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2317911	2025-01-20T12:47:15-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-08249160017374060238.png
Trump Delivers Inauguration Speech, Pledges to Restore 'Trust in ...	US President Donald Trump took office Monday as the nation’s 47th leader, portraying himself and his incoming administration as one that will immediately spring into action to take the country back. With a series of promised executive orders — some of which were designed to undo the executive orders of former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama — Trump moved from the presidential oath to the first actions of his second term. 'The golden age of America begins right now,' Trump said. 'From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world.' In a roughly 30-minute address from the U.S. Capitol Rotunda, where the inauguration was moved due to frigid temperatures, he outlined his vision for the country and plans that will shape his presidency and legacy. Here are the biggest takeaways from Trump’s inaugural address. Trump pledges to restore trust in government Trump began his speech with an optimistic tone while seeming to acknowledge that many Americans’ faith in government institutions has waned in recent years. He mentioned the federal response to hurricane victims in North Carolina last fall and the ongoing response to California wildfires as areas he saw trust broken. 'As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust,' Trump said. 'For many years, a radical establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay completely broken and seemingly in complete disrepair.' This statement appears similar to former President Joe Biden’s warning of an 'oligarchy' during last week’s farewell address. Executive orders Trump came out swinging with his promise to crack down on illegal immigration and crime, promising sweeping executive action right away. The list of his priorities included sending military troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to address a surge of migrants, formally designating Mexican cartels supplying illegal drugs as terrorist organizations and invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to 'eliminate' criminal gangs operating in the U.S. Other executive orders Trump announced would declare a national energy emergency, and rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America, and Alaska’s Denali, the highest mountain peak in North America, to Mount McKinley. Outreach to the Black, Hispanic communities Trump thanked the increasing number of Black and Hispanic voters who carried him to victory, vowing he 'will not forget' their support. According to Associated Press exit polls, Trump received support from about 16% of Black voters and 43% of Hispanics — both record numbers for Republican candidates in the modern era. He recognized Monday as Martin Luther King Jr. Day and vowed to fight to 'make his dream a reality,' referring to King’s famous 'I Have a Dream…' speech in 1963. Going to Mars Trump said he will revitalize the American space program by sending astronauts to Mars. 'We will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the stars and stripes on the plant Mars.' Trump ally Elon Musk could be seen smiling and giving a thumbs-up when Trump declared his intention to go to Mars. Tech and media leaders as VIPs It wasn’t just the American people Trump was addressing on Monday. He had some of the most powerful and influential leaders in VIP seats, including tech leaders like Musk and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, as well as Fox News magnate Rupert Murdoch and podcast host Joe Rogan, among others. Additional supporters sat in the Capitol’s Emancipation Hall, which was set up as an overflow viewing room, and included artificial intelligence billionaires Sam Altman and Alexandr Wang, YouTube influencers and brothers Logan and Jake Paul, indicted New York Mayor Eric Adams, former NASCAR driver Danica Patrick and more. Wealthy tech leaders, such as Amazon owner Jeff Bezos, getting better seats than Cabinet nominees and elected lawmakers is unusual for inaugurations. However, many top business leaders have a long and deep history of lobbying presidents and members of Congress.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2317834	2025-01-20T11:01:09-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-05225220017373996544.jpg
Sayyed Houthi Congratulates Palestinian People: We Are Observing ...	Leader of Yemen’s Ansarullah movement, Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi,described on Monday Gaza victory as great and historic, expressing gratitude to Allah over this bless of supporting the fighters, strengthening their resolve, and granting steadfastness to the Palestinian people. Sayyed Houthi warmly congratulated the Palestinian people and all the resistance factions in Gaza, especially Al-Qassam Brigades and Al-Quds Brigades. 'Al-Aqsa Flood operation was a pivotal, significant, and transformative event that advanced the Palestinian cause to a new stage.' Cooperation among the Palestinian factions was pivotal in achieving these remarkable results, granted by Allah, Sayyed Houthi said. 'The fighters in Gaza, despite limited capabilities and an intense blockade, stood firm against the heavily armed enemy, which mobilized its forces in Gaza, with American and British support, aiming to destroy resistance activities and eliminate any jihadi movement.' Despite significant sacrifices, including the martyrdom of leaders like Ismail Haniyeh, Al-Arouri, and Al-Sinwar, may Allah have mercy on them, the fighters’ determination remained unbroken, he affirmed. 'Despite widespread Arab official betrayal and negative stances from certain Arab regimes and the Palestinian Authority, Allah granted the fighters success and steadfastness,' Houthi added, 'Despite genocide, total blockade, and destruction of life’s essentials, the steadfastness of the Palestinian people achieved meaningful outcomes.' Sayyed Houthi noted that the negotiations and their intervals were true arenas for political confrontation against immense American and Western pressures. This round of confrontation with the Israeli enemy marks a pivotal chapter in the history of the struggle against the 'Israeli' occupation, Houthi added. Sayyed Houthi vowed resumption of military attacks if the Zionist attacks on Gaza are resumed, saying ''We are observing the ceasefire with our finger on the trigger.' 'Hezbollah contributed significantly to striking the Israeli enemy, participating in major operations and comprehensive confrontations, and inflicting substantial depletion on the enemy.' Hezbollah's role in inflicting severe losses and damages during its jihadi efforts and resistance against 'Israeli' aggression on Lebanon is remarkable, Sayyed Houthi affirmed. The support front in Iraq continued its operations until recently, as some factions persisted until victory was achieved, he added. The Yemeni leader indicated that the Islamic Republic of Iran consistently provided unwavering support despite pressures and temptations, along with its unprecedented major operations, exemplified by the 'True Promise.' Sayyed Houthi confirmed that Yemen's support front amazed the world with its steadfastness, popular momentum, and high-level commitment to the cause. Speaking about Yemen's contributions is not for boasting but rather fulfilling a sacred duty and religious responsibility, he noted. 'The Yemeni experience is significant for building on its achievements for the present and future. The Yemeni stance stemmed from an authentic faith-based launch and a Quranic orientation of the noble Yemeni people.' The US and its allies failed to influence Yemen's position which sincerely reflected the people's will and aspirations, he added. 'The Yemeni people expressed their desire to actively participate alongside the Palestinian fighters in direct combat. However, some governments, regimes, and countries between us and Palestine did not respond to requests for safe land routes to access Palestine.' The Americans sent us a message of threats, warnings, and intimidation. However, by Allah's guidance, we responded decisively and carried out the first operation when the 'Israeli' enemy committed the major crime of targeting Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, Sayyed Houthi clarified. Houthi noted that the operation targeting Umm Al-Rashrash and southern Palestine marked the first phase of our military support operations, utilizing our maximum available capacity. 'The Americans and their allies were shocked by Yemen's unprecedented use of ballistic missiles in naval operations. For the first time in history, ballistic missiles, typically used for fixed land targets, were employed to strike moving targets at sea.' The use of ballistic missiles in naval operations resulted from the missile forces' technical expertise and innovation, Houthi confirmed. 'Our armed forces succeeded during that phase in halting the Israeli enemy's direct maritime activities in the Red Sea using its own ships. The American and Israeli enemies were greatly disturbed by the complete halt of the export and import of goods through the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab.' Sayyed Houthi emphasized the maritime blockade on the 'Israeli' enemy had a direct impact on its economy. Aggressive operations against our country were accompanied by extensive aerial surveillance using satellites and all types of reconnaissance aircraft, he added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2317801	2025-01-20T09:40:51-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-062354000173739453710.png
Hezbollah Expresses Pride in Gaza’s Victory, Reiterates Support f...	Hezbollah congratulated, in a statement issued on Monday, the great Palestinian people as well as their valiant resistance, all the resistance forces that supported Gaza, the Arab and Islamic nation, and the free people of the world on this great victory that came as a culmination of the legendary and historic steadfastness, over more than 15 months since the start of the Al-Aqsa Flood epic, which constituted an example to be followed in confronting the Zionist-American aggression the whole region. On this great occasion in the history of the Palestinian cause and the struggle against the Zionist enemy, the statement added, Hezbollah is concerned to emphasize the following: 1- This historic victory confirms once again that the option of resistance is the only choice capable of deterring the occupation and frustrating its aggressive plots. It represents a new strategic defeat for the Zionist enemy and its supporters and confirms that the time of imposing dictates is over, and that the will of free peoples is unbreakable, and even stronger than all the machines of Zionist and American war and terrorism. 2- Reaching a ceasefire agreement by imposing the conditions of the resistance and without giving up the rights of the Palestinian people represents a political victory added to the military achievement, and indicates that the occupation was unable to achieve any of its goals by force or break the will and steadfastness of the Palestinian people. 3- The Palestinian resistance has proven during this battle that it is strong and capable of breaking the arrogance and tyranny of the Zionist enemy, despite all its crimes and brutal aggression. It stressed that this temporary entity is a fragile entity that has no ability to survive and continue, and that it will not enjoy security or stability as long as it continues its aggression against our people, our land and its sanctities. 4- This victory was achieved thanks to the resistance, steadfastness, perseverance and patience of the Palestinian people, children, women, elderly and men, and thanks to the blood of the martyrs who rose in the most honorable and greatest battle, foremost among them the martyr leaders, martyr Ismail Haniyeh and martyr Yahya Sinwar, who led the fields of honor and redemption, embodied the highest meanings of sacrifice and giving, and wrote with their blood epics of heroism that thwarted the enemy’s goals and projects. This blood will remain a beacon that guides our nation towards victory and freedom. 5- What the Zionist occupation did during this war by committing the most heinous crimes and genocide, which targeted civilians, children, women and the elderly, will remain a historical witness for the barbarism of this entity and its supporters and will remain engraved in the memory of generations, and a stigma on the forehead of the silent and indifferent international community. 6- The United States of America is a full partner in the crimes and genocide committed by the enemy against the Palestinian people, and it bears full responsibility due to its continuous and ongoing support for this occupation militarily, security-wise, intelligence-wise, politically and diplomatically. 7- We hail the efforts of the forces of the support fronts, who are partners in the great victory and have played a pivotal role in supporting the resistance and strengthening its steadfastness and presented a constellation of righteous martyrs all the way to Al-Quds. We salute the Islamic Republic of Iran, which has been a fundamental pillar of the resistance's steadfastness and has endured all the pressures and risks for the sake of Palestine. We salute the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, whose drones and missiles have not stopped and have overcome all obstacles in support of Gaza. We salute the strength and courage of our mujahid brothers in Yemen who imposed a siege on the Zionist entity and challenged the fleets of major countries in order to support Palestine. 8- Hezbollah expresses its pride and honor in this blessed victory of the Palestinian people and their resistance, which it has been a partner in achieving through the steadfastness, perseverance and sacrifices of the resistance and its people in Lebanon, which sacrificed for this purpose the most precious of what it possesses, the master of the Ummah’s martyrs, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallahb along with Sayyed Sayyed Al-Hashemi Hashem Safieddine, a large number of leaders and mujahidin, and martyrs from its loyal and faithful people who carried the banner of defending Palestine with all strength and faith. Hezbollah renews its confirmation of its permanent support for the Palestinian people and their resistance in the battle of liberation and dignity until the end of the occupation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2317746	2025-01-20T07:25:06-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-027725400166239486010.jpg

As residents of Gaza returned to their homes, the Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, was seen among the people. According to Amir Bohbot, a military analyst for the Israeli website Walla, the survival of Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida represents 'a failure of the Israeli security and military establishments.' Bohbot said the Israeli authorities have neglected the importance of 'awareness and psychological warfare' in the digital age. Amos Harel, a military affairs analyst for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, commented on the appearance of hundreds of Hamas fighters just kilometers from where Israeli forces were stationed until recently. Harel said this display showed Hamas' military strength and signs of civil control in Gaza. Harel noted that Hamas' presence is already being felt in the northern part of the Strip, including Gaza City, Jabalia and Beit Hanoun - areas from which the Israeli army withdrew only at the end of the latest war. The analyst predicted that 'crowds will begin to flow north' once the Netzarim axis southwest of Gaza City is evacuated, estimating that over a million people will return. Haaretz also reported that the 'full details of the Israeli concessions have begun to emerge,' including the release of Palestinian prisoners, which is 'provoking strong reactions among Israelis.' The newspaper stressed that 'Israel was required to make major concessions' to complete the prisoner release deal. Harel concluded that 'Israel largely lost the war on October 7, 2023,' and that everything since then has been 'an attempt to minimize some of the damage.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2317625	2025-01-20T02:57:38-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-07025520017373706501.jpg
Hamas: Hezbollah Decision to Support Gaza Written in Gold in Hist...	Hamas top official Osama Hamadan on Sunday laud Hezbollah for its decision to back the resistance in Gaza, as he hailed support fronts in Yemen and Iraq. In an interview with Al-Manar, hours after the ceasefire in Gaza took effect, the Hamas official said the Israeli occupation announced major slogans for the war, but it backed down from all these titles. 'The Israeli occupation 'wanted to eradicate the resistance, but it was forced to sit at the negotiating table. It wanted to release the captives by force, but it could only achieve that through negotiations. Meanwhile, the resistance remained steadfast in the battlefield by the will of its people,' he said. The Hamas official hailed the support fronts for backing Gaza its resistance and people in face of the Israeli genocidal war throughout 471 days. 'The international community realized the existence of a latent force within the nation, represented by the fronts which did all it can in a bid to support Gaza.' 'Our brothers in Yemen blocked the sea in face of the enemy, while the brothers in Iraq broke down the distance barrier. As for Lebanon, Hezbollah advanced and offered support despite sacrifices,' Hamdan told Al-Manar. 'It must be written in gold in history the decision of the Hezbollah leadership, led by the Master of the Martyrs of the Nation, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, to support and back the Palestinian resistance since the first day of the war, even before the coordination meetings between the Lebanese and Palestinian resistance. This decision represented the unity of the nation and its determination to confront the occupation.' Late Hezbollah S.G. Sayyed Nasrallah in a meeting with Islamic Jihad and Hamas leaders (October 2023). He noted that the battlefield was Gaza, 'but it was not a battle for Gaza alone, but a battle to liberate Palestine and Al-Quds (Jerusalem). The war was a prelude for the great operation of liberation.' 'When the battle is this big, it is natural for the resistance leaders to lead the ranks of martyrs and sacrifices. These leaders have carried the banner of resistance for decades, and their peoples and masses have trusted them.' Hamdan said that Netanyahu thought he could end the resistance in Gaza. 'Netanyahu failed, while the resistance remained steadfast in the battlefield, and secured achievements.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2317471	2025-01-20T01:10:39-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-05332710017373640346.jpg

Al-Qassam Brigades Abu Obaida: Gaza Ceasefire Marks a Turning Poi...	In a recorded message on Sunday, Abu Obeida, the spokesperson for the Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, addressed the public following the implementation of the ceasefire in Gaza. During his speech, Abu Obeida discussed the ceasefire agreement and the course of the battle that Palestinian resistance forces fought against the Israeli occupation over the past 15 months. He highlighted the transformative impact of 'Operation Al-Aqsa Flood' in the region, emphasizing the new dynamics it has established in the ongoing struggle against the occupier. 'The Palestinian people have made unprecedented sacrifices for their freedom and their holy sites over the course of 471 days,' Abu Obaida stated. He further expressed that the immense sacrifices and bloodshed of the Palestinian people would not be in vain, affirming, 'We deeply feel the great pain our people are enduring, but this is the cost of liberating our land, people, and sacred sites.' Ceasefire Agreement Implementation In reference to the ceasefire agreement that took effect on Sunday afternoon, Al-Qassam Brigades' Abu Obeida said that reaching a ceasefire agreement to end Israeli aggression had been the resistance's goal for many months, even from the very beginning of the aggression. He added that the Al-Qassam Brigades and other resistance factions are fully committed to the agreement but emphasized that its success depends on the Israeli occupation's adherence to it. He also called on mediators to hold the occupation accountable for implementing the ceasefire. Abu Obeida remarked that '471 days have passed since the historic 'Operation Al-Aqsa Flood,' which drove the final nail into the coffin of the occupation.' He noted that while the battle began at the Gaza borders, it significantly altered the region’s dynamics and introduced new equations into the struggle with the occupier. New Fronts and International Support Abu Obeida further explained that the battle had opened new fronts and forced the Israeli enemy to turn to international powers for assistance. He extended his gratitude to Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance in Lebanon, Ansarullah in Yemen, and the Islamic Resistance in Iraq for their unwavering support of the Gaza resistance, describing them as 'companions in arms' who paid a heavy price during the battle. The Al-Qassam spokesperson also praised the Jordanians who crossed the borders and launched attacks on 'Israel,' underscoring that all attempts to normalize relations between 'Israel' and the region would be met with the 'tsunami of awareness and resistance from free nations.'

He stated, 'The Al-Qassam Brigades fought alongside all resistance factions as one force across the entire Gaza Strip, delivering decisive blows to the enemy.' He praised the bravery and determination of the fighters, saying, 'Our fighters displayed exceptional courage and resilience until the final hours of the battle, fighting under seemingly impossible circumstances.' Abu Obeida noted that the last confrontation with the Israeli occupation was an uneven one, both in terms of combat capabilities and military ethics. 'While we struck the enemy's forces, they resorted to new and horrific methods of brutality against our people,' he added. He highlighted the leadership of the resistance, pointing to the sacrifices of figures such as Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, and Saleh Al-Arouri, who led the battle alongside the countless martyrs. Popular Support Abu Obeida also touched on the widespread popular support for the Gaza resistance, noting that they receive millions of messages of solidarity from across the Arab and Islamic nations. Looking ahead, he stressed that the major responsibility now lies with the Palestinians in the West Bank. He specifically praised Jenin, calling it 'the sister of Gaza in courage and resilience.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2317207	2025-01-19T10:50:04-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-074098600173731225310.png
Senior IRGC Commanders: Gaza Ceasefire Agreement ‘Greatest Defeat...	Since the onset of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, the Islamic Republic of Iran has emerged as a steadfast pillar of support for the Palestinian cause, playing a crucial role in Gaza's victory that forced the Israeli enemy to cease its aggression. Massive public demonstrations across Iranian cities, along with unwavering military and diplomatic efforts, have showcased genuine solidarity with Palestinians. Over the past year, Iranians have united in street rallies and voiced their strong support for Gaza. This solidarity extended beyond slogans to material aid, with Iranians, from children to adults, contributing generous donations of money and gold to support Gaza’s resistance. Iranians wave Palestinian flags on November 3, 2023, as they gather in a Tehran square (Source: AFP) Iran's commitment has also been evident in its significant military assistance, notably during Operation Al-Quds Promise, which bolstered Gaza's defense capabilities. Iran has even lost martyrs in the fight for Gaza, symbolizing its deep-rooted dedication to the resistance. On the international stage, key figures, including martyrs President Ibrahim Raisi and Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, alongside President Masoud Pezeshkian, led a robust diplomatic campaign, advocating for an end to the Israeli aggression and amplifying Gaza’s voice globally. In a show of solidarity with Palestinians, Iranians across the country participated in nationwide rallies to celebrate Gaza’s successful ceasefire agreement with Israeli enemy (Jan 17, 2025) IRGC's Qaani: Gaza Ceasefire Marks a Crushing Defeat for Enemy In a powerful speech during a ceremony honoring medical teams who treated Lebanese victims of explosions caused by wireless communication devices, Brigadier General Esmail Qaani, commander of the Quds Force in Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, described the Gaza ceasefire as 'the greatest defeat' for the Israeli enemy, calling it 'the pinnacle of humiliation' for the Zionist regime. Brigadier General Qaani highlighted that after over 15 months of unrestrained Israeli aggression targeting Palestinians and Lebanese, the Zionist regime was forced to accept a ceasefire. He described the Zionist entity as a 'bloodthirsty entity and a child killer,' stating that its acceptance of the ceasefire reflected its humiliation and loss. He emphasized that the agreement represented a forced acknowledgment of Palestinian strength. 'This agreement was imposed on 'Israel,' demonstrating the strength of Palestinian resolve,' Brigadier General Qaani concluded. Revolutionary Guards’ Deputy: Israeli Enemy’s Collapse and the Road to Jerusalem Meanwhile, General Mohammad Reza Naghdi, Deputy Coordinator of the IRGC, emphasized the Israeli enemy's failure on multiple fronts. He stated that the imposed ceasefire is evidence that 'Israel' can no longer resist, as it was forced to accept all the red lines set by Gaza’s steadfast resistance. 'The martyrs of the resistance have dealt fatal blows to the Israeli body, and only one step remains toward Jerusalem. We, the Basij forces, are ready to take that step, Brig. Naghdi asserted. He concluded by reiterating that, under the command of the Supreme Leader, Iran is prepared to return to the battlefield and 'cleanse the region from the disgrace of the Israeli enemy.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2317031	2025-01-19T08:17:04-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/05/manar-09782740016848369817.jpg
Video | Ceasefire in Gaza Takes Effect, Ending 471 Days of Israel...	The ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip officially came into effect on Sunday morning, marking the end of 471 days of relentless military aggression by Israeli occupation forces on the besieged enclave. Initially scheduled to start at 8:30 AM, the ceasefire was delayed after the Israeli occupation army insisted that Hamas fulfill its commitments, including submitting the list of female detainees set to be released. Airstrikes on Gaza continued until Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office confirmed that the ceasefire would commence at 11:15 AM local time (9:15 GMT). The Israeli enemy later confirmed it had received the list of hostages set to be released in the first phase of the prisoner exchange, a key component of the agreement. Celebrations Erupt Across Gaza As the ceasefire took hold, joyful chants and celebrations echoed throughout Gaza. Residents poured into the streets, celebrating the end of the devastation and expressing support for the resistance. In central Gaza, crowds marched with slogans praising the resilience of the Palestinian people. In the north and Rafah, displaced families began returning to their homes, many of which bear the scars of the conflict. Meanwhile, security forces were deployed across the Strip to maintain order and safeguard public and private property. First Moments After Ceasefire in Gaza: Residents Celebrate with Civil Defense and Medical Teams Hamas Affirms Commitment to Ceasefire Terms The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas announced its full commitment to the ceasefire terms on Sunday morning, addressing the delay in submitting the prisoner release list as being due to technical and logistical reasons. The group hailed the agreement as 'a testament to the heroic endurance of the Palestinian people and the steadfastness of Gaza’s resistance over 15 months of aggression.' Comprehensive Plan to Restore Life On Saturday, the Palestinian government in Gaza unveiled a comprehensive plan to gradually restore normal life following the ceasefire.

Despite the agreement, the Israeli enemy warplanes launched airstrikes on Gaza, resulting in multiple casualties. The strikes, reportedly ordered by Netanyahu himself, claimed the lives of several Palestinians and left at least 25 others injured. Following the attacks, Netanyahu’s office unilaterally announced a new ceasefire timing, setting it to take effect at 11:15 AM.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2316866	2025-01-19T04:57:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-09612250017372910913.jpg
Zionist MK Itamar Ben Gvir Resigns Over Prisoner Exchange Deal an...	Israeli so-called 'National Security' Minister Itamar Ben Gvir officially resigned from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government on Sunday, along with his three party ministers, following his earlier threats to withdraw if the controversial prisoner exchange deal and ceasefire agreement with Hamas were approved. The ceasefire took effect Sunday morning. Ben Gvir's party, Otzma Yehudit, announced its withdrawal from the governing coalition in a strongly worded statement, condemning the agreement as a 'shameful capitulation' to Hamas. The party criticized the deal for including the release of 'hundreds of murderers,' some of whom will return to the occupied city of Jerusalem and the West Bank. It also decried the ceasefire, claiming it undermined the military gains achieved during the recent conflict, marked by the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces from Gaza. In the statement, Otzma Yehudit accused the government of 'surrendering to Hamas' and formally declared that Ben Gvir, along with Ministers Yitzhak Wasserlauf and Amichai Eliyahu, submitted their resignations to Netanyahu.

Israeli Supreme Court Rejects Petitions Against Prisoner Exchange In a related development, the Israeli enemy’s Supreme Court dismissed petitions filed against the prisoner exchange agreement with Hamas, part of the ceasefire deal. The petitions, submitted by organizations Bechirot BeChayim and Almagor, as well as families of Zionists, sought to prevent the release of Palestinian prisoners. The court ruled it could not intervene, citing a lack of legal grounds, as reported by the Zionist public broadcaster KAN. The petitioners had argued that releasing security prisoners, many of whom were involved in past attacks, could harm the Israeli occupation security and enable their return to armed resistance. Under the terms of the agreement, the Israeli occupation will release 1,904 Palestinian prisoners, including 737 detainees held in Israeli prisons and 1,167 from Gaza detained during recent ground operations. In return, 33 of the 98 Zionist captives held by Gaza resistance factions will be freed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2316822	2025-01-19T03:37:05-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/06/manar-03423360016866602357-e1686660305798.jpg
Aoun to Guterres: Lebanon Insists on Israeli Withdrawal from Sout...	President of the Republic, General Joseph Aoun, informed UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during their meeting this morning at Baabda Palace that 'Lebanon is committed to the need for Israeli forces’ withdrawal from its occupied territories in the south within the deadline set by the agreement reached on November 27.' President Aoun underlined that 'the continued Israeli land and air violations, particularly in bombarding houses and destroying border villages, completely contradict with the ceasefire agreement and is considered a continued breach of Lebanese sovereignty and the will of the international community to restore stability to southern Lebanon.' Aoun considered Guterres' visit to Lebanon a week after his election as President of the Republic 'a message of hope to the Lebanese,' thanking the United Nations organizations for the support provided to Lebanon in all fields, hailing the role of the international peacekeeping forces operating in the south and the steadfastness of its members in the face of the Israeli attacks that targeted its centers, saluting the souls of the 'UNIFIL' martyrs and stressing full coordination with the Lebanese army. Additionally, President Aoun raised the issue of Israel's burning of agricultural lands in the south, aspiring for the help of the United Nations especially the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), for farmers to restore the investment status of their lands once again. Aoun also touched on the readiness of the Lebanese army to replace the Israelis immediately after their withdrawal, and requested the assistance of the United Nations to secure the return of displaced Syrians to their country, now that the political and security reasons that led to their displacement are no longer in place. Israeli Violations The Israeli occupation forces continued on Saturday violating the ceasefire in South Lebanon, delaying their withdrawal from the area and the deployment of the Lebanese military units in the border towns. In this regard, the Zionist occupation forces advanced into Bint Jbeil outskirts, Wadli Slouki, Houla, Mais Al-Jabal and Al-Khiam barrens, bulldozing lands, opening fire, detonating houses and looting collectibles. من عمليات التوغل العدوانية التي نفذتها قوات الاحتلال في حي 'الدبش' في أطراف مدينة بنت جبيل استغلالا لقرار وقف اطلاق النار . pic.twitter.com/Hl1bF6h8Aw — شعيب 🇱🇧 (@cheib1970) January 18, 2025	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2316448	2025-01-18T12:23:10-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-03311400017372317791.png

Countdown to Gaza Ceasefire: Hope Amidst Devastation	The countdown to the ceasefire, set to take effect on Sunday, is filled with a mix of anticipation and fear for Gaza's residents. As airstrikes by the occupation forces continue relentlessly, many fear becoming the conflict's final casualties. Al-Akhbar War Journalist Youssef Fares reports the details from Gaza. Talks of post-ceasefire plans dominate conversations. In northern Gaza, displaced residents, forced from their homes over 100 days ago, are preparing to return to areas ravaged by bombing. Mohammad Salha, displaced from Tal Al-Zaatar, expressed his priorities: 'The first thing I will do is search for my relatives, whom I haven’t been able to contact for 60 days. If they have been martyred, we will honor them and bury their bodies, and then we will check on the state of our homes, if nothing is left then we’ll have to look for shelter again.' Many displaced families face an uncertain future. Ahed Ali, who is staying with relatives in southern Gaza, shared his concerns: 'We are happy, by God, that the war is over, but our concerns are great. My family and I are staying in the home of our displaced relatives in the south. When the ceasefire takes effect, we will have to search for a new shelter. Our house in Jabalia is destroyed, and we must leave the house to its owners, may God bless them for having us.' Others, like Samah Hijazi, are focused on finding loved ones. 'The first thing I will do immediately after the ceasefire begins is to search for the body of my brother Mohammad, then honor him by burying him to calm his grieving mother’s heart,' she said. Sources told Al-Akhbar that hundreds of bodies still lie in the streets of northern Gaza. Palestinian Civil Defense and medical teams are coordinating efforts to recover them and clear unexploded ordnance left behind by the Israeli occupation before residents return to their neighborhoods. Meanwhile, the violence continues. Journalist Amer Sultan's family home in Jabalia Al-Balad was bombed by 'Israel' on Friday, killing his family, including his wife, children, and parents. Rescue efforts were delayed until the next afternoon. Palestinian journalist Amer al-Sultan lost 9 members of his family: his mother, his brothers, and his sisters in an Israeli strike that targeted their family home in the northern #Gaza Strip.

The group asserted that ‘Israel’ 'failed to achieve its aggressive goals and succeeded only in committing war crimes that disgrace humanity.' According to the statement, Hamas 'forced the occupation to halt its aggression against our people and withdraw, despite Netanyahu's attempts to prolong the war and commit more massacres.' The group vowed that the blood of the martyrs who died during the conflict 'will not be in vain,' and that 'the enemy's leaders and soldiers will be pursued and held accountable for these crimes, no matter how long it takes.' 'The occupation failed to achieve its aggressive goals, and only succeeded in committing war crimes that would make humanity blush.' Looking ahead, Hamas emphasized that the immediate priority is the lifting of the Israeli siege on Gaza, providing relief to the Palestinian people, facilitating the return of the displaced, and initiating the reconstruction of the devastated enclave. The group indicated that this has been a focus of their leadership since the start of the conflict. Regarding the humanitarian aid protocol agreed upon under the supervision of mediators, Hamas noted that it ensures the implementation of relief, shelter, and reconstruction measures for the people of Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2316217	2025-01-18T05:13:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/05/manar-081753800171534147910.jpg
Abu Hamza: Israeli airstrikes before ceasefire could lead to the ...	Abu Hamza, a spokesperson for the Al-Quds Brigades, issued a warning on Saturday via Telegram. He urged the families of Israeli captives to demand that the Israeli occupation military refrain from heavy airstrikes in the remaining hours before a ceasefire takes effect. Abu Hamza cautioned that such airstrikes could 'result in the killing of your sons while the resistance makes final field arrangements for their release.' He emphasized that the families of the enemy's captives must demand the Zionist army halt the intense bombardment of the final hours, as it could lead to the death of the hostages while the resistance completes arrangements for their release.

Sheikh Qassem Hails Gaza Legendry Steadfastness, Calls on ‘Israel...	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem congratulated Gaza, its people and resistance over the ceasefire deal with the Zionist entity, hailing them over their epic steadfastness in face of the Israeli genocide. In a televised speech addressing an international conference in support of Gaza entitled: 'Gaza Icon of Resistance,' Sheikh Qassem stressed that the resistance in Lebanon is persistent stressing that any scheme to exclude Hezbollah from the political scene in Lebanon is doomed to fail. He stressed that the Israeli violations to the ceasefire in Lebanon 'can’t go on,' calling on the Israeli enemy 'not to test our patience.' Al-Aqsa Flood and Gaza Ceasefire Sheikh Qaasem stressed that Op. Al-Aqsa Flood restored momentum to the Palestinian cause. In this context, he pointed to major shift in the international stance towards Palestine, citing the mass protests across the world, especially the West in support of Gaza. 'The war on Gaza is a US-Israeli genocidal scheme aimed at wiping out Palestine of the map,' the Hezbollah S.G. said. Palestinian resistance fighters near a rocket launcher in Gaza (photo from archive). However, the Palestinian resistance has foiled this dangerous plan, his eminence stressed, in remarks carried by Al-Manar. 'The great sacrifices along with the legendary steadfastness prove that the great people of Palestine are worthful of regaining their land and they are capable of doing so. Steadfastness now is the foundation of the future.' He stressed that the people in Gaza came out glorious and the resistance hasn’t laid down its arms, hailing Hamas, the Islamic Jihad and other Palestinian resistance groups over their epic steadfastness. 'Congratulations to the Palestinian people, to the people of Gaza and to the resistance fighters, for this agreement that has not changed from what was proposed in May 2024. This indicates the steadfastness of the resistance, and that it achieved its demands while the Israeli enemy was not able to impose its terms.' Isolation of ‘Israel’ and Support Fronts Meanwhile, Sheikh Qassem pointed to the isolation which the Zionist entity have been witnessing in the latest months. 'Israel is now an international pariah; its image is bleak. The condemnation of the International Criminal Court is enough to know the extent of this great impact that the resistance of the Palestinian people has had and how it has exposed this Israeli entity. The Israelis won’t embrace stability in occupied Palestine. Wait for the coming days and months to see the repercussions. As for the internal disputes within the Zionist entity, they will increase, God willing, and there is no solution except for Palestine to return to its people.' The Hezbollah S.G. then hailed all those who stood by Gaza and Palestine, specifically naming the Islamic Republic of Iran, led by the Supreme Leader Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei. 'History will record, as the field did, those who supported Gaza with sacrifices and contributed to foiling the Israeli enemy’s project. The most prominent contributors are the Islamic Republic of Iran, led by Imam Khamenei who has not missed an opportunity to emphasize standing with the Palestinian people to liberate it from the sea to the river, and has provided all kinds of military, moral, material and political support.' Sheikh Qassem also praised the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran IRGC and its external branch Al-Quds along with the arm’s former head Hajj Qassem Suleimani who was 'truly the martyr of Al-Quds.' Iran has been punished for decades because it directed its compass towards liberating,' his eminence said, saluting the Iranian nation for supporting Palestine. 'Lebanon Offered Master of the Nation’s Martyrs' As for Lebanon, Sheikh Qassem stressed that the country has offered 'its all' via Hezbollah, Amal Movement and the Lebanese people during the last Israeli war. 'Lebanon and Hezbollah offered the master of the nation’s martyrs Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah along with the Hashemite cleric Sayyed Hashem Safeiddine and many other leaders, commanders, fighters, martyrs and injured people.' 'The confrontations against Hezbollah in Lebanon contributed to the victory of Gaza. The resistance fighters stood as an impregnable barrier against the Israeli advance on the front in legendary battles, and their honorable families protected, supported and backed them. Hezbollah and the resistance fighters have thwarted the Israeli goal of ending the resistance in Lebanon, which emerged proud and with its head held high.' 'Hezbollah Won’t Be Excluded from the Political Scene' On the other hand, Sheikh Qassem stressed that Hezbollah won’t be excluded from the political scene in Lebanon. 'The resistance in Lebanon will remain resistant to the American-Israeli project. It is persistent, strong and ready to preserve the blood of the martyrs in a bid to liberate the land and to liberate Palestine.'

Terrorist Attack Kills Two Prominent Iranian Judges in Tehran	Two high-profile Iranian judges were assassinated in a terrorist shooting attack at the Supreme Court building in downtown Tehran on Saturday morning. A shooting incident occurred outside Tehran's Palace of Justice moments ago, resulting in the martyrdom of two judges.

'A person armed with a small weapon entered the room of the two veteran judges before noon Saturday and martyred them,' said Judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir. The judges were known for working on cases 'fighting crimes against national security, espionage and terrorism,' the state news agency IRNA reported. Preliminary investigations indicate the attacker was not involved in any cases before the Supreme Court. Reports suggest another person was also injured in the attack. 'Right after the terrorist act, an attempt was made to arrest the gunman, who then quickly committed suicide,' the judiciary's statement read. The statement said an investigation had been launched to identify and arrest those behind the assassinations. Over the past year, the Iranian judiciary has taken measures to prosecute agents and elements affiliated with Israel, the U.S. and terrorist groups. Razini, 71, held several important positions in Iran's judiciary and was previously targeted in a 1998 assassination attempt.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2316052	2025-01-18T03:27:18-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-08165400017371996322.jpg

President Aoun Welcomes French Counterpart, Underlines Israeli Wi...	The Lebanese President Joseph Aoun hosted, on Friday at Baabda Palace, his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron who had arrived earlier in Beirut. 'I hope you will bear witness to the entire world that the Lebanese people's trust in their country and state has been restored, and that the world's confidence in Lebanon must fully return because the true and genuine Lebanon has revived,' Aoun told Macron. President Aoun also underlined the importance of maintaining the ceasefire deal and the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon, underscoring the liberation of the prisoners and the reconstruction project. President Aoun hoped that Macron 'instruct Total to return to continue oil exploration operations in the offshore oil blocks.' For his part, Macron affirmed France’s steadfast support for Lebanon, commending Aoun's efforts in ending the political vacuum and steering Lebanon toward recovery. 'France has stood by the Lebanese people over the past years,' Macron said, highlighting his country’s commitment to Lebanon’s stability and sovereignty. Moreover, Macron underscored the importance of Lebanon remaining immune to foreign interference, describing it as a vital condition for the continued implementation of the ceasefire. Macron further reiterated France’s support for the Lebanese Army, particularly in their deployment in southern Lebanon. 'We will continue to support the army to ensure it can extend its presence and maintain security in the south,' Macron stated. Additionally, the French President expressed France’s readiness to collaborate with Lebanon in demarcating its borders along the Blue Line. Later on, House Speaker Nabih Berri and the caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati arrived at Baabda Palace, where a bilateral meeting was held between and Berri. President Aoun also met with Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam at the Baabda Presidential Palace to tackle the cabinet formation. The two statesmen agreed on a speedy process and a preliminary lineup. Salam also stated that he informed Macron that any delay of the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon threatens the regional stability.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2315667	2025-01-17T10:02:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-033762800173713692410.jpg
Speaker Berri Welcomes PM-designate Salam: Meeting Was Promising	House Speaker, Nabih Berri welcomed, on Friday at the Second Presidency in Ain al-Tineh, Prime Minister-designate, Nawaf Salam to discuss the latest developments related the Lebanese cabinet formation. After the meeting, Salam stated, 'Speaker Berri and I are on the same page, following the constitution. I will remain in contact with him until the government is formed,' adding that parliamentary consultations did not conclude yesterday. 'I am continuing them today. There is a consensus among parliamentary blocs on the urgent need to revive the country and work toward its recovery, and I pledge to achieve this,' Salam noted, affirming there is no alternative to dialogue and understanding. 'No one will obstruct or be allowed to obstruct the government formation process,' asserted Salam, revealing an initial plan to present to the President. 'There are no hurdles hindering the government formation,' Salam concluded, pledging to ensure its success. In turn, Speaker Berri commented briefly, describing the meeting with the PM-designate as 'promising'. Salam was designated on Monday by President Joseph Aoun on the basis of binding parliamentary consultations. However, lack of coordination among the parliamentary blocs pushed the 'Loyalty to Resistance' and 'Development and Liberation' to boycott the non-binding parliamentary consultations held by the PM-designate. The latest political contacts eased the tensions and led to Berri-Salam meeting which would enhance the new government formation on the basis of national consensus.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2315535	2025-01-17T07:07:56-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-00419080017371264665.png

On the same day, the US-Israeli-UK coalition conducted airstrikes on Yemen’s capital, Sana’a, coinciding with a nationwide march supporting Gaza’s resistance. The coalition also bombed the Hizyaz power station in Sanhan District with eight airstrikes, severely damaging vital infrastructure. These attacks are a direct response to Yemen’s unwavering solidarity with Gaza in its fight against Israeli genocide. Since November 2023, the Yemeni Armed Forces have successfully targeted Israeli-linked vessels in the Red Sea using missiles and drones, as well as striking vital Israeli targets in occupied territory. In response, Washington and London began airstrikes on Yemen in early 2024.

Yemen’s Ansarullah Leader Warns: Gaza Ceasefire Hinges on Israeli...	The leader of Yemen’s Ansarullah movement, Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi, outlined Yemen’s stance on the Gaza ceasefire agreement, asserting that military operations will continue if Zionist violations persist. Speaking on Thursday evening, Sayyed Al-Houthi stressed that Yemen’s position aligns with that of Palestinian resistance factions and will remain steadfast throughout the implementation of the ceasefire. Al-Houthi stated that Yemen’s support for Gaza is unwavering, warning that any Israeli regression or massacres will prompt renewed military action in solidarity with the Palestinian people. He further emphasized Yemen’s commitment to enhancing military capabilities for more effective support of the Palestinian cause, reiterating that 'the path to supporting Palestine remains ongoing.' Yemen’s Military Strikes Shake Israeli Enemy Defense Discussing Yemen’s role in Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, Al-Houthi highlighted the remarkable impact of Yemen’s resistance, which surprised the world with powerful strikes against the Israeli enemy and its US and British allies. Despite the challenging conditions facing the Yemeni people, Ansarullah forces carried out 1,255 operations, including ballistic missile launches, drone attacks, and naval operations. Aftermath of a Yemeni drone strike targeting Yavne in occupied Palestine, Monday, December 11, 2024. Al-Houthi praised the success of Yemeni Armed Forces in undermining the effectiveness of US naval fleets, rendering them incapable of safeguarding Israeli shipping routes. He noted that the Israeli occupation now faces significant challenges in intercepting Yemeni attacks, which have exposed vulnerabilities in its defense systems. Escalating Impact on Zionist Economy The Ansarullah leader emphasized the escalating military operations' profound impact on the Israeli enemy, particularly in aviation and economic sectors. Yemeni strikes on Israeli vessels have led to disrupted trade routes, forcing airlines to reconsider using Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport. He pointed to the Israeli enemy’s failure to achieve its objectives, with Yemeni operations severely affecting the morale of Israeli forces and its economy. These setbacks have compelled the Israeli enemy to explore political solutions after exhausting military options. Criticism of Arab Inaction, International Complicity Al-Houthi condemned the lack of Arab action in supporting the Palestinian cause, noting that this inaction has emboldened the Israeli enemy's crimes against Palestinians. He also criticized the complicity of some Arab regimes and highlighted the United Nations' failure to hold the Israeli occupation entity accountable despite claims of neutrality. Hezbollah’s Role and Regional Resistance Sayyed Al-Houthi commended Hezbollah for its significant contributions to supporting the Palestinian resistance, acknowledging its sacrifices and pivotal role in confronting the Zionist enemy. He also praised the Iraqi resistance's involvement, noting its support for the Palestinian cause through various means. Call for Mass Mobilization The Ansarullah leader called on the Yemeni people to participate in a massive demonstration planned for Friday, emphasizing its importance as a culmination of continuous public mobilization over the past 15 months. He stressed that such displays of solidarity underscore Yemen’s unwavering support for Palestine and readiness to confront any Israeli escalation. Al-Houthi concluded by highlighting Yemen’s sacrifices, with 106 martyrs and 328 injured, as a testament to the nation’s steadfast commitment to defending Palestinian rights. Yemen’s support, he said, transcends rhetoric and includes military, political, and popular dimensions, rooted in the country’s deep faith and principles.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2315029	2025-01-16T12:42:32-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-01108620017291797507.png

Speaking to Al-Manar, she stated, 'Our opposition to colonialism is a principled stance and an ongoing battle that will only end with the eradication of this colonial entity.' Mrs. Karaki referenced recent Israeli economic reports warning of a 'spiral collapse,' citing the exit of over 40,000 companies from the market and the suspension of numerous projects. She argued that continued global corporate support for the Zionist economy amounts to 'artificial life support for a dying system.' 'Boycotts are not merely an economic tool; they embody widespread popular rejection of any form of normalization or support for the occupation,' she added. Tangible Results of Boycott Campaigns Mrs. Karaki highlighted the tangible impact of global economic boycotts in reducing support for the occupation. For example, she noted that Puma ended its sponsorship of the Israeli Football Association after sustained boycott efforts. She also reassured that local economies can remain resilient, as domestic investors are capable of finding alternatives that strengthen local markets without supporting entities complicit in violence and oppression. Call to Intensify Boycott Efforts Mrs. Karaki concluded by urging greater efforts to support boycott campaigns. She emphasized that 'boycotts are a vital form of resistance, no less important than any other form of struggle.' She called for heightened public awareness and stronger community support to challenge systems and corporations that directly or indirectly enable the occupation.

Israeli Ceasefire Violations Escalate Along Lebanon Border: Milit...	In an alarming escalation of violations, Israeli occupation forces have conducted a series of military incursions along the Lebanon border. These include tank deployments, explosions in border villages such as Aita Al-Shaab, Maroun Al-Ras, and Al-Taybeh, as well as extensive drone activity and deforestation. The developments come amid a prolonged delay in the Lebanese army’s deployment to border areas due to the Israeli enemy's refusal to withdraw. Explosions and Military Incursions On Thursday afternoon, Aita Al-Shaab witnessed its fourth explosion of the day, carried out by Israeli enemy forces. Between morning and 1:15 PM, a heavily armed convoy of three tanks, an armored vehicle, and a personnel carrier advanced toward the northern outskirts of Maroun al-Ras, extending to the northeast near Bint Jbeil. The Zionist military reportedly targeted homes, destroying gates and firing at private properties. Additionally, Israeli occupation forces pushed into Al-Taybeh, firing weapons along the town’s edges toward Deir Seryan. Explosions rocked Al-Taybeh as Zionist soldiers set fire to several homes. Similar violations were reported in Hula, where heavy gunfire echoed across the area, and near Mays Al-Jabal, where Israeli troops conducted extensive searches. Since early morning, armed drones have been flying extensively across the border area at various altitudes, reminiscent of wartime operations. Al-Manar correspondent captured footage of Israeli tank, personnel carrier, and infantry movements in Houla, accompanied by heavy machine gun fire throughout the day. In Beirut's southern suburbs (Dahiyeh), Israeli enemy drones were flying at low altitude throughout the entire day. Lebanese Army Deployment Delayed Despite scheduled plans to enter border villages like Yaroun, Ayta Al-Shaab, Maroun Al-Ras, Blida, Mays Al-Jabal, and Adaisseh, the Lebanese army has yet to deploy. For over ten days, Israeli enemy forces’ refusal to withdraw has prevented the army from assuming control, leaving the area vulnerable to ongoing violations. Deforestation and Time Exploitation Israeli occupation forces continue to exploit the stalled situation by carrying out explosions and large-scale deforestation in border regions. In recent days, ancient trees in the Yaroun forest near the occupied Palestinian border have been uprooted. Today, Israeli bulldozers persisted in leveling the forest, causing irreversible environmental damage.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2314820	2025-01-16T11:07:43-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-07897610017370541879.jpg
From Netanyahu’s 'Absolute Victory' to Hamas Ceasefire Terms: Bit...	When the mighty fighters of Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas military wing, launched their attack on the Gaza envelop settlements on October 7, 2023, the Zionist entity was dealt the most powerful blow since its emergence. Experts, analysts, scholars, historians, academics, and journalists do know that the strike changed the course of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and even the Arab-Zionist one. The Zionist entity had either to 'digest' the new reality in which the settlements may be invaded by the 'enemies' or take a certain action that alters the dark facts of 'Al-Aqsa Flood'. Since the Zionist government is formed of a group of extremists, the second choice certainly turns to be the Israeli long-term strategy. PM Benjamin Netanyahu immediately occupied the scene and heralded his war aimed at achieving the 'absolute victory'of crushing Hamas, liberating the prisoners by force, displacing the Gazans into various countries, and establishing Zionist settlements in the Strip. The Zionist army was commanded to commit the worst war crime throughout the human history. The order was that achieving the 'absolute victory' justifies all forms of criminality and barbarism, despite the public opinion condemnation and the legal agencies convictions. Around 450 days, hundreds of thousands of war criminals armed by the most sophisticated and lethal weaponry in the world, failed to achieve any of the strategic Israeli targets. The Israeli prisoners have remained held by the Palestinian resistance; Hamas and all the factions are still operating powerfully in the Strip; the displaced Gazans will return to their houses; the Zionists have failed to establish any settlement in Gaza. Nevertheless, the Zionist nose has been rubbed in the dirt of Gaza whose negotiators imposed their terms on the Israeli side. An honorable prisoner swap will accompany the ceasefire and Israeli withdrawal from the Strip. In details, the agreement will be implemented in three stages. The first phase will last for 42 days and include a temporary stop of hostilities, IOF withdrawal from the residential areas, reopening of Rafah crossing to let 600 aid trucks into the Strip, and release of 2000 Palestinian prisoners in return for 33 Zionist captives. In the second and third phases, the reconstruction of Gaza and the announcement of the permanent truce will take place. In brief, none of the Zionist conditions were observed in the deal, which reflects the outcomes of the battle. The Zionists managed only to kill, injure, capture, and destroy, but in vain. The Zionist media has reflected the case of frustration in the entity because of the strategic Israeli failure in the war. Israeli Channel 12 considered that the return of the Zionist settlers to northern Gaza highlights the Israeli failure and Palestinian victory. The Channel even went on to say that the Palestinian prisoners, to be freed, are expected to be the new leaders of the Palestinians, describing them as educated and powerful. -	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2314710	2025-01-16T09:19:15-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2017/02/manar-02792890014872330091.jpg
Top General Hails Iran’s Growing Naval Might	Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Major General Mohammad Baqeri hails growing capabilities of the country’s navy, saying it is fully prepared to execute and implement various complex plans and programs. General Baqeri made the remarks while attending an inauguration ceremony of the Second Maritime Zone located in the strategic Jask region, near the Strait of Hormuz in southern Iran on Thursday. He said that the Iranian navy, today, is excelling in various domains of training, skills, and design capabilities. While honoring the founder of the Islamic Republic, Imam Khomeini, as well as those who sacrificed their lived for the sake of the Islamic Revolution, the top commander said that the long coast and the strategic position Iran enjoys are 'God’s blessings'. 'If we take advantage of our long coast properly, it will lead us to unparalleled power in the region and even as one of the world powers', he said. He called the Second Maritime Zone a very sensitive and strategic point that could help the country’s navy reach the entire planet. Major General Baqeri continued by saying that the Navy of the Islamic Republic of Iran has expanded two of its three main areas on the coast of the Sea of Oman and provided maritime security for the country’s commercial and oil fleets. Over the past 10 years, despite the fact that pirates were making international waterways unsafe, these naval fleets have been the ones that have helped 'our commercial and oil vessels safely pass through dangerous areas' more than hundreds of times, he added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2314556	2025-01-16T06:40:10-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/05/manar-00891400016855293234.jpg
