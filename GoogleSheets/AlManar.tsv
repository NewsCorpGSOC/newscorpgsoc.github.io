Firefighters Race to Beat LA Blazes as Winds Grow and Death Toll ...	At least 16 people were now confirmed dead from fires that have ripped through the city, leaving communities in ruins and testing the mettle of thousands of firefighters — and millions of California residents. Despite heroic efforts, including precision sorties from aerial crews, the Palisades Fire continued to grow Saturday, pushing east towards the priceless collections of the Getty Center art museum and north to the densely populated San Fernando Valley.

Despite heroic efforts, including precision sorties from aerial crews, the Palisades Fire continued to grow Saturday, pushing east towards the priceless collections of the Getty Center art museum and north to the densely populated San Fernando Valley. 'We're a nervous wreck,' Sarah Cohen told the Los Angeles Times of the threat to her Tarzana home. 'Every time they drop water, it gets better. But then it gets worse again.'

'Critical fire-weather conditions will unfortunately ramp up again today for southern California and last through at least early next week,' the National Weather Service said. 'This may lead to the spread of ongoing fires as well as the development of new ones.' Row The Palisades fire was 11 percent contained Saturday but had grown to 23,600 acres (9,500 hectares), while the Eaton Fire was at 14,000 acres and 15 percent contained. Official figures show more than 12,000 structures burned, but Cal Fire's Todd Hopkins said not all were homes, and the number would also include outbuildings, recreational vehicles and sheds. The sudden rush of people needing somewhere new to live in the months ahead looked set to make life hard for already-squeezed renters in the city.

'That doesn't bode well.' With reports of looting and a nighttime curfew in place, police and National Guard have mounted checkpoints to prevent people getting into the disaster zones. But that has left residents frustrated as they queue for up to 10 hours to try to get back in and see what, if anything, is left of their homes.

The long queues left some people fuming about poor management, the latest gripe from a population already angry over hydrants that ran dry in the initial firefight. City officials put on a united front Saturday after reports of a behind-the-scenes row and suggestions that Mayor Karen Bass had sacked her fire chief. 'As you see here, the chief and I are lockstep in our number one mission, and that mission is to get us past this emergency,' Bass told reporters. An at-times tense joint press conference came after Chief Kristin Crowley complained her fire department was short of cash.

'It is with great sadness that I have to announce the death of my beautiful son @Rorysykes to the Malibu fires yesterday. I'm totally heart broken,' his mother Shelley Sykes wrote on social media. Teams with cadaver dogs were combing through the rubble, with several people known to be missing and fears that the death toll will grow.

'We are not going to leave any rock unturned,' he said. 'If this is a criminal act — I'm not saying it's going to be — if it is, we need to hold whoever did this, or groups responsible,' Luna added, appealing for anyone who had information to come forward.

One Year of US-UK Failure: Yemen’s Resilience and Support for Gaz...	It has now been a year since the US and UK launched their aggression against Yemen on January 12 of the previous year, aiming to secure Israeli shipping in the Red Sea. However, the operation has ended in failure. The primary goal of the US and UK's direct involvement was to deter Yemen and halt its support for Gaza. Over time, however, the aggression became a significant burden for Washington, as Yemeni strikes targeted US and UK warships, naval vessels, and commercial ships across the Red Sea, Arabian Sea, and Indian Ocean. The outcome of this year-long aggression has transformed Yemen into a formidable military power, partially breaking America’s naval dominance. US aircraft carriers, warships, and destroyers were forced to retreat from the Red Sea while Yemen asserted control over its turbulent waters.

Yemen’s Support for Gaza In support of Gaza, Yemen’s armed forces began targeting vessels associated with the Israeli enemy in the Red Sea. This intervention comes as Gaza faces an Israeli-led genocide and an unprecedented siege. Yemen set one condition for halting its operations: the cessation of aggression and the lifting of the blockade on Gaza. In a historic speech three days after Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, Abdulmalik Al-Houthi declared that Yemen would not remain passive in the face of Gaza's suffering. He famously stated, 'You are not alone,' reaffirming Yemen’s commitment to defend Gaza if the US backed the Israeli occupation entity. What a GREAT Yemen! Hezbollah leader praises Yemeni resistance against the Israeli regime, comparing the impoverished Arab country to the wealthy Arab states for their inaction in the face of Israeli genocide. pic.twitter.com/eC8XKYajp4 — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) January 4, 2025 Israeli Concerns Over the US-UK Aggression Against Yemen Many within Zionist circles have expressed concern over the failure of the joint US-UK aggression against Yemen. They have called for reigniting Yemen’s internal conflict to distract the country from supporting Palestinians. Could the US-UK Alliance Turn the Tide for the Israeli Enemy? This crucial question has circulated among Zionist officials following the recent aggression against Yemen. Most responses have cautioned against relying on this alliance to break Yemen’s resolve or force its retreat. This uncertainty led the Israel enemy to place its air defense systems on high alert, anticipating a Yemeni response that would expose the failure of Israeli expectations. Zionist experts have reviewed the nature of the recent aggression, focusing on how the coalition partners shared roles in the operation. They emphasized the message the Israeli occupation hoped to send during the large Palestinian solidarity protests in Sanaa's Tahrir Square. Moreover, these experts have reiterated the importance of provoking internal conflict in Yemen, hoping factions within the country would resume fighting against the Yemeni government in Sanaa, thus diverting attention from Yemen’s external support for Palestine. Yemeni Armed Forces Target Key Site in Occupied Jaffa with Hypersonic Missile 'Palestine-2' United States' Strategic Missteps Washington should have focused on halting the war and lifting the Israeli siege on Gaza rather than rallying nations to attack Yemen, a country legally justified under international law to intervene in support of Gaza. The United States likely hoped that forming this alliance would intimidate Yemen into ceasing its support for Gaza, leaving the Arab world as passive spectators to the US-Israeli genocide in Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2311674	2025-01-11T11:10:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-02168500017050333731.jpg
Lebanese Army Deploys Across Southern Lebanon Amid Ongoing Israel...	The Lebanese Army has initiated deployment in towns across southern Lebanon, including Al-Qouzah, Yater, Beit Lif, and the outskirts of Ramya in the Bint Jbeil district, following the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces. Units also moved into Al-Naqoura and Al-Bayyada in the Tyre district, establishing a presence in these areas. The army announced on January 7th its deployment across several southern locations, such as Ras Al-Naqoura, Alma Al-Shaab, Tayr Harfa—Tyre, Beit Lif—Bint Jbeil, and other towns in the western and central sectors, reclaiming territory vacated by Zionist forces. In Al-Naqoura, specialized units continue operations to clear unexploded ordnance, remove debris, and reopen roads. These efforts are being conducted in coordination with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the five-nation committee overseeing the ceasefire agreement. Despite the ceasefire agreement, Israeli occupation forces launched stun grenades toward the town of Ayta Al-Shaab, attempting to intimidate civilians entering the area. The Lebanese Army had previously warned residents to wait for military clearance operations to be completed before returning. In the eastern sector, the army's planned deployment to the Al-Hammams Hill site faced delays due to Israeli enemy stalling. Meanwhile, Israeli occupation military vehicles were observed moving along the Abu Zainab-Tal Al-Nahhas road toward the Metula settlement, signaling ongoing activity in the area. Al-Manar correspondent toured the Wadi Al-Oyoun area, reaching the town of Hanin to assess its condition and the damage caused by Israeli aggression. Circulating video shows Lebanese Army vehicles entering Ramya town amid widespread destruction caused by Israeli attacks Israeli Violations Persist in Southern Lebanon Israeli occupation forces continue their violations in southern Lebanon, as reported by Al-Manar’s correspondent. The Zionist army carried out an explosion near the outskirts of Alma Al-Shaab and constructed additional earthworks along a newly established military road connecting the Al-Dhaira site to a new position west of the town. In the eastern sector, Israeli occupation forces were observed moving vehicles from Al-Hamames Hill towards the Metula area. While there had been discussions regarding the Lebanese Army repositioning at Al-Hamames Hill near Khiyam, Israeli delays have hindered progress. Drone Surveillance Intensifies IOF drones, including the Hermes 450 and Hermes 900 models, resumed high-altitude surveillance over border areas, coinciding with the ongoing deployment of Lebanese Army units along the southern border. Lebanese Army Deployment Progresses The Lebanese Army is set to establish military checkpoints as part of its initial deployment phase. This will restrict civilian access due to significant damage from recent Israeli airstrikes and bulldozer operations, as well as the presence of unexploded ordnance. Army engineering units will conduct thorough sweeps to secure the areas before civilians are allowed to return. تستكمل وحدات الجيش الانتشار في رأس الناقورة – صور وبلدات في القطاع الغربي علما الشعب، الضهيرة، عيترون، بنت جبيل، طيرحرفا، مجدل زون، الصالحني والقوزح بعد انسحاب العدو الإسرائيلي، وتعمل على تعزيز التمركز وتأمين النقاط المهمة، بالتنسيق مع قوة الأمم المتحدة المؤقتة في لبنان –… pic.twitter.com/61q04Sw5zS — الجيش اللبناني (@LebarmyOfficial) January 11, 2025 The deployment will expand to other villages, including Blida and Mays Al-Jabal, and will eventually cover the entire eastern sector.

Mikati Visits Syria’s Al-Sharaa: Our Duty to Activate Ties on Bas...	Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najb Mikati arrived in Damascus on Saturday for talks with Syria's de facto leader, Ahmed Al-Sharaa, marking the first visit by a sitting Lebanese premier to Syria in over a decade. Mikati, accompanied by a senior delegation including Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib and top security officials, landed at Damascus International Airport aboard a Lebanese commercial flight. The visit follows a formal invitation from Al-Sharaa, extended during a phone call last week. In a joint press conference, Al-Sharaa stated, 'We are giving ourselves a chance to build a positive relationship in the upcoming stages based on the sovereignty of both Lebanon and Syria. We will maintain neutrality towards all parties in Lebanon and will try to resolve issues.'

In response to a question, Al-Sharaa added: 'We also raised the issue of border demarcation between the two countries.' Mikati, in turn, expressed optimism, stating, 'We affirmed that the good neighborly relations and mutual respect between our two peoples govern our relationship. It is our duty to activate these relations on the basis of national sovereignty for both countries and to work on preventing anything that might harm this relationship.' He also stressed the importance of addressing the refugee crisis, saying, 'It has become urgent for the benefit of both countries to address the issue of refugees' return to Syria, especially as this issue is putting significant pressure on Lebanon as a whole. I sensed understanding on this matter.' The leaders also focused on border security, ensuring that both countries remain safe from any harmful activities. Mikati concluded, 'This visit marks a positive start, and what I have sensed from Mr. Al-Sharaa regarding the relationship between the two countries reassures me.' The visit comes two days after Lebanese lawmakers elected the country’s army chief Joseph Aoun as president, ending a more than two-year vacancy.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2311443	2025-01-11T06:25:13-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-01921560017366051821.jpg
Gaza Endures 463rd Day of Zionist Occupation Crimes	The Israeli occupation forces have continued their crimes against the people of Gaza, carrying out a brutal and unrelenting assault for the 463rd consecutive day. This ongoing campaign of violence has resulted in a catastrophic humanitarian situation in the besieged Gaza Strip. The Palestinian Information Center reported that the occupation's aircraft and artillery have maintained a barrage of airstrikes and shelling, targeting civilian homes, gatherings of displaced persons, and streets across Gaza. This has led to the martyrdom of dozens of Palestinians, with many more injured, in a continuation of the occupation's campaign of terror.

This has resulted in horrific massacres and the demolition of citizens' homes in the Jabalia refugee camp. Hundreds of martyrs have fallen as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens.

This has exacerbated the suffering of the population, as the ongoing violent bombing campaign continues to disrupt the work of the Civil Defense, leaving thousands without access to critical humanitarian and medical care. According to Palestinian sources, the occupation's forces have continued to target civilian infrastructure and populations, with drone strikes, airstrikes, and artillery shelling hitting residential areas and claiming more lives. The bodies of martyrs and wounded have been pulled from the rubble, as the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. The Government Media Office in Gaza has confirmed that the Zionist occupation has completely wiped out 1,600 Palestinian families, killing all of their members, as part of the ongoing genocide that has plagued the Gaza Strip for 15 months. This has resulted in the martyrdom of more than 5,600 Palestinians from these families, in addition to the annihilation of 3,471 other families, with only one person remaining in each. The total death toll from these atrocities has exceeded 9,000 martyrs.

Hochstein Told Lebanon US Guarantees Full Israeli Withdrawal befo...	US envoy Amos Hochstein reportedly said Washington guarantees that the Israeli enemy will fully withdraw from southern Lebanon before the 60-day deadline stipulated in the November 27 ceasefire, both Lebanese and Israeli media reported. According to the Lebanon-based Al-Akhbar newspaper, Hochstein made the promise when he was in Beirut earlier this week. The US envoy was also reportedly updated on an agreement between the Lebanese army and on Hezbollah pulling its forces north of the Litani River — about 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the border — and dismantling any remaining military infrastructure in the south, as stipulated by the ceasefire agreement.

Under the terms of the deal that Hochstein helped to broker, the Lebanese army is to deploy alongside United Nations peacekeepers in the south as the Israeli occupation army withdraws. For its part, Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation, Kan in Hebrew, also reported that the United States had guaranteed a complete withdrawal of the Israeli army from southern Lebanon before the end of the 60-day ceasefire. The Israeli occupation army have been going ahead with its violation to the ceasefire since it took effect earlier on November 27. On Friday, 6 Lebanese people were martyred and wounded at least two others in an Israeli strike on a van n the southern town of Teir Dibba.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2311311	2025-01-11T03:24:07-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-00451270017320075923.jpg
Iran Unveils ‘Dormant Volcano’ of Missile Power	The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has unveiled one of its newest and most sophisticated underground missile bases, described as a sprawling 'missile city' deep within Iran's mountainous terrain. The subterranean facility, broadcast on state television, showcases Iran's advanced missile capabilities, including the liquid-fueled Emad, Qadr, and Qiam projectiles. IRGC Commander Major General Hossein Salami and Aerospace Force Chief Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh led the tour, highlighting the base's strategic location and firepower. 'The volcano lying under these mountains can erupt in the shortest time possible,' the state TV report ominously noted, likening the hidden missile complex to a 'dormant volcano' ready to unleash its fury. ‘Dormant volcano’: IRGC unveils new subterranean missile facility — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) January 11, 2025 Salami boasted that Iran's missile production and capabilities continue to grow daily, dismissing claims that previous Israeli attacks had weakened the country's armed forces. He promised the IRGC would unveil even more new missiles and facilities in the near future. During the tour of the missile facility, Salami praised the IRGC forces involved in the two anti-Israel attacks and rejected the enemy’s mistaken belief that Iran’s capability to produce missiles had been harmed. 'Every day, the number of systems and missiles is augmented in the far corners of this land. Maybe the enemy thought that our production power has stagnated, but the growth rate of our missile power is up to date,' the IRGC chief said. 'All components of our power are improving, but missiles, their capacity and capability are increasing and improving every day both in quantity and quality and in efficiency and design.' Earlier in the day, Salami asserted that the Islamic Republic has more missiles than it can store, dismissing the enemy’s propaganda about the weakening of Iran’s armed forces following attacks by Israel on Iran and its regional allies. Salami added that the IRGC Aerospace Force would unveil more new missiles and missile facilities in the near future. The Armed Forces, including the IRGC and the country’s Army, have been continuously enhancing their military hardware and combat readiness in line with the directives of Leader of the Islamic Revolution Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei. The forces have vowed to defend the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of the threats by the Iranian nation’s enemies. The Islamic Republic launched some 200 missiles towards the Israeli entity’s military, and espionage and intelligence bases all over the occupied territories on October 1 as part of Operation True Promise II. The operation came in response to the regime’s assassinations of senior leaders of the Palestinian and Lebanese resistance and a senior IRGC commander.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2311234	2025-01-11T02:00:32-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-05448040017365896276.jpg
Israeli Air Raid on South Lebanon Town Claims 6 Martyrs in Worst ...	An Israeli air raid on a car and a van in Teir Dibba town, South Lebanon, claimed six martyrs and two injuries. NNA reported that Red Cross and Civil Defense ambulances moved the injured into Tyre hospitals, while the Lebanese Army cordoned off the scene. Teir Dibba municipality issued, in coordination with the Lebanese Army Intelligence, a statement that calls on the civilians to avoid attending the area targeted by the raid due to the presence of unexploded ordnance to be removed by the military tomorrow (Friday). The raid is considered the most blatant violation of the ceasefire in South Lebanon, which took into effect on November 27, 2024, with respect to the number of the martyrs and the location of the targeted area which is far away from the borders where most of the enemy's breaches used to take place in the past stage. Moreover, the Israeli occupation forces incurred into Taybeh town, opening fire at houses and incinerating a number of them. The Zionist artillery shells targeted Aita Shaab town which also witnessed a new hostile operation of blowing up houses. The Israeli enemy also executed major explosions in Kfar Kila town. Meanwhile, the Lebanese Army units continued deploying at Teir Harfa - Al-Jebbain as well as Al-Qawzah-Ramya-Aita Al-Shaab Triangles. The Army units also advanced into Aitaroun border town, reopening its main road which had been blocked by the enemy.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2310926	2025-01-10T11:25:33-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-07288010017365371281.jpg
US-British Air Raids Target Al-Sabeen Square during Million-man R...	The Zionist-American-British aggression launched a series of airraids on the capital, Sanaa, on Friday afternoon, coinciding with the weekly million-person march in support of Gaza. Yemeni media reported that the aggression targeted the vicinity of Al-Sabeen Square in the capital, coinciding with the mass turnout to participate in the weekly million-person marches in support of Gaza. In addition, the sources explained that the Israeli-American-British aggression targeted the Haiz Central Power Station in Sanhan District with eight raids. They reported that a worker at the Haiz Central Power Station was injured and citizens' homes were damaged as a result of the bombing of the power station by the American-Israeli-British aggression. Meanwhile, the million-man rally in Sanaa was not frightened by the US-UK-Zionist aggression. The protesters insisted on voicing their support for Gaza and the Armed Forces' actions in face of any aggression on Yemen. The participants held banners which affirm commitment to the path of supporting the Palestinian cause and facing the US-UK aggression on Yemen, challenging the air raids on the capital, Sanaa. The spokesman for the Yemeni Armed Forces, Brigadier General Yahya Sarea announced several military operations during the past 48 hours. The Yemeni Armed Forces, with the help of Allah Almighty, carried out several military operations during the past 48 hours, the most prominent of which was targeting the American aircraft carrier 'USS Harry S. Truman' and a number of its warships in the northern Red Sea region with a number of cruise missiles and drones, General Sarea said. The operation was carried out by the missile force and the air force, and the operation succeeded in thwarting a new air attack against our country from that carrier, which was forced with its warships to leave the northern Red Sea region, he added. 'Yesterday, the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out a targeting operation against a number of targets belonging to the Israeli enemy in the occupied area of Yaffa with three drones, and they were able to reach their targets successfully, thanks to Allah.' The operations came in context of triumphing for the oppression of the Palestinian people and their Mujahideen and response to the massacres against our people in Gaza, and within the fifth stage of the supportive stages in the battle of the Promised Conquest and the Holy Jihad, he noted. 'The Yemeni Armed Forces reiterate that they will continue to perform their duties towards the oppressed Palestinian people and that their operations will not stop until the aggression stops and the siege on the Gaza Strip is lifted.'

Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades: Most Zionist Prisoners in Gaza’s North...	A senior official from Hamas' military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, stated in an interview with Al-Jazeera that most Israeli prisoners in the northern Gaza area are now considered missing due to ongoing Israeli enemy aggression. The official emphasized that the brigades had repeatedly warned about the consequences of Israeli occupation actions in Gaza. Al-Qassam Brigades Hold Zionist Government Responsible for Prisoners' Fate The Al-Qassam official criticized Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli occupation military, accusing them of avoiding accountability for the fate of their soldiers. He reaffirmed that the brigades hold the Israeli enemy government and military fully responsible for the lives of the prisoners. For the 98th consecutive day, northern Gaza remains under a severe Israeli siege, with continuous air and artillery bombardment isolating the region from the rest of Gaza. Zionist Families Urge Swift Negotiations The warnings from a senior Al-Qassam leader come at a time when the families of Zionist prisoners in Gaza issued a statement saying, 'It would have been possible to return Youssef and Hamza Al-Zayadna alive if an agreement had been reached earlier.' This follows the Israeli occupation army's announcement that, 'After completing the identification process at the forensic institute, the Zayadna family was informed of the death of their son, Hamza, in Gaza, two days after the body of his father was discovered.' In the same context, Zionist enemy army spokesperson Daniel Hagari stated that 'forces from the army and Shin Bet managed to recover the body of Israeli soldier Youssef Al-Zayadna after locating it inside a tunnel in the Rafah area.' The families of the prisoners have urged Netanyahu and decision-makers to 'accelerate negotiations to immediately return all hostages,' adding, 'We have a historic opportunity to secure the release of the captives, and we should not squander it. Poll Shows 88% of Zionists Support Prisoner Swap Deal A recent survey by Maariv reveals that 88% of Zionists are in favor of reaching a prisoner swap deal. The poll also highlights a significant shift in political support, with the Likud party losing two seats this week while the opposition bloc gains 61 seats due to the ongoing war in Gaza. According to the poll, if elections were held today, Netanyahu's coalition would secure 49 seats, while the opposition would gain 61 seats, without relying on the Arab parties. Support for a Comprehensive Prisoner Swap The survey also found that 52% of Zionists support a comprehensive prisoner exchange deal, while 36% back a partial deal. Only 6% of respondents oppose the idea. Interestingly, 51% of coalition supporters favor a full swap, while 14% oppose it, with no opposition among supporters of the opposition bloc.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2310739	2025-01-10T05:27:18-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-07819070017319274025.jpg

Troops raided the town of Qabatiya near Jenin, searching the home of a man alleged to be connected to the attack. According to Israeli occupation officials cited by Israel Hayom, there are calls within the military to escalate operations in the West Bank, including deploying tanks, to confront Palestinian resistance groups. Meanwhile, Palestinian factions have pushed back against Israeli aggression. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in Jenin announced they had identified and engaged an undercover Israeli unit near Qabatiya, resulting in intense gun battles. Videos shared on Palestinian platforms showed Israeli military vehicles storming the town. At least eight Palestinians, including a woman, were arrested during Israeli raids in Qabatiyah. Similar operations were reported in Talluza and Bazan, north of Nablus, and the Jalazone refugee camp near Ramallah. In Ni'lin, west of Ramallah, a young Palestinian man was injured by live fire. Settler Violence and More Raids In Abu Falah, northeast of Ramallah, settlers set fire to a property, as documented by Palestinian media. Meanwhile, Israeli occupation forces conducted raids in Deir Istiya in Salfit and arrested several young men in Asira Al-Shamaliya near Nablus. In Hebron’s old city, two Palestinians suffered injuries after being attacked by Israeli soldiers on Thursday night. Israeli Forces Target Families of Prisoners Israeli occupation forces demolished two Palestinian homes in Tulkarm and Qalqilya on Friday, one of them for the second time. The first home, located in the Tulkarm refugee camp, belonged to the family of Mahmoud Sleit 'Abu Hanoud,' a Palestinian prisoner accused of involvement in the twin operations at Beit Lid and Bal’a in November 2023. This house had previously been partially demolished in September 2024.

The family was forced to evacuate before the explosion, which caused significant structural damage to the house and destroyed its contents. A vehicle belonging to the Badran family was also damaged in the blast. Expanding Settlements and Military Presence Hebron, another hotbed of Israeli enemy brutality, continues to see the proliferation of settlements. Approximately 500 settlers reside in the heart of the city, protected by hundreds of Israeli occupation soldiers. Across the West Bank, including east of occupied Jerusalem, over 720,000 settlers now live in illegal outposts, further entrenching the occupation and exacerbating tensions in the region.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2310673	2025-01-10T04:22:19-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-03998320017365115922.jpg
California Wildfires Leave 10 Dead, 130,000 Evacuated, $50 Billio...	At least 10 people have died, over 130,000 residents have been forced to evacuate, and approximately 10,000 structures have been destroyed by wildfires sweeping across Los Angeles, United States of America. Early damage estimates peg the losses at $50 billion. Uncontrollable Fires and Widespread Evacuations As of Thursday, five massive fires continued to rage, destroying homes, vehicles, and infrastructure. Two major wildfires remained out of control in the city, with firefighters working tirelessly to contain the flames after fierce winds driving the fires began to subside. However, meteorologists warned of continued fire risks through Friday. In the affluent Pacific Palisades neighborhood, nestled between Malibu and Santa Monica, fires burned through 6,500 hectares and more than 1,000 structures. Helicopters were deployed to combat the blaze. Meanwhile, Hollywood Hills saw fires near iconic landmarks like the Chinese Theatre and Hollywood Boulevard, though authorities lifted evacuation orders on Thursday after gaining control of the situation. 'Most Destructive Wildfires in Los Angeles History' The fires disrupted life in Los Angeles, halting film and TV productions and leading to the closure of Universal Studios Theme Park. The Oscar nominations announcement was postponed to January 19, and the Critics’ Choice Awards ceremony, scheduled for Sunday, was delayed. President Joe Biden described the fires as the 'largest and most destructive in California's history,' attributing their intensity to climate change. Declaring a major disaster, Biden held meetings with top officials to coordinate federal assistance. This is absolutely heartbreaking 😢. Our thoughts are with you at this very frightening time 🙏.#CaliforniaWildfires pic.twitter.com/hUUo7pBrUt — PROTECT ALL WILDLIFE (@Protect_Wldlife) January 9, 2025 California Governor Gavin Newsom revealed that over 7,500 firefighters, including reinforcements from other states and 400 National Guard troops, were battling the blazes. Private weather service AccuWeather estimated damages could reach $57 billion, warning this could become California’s worst wildfire disaster. Speculation on Causes and Political Fallout Authorities suspect electrical faults caused the fires, a recurring issue in California’s wildfire history. The ongoing crisis also became a political flashpoint, with former President Donald Trump blaming Democratic policies for water shortages, claiming they prioritize environmental causes over practical needs. His assertions were widely debunked, with experts pointing out that most water in Los Angeles supports agriculture, primarily sourced from the Colorado River. Trump demanded Governor Newsom’s resignation, calling the crisis a direct result of his leadership as the state continues to grapple with devastating losses and widespread displacement.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2310640	2025-01-10T03:32:23-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-09871220017365080486.png
Houthi: Hezbollah Preserves Strong Role in Lebanon, Trump’s Remar...	Head of Yemen's Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi tackled, on Thursday in a televised speech, the latest developments, indicating that the genocide crimes committed by the Zionist enemy in Gaza have exceeded 4,000 massacres, including 30 massacres this week. During the final days of Biden's presidency, he approved a major deal of bombs, shells, and ammunition for the Zionist enemy to kill children and women, he added. Sayyed Houthi said that the crime of starvation involves not only the Zionist enemy but also all the cowardly, stingy regimes that remain mere spectators as the Palestinian people starve, noting that the Zionist enemy continues its policy of rationing, allowing only minimal aid to enter Gaza. 'The Zionist enemy has formed gangs of traitors and collaborators to loot and seize aid near the military checkpoints it establishes in Gaza. This week, Zionist soldiers themselves have started directly looting the limited aid entering Gaza.' Houthi maintained the Zionist enemy has created a contaminated reality in Gaza, systematically targeting the entire healthcare infrastructure, adding that the attack on Kamal Adwan Hospital is a clear aggression and one of the major crimes committed by the Zionist enemy in Gaza. The Zionist enemy is now targeting the Indonesian Hospital and other hospitals providing minimal services under severe siege, he added. 'Zionist criminals in the Knesset continue to call for more crimes, tyranny, and destruction of all aspects of life. The Zionist enemy targets displaced individuals, leaving the entire population of Gaza in a state of displacement without real shelter centers.' The Zionist enemy seeks to use all means of genocide and deprivation of basic life essentials and legitimate human rights, Houthi said. Sayyed Houthi warned that the ultimate goal of the Zionist Jews is to completely destroy Al-Aqsa Mosque and build their alleged temple, with every step being deliberate. Houthi said that the Zionist enemy continues its violations in Lebanon, breaching the ceasefire agreement through shelling, gunfire, destruction, and demolition of homes. 'Despite its actions in southern Lebanon and its aggression on the country, the Zionist enemy has failed. The Zionist enemy has not achieved its declared goal of eliminating Hezbollah, which remains a strong presence in the Lebanese arena.' Ansarullah leader maintained that Hezbollah is recovering and growing stronger, maintaining a solid and unwavering front against the Zionist enemy, adding that the Zionist enemy, alongside the Americans and unfortunately with the cooperation of some Arab regimes, is targeting Lebanon's internal political scene. There is a significant responsibility on all Lebanese factions to act with awareness and prioritize the stability and interests of their country, he pointed out. 'Aligning with the Zionist enemy in Lebanon has severe consequences, even for those who serve its agenda. Those conspiring and destabilizing Lebanon are harming themselves while affecting the country's stability.' True national interests for all Lebanese lie in prioritizing internal stability, which benefits Lebanon as a whole, Houthi underlined. 'The Zionist enemy continues its aggression on Syria through airstrikes, targeting remaining factories. The Zionist enemy aims to solidify its control over the areas it recently invaded and occupied in Syria, proving its intention of permanent occupation.' The occupation in Syria serves Zionist interests, focused on exploitation and plunder, Sayyed Houthi warned. 'The Zionist enemy is bringing in more military reinforcements, constructing fortifications, and setting up prefabricated buildings in Syria. The Zionist enemy has reached the Al-Mantra Dam, the largest dam in southern Syria.' Houthi added that the Americans are establishing new military bases in eastern Syria, seeking to enhance their influence and control. The Yemeni leader noted that both the American and Zionist forces aim not only to occupy expanding territories but also to infiltrate Syria's internal affairs, adding that all Syrians must unite to protect their homeland from American and Zionist aggression. Sayyed Houthi clarified that the Zionist enemy has recently published a new map that includes areas in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan, following previously staged maps accompanied by provocative statements. 'Everyone in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Palestine must understand that the Zionist entity harbors aggressive ambitions for control and exploitation of these lands. The staged map released by the Zionist enemy is highly provocative and aggressive.' Houthi urged nations to stand strong and resilient to protect their nations from the American and Zionist threats and safeguard their lands and resources as free and independent peoples, adding that the current policies adopted by Jordan and Syria will not change the ambitions of the Zionist enemy, nor will they cause it to abandon its greed. 'The Zionist enemy remains determined in its ambitions and hostile policies, as evident in official statements and clear stances. Both the Zionist entity and the United States pursue aggressive, practical plans to achieve their hostile objectives.' Sayyed Houthi mentioned that the Hamas movement has shown significant flexibility in all rounds of negotiations, eliminating all excuses and justifications for the Americans and Zionists. 'Military operations on the Yemeni faith and fight front continued this week, targeting Zionist enemy objectives deep within occupied Palestine using hypersonic missiles and drones.' Sayyed Houthi added that the operations extended to occupied Jaffa and Ashkelon, targeting a substation and the 'Orot Rabin' power plant south of occupied Haifa. These operations have had a profound psychological impact on the enemy, exacerbating panic, anxiety, and fear, as the Zionists fail to intercept the missiles, Houthi highlighted. 'The scale of panic has expanded, with alarm sirens sounding in over 234 cities and towns in occupied Palestine, forcing more than half of Zionist settlers to seek refuge in shelters. Over half of Zionist settlers flee to shelters due to the continuous sounding of alarm sirens.' Sayyed Houthi indicated that the Zionist enemy is deeply concerned about its failure to intercept missiles launched by the Yemeni armed forces, adding that a Friday dawn missile, claimed to have been intercepted by the enemy, was clearly seen reaching its target in video footage, intensifying their worry. The enemy struggles with the high costs and widespread debris of its interceptive missiles, sometimes spreading over 80 kilometers, he added. 'Yemeni operations have significantly impacted the enemy’s aviation activity at Ben Gurion airport, forcing flight suspensions and affecting airlines' decisions to resume operations. Economic repercussions of Yemeni strikes are evident on the Zionist entity.' Meanwhile, the Yemeni leader affirmed that this week witnessed the third clash with the American aircraft carrier 'Truman,' marking the sixth confrontation overall with U.S. carriers. 'The clash coincided with U.S. preparations for large-scale aggressive operations against Yemen, which were thwarted by Allah’s grace.' Sayyed Houthi underscored that the notable American tactical achievement this week was the rapid retreat operations, as the 'Truman' carrier quickly fled, recalling all deployed fighter jets and rerouting to the far north of the Red Sea. 'The economic impact on the Zionist entity is substantial, forcing them to raise prices significantly. Zionist media likened the price hikes to a tsunami affecting all goods and public services, heavily burdening settler families.' 'Reverse migration continues, with over 82,000 settlers leaving during 2024. Economic collapse is evident, with 50,000 Zionist companies shutting down in 2024.' Sayyed Houthi highlighted that a significant security achievement was made this week with the arrest of a British espionage network, marking an important milestone, adding that the enemies face substantial failures in the security field, which remains a critical domain. 'The enemies continue their multi-faceted aggression against the people, targeting them militarily, economically, politically, and through media and intelligence. By Allah’s grace and support, the enemies are visibly failing across all fronts, while our resilient and steadfast people achieve success and maintain cohesion.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2310354	2025-01-09T12:07:56-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-02744070017364532661.jpg

There is no place for mafias, drug trafficking, or money laundering in Lebanon,' the President concluded. General Aoun underlined that, during his tenure, the armed forces will prevent the Israeli attacks on Lebanon, adding that he would discuss a defense strategy capable of removing the Zionist occupation. President Aoun affirmed that he would lead the construction of all what was destroyed in South Lebanon, Bekaa, and Dahiyeh by the Israeli war.

Families of Israeli Soldiers: Netanyahu Abandoning Hostages, Wagi...	Families of Israeli conscripts and reservists who fought or are still fighting in Gaza issued a public letter accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of irresponsibly and unnecessarily risking the troops’ lives, and demanding that he reach a deal to end the war. In a letter addressed to the premier, more than 800 of the relatives accused him of leading 'a war without a horizon, unlike anything in our history, solely in the interest of your own political survival.' 'Our sons and daughters set out on a necessary war brought upon us by your actions,' they claimed, according to The Times of Israel. Israeli occupation army in Jabalia in northern Gaza Strip (November 5, 2024). 'They lost many friends and are continuing to die and get injured, mentally and physically.' The families said the troops were motivated by the stated war goals, 'first and foremost returning the hostages.' But now, after more than a year, they assert the only way this will happen is as part of a deal with Hamas, alleging that the war is being extended aimlessly and that 'the IDF has no reason to stay in Gaza, besides fulfilling messianic wishes of settling there.' 'We accuse you of abandoning the hostages and the soldiers,' the parents write, threatening to launch an 'all-out struggle.' Yedioth Ahronoth reported on Thursday that 10 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the start of the offensive in Beit Hanoun two weeks earlier. Meanwhile on Thursday, three soldiers were announced killed in northern Gaza battles.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2310013	2025-01-09T04:40:13-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/12/manar-08250970016716330715.jpg
After 2-Year Vacuum, Will Lebanon Elect President Today?	Lebanese Army Commander Joseph Aoun on Thursday failed in the first round to secure the 86 votes needed to be elected as a new president, with eyes on the second round that is expected to lead to his election. Lebanon’s Parliament has convened on Thursday to elect a new president after a two-year vacuum. Lawmakers assembled in the Parliament’s general hall in the 13th attempt to elect the new president.

The incident came after three other troops were killed and several more wounded in separate incidents the previous two days. Yedioth Ahronoth reported on Thursday that 10 Israelis soldiers have been killed since the start of the offensive in Beit Hanoun two weeks earlier Despite the brutal genocide in Gaza, resistance in the besieged enclave remained steadfast, dealing blows to the Israeli occupation.

Lebanon Presidential Race: Franjieh Withdraws, Sources Put Forwar...	On Thursday, Lebanon's parliament will convene to elect a president, with Lebanese Army Commander Joseph Aoun appears to be the strongest contender. On Wednesday, there was a flurry of activity including declarations, intensified discussions and communications. Marada Movement leader Sleiman Frangieh, who is preferred by Hezbollah and Amal Movement, declared he was withdrawaing from the presidential race. In a statement, Franjieh said: 'Now that the conditions for electing a president of the republic are in place tomorrow, and in light of the way things have turned out, I announce the withdrawal of my candidacy, which was never an obstacle to the election process. While I thank everyone who voted for me, I - in line with what I announced in previous positions - support General Joseph Aoun, who enjoys the qualifications to preserve the position of the first presidency.' صدر عن رئيس تيار المرده سليمان فرنجيه البيان التالي: 'أمّا وقد توفّرت ظروف انتخاب رئيس للجمهورية يوم غد، وإزاء ما آلت إليه الأمور، فإنني أعلن عن سحب ترشيحي الذي لم يكن يوماً هو العائق أمام عملية الانتخاب. وإذ أشكر كلّ من اقترع لي، فإنني - وانسجاماً مع ما كنت قد أعلنته في مواقف… — Sleiman Frangieh (@sleimanfrangieh) January 8, 2025 Frangieh wished the House of Parliament success in the election process, and for 'the country to pass this stage with unity, awareness and responsibility.'

‘Israel’ Advances into Quneitra, New Syrian Admin Provides No Det...	Zein Sandouk Translated by Al-Manar English Website Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) have intensified their incursions into southern Syria, particularly in Quneitra’s northern countryside. On the 2nd of January, the IOF advanced into the Al-Hamr Hills near Hadar and Taranja, where they uprooted trees, demolished homes and agricultural lands, and destroyed Syrian Army barracks and weapons depots. The area has been declared a military zone, barring civilian access. Residents were reportedly ordered to hand over weapons allegedly looted from Syrian military locations. In the southern Quneitra Countryside, Israeli forces supported by tanks entered the villages of Al-Asha, Abu Ghara, and Al-Hiran farm, further solidifying control. They also destroyed fortifications and demanded civilian compliance under the guise of military security. Israeli military armored vehicles block a road leading to the town of Quneitra (Jaunary 2025). In Jabatha al-Khashab, Israeli forces advanced and established new military points within Syrian territory, including constructing a 3-kilometer road inside the forest. The town’s mayor emphasized the need to resist Israeli demands and called on the new Syrian government to address the violations. The occupation forces’ control over weapons abandoned during Syrian Army collapses has fueled further tensions in the region. One of the most significant developments occurred when Israeli forces seized the Mantara Dam, the largest water reservoir in southern Syria, capable of holding 40.2 million cubic meters of water. By raising earthen barriers, the occupation has effectively blocked residents’ access to this critical resource. This move exacerbates Syria’s water security crisis, particularly in the face of climate change and declining reserves. Water theft persists as Israel grabs 40 percent of Syria's vital water resources Follow us on Telegram: pic.twitter.com/kwrEBw7I1X — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) January 8, 2025 Israeli consolidation of 13 military points in southern Syria, including the strategic Mount Hermon, further threatens Syria’s vital resources. Mount Hermon contains a vast water reservoir, making its occupation an existential threat to the region’s water security. The Syrian government responded by filing a complaint with the United Nations Security Council, condemning the Israeli incursions and violations. However, this diplomatic action has had little effect on the ground. An Israeli official stated that their forces would remain in the seized areas until assured that Syria’s new administration does not pose a threat to 'Israel'. These developments have left Syrian citizens frustrated and questioning the new administration’s ability to protect its territory and people. The situation underscores the growing humanitarian and geopolitical challenges in the levant as the IOF continues to fortify and solidify its occupation of southern Syria, contradicting its narrative of ensuring the safety of the Zionist entity.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2309463	2025-01-08T11:23:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-04233730017363641536.jpg
Israeli Violations of Lebanon Ceasefire Agreement Persist as Dead...	Since the ceasefire agreement took effect on November 27, Israeli occupation forces have repeatedly violated the terms, despite the resistance’s full adherence to the deal. As the 60-day deadline for Israeli enemy withdrawal from southern occupied villages nears, questions arise about the future of the ceasefire and its sustainability. Continued Israeli Violations and Civilian Casualties Israel has not only breached Lebanese airspace with military and reconnaissance flights but has also carried out numerous attacks and assassinations. Reports indicate that more than 45 civilians have been killed in these violations, including 14 martyrs from airstrikes on Shabaa, Tallousa, and Haris on December 4. The number of Israeli breaches has reached nearly 1,000 since the ceasefire began. Al-Manar correspondent Ali Shouaib reported on Wednesday that Israeli occupation forces advanced at the outskirts of Bint Jbeil, near Maroun Al-Ras, targeting and setting fire to several homes. He also confirmed two explosions in the town of Al-Jibbain and the establishment of new positions for military vehicles and tanks west of Al-Dhaira. Israeli occupation forces advance at the outskirts of Bint Jbeil, near Maroun al-Ras, targeting and setting fire to several homes (Jan 8, 2025) Israeli occupation forces advance in south Lebanon (Jan 8, 2025) Additionally, Israeli enemy forces deployed surveillance devices on a crane in Mount Blat, adjacent to the town of Marwahin. Resistance's Possible Response Hezbollah's Secretary-General, Sheikh Naim Qassem, left open the possibility of resistance retaliation. He emphasized that the resistance alone would decide whether to respond to Israeli provocations, warning that their patience could run out before the ceasefire period ends. Why Does the Israeli Enemy Continue Their Violations? Military expert Brigadier General (res.) Charles Abi Nader explained that the Israeli enemy seeks to inflict as much damage as possible during its presence in southern Lebanon. He noted that Zionist actions are driven by their aggressive stance, exploiting the Lebanese commitment to the ceasefire to intensify violations. The absence of the Lebanese Army in certain southern areas has provided Israel with a pretext to continue its violations, including claims of targeting Hezbollah’s infrastructure south of the Litani River. Role of the Monitoring Committee When questioned about the lack of effective monitoring of Israeli violations, Brigadier Abi Nader criticized the failure of the monitoring committee to carry out its duties. He suggested that the countries sponsoring the ceasefire are complicit with the Israeli occupation, using violations to pursue political objectives in Lebanon, such as influencing the presidential elections and undermining Hezbollah’s military capabilities. Brigadier Abi Nader dismissed the idea of the Lebanese Army confronting Israeli violations directly, attributing this historical issue to Western impositions on Lebanon. He acknowledged that while the Lebanese Army is doing its best, the challenges of deploying in areas with potential mines and unexploded ordnance make it difficult to assert full control in all areas vacated by Israeli forces. Israeli Withdrawal and Delayed Return of Residents: A Complex Situation Al-Manar correspondent Samer Al-Hajj Ali suggests that the Israeli enemy is intensifying demolition and sabotage operations for two main reasons: to delay the return of residents to border villages as much as possible and to create the illusion of achieving some success in the south after its initial failure in ground operations. He further noted that the resistance's challenge to the Israeli occupation is now deeply embedded in Israeli consciousness, prompting the enemy's ongoing aggression. Regarding the status quo, Al-Hajj Ali explained that the Israeli occupation is continuing its withdrawal from several positions in the western sector and plans to pull out from villages between Al-Naqoura and Rmeish. The Lebanese army is expected to position itself in several centers vacated by Israel at the start of its invasion, including Tair Harfa, Al-Jibbain, Al-Dhaira, Alma Al-Shaab, Al-Qawzah, Aita Al-Shaab, and Ras Al-Naqoura. The question remains: Will the Israeli enemy fully withdraw from Lebanese territory in the near future, or will it extend its occupation of part of these lands? How will the Zionist enemy's repeated violations of the ceasefire agreement be addressed?	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2309397	2025-01-08T07:25:20-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-01719130017363482839.jpg
Israeli Strike Claims the Lives of 3 Palestinians, Including Two ...	Israeli enemy drones struck Tammun southeast of Tubas in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, claiming the lives of three Palestinians, including two children. This comes amid a large-scale campaign of raids and arrests carried out by the Israeli forces across the West Bank early this morning, accompanied by widespread settler attacks on Palestinians and their properties for the third consecutive day. The escalation follows the 'Hotel Operation,' which resulted in the killing of three settlers and the injury of seven others. According to Palestinian medical sources, the victims were identified as 9-year-old Rida Ali Ahmad Bsharat, 10-year-old Hamza Ammar Ahmad Bsharat, and 23-year-old Adam Khaireddine Ahmad Bsharat. Israeli occupation forces seized their bodies after the attack. 🔴They were mere children, innocently playing in their backyard. What offense could possibly warrant their murder?

Witnesses reported that the area was crowded with families at the time of the strike. Morning Raid and Clashes Earlier in the day, Israeli occupation forces raided Tammun, deploying snipers and infantry across the town, surrounding several homes, and conducting house-to-house searches. A later drone strike injured several Palestinians, including Abdul Rahman Mohammad Eid Bani Odeh, 24, who succumbed to his injuries, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The ministry confirmed that Bani Odeh was killed by a drone strike targeting a group of Palestinians. His body was also confiscated by Israeli forces. Israeli enemy forces prevented Palestinian medical teams from reaching the injured near the strike site, citing security concerns. The Red Crescent Society reported difficulties in accessing the area due to restrictions imposed by the Israeli occupation military. 5 martyrs in Tammun in the last 24 hours Ahmad Al-Asaad, Governor of Tubas and Northern Jordan Valley, condemned the Israeli occupation military's targeting of civilians, particularly children, in Tammun. 'The claim of targeting an armed cell is baseless. The victims include two children under the age of ten and a young man who were near their home,' he stated. Al-Asaad called on the international community and human rights organizations to intervene immediately to halt Israel’s continued attacks on civilians. 'Tammun has lost five of its residents in the last 24 hours, alongside extensive destruction of infrastructure and public property,' he added. Ongoing Raids and Arrests in West Bank Since October 7, 2023 Palestinian organizations report that 844 Palestinians, including 172 children, 16 women, and 12 elderly individuals, were martyred in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem since October 7, 2023. These numbers resulted from Israeli occupation forces' shootings, bombings, and settler violence. The latest victim, Abdul Rahman Bani Awde from Tammun, Tubas, raised the martyr count in Tubas to 72. Jenin recorded the highest toll with 225 martyrs, followed by Tulkarm with 196. Among the martyrs, 238 were killed in targeted assassinations and 372 during Israeli enemy raids. Additionally, the number of withheld bodies has risen to 180. Bani Odeh was injured when an occupation drone targeted a group of young men in the town. The occupation forces kidnapped him.

Today, Hebron, Nablus, Ramallah, and Tulkarm witnessed intensified operations: In Nablus, Israeli occupation forces conducted raids in Beita and Sebastia, sparking confrontations where live bullets, sound bombs, and tear gas were used, while seven youths were detained during a raid on Askar Refugee Camp. Meanwhile, Hebron witnessed a widespread arrest campaign in Sa'ir targeting multiple residents, and five young men were briefly detained at the Shuhada Street checkpoint before being released. Tulkarm saw residents of Kafr Jammal and Irta enduring vehicle searches, home invasions, and arbitrary detentions during Israeli raids as settlers from the Ramin outpost fired at Palestinian vehicles passing through the area. In Jerusalem’s Old City, Israeli forces detained two women, Maram and Hasniya Fera’awi, and raided Hazma town, firing tear gas at homes. Settler Aggression and Restrictions Settlers in Tulkarm’s Ramin Valley targeted Palestinian vehicles, firing randomly at passersby. Meanwhile, the Israeli military continued its closure of the Jbara Bridge south of Tulkarm for the third consecutive day, restricting movement for vehicles and residents. Call for International Action Palestinian officials and rights groups have called on the international community to intervene against the escalating Israeli enemy military and settler aggression, which continues to claim civilian lives and disrupt daily life across the occupied territories.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2309276	2025-01-08T06:42:00-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-08732950017363472597.jpg
Imam Khamenei: US Severely Misjudged Iran Over Decades	Leader Imam Ali Khamenei accused the United States of repeatedly making grave miscalculations about Iran over the past decades. Addressing a gathering in the city of Qom, Khamenei said the US had long viewed Iran under the former Pahlavi monarchy as a 'formidable fortress' for American interests. However, he noted, 'it was from the heart of this fortress that the [1979 Islamic] Revolution was born and bubbled up. The Americans did not realize this, were duped, lagged behind, and became oblivious.' Imam Khamenei's remarks came as Iran commemorated the anniversary of a 1978 uprising that helped pave the way for the Islamic Revolution. Leader meets people of Qom on 1978 uprising anniv. pic.twitter.com/ubhd0WSbNm — IRNA News Agency (@IrnaEnglish) January 8, 2025 The Leader asserted that the US has 'on most occasions, committed mistakes concerning its attitude towards Iran throughout the past decades.' The Leader described the development as 'the Americans’ miscalculation' vis-à-vis Iran. 'After the Revolution, the Americans perpetrated mistakes concerning Iran throughout these several decades on most occasions,' Ayatollah Khamenei observed. The Leader said his remarks were mostly addressed towards those 'who are intimidated by the US’s policies.' Observers describe the Islamic Revolution as a force that took the global anti-colonial movement to the next level, calling it a symbol of the fight for a just and multipolar world order.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2309089	2025-01-08T01:36:37-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-00658010017339102662.jpg
Iran’s IRGC Showcases Air Defense Prowess in Eqtedar 1403 Drills	In a series of large-scale military exercises dubbed 'Eqtedar 1403' (Authority 1403), the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) has showcased its advanced air defense capabilities in protecting critical infrastructure, including the Natanz nuclear facility. According to IRGC Chief Commander Major General Hossein Salami, the drills involved 'various real-world scenarios' that the forces expected Iran's enemies might attempt. 'Fortunately, encouraging results and fairly valuable achievements were obtained,' Salami stated. A key focus of the exercises was bolstering the IRGC's air defense systems. Salami noted that this domain is 'among the most determining spheres' of Iran's defense capabilities, necessitating the 'exhibition of the capabilities of our air defense systems in a nearly real-world and very precise situation.'

Additionally, the air defense division utilized point-defense tactics to protect the Natanz nuclear site, engaging with 30 aerial targets using short-range systems like Dezful and Tor-M1. Iranian forces also activated the homegrown Dey-9 air defense missile system to practice intercepting a bunker buster dropped from a warplane. The system was able to track, intercept, and destroy the heavy weapon in less than 15 seconds at a distance of 17 kilometers from the nuclear facility. Furthermore, the IRGC Aerospace Force operated various other air defense systems to hone their electronic warfare tactics, showcasing Iran's commitment to bolstering its military capabilities for defensive purposes. The Eqtedar 1403 drills underline Iran's determination to strengthen its air defense systems and preparedness against potential threats, as reiterated by the country's officials.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2309012	2025-01-08T00:38:05-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-02608810017363254812.jpg
First Stage of ‘Eqtedar 1403’ Drills Kicks Off near Natanz Nuclea...	The first stage of the military exercise, codenamed Eqtedar (Authority) 1403, in the air defense zone of the Natanz nuclear facility, has commenced under the order of Brigadier General Qader Rahimzadeh, commander of the Khatam al-Anbia Air Defense Base. After announcing the beginning of the first phase of the 'Eqtedar 1403' drills on Tuesday, Brigadier General Rahimzadeh said that during this phase of the military exercise, the air defense units of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Aerospace Force are providing comprehensive protection for the Shahid Ahmadi Roshan nuclear site, commonly known as the Natanz site, against various aerial threats under critical electronic warfare conditions. He noted that the joint air defense exercise is based on detailed annual planning and will take place over the next few days as part of an exercise demonstrating the authority of the armed forces. The drills will review the training conducted over the past year, he said, adding that the exercises focusing on monitoring enemy movements and addressing the country’s air defense needs will serve as the foundation for this defense drill. Brigadier General Rahimzadeh emphasized that the air defense units from both the army and the IRGC have been deployed alongside new and advanced systems near sensitive sites, noting that, in the coming days, under the command of the integrated air defense network, they will practice robustly defending the country’s skies as part of the armed forces' authority exercises. Meanwhile, the Iranian foreign ministry stressed that the civil nuclear activities of Iran abide by the international laws and the regulations of the International Agency.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2308759	2025-01-07T13:11:30-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-00162950017362842732.jpg
Gaza Ceasefire Reportedly Looms Closer as Discussions Pivot on Po...	As the genocide in Gaza continues unabated for the 459th day, efforts to reach a ceasefire continue, with discussions focusing on post-war governance of the besieged strip. The Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) has intensified its bombardment, on Tuesday targeting multiple areas across the Gaza Strip. According to Ministry of Health in Gaza, 31 Palestinians were martyred as the IOF committed at least three massacres within the past 24 hours, bringing the total death toll since the war’s eruption on October 7, 2023, to 45,885.

Four additional soldiers sustained injuries during the confrontations. Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire, compounded by escalating violence, mounting casualties and worsening living conditions for civilians. The United Nations World Food Program (WFP) issued a statement on Monday condemning an attack by the IOF on one of its aid convoys a day earlier. The WFP reported that at least 16 bullets struck clearly marked vehicles belonging to the organization. Describing the incident as 'horrific' and 'unacceptable,' the WFP reiterated its demand for adherence to international humanitarian law, the safeguarding of civilian lives, and the unimpeded passage of humanitarian assistance. Ceasefire Talks Amid consistent violence, efforts to broker a ceasefire remain fraught with challenges, leaving the prospect of a resolution uncertain. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized the urgency of reaching a truce before the end of President Joe Biden’s term on the 20th of January. Speaking at a news conference in South Korea on Monday, Blinken expressed optimism, stating, 'We very much want to cross the finish line within the next two weeks, which is the time we have left.' His remarks came after a senior Hamas official revealed to Reuters that the resistance group had approved a list of 34 Israeli detainees to be released as part of a truce agreement. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the State Department (February 4, 2021 / photo by Reuters). Meanwhile, 'Israel' has dispatched a delegation of mid-level officials to Qatar for negotiations mediated by Qatari and Egyptian representatives. The team is expected to be joined by David Barnea, the head of Mossad, who is spearheading the talks. Gaza Post-war Governance In related developments, Reuters news agency reported that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is engaged in confidential discussions with 'Israel' and the US regarding Gaza’s post-war governance. The proposed plan envisions temporary oversight of Gaza by the UAE and the US to manage governance, security, and reconstruction until a Palestinian government is ready to assume full control. An Emirati official emphasized the 'necessity of reforming and empowering the Palestinian Authority (PA) as a prerequisite for the plan.' This vision includes the 'establishment of a credible roadmap toward an independent Palestinian state encompassing the West Bank, East Al-Quds (Jerusalem), and Gaza,' according to the report. Among the proposals put forth by Abu Dhabi is the use of private military contractors to form a peacekeeping police force for post-war Gaza, Reuters reported, adding that however, the 'plan remains contingent on significant reforms within the Palestinian Authority.' Hamas Stance Hamas has responded to these developments, with senior leader Osama Hamdan expressing the movement’s willingness to transfer Gaza’s administration to a Palestinian-led national unity government or a government composed of national elites. Osama Hamdan, top Hamas official during interview with the CNN (Thursday, June 14, 2024). Nonetheless, Hamdan reiterated Hamas’s rejection of external interference in post-war governance arrangements. Speaking at a press conference in Algeria, Hamdan affirmed that Hamas’s delegation in Doha remains steadfast in its demands, which include a complete withdrawal of the IOF, the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners, and unrestricted reconstruction efforts in Gaza. Addressing the ongoing ceasefire negotiations, Hamdan stated that no definitive outcomes were expected at this stage. He also emphasized the continued strength of the resistance, which he said is inflicting significant losses on the IOF. When questioned about a potential successor to Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Hamdan assured that internal arrangements were in place, and an announcement regarding the movement’s leadership would be made soon.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2308737	2025-01-07T12:13:43-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-02514580017267356425.jpeg
Strong Earthquake Kills at Least 126 People in Western China near...	A strong earthquake shook a high-altitude region of western China and areas of Nepal on Tuesday, damaging hundreds of houses, littering streets with rubble and killing at least 126 people in Tibet. Many others were trapped as dozens of aftershocks shook the remote region. Rescue workers climbed mounds of broken bricks, some using ladders in heavily damaged villages, as they searched for survivors. Videos posted by China's Ministry of Emergency Management showed two people being carried on stretchers by workers treading over the debris from collapsed homes. At least 188 people were injured in Tibet on the Chinese side of the border, the official Xinhua News Agency said. More than 1,000 homes were damaged in the barren and sparsely populated region, state broadcaster CCTV reported. In video posted by the broadcaster, building debris littered streets and crushed cars. People in northeastern Nepal strongly felt the earthquake, but there were no initial reports of injuries or damage, according to the country's National Emergency Operation Center. The area around Mount Everest, about 75 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of the epicenter, was empty in the depth of winter when even some residents move away to escape the cold. The quake woke up residents in Nepal’s capital of Kathmandu — about 230 kilometers (140 miles) from the epicenter — and sent them running into the streets. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake measured magnitude 7.1 and was relatively shallow at a depth of about 10 kilometers (6 miles). China's Earthquake Networks Center recorded the magnitude as 6.8. Shallow earthquakes often cause more damage. The epicenter was in Tibet's Tingri county, where the India and Eurasia plates grind against each other and can cause earthquakes strong enough to change the heights of some of the world’s tallest peaks in the Himalayan mountains. Tibet is part of China, but many Tibetans’ loyalties lie with the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader who has lived in exile in India since a failed anti-Chinese uprising in 1959. Western governments and human rights organizations have repeatedly accused the Chinese government of abuses in Tibet, where it has cracked down on dissent while investing heavily in economic development. There have been 10 earthquakes of at least magnitude 6 in the area where Tuesday’s quake hit over the past century, the USGS said. About 150 aftershocks were recorded in the nine hours after the earthquake, and the Mount Everest scenic area on the Chinese side was closed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2308550	2025-01-07T07:00:34-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-02622730017362620243.jpg
Lebanese Army Deploys in More Southern Towns as Israeli Enemy Con...	The Lebanese army units continued deploying troops in the towns of the Western Sector of South Lebanon as the Israeli enemy withdrew from more villages in the area. The Zionist occupation forces withdrew from Naqoura and Alma Al-Shaab towns before the Lebanese army completed its deployment in Naqoura and reached Labbouneh crossroad. The Lebanese army established a checkpoint in Wadi Al-Oyoun area at Beit Leif, Debl and Rshaf intersection, South Lebanon, according to Al-Manar reporter who added that the military is expected to enter all those towns in addition to that of Rmeish. Caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati affirmed that the ceasefire agreement obliges the Israeli enemy to be committed to its stipulations, adding that he informed the sponsors of the indirect deal that the halt of the Zionist violations as well as the compete withdrawal of the occupation forces are of a great necessity. Mikati also warned against the repercussions of the Zionist violations and their effects on the regional security and stability.

Israeli Occupation Escalates Aggression in the West Bank, Kills 3...	The Israeli occupation forces have escalated its aggression in the occupied West Bank, raiding several cities and towns and killing at least three Palestinians early on Tuesday. WAFA news agency reported that the ongoing aggression in the town of Tamoun, southeast Tubas, has so far resulted in the killing of two Palestinian young men. Red Crescent sources reported that their crews evacuated a critically injured person after Israeli occupation forces shelled the town. Local sources confirmed the killing of two Palestinians as a result of the shelling. Security sources identified one of the martyrs as Suleiman Mustafa Qteishat. However, they said that the identity of the second martyr was still unknown. The occupation forces raided several homes inside the town and caused damage to the properties, shops and infrastructure in the area.

2 Israeli Soldiers Killed, 4 Others Injured in Gaza Battles	Two Israeli soldiers were killed and four others were seriously wounded in fighting in the northern Gaza Strip on Monday, the Israeli occupation military announced on Tuesday. The slain soldiers served in the Nahal Brigade’s 932nd Battalion. One was a company commander and the other was his deputy, The Times of Israel reported, citing a statement by the Israeli occupation army. The two officers were killed and two other soldiers of the 932nd Battalion were seriously wounded in the same incident in northern Gaza’s Beit Hanoun. The Israeli army releases image of the two occupation soldiers killed in Gaza (January 7, 2024). The military did not immediately provide further details on the circumstances of the incident. In a separate incident on Monday, two other soldiers with the Nahal Brigade’s reconnaissance unit, were seriously wounded in fighting in northern Gaza. They were evacuated to the occupied territories for treatment. The deaths brought Israeli toll in the ground offensive on Gaza and in military operations along the border with the Strip to 397. Also on Monday, the occupation military said its instructions for soldiers have been 'sharpened' after troops opened fire on a UN World Food Program convoy in the central Gaza Strip Sunday. The WFP said the convoy of three vehicles with eight staff members came under fire by Israeli soldiers despite having received all of the necessary clearances from Israeli authorities.

US Cover-Ups for ‘Israel’ in South Lebanon: Extended Stays and Bu...	The Ceasefire Supervision Committee convened on Monday, led by US envoy Amos Hochstein, amid boiling-point tensions raised by ‘Israeli’ post-ceasefire barbarism in southern Lebanon. The meeting in the southern town of Naqoura marks the third session since the ceasefire on November 27, wherein Israeli occupation forces (IOF) saw the given 60 days as an opportunity to brazenly occupy Lebanese lands that they were never able to when in direct confrontation with Hezbollah resistance fighters. The Lebanese delegation, carrying strong objections, has aimed to address Israeli obstruction of the Lebanese army's deployment plan, Al-Akhbar Lebanese daily’s Amal Khalil reported on Monday. Prime Minister Najib Mikati previously expressed these concerns to US and French representatives during a meeting at the Grand Serail. Despite the Lebanese anger, the IOF continues their violations, with recent bombings and demolitions in areas like Naqoura, Al-Jebbain, and Teir Harfa, in addition to Taybeh, Yaroun and Aitaroun where the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) were beginning deployment. Khalil cited a well-informed source who hinted that 'the Israeli enemy will withdraw from Naqoura after this committee meeting, as it did from Khiyam after the first meeting.' بالصور | مراسل قناة المنار : توثيق لتوغل الدبابات الاسرائيلية المعادية في بلدة #الطيبة وعمليات الاحراق والتفجير pic.twitter.com/m2otZgqnqm — قناة المنار (@TVManar1) January 5, 2025 Extending Ceasefire Reports suggest that Hochstein would propose extending the ceasefire to 90 days, conditional on the Lebanese army's readiness to deploy. The source quoted US General Jasper Jeffers, US head of the monitoring committee, as saying, 'Israel will withdraw sooner or later, but according to arrangements that the border area will be subject to in cooperation between UNIFIL and the Lebanese army'. UNIFIL patrol in south Lebanon (photo from December 2024). This unclear 'sooner or later' rhetoric directly contradicts the original terms of the ceasefire agreement and suggests that the US will most likely push harder for extended IOF presence in southern Lebanon, Al-Akhbar report added. Jeffers commended the Lebanese army for adhering to UN Resolution 1701, contrasting 'Israeli' claims of the LAF’s negligence. He highlighted his recent visit to Khiyam, where he witnessed LAF units confiscating large quantities of ammunition, as evidence of its commitment, according to the report. Israeli Conditions Citing leaks from Israeli media sources, Al-Akhbar’s Khalil reported suggested conditions for withdrawal, including establishing a buffer zone along the border. These sources claimed that 'Israel will enforce a buffer zone across the border and not allow residents of southern towns to return,' though the Lebanese government has not received official confirmation of this plan. The sources added that a proposal yet to be presented by the supervision committee involves a buffer zone three kilometers deep as part of a revised map south of the Litani River, which would most likely be imposed through the signature illegal aggression of the IOF. The updated map accompanying the November 27 ceasefire agreement raises deadly concerns. While the Lebanese government reaffirmed its commitment to Resolution 1701 and stability along the Blue Line, the map omits key landmarks, such as the Shebaa Farms and Ghajar. The Blue Line, originally a withdrawal demarcation, is being treated by the supervision committee as the de facto border rather than the border set by the 1949 Israeli-Lebanese General Armistice Agreement, according to the leaks. The map also reportedly includes Yahmor Al-Shaqif, a town north of the Litani River, positioned just three kilometers from Metula, an Israeli settlement. This territorial adjustment complicates negotiations, especially as discussions turn to the party which will run the Ras Al-Naqoura crossing following the Israeli withdrawal. According to Khalil’s sources, 'Israel does not trust handing over the crossing to UNIFIL and the LAF' and instead suggests oversight by a reinforced international force or the direct involvement of the US head of the committee. While Lebanon remains firm in its demands for sovereignty and the cessation of hostilities, Israeli actions prove an entrenched refusal to comply with Resolution 1701. As the committee meets, the outcomes of proposed truce extensions, border adjustments, and management of key crossings will determine the trajectory of this volatile situation. Lebanon’s delegation seeks to ensure that its territorial integrity and rights are upheld in the face of Zionist arrogance and US deception. Earlier on Saturday, Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem warned that the resistance patience may run out before the end of the 60-day ceasefire deadline.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2308044	2025-01-06T13:18:28-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-06804240017361982106.jpg
Hochstein: Israeli Forces Will Withdraw Completely from South Leb...	The US presidential envoy Amos Hochstein arrived on Monday in Beirut, holding meetings with the senior Lebanese officials to discuss mainly the implementation of the US-brokered ceasefire in South Lebanon. Hoschstein met at first with the Lebanese Army Commander, General Joseph Aoun, in Yarzeh, in the presence of US Ambassador to Lebanon, Lisa A. Johnson, and Head of the Five-Party Supervisory Committee, US Major Gen. Jasper Jeffers. Discussions during the meeting touched on the mechanism for implementing the ceasefire which took into effect on November 27, 2024, and ended a two-month Israeli war on Lebanon. Later on, the US envoy chaired the third meeting of the Five-Party Supervisory Committee in Naqoura which was held in light of the Israeli withdrawal from the western sector. The US envoy and his accompanying delegation then visited House Speaker Nabih Berri at Ain El-Tineh Palace. Hochstein pledged continued commitment of the United States and the international community in support of the Lebanese Armed Forces as they implement the ceasefire agreement by ensuring security in the south and throughout Lebanon, noting that the withdrawals will continue until all Israeli forces are completely outside Lebanese territory. Hochstein and the US delegation also met with the Prime Minister Najib Mikati who demanded a timeline for the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon in addition to an immediate stop of the Zionist violations of the ceasefire.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2308011	2025-01-06T12:49:42-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-04563170017361965721.jpeg

Over 15,000 Ukrainian Troops Engaged in Kurakhovo, Says Russian T...	The Ukrainian military command has turned Kurakhovo in the Donetsk People’s Republic into a fortified stronghold over the past 10 years, the Russian Defense Ministry said. 'Over ten years, the Kiev regime turned it into a powerful fortified area with the developed network of permanent firing positions and underground communications,' the ministry noted. According to the military agency, the Ukrainian army has amassed over 15,000 troops in Kurakhovo, including elite units, nationalist formations and foreign mercenaries. After liberating Kurakhovo, Russian forces break out of bridgehead Russian units have more room for maneuvering following the taking of Kurakhovo which aids in increasing the rates of liberating the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), the Russian Defense Ministry said. 'After the liberation of Kurakhovo, Russian forces have broken out of the bridgehead. This will help to increase the rates of liberating the Donetsk People’s Republic,' it said in a statement. Control over Kurakhovo hinders supplies to Ukrainian troops Establishing control over the town of Kurakhovo in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has substantially hindered combat service support to the Ukrainian armed forces, the Russian Defense Ministry said. 'Taking control over this important logistics hub has significantly hindered combat service support to the Ukrainian military grouping in the Donetsk area, depriving the Kiev regime of the opportunity to use artillery systems to shell civilians in the city of Donetsk, the capital of the DPR,' the ministry said in a statement.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2307813	2025-01-06T07:04:33-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-063171300173617586210.jpg
IRGC Commander: Resistance Front Reaches Apex of Power as Hezboll...	Major General Hossein Salami, the chief commander of Iran's elite Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), declared that the regional Resistance Front has attained an unprecedented level of strength and influence. Salami emphasized that while the Resistance Front continues to grow in power, their enemies have become objects of scorn and fear, a trend he believes will persist. The commander specifically praised Lebanon's formidable Hezbollah movement for its unwavering resolve in the face of grave threats. Resistance Front at 'peak of its power'; Hezbollah imposed its will on worn-out Israel: IRGC — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) January 6, 2025 'The fact that Hezbollah stays on its course, despite those heavy dangers, is down to the struggles of [the group’s former secretary-general] the Greatest Martyr His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and [former senior official] Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, who managed to plant the roots of Jihad within the Lebanese youths’ beliefs,' Salami elaborated. Salami asserted that Hezbollah's steadfast determination allowed it to impose its will on a worn-out Israel, compelling the entity to accept the terms of a truce deal following its failed aggression against Lebanon. During the ceremony honoring the late General Qassem Suleimani, Salami commended the former anti-terror commander for his tireless efforts in leading the fight against Western- and Israeli-backed Takfiri terrorist groups, sacrificing himself for the sake of regional Muslim nations.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2307648	2025-01-06T05:33:40-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/12/manar-067219500170375961910.jpg
Israeli Occupation Army Warns Soldiers of Arrest Risk Abroad over...	An investigative report by the Israeli Kan broadcaster highlights a surge in legal attempts to prosecute Israeli occupation army soldiers abroad since the war on the Gaza Strip began. Approximately 50 complaints have been filed against reserve soldiers, leading to 10 formal investigations in various countries. However, no arrests have been reported. Social Media Risks and Cautious Travel Data from the Israeli occupation army's Information Security Division indicates that soldiers post nearly one million pieces of content daily on social media, increasing the risk of exposure and legal action. While no official travel bans to specific countries have been issued, authorities are exercising caution, particularly for dual-nationality soldiers or those traveling to high-risk nations like South Africa. Intelligence suggesting targeted efforts against soldiers has heightened vigilance. Security officials have recommended reassessing high-risk travel and incorporating legal risk evaluations into decision-making. Consequently, Zionist soldiers have also been instructed to reduce their social media activity. Experts have raised alarms over the lack of a comprehensive strategy to address this growing threat, despite ongoing efforts to mitigate exposure and legal risks. High-Profile Cases and Warnings In a recent incident, Israeli media reported that a Zionist soldier wanted in Brazil managed to leave the country before authorities could arrest him. Brazilian authorities had issued an urgent arrest warrant following a complaint by a human rights organization accusing him of crimes in Gaza. Meanwhile, Haaretz reported that the Israeli occupation army has warned reserve soldiers abroad about the risk of arrest due to their involvement in the Gaza war. Human rights organizations have been actively collecting evidence, including videos documenting alleged war crimes, to pressure local authorities to pursue legal action. Soldiers’ Families Demand Legal Protection According to Israel Hayom, the mothers of Zionist soldiers sent a strongly worded letter to Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, demanding legal protection for their sons. The letter expressed concerns about international tribunals, particularly in light of the erosion of the Israeli occupation’s so-called judicial independence.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2307417	2025-01-06T05:29:22-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/08/manar-02566110017249333574.jpg

The Israeli occupation forces withdraw from an area only to see Palestinian resistance fighters return, launching precision operations that inflict direct casualties among enemy fighters. Explosions in Sderot Amid Rocket Attacks Israeli sources reported on Monday explosions in 'Sderot' and its surroundings following rocket sirens in the area. An Israeli Army Radio correspondent confirmed the rockets were launched from Beit Hanoun.

Israeli enemy Mossad chief David Barnea headed to Doha on Monday to pursue indirect negotiations on a prisoner exchange and a ceasefire with Hamas. Axios reported that Brett McGurk, senior advisor to US President Joe Biden, also arrived in Doha to join the talks. Progress in Ceasefire Talks A Palestinian source told The New Arab news outlet that mediators have bridged gaps between the parties through compromise solutions. Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a late-night meeting on Sunday with ministers and officials to finalize a response, which Barnea is expected to deliver in Doha. Israeli media, however, noted that Netanyahu's security cabinet will not address the issue of hostages during these discussions, according to Kan 11. Escalating Aggression: Rising Civilian Casualties in Gaza The ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza has led to mounting civilian casualties. Over 20 Palestinians were injured when an Israeli drone targeted a school sheltering displaced individuals near Al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza. In Rafah, two children were martyred in an Israeli airstrike, while the Ministry of Health reported the martyrdom of a 35-day-old infant due to severe weather conditions and freezing temperatures. This brings the death toll of children succumbing to the cold in Gaza to eight. Brutal Israeli Airstrikes Across Gaza An Israeli occupation airstrike in Rafah’s Khirbet Al-Adas claimed the life of one Palestinian and injured two others. In Khan Younis, shelling in the Al-Mawasi area, which houses displaced individuals, caused additional injuries.

Another airstrike in Jabalia camp killed one civilian, while a volunteer nurse at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital lost her life in a strike on a home in Al-Nuseirat. In Rafah, two farmers were martyred while sleeping in their field, and two more were martyred in an Israeli strike targeting northeastern Rafah. Humanitarian Crisis in Northern Gaza The northern Gaza region has endured a relentless siege and bombardment for 94 consecutive days, leaving it isolated and devastated. Israeli enemy forces have paralyzed civil defense operations in northern Gaza for 74 days, preventing vital humanitarian and medical aid. Thousands of residents remain without essential care amid the continuing aggression.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2307362	2025-01-06T03:39:08-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-00626040017361631478.jpg

Hamas Says List of 34 Captives Submitted for Prisoner Swap	The Palestinian resistance group Hamas has reportedly approved a list of 34 captives it is willing to exchange with ‘Israel’ as part of ongoing ceasefire negotiations. However, the two sides remain at odds over the terms of a broader truce. According to a Hamas official who spoke to Reuters on Sunday, the list of prisoners was handed over to Israeli intermediaries on Sunday. The official emphasized that any final agreement would be contingent on Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and a permanent ceasefire. 'There has been no progress from ‘Israel’ on the matters of withdrawal from Gaza or a permanent ceasefire,' the Hamas official stated. But the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu disputed Hamas' statement, claiming that the group has not provided any names for a proposed prisoner swap. 'Up to this moment, Hamas has not delivered a list of hostage names,' a statement from Netanyahu's office said. These reports come as intensified Israeli airstrikes over the weekend killed over 100 Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip. Efforts to broker a ceasefire and secure the return of Israeli captives are ongoing in Doha, with Qatari and Egyptian mediators playing a key role.

New Arms Sale: Even in Its Final Days, Biden Administration Enabl...	Even in its last days, the tenure of US President Joe Biden was marked by unwavering support for the Israeli colonial regime. The US State Department has informed Congress of a planned $8 billion (€7.7 billion) weapons sale to the Zionist entity, which has been pressing forward with its brutal war on Gaza. The sale includes medium-range air-to-air missiles, 155 mm projectile artillery shells for long-range targeting, Hellfire AGM-114 missiles, 500-pound bombs and other weaponry. Palestinian father holds his injured child following an Israeli strike on Gaza (January 2025). The weapons package would add to a record of at least $17.9 billion (€17.3 billion) in military aid that Washington has provided the Zionist entity with since the start of the war on Gaza in October 2023. Some of the arms in the package could be sent through current US stocks but the majority would take a year or several years to deliver, AP reported, quoting two anonymous US officials. The informal notice to Congress isn’t the final notification before a sale. Now the leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee or the Senate Foreign Relations Committee can review the package. The Biden administration has faced criticism over the mounting Palestinian civilian death toll - more than 45,500 Palestinian martyrs - with demonstrations on college campuses pressing to block sales of offensive weapons to ‘Israel’. Protesters have for months demanded an arms embargo against the Zionist entity, but US policy has largely remained unchanged. In August, the United States approved the sale of $20 billion in fighter jets and other military equipment.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2306581	2025-01-05T02:06:21-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-08506260017360714536.jpg
Sheikh Qassem: Resistance Patience May Run Out before End of '60 ...	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem stressed on Saturday that the Resistance is 'our choice to liberate the land, preserve sovereignty, and support Palestine in face of the occupation.' Resistance is a cultural, faith-based, political, and jihadi choice that opposes the surrender to the enemy's will, according to Sheikh Qassem who underlined the importance of faith and preparation in the confrontation. In a televised speech on the fifth anniversary of the two martyred leaders Qassem Suleimani and Abu Mahdi Al-Muhandis, Sheikh Qassem said that in the past, 'Israel' reached Beirut within days, but during the 2024 aggression, it couldn’t advance more than a few hundred meters along the front edge. ''Israel' failed to progress because the resisting fighters held firm and steadfast against it.' His eminence asked, 'Does this not indicate that the Resistance is strong, possesses deterrence, and has thwarted the enemy’s objectives? Due to steadfastness and sacrifices, the enemy was forced to seek a ceasefire agreement, Hezbollah leader maintained. 'The enemy was compelled to request a ceasefire because of the Resistance’s strength, and we agreed through the Lebanese state.' 'We broke Israel's arrogance, preventing it from achieving its goals, and through these sacrifices, the Resistance will continue, God willing.' According to Sheikh Qassem, after the Battle of 'The Formidable in Might', Lebanon cannot exist without the Resistance. This battle shattered 'Israel's' hopes of achieving ambitions in Lebanon, he added. 'The leadership of the Resistance decides when, how, and with what weapons to resist. There is no fixed timeline dictating the Resistance’s actions. Our patience is tied to the appropriate timing to confront the enemy. Our actions may precede or exceed 60 days, and when we decide to act, you will witness it directly.' Sheikh Qassem emphasized that the agreement exclusively pertains to south of the Litani River, and the state, alongside mediators, is responsible for restraining 'Israel' and enforcing the agreement. 'The Resistance began recovering just days after the martyrdom of His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and everyone has witnessed this.' Sheikh Qassem underscored that, in 1982 invasion, the Israeli enemy reached Beirut in few days, and the resistance fought it for 18 years to expel it from the Lebanese territories. 'Whereas, in 2024. 72 thousand Israeli soldiers could not reach Litani river because of the steadfast, powerful and epic resistance.' In 64 days, the occupation forces advanced for only hundreds of meters in the border area, and the Resistance strikes inflicted heavy losses upon its officers and soldiers, Sheikh Qassem said. Lebanon suffered big humanitarian and materialistic losses inflicted by the Israeli aggression, yet those sacrifices fortify the national dignity, Hezbollah leader underscored. When the ceasefire took into effect, the Islamic Resistance capabilities were still there, Sheikh Qassem stressed. The ceasefire took place, not because the Resistance lost its weapons, but the enemy requested the deal due to its ground failure. Sheikh Qassem affirmed that the Israeli schemes against Lebanon are doomed to failure, mentioning that the military invasion, establishment of a buffer zone, and the construction of settlements are impossible. His eminence also called for observing the Israeli invasion of south Syria and how the enemy troops controlled an area equal to 1.5 that of Gaza, highlighting the Israeli airstrikes on the military capabilities of the Syrian army. 'We believe that in the future, the Syrian people will play a role in confronting 'Israel' because they are honorable and dignified people,' Sheikh Qassem noted. In response to the hostile propaganda that targets the Resistance and its social incubation, Sheikh Qassem stressed that the Resistance is still powerful and possesses great capabilities, citing the Israeli request of the ceasefire. Sheikh Qassem also underlined the power of faith that enhances the military victories despite the great sacrifices made by the martyrs, injuries, prisoners and their families. We passed the divine exam, and the materialistic losses will be compensated, Sheikh Qassem said, stressing the hostile propaganda is run by people who had dreamed of the defeat of the Resistance. Hezbollah Secretary General stressed that the Palestinian people are the loftiest in the world with respect to the sacrifices, underling that 155 thousand martyrs or injuries have been left so far by the Zionist war amid the silence of the international community. Sheikh Qassem stressed that the Palestinian resistance would persist despite the Israeli crimes of killing women and children in Gaza. Hezbollah leader also greeted Yemen's people, command and army, haling their achievements in face of the Israeli enemy, US, Britain and their allies despite the meager capabilities. The Yemeni support for Gaza puts the Arab and Islamic states' reluctance under question of capabilities and choices, his eminence said. 'The martyr Hajj Qassem Suleimani was a strategic leader on intellectual and political levels. Hajj Qassem drew from the essence of Islam, the pure Mohammadi Islam, following the path of Imam Khomeini (may Allah's blessings be upon him) and Imam Khamenei (may his shadow endure).' Sheikh Qassem indicated that martyr Suleimani exposed America, its plans, and its support for ISIL, and thwarted America's shifting projects in the region, adding that he also unveiled 'Israel's' expansionist schemes, delivering harsh blows by redirecting focus to occupied Palestine, restoring its prominence. Martyr Souimani also worked to connect the region's arenas to benefit from one another, playing a vital role in restoring the Palestinian cause as the central issue of the region, he added. Sheikh Qassem borrowed the words of his beloved companion in fight, the Leader of the Resistance, His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who said, 'The dear brother Hajj Qassem Suleimani achieved his greatest wish and earned the high honor of being rightfully called the Master of the Martyrs of the Resistance Axis.' 'The martyr commander Abu Mahdi Al-Muhandis was a towering figure in Iraq, with a significant role in its liberation from the cursed Saddam and from ISIL, which sought to occupy Iraq. Abu Mahdi played a pivotal role under the banner of the religious authority in establishing the Hashd Shaabi and driving out the American occupation of Iraq.' Regarding the Lebanese presidential elections, Sheikh Qassem stressed that Hezbollah is keen on the success of the constitutional entitlement on the basis of cooperation among the parliamentary blocs concerned with the vote, away from the foreign dictates. 'The abolitionists have no chance; those who rely on foreigners cannot pass this entitlement with their support,' he continued, 'We want to accomplish January 9 entitlement by choosing a new president for a new, positive and cooperative phase that leads to stability, and we work on the basis of consolidating and dedicating national unity, Islamic unity, and all forms of internal cooperation in order to develop reconstruct our country.' Sheikh Qassem started his speech by congratulating the Islamic nation on the beginning of the blessed month of Rajab and the birth of Imam Ali Al-Hadi (peace be upon him), and we also offer condolences on his martyrdom according to some narrations.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2306372	2025-01-04T12:18:43-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-03957560017360218414.jpg

The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Ground Force has launched a large-scale and specialized drill in Iran’s western province of Kermanshah, as part of attempts to raise its combat preparedness and get further ready to confront potential security threats against the country. The drills, codenamed Payambar-e-A’azam (Great Prophet) 19, kicked off in a combat zone in western Iran on Saturday, with the participation of various specialized divisions and units of the IRGC Ground Force, particularly from the Mirza Kuchak Khan Brigades. During the first stage of the war game, different rapid response operation scenarios were exercised. The quick transfer of troops and military hardware to the exercise area was carried out in the first part of the drills. Iranian military forces hold routine exercises according to a detailed schedule in various parts of the country in order to test their weaponry and equipment and evaluate their combat preparedness. The country’s officials have repeatedly underscored that the country will not hesitate to strengthen its military capabilities, including its missile power, which are entirely meant for defense, and that Iran’s defense capabilities will never be subject to negotiations.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2305888	2025-01-04T04:21:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-05253160017359932792.jpg

In response to the raid, Saraya al-Quds, the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement, announced that its fighters had confronted the Israeli forces storming the eastern areas of Balata camp. The resistance group said it unleashed heavy gunfire and explosive devices at the Israeli occupation troops and military vehicles. According to local sources, Israeli occupation forces entered the outskirts of Balata camp from the nearby Awarta checkpoint and deployed snipers on the roofs of buildings. The troops opened fire on residents, injuring several. Ambulances were reportedly prevented from entering the camp to evacuate the wounded.

Lebanese Parliament Set to Elect New President After Two-Year Vac...	Lebanon's Parliament will convene on January 9, 2025, to elect a president, ending a vacancy that has persisted for over two years following the expiration of former President Michel Aoun's term. Role of the President Article 49 of the Lebanese Constitution defines the president as the head of state and a symbol of national unity. The president is responsible for upholding the constitution, safeguarding Lebanon's independence, and preserving its territorial integrity. As the supreme commander of the armed forces, the president operates under the authority of the Council of Ministers and presides over the Higher Defense Council. Election Process The president is elected by secret ballot in Parliament. In the first round, a two-thirds majority (86 of 128 MPs) is required. If subsequent rounds are needed, a simple majority (more than 50%) suffices. The presidential term lasts six years, with reelection prohibited until six years after the end of the initial term. To qualify for candidacy, individuals must meet the eligibility criteria for parliamentary membership and face no legal impediments. Judges and senior civil servants are ineligible to run for office while serving and for two years after their resignation, retirement, or cessation of duties. Lebanon's 12th parliamentary session aimed at electing a new president (June 14, 2023). Political Consensus and Constitutional Norms In Lebanon, there is no formal nomination process for presidential candidates as seen in parliamentary elections. Instead, the presidency typically results from political consensus among domestic factions, often influenced by external support or approval. Since the Taif Agreement of 1990 and the subsequent constitutional amendments, presidential elections have rarely featured multiple candidates. Instead, Parliament votes on a single agreed-upon name, a stark contrast to the competitive elections seen before the 1975 civil war. Maronite Presidency and Fixed Terms A longstanding, unwritten convention reserves the presidency for a Maronite Christian, a tradition upheld since Lebanon's independence in 1943. The president serves a single six-year term without renewal or extension unless a constitutional amendment is made, as occurred with Presidents Elias Hrawi and Émile Lahhoud, whose terms were exceptionally extended by three years each. Eligibility Restrictions Article 49 of the constitution bars judges, senior civil servants, and military officials from running for the presidency during their tenure. Exceptions require constitutional amendments, as was the case for President Lahoud, when such a change allowed his election despite serving as Commander of the Lebanese Army. Election of Michel Sleiman and Absence of Const. Amendments On May 25, 2008, General Michel Suleiman was elected president without a constitutional amendment, unlike his predecessor, President Lahoud. He received 118 votes, ensuring his election through political consensus and national parliamentary agreement. A presidential election can be contested before the Constitutional Council within 24 hours, requiring a third of Parliament's members (43 out of 128). However, this was not the case with Suleiman's election, as he secured overwhelming support, with only 10 MPs opposing him. The national settlement reached in Doha, with external backing, resolved the debate over amending the constitution for his election. The question remains: Could such a scenario unfold again? In the coming days, it will become clearer whether a presidential election will take place or if the election of a candidate from the civil service will require a constitutional amendment.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2305745	2025-01-04T02:57:34-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-099261700173599138310.jpg
Gaza: Israeli Airstrikes Target Displaced Civilians, Destroy Crit...	The Israeli occupation forces (IOF) have intensified their devastating assault on the Gaza Strip, committing further atrocities against the civilian population. In a series of airstrikes and bombardments over the weekend, the IOF targeted the tents of displaced residents in the cities of Deir al-Balah and Rafah, resulting in injuries. The attacks began on Saturday at dawn, when the IOF bombed a tent housing displaced people along the street of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. Injuries were also reported following an IOF attack on the Ghoul family's house in the Shuja'iyya neighborhood, east of Gaza City. Simultaneously, IOF aircraft targeted the western part of the Sabra neighborhood, south of Gaza City.

In the southern Gaza Strip, an IOF attack on a house in the al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis resulted in the death of a child and the injury of 10 individuals, with three others reported missing.

Alongside these attacks on civilian targets, the IOF have intensified their assault on Gaza's medical sector. On Friday, the IOF issued a threat to those present at the Indonesian Hospital in the northern Gaza Strip, demanding their immediate evacuation. This came after the forces had already destroyed the hospital's oxygen and electricity stations and continued to bulldoze the surrounding area, systematically dismantling essential infrastructure.

The ongoing Israeli aggression in the Gaza Strip, which began on October 7, 2023, has resulted in a population decline of approximately 6%. This devastating war has led to the martyrdom of around 45,581 Palestinians and left 108,438 others injured, according to initial figures. Eleven Palestinians were reported killed in a massacre committed by Israeli occupation forces when an airstrike targeted a residential building in the Shejaiya neighborhood, east of Gaza City, last night. pic.twitter.com/JvCgotXvwB — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) January 4, 2025	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2305657	2025-01-04T02:02:57-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-01552600017307483156.jpg
US Plans $8 Billion Arms Sale to ‘Israel’: Reports	The Biden administration has informed Congress of a proposed $8 billion arms sale to ‘Israel’, further bolstering the Zionist regime’s military capabilities. This latest package comes on the heels of over $22 billion in US military aid provided to ‘Israel’ since October 2023. According to a report by Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom, the US has significantly ramped up its military support for Israel in recent months. Initially, 10,000 tons of ammunition valued at $2.4 billion were sent, but this amount has since quintupled, reaching 50,000 tons by August 2024. Scoop: Biden notifies Congress of $8 billion arms sale to Israel — Axios (@axios) January 4, 2025 The aid package encompasses a wide array of advanced weaponry, including missiles for the Iron Dome defense system, precision-guided bombs, heavy-lift helicopters, attack helicopters, artillery shells, bunker-buster bombs, and armored vehicles. Notably, the report highlights a 15% surge in the total revenues of Israel's three major arms manufacturing companies following the onset of the aggression on Gaza, reaching a staggering $13.6 billion. The latest arms deal, which requires approval from both House and Senate committees, comes at a time when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested that a prisoner exchange deal and an end to the war on Gaza would not be approved 'unless it comes as a directive or clear order from the US president.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2305591	2025-01-04T00:41:18-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/08/manar-09806660016301811925.jpeg
Withdrawal: The Only Option for ‘Israel’ in South Lebanon	As the 60-day deadline for the Israeli withdrawal from occupied Lebanese territories approaches, reports and actions since the recent ceasefire on 27 November have raised serious doubts about the Zionist entity’s intentions to comply. This possibility has become a pressing concern, fueling debates over its implications and potential consequences for Lebanon and the broader region, Al-Akhbar Lebanese daily reported on Friday. This hypothesis of Israel’s 'non-withdrawal' has gained traction due to the consistent violations in areas south of the Litani River. Such violations include airstrikes, destruction of homes, and other aggressive acts. Observers suggest these actions reflect a strategic calculation by Israeli leadership, banking on Hezbollah’s apparent reluctance to reignite hostilities. Hezbollah’s commitment to upholding the ceasefire agreement, despite provocations, is seen by 'Israel' as a factor emboldening such brazen aggression, Al-Akhbar’s Ali Haidar wrote. A critical variable in the Israeli strategy appears to be the situation in Syria, which has impacted Hezbollah’s strategic depth. The fall of the Syrian regime and Israeli subsequent expansion into Syrian territories, occupying approximately 400 square kilometers, further demonstrates its offensive stance. This has occurred without any Syrian instigation and went by without a single military response, according to the report. Israeli occupation forces set fire to a house in the town of Bani Hayyan, south of Lebanon.#Bani_Hayyan #Lebanon @qudsn pic.twitter.com/ZSBt4OIBAt — ⚡️🌎 World News 🌐⚡️ (@ferozwala) January 3, 2025 Should 'Israel' fail to withdraw by the 27th of January, it would again be violating the terms of the ceasefire agreement it signed, undermining the credibility of both the Lebanese state and the agreement’s supervisory committee. Such a scenario would erode trust in the Lebanese government among residents of southern Lebanon and prove without doubt the inefficacy of diplomacy in the face of the Israeli barbarism. All of this would again pit Hezbollah’s resistance efforts as the only legitimate means to enforce Israeli compliance, which may mean a reignition of war, Al-Akhbar reported. Domestically, the persistence of the Israeli occupation complicates Lebanon’s political landscape. It greatly undermines arguments by resistance opponents that the Lebanese state, through international relations and diplomacy, can safeguard the nation without military resistance. The situation exposes weaknesses in Lebanon’s government, particularly in its handling of sovereignty and reconstruction efforts, Haidar added. He wrote that attempts by certain political leaders to shift blame onto the resistance, accusing it of monopolizing government decisions, further highlight Lebanon’s internal divisions. For Hezbollah, according to the Lebanese writer and analyst, the occupation represents an ongoing challenge that demands strategic responses. While the group has not disclosed specific plans, its leadership maintains that Israeli occupation of Lebanese land has no future. Any silence on this issue, they argue, would misrepresent the post-agreement reality and embolden further Israeli transgressions. The timing and nature of any response by the resistance will likely depend on its assessment of conditions on the ground, he added. However, Hezbollah has emphasized that its enhanced capabilities and experience since the liberation of the year 2000 make it well-prepared for renewed confrontations, that which was proven during the most recent battles, should they become necessary, according to Al-Akhbar. Hezbollah fighters in a photo released by the group's Military Media (image from archive). As the situation develops, the prospect of continued Zionist occupation poses a significant risk on the integrity of the ceasefire agreement, and stands as proof to opponents of armed resistance that the only language the Zionist enemy understands is that of the sword, Al-Akbar’s Haidar concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2305261	2025-01-03T13:24:06-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-06482690017359393356.jpg
Yemeni Armed Forces Strike Power Station, Military Target in 'Tel...	The Yemeni Armed Forces announced on Friday the successful execution of two military operations targeting the occupied city of Tel Aviv in the heart of occupied Palestinian territory. The operations involved a hypersonic ballistic missile, 'Palestine-2,' and a drone strike using the 'Jaffa' model. In a statement made during mass rallies in support of Gaza, held in the capital, Sana'a, Yemeni Armed Forces spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Saree outlined the operations. He confirmed that the missile, launched by Yemen's missile forces, accurately struck a power station east of the occupied Jaffa region. Brigadier Saree also revealed that the Yemeni Air Force, using the 'Jaffa' drone, carried out a successful military operation targeting an Israeli military site in the same area. He noted that the drone strike achieved its objective. 'These operations represent a victory for the Palestinian people and their fighters,' Saree stated, emphasizing that they serve as a response to the ongoing Israeli massacres in Gaza. He also clarified that these strikes are part of the fifth phase of Yemen’s support operations in the 'Promised Conquest and Sacred Jihad' campaign, directly retaliating against Israeli aggression on Yemen. Brigadier Saree reaffirmed the Yemeni Armed Forces' readiness to confront any potential aggression from U.S. and Israeli forces or their allies, stressing that Yemen is fully capable of defending its sovereignty and legitimate rights. He concluded by renewing his call for the Arab and Islamic worlds to take decisive action to end Israeli massacres against the people of Gaza. Yemeni Armed Forces Israeli Occupation Admits Failure to Intercept Yemeni Missile In a rare admission, Israeli media acknowledged the failure of both the Israeli enemy and US defense systems to intercept a missile launched from Yemen early this morning. According to reports from the Israeli enemy's media, the missile caused widespread panic, with its launch forcing approximately 5 million Zionists into bomb shelters. Failed Interception Attempts and Widespread Panic The Israeli occupation army admitted to failing in its attempts to intercept the Yemeni missile, which was launched towards the central area in occupied territories. As the missile was tracked, alarm sirens blared across 'Tel Aviv' and more than 150 cities and towns in the occupied areas. A spokesperson for the Israeli occupation army confirmed that the missile was detected as it entered occupied airspace, triggering the activation of warning systems in multiple regions, including central and southern areas. Explosion and Casualties The missile caused explosions near the occupied city of Al-Quds (Jerusalem) and its surrounding areas. Israeli reports confirmed that the missile struck a military base near Modiin, located west of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. Israeli emergency services reported injuries among settlers, particularly during their rushed attempts to seek shelter. Twelve settlers were injured while running for cover, and nine others were affected by panic following the activation of the alarm systems. Impact on Aviation In response to the missile strike, French airlines announced the suspension of flights to Tel Aviv until January 17. Moreover, air traffic at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv was halted once again following the Yemeni missile attack.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2305140	2025-01-03T09:31:58-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-01195600017359231906.png

Israeli occupation forces have continued their violations of the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon, launching a series of attacks on southern areas. On Thursday evening, the Israeli enemy conducted airstrikes on the outskirts of Jbaa and Mount Al-Rihan in the Iqlim Al-Tuffah region. Simultaneously, Israeli enemy troops carried out sweeping operations throughout the night and into Friday morning, targeting villages near the southern border, including Maroun Al-Ras, Tallousa, Markaba, and Al-Naqoura. Explosions were reported in Bani Hayyan and Kfar Kila, as well as in Wadi Muzlim, an area between Beit Lif and Ramiya, where Israeli occupation forces had advanced earlier.

Notable incidents included operations near Marwahin, opposite the Zionist Zar'it barracks, and in Aita Al-Shaab, adjacent to the Israeli Al-Raheb military site. Persistent Airspace Violations Israeli surveillance drones and reconnaissance aircraft have maintained a constant presence over southern Lebanon, conducting round-the-clock monitoring and intelligence-gathering operations, further breaching the ceasefire terms. In Beirut's Dahiyeh, reconnaissance drones have been observed flying at low altitudes throughout the day. Lebanese Army Deployment to Al-Naqoura Delayed Plans for the Lebanese Army to deploy in Al-Naqoura have been postponed indefinitely due to Israeli enemy delays in withdrawing from the area. According to Al-Akhbar newspaper, the Lebanese Army had coordinated with the UN’s oversight committee, led by US officer Gasper Jeffers, who reportedly requested more time for Israeli occupation forces to leave. A source familiar with the matter revealed that the Lebanese Army had initiated the deployment plan, urging the committee to pressure the Israeli enemy for a complete withdrawal from the western sector. However, no decision was reached. The Lebanese Army informed the committee of its intention to enter Al-Naqoura after completing its deployment in Shama. Despite this, Israeli enemy forces have employed delaying tactics, appearing to maintain control over the situation. According to Al-Akhbar, the Israeli enemy’s maneuvering undermines Lebanese initiatives and perpetuates its hold over the border region.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2305008	2025-01-03T06:29:22-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-08801580017359143249.jpg

Yemen Rises in Solidarity: Massive Demonstrations Across the Nati...	Massive demonstrations have erupted across Yemen in support of the Palestinian people and their resistance against Israeli aggression. From the northern reaches of Saada to the southern cities of Taiz and Ibb, Yemenis from all walks of life poured into the streets by the hundreds of thousands, their voices rising as one to condemn the Israeli aggression on Gaza and demand an end to the suffering of their Palestinian brothers and sisters. The Al-Aqsa Support Committee, which helped organize the demonstrations, designated a staggering 680 locations across 14 Yemeni governorates as gathering points for the marches.

‘Israel’ Launches Airstrikes on Syrian Defense Sites Amid Ongoing...	Israeli warplanes carried out targeted strikes on Syrian defense production facilities located in the eastern countryside of Aleppo late Thursday night. The airstrikes, which aimed to cripple Syria's arms manufacturing capabilities, came amidst an ongoing Israeli ground offensive that has seen Israeli forces push deep into Syrian territory. According to reports, Israeli troops have advanced as far as the strategically important al-Mantara Dam in the Quneitra countryside, effectively seizing control of the buffer zone east of the Golan Heights. This area includes six critical bodies of water and the tactically valuable Mount Hermon peak. The scale of Israel's military activities in Syria is said to be equivalent to the deployment of two full brigades, underscoring the seriousness of the situation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2304656	2025-01-03T00:16:44-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-06051240017343434558.jpg

The Israeli regime has launched numerous aerial assaults on targets in Yemen, including the Sanaa airport, the port of Hodeidah, and power/energy facilities. The YAF has defended against American and British aggression, downing high-value drones and engaging in naval battles to thwart or minimize the effects of these attacks.

Iranians Commemorate Martyrdom Anniversary of General Suleimani a...	Ceremonies have been held across Iran to commemorate the martyrdom anniversary of anti-terror icon Lieutenant General Qassem Suleimani, the commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) who was assassinated by the US in Iraq on January 3, 2020. The ceremonies were held on Thursday in different Iranian cities including the capital Tehran where people as well as top military and state officials gathered at the Grand Mosalla Mosque to pay tribute to General Soleimani and other martyrs who lost their lives in fighting against terrorism and defending holy shrines in the West Asia region in the past years. Participants in the Tehran ceremony carried pictures of Hajj Qassem Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a senior commander of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) who was martyred alongside the top Iranian general in a US drone strike near Iraq’s capital Baghdad. The participants also carried pictures of resistance leaders including Lebanon’s Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and Palestine’s Hamas leaders Ismail Haniyeh and Yayha Sinwar, all assassinated by the Israeli regime in a span of several months in 2024. 'Resistance will continue' Yemen’s Ambassador to Tehran Ibrahim Mohammad al-Deilami was in attendance as well, making a speech in which he promised that the Resistance Axis will continue to fight despite Israeli crimes. He also hailed the Iranian people for their support of the Resistance Axis and the Palestinian people in their struggle to liberate their land from the Israeli occupation. Najaf commemoration ceremony A ceremony was also held on Thursday in Iraq’s holy city of Najaf to commemorate the martyrdom anniversary of General Soleimani and al-Muhandis. Iran’s Supreme Leader’s Representative to Iraq Ayatollah Sayyed Mojtaba Hosseini made a speech in Najaf, emphasizing the need for continuing the path of the martyrs who defended the dignity of the Islamic Ummah. He also spoke about the Israeli regime’s crimes in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria, saying that Israeli authorities should stand trial over those crimes including the killing of civilians and the destruction of infrastructure. The cleric said that the Israeli regime and its supporters are responsible for the war crimes committed against the oppressed people in the region.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2304458	2025-01-02T14:27:19-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-03761680017358568295.jpg
Houthi Vows Inflicting More Pain on ‘Israel’ in Support of Gaza d...	Head of Yemen's Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi stressed on Thursday that the confrontation with the Zionist enemy in support of Gaza would continue despite all the conspiracies of the United States and the rest of the Western states. 'The Israeli enemy realizes that no matter how much it attacks, with the Americans and the British, and even if whoever joins it, it will not affect the Yemeni position.' In a televised speech, Sayyed Houthi affirmed that Yemen has achieved a great victory, vowing inflicting more pain upon the Zionist entity in support of Gaza. 'Our operations are continuing intensively to target the Israeli enemy in support of the Palestinian people and their mujahideen.' Tackling the latest developments, Sayyed Houthi indicated that the recent Yemeni attacks on the Zionist entity included the strategic targets of Jaffa (Tel Aviv), Ben Gurion airport, electric plant in south of Al-Quds, and Nevatim airbase. Houthi underlined the Yemeni missile and drone attack on the US aircraft carrier Truman, adding that the operation frustrated a US aggression on Yemen and led to Truman withdrawal. Sayyed Houthi also underscored the importance of jihad and weaponry possession, stressing that the aggression will never prevent the Yemenis from supporting Gaza. 'The battle we are fighting with the Americans is at a level that necessarily pushes us to develop our military capabilities, and this is what has been done.' US-British aggression aircraft launched on Tuesday air strikes on the capital, Sanaa. Yemeni sources reported that 10 raids targeted the 22 May Complex in Al-Thawra District and two raids hit Al-Ardi Complex in Al-Safiyah District.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2304337	2025-01-02T12:49:41-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-08973250017358509744.jpg
Imam Khamenei Welcomes Families of Resistance Front Martyrs on Fi...	Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei has paid tribute to Iran’s top anti-terror commander Lieutenant General Qassem Suleimani ahead of his fifth martyrdom anniversary. 'Martyr Suleimani’s constant strategy was to revive the Resistance Front,' Ayatollah Khamenei said during a meeting with a group of families of martyrs, veterans, and resistance activists on Wednesday morning. He said if it were not for the endeavors of the late commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), the fate of all holy sites would have been the same as the shrine of Samarra in Iraq, arguing that the martyrs of the fight against terrorism did not lose their precious lives in vain. 'Some people, due to a lack of proper analysis, understanding, and knowledge of the issues, imagine and say, and perhaps promote, that with the recent events in the region, the blood [of martyrs] defending the shrine was wasted,' he lamented. 'They are making a grave mistake,' he asserted. 'If these lives had not been sacrificed and this struggle had not been fought and Hajj Qassem Suleimani had not moved with such courage in the mountains and deserts of this region and had not taken [these martyrs] with him, there would be no holy [shrine] today.' According to Ayatollah Khamenei, General Suleimani was a man of the battlefield who played an irreplaceable role in the region. 'He himself did not say or write much. I do not think that anyone else has written about these characteristics and these details for posterity,' he said. 'This is one of the things that are a source of regret.' ‘Ultimate victory belongs to truth front’ Elsewhere in his remarks, the Supreme Leader argued that if countries make the mistake of removing their forces of stability and strength, who are the faithful youth, from the scene, they will become like Syria. However, he noted that the ultimate victory of the front of truth against the enemies is certain, adding, 'Know that those who are running wild today will one day be trampled under the feet of the believers.' The American bases in Syria will be trampled upon under the feet of the Syrian youth, he predicted. Ayatollah Khamenei described Lebanon and Yemen as symbols of resistance, saying they will emerge victorious. He also said that the events of these past few years and the anti-terror victories of the 'defenders of the shrine' have shown that the Islamic Revolution is alive. Al-Manar TV Al-Manar TV corresponded attended the event, reporting the sincere moments of the meeting between the Leader and the members of the sacrificing families. Zeinab Qassem Suleimani said that the Resistance, Hezbollah and Palestine are alive, adding that the successors of Martyr Qassem Suleimani will follow his path.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2304271	2025-01-02T11:57:23-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-08209610017358467426.png

Multiple violations of the ceasefire agreement were reported on Thursday in the western villages of southern Lebanon, near the border with occupied Palestine. Notably, Israeli forces, including armored units and infantry, advanced towards the outskirts of Beit Lif. According to Al-Manar correspondent, this Israeli enemy military movement occurred between the villages of Ramia and Beit Lif, heading towards Wadi Muzlem, originating from the border region of Al-Salhani. Al-Manar correspondent Ali Shouaib captures 8 Israeli Merkava tanks, a bulldozer, Hummers, and infantry advancing towards the area, clearing land in the valley Heavy Gunfire and Shelling In conjunction with this advance, Israeli occupation forces conducted a thorough sweep of the area, using machine guns to fire heavy bursts towards the village.

Al-Manar correspondent stated that over the past week, Israeli enemy forces withdrew a significant number of their vehicles and troops from the Al-Naqoura vicinity, moving towards Alam Al-Shaab and then into the occupied Palestinian territories. The Lebanese Army has confirmed its readiness to enter various southern areas previously vacated by Israeli forces. While there is no specific date set for the Lebanese Army's entry into Al-Naqoura, the situation remains fluid, with operations unfolding without prior scheduling, as witnessed in previous withdrawal and deployment actions along the border.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2304040	2025-01-02T05:00:57-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-00307230017358222884.jpg
Hamas Commemorates Saleh Al-Arouri’s Martyrdom, Vows Unwavering R...	Hamas reaffirmed its commitment to steadfastness and resistance against the Israeli occupation on the first anniversary of the assassination of Saleh Al-Arouri, Deputy Head of Hamas' Political Bureau and its leader in the West Bank, along with other cadres. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the movement emphasized that such assassinations have failed and will continue to fail in breaking the will of the Palestinian people and their unwavering resistance. A Beacon of Sacrifice 'The pure blood of martyr Sheikh Saleh Al-Arouri and his comrades mingled with the blood of tens of thousands of martyrs from Gaza, the West Bank, and the diaspora, as well as the blood of the nation’s martyrs in Operation Al-Aqsa Flood for Palestine and the sacred Al-Aqsa Mosque, and will forever serve as a guiding beacon for every fighter and resistor on the path to liberation,' Hamas affirmed. The movement praised Al-Arouri's life as one dedicated to sacrifice, jihad, and unwavering commitment to the Palestinian cause, particularly Al-Quds (occupied Jerusalem) and Al-Aqsa Mosque. 'He and his comrades achieved the highest aspiration of martyrdom in the struggle, leaving behind steadfast men to carry the banner, defend our people, and continue the journey until liberation and return, God willing.' Hamas reiterated that it remains unshaken despite the loss of its leaders and founders, noting that figures such as Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, Sheikh Ahmad Yassine, and Dr. Abdel Aziz Al-Rantisi have all embraced martyrdom for the dignity of the Palestinian people and the nation. 'This movement, which has offered its leaders and founders as martyrs, will never be defeated.' Call to Action The movement urged Palestinians to follow the example of these great leaders by intensifying resistance against the Israeli occupation, which it described as having surpassed all bounds of human rationality with its crimes. It also called for escalating confrontation and solidarity with the Palestinian cause, its sacred sites, and its prisoners. Commitment to Victory Hamas concluded by affirming its unwavering dedication to the path of its martyred leaders. 'We march on this path until victory and liberation, unafraid of the occupation's terrorism or the support it receives from some Western nations for its criminal regime.' Martyr Sheikh Saleh Al-Arouri was assassinated on Tuesday, January 2, 2024, in an Israeli airstrike targeting an apartment and a car in Beirut’s Dahiyeh. Two commanders of Al-Qassam Brigades, Samir Fandi and Azzam Al-Aqraa, were also martyred in the attack.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2303941	2025-01-02T04:11:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-046699200170427526610.jpg

Abu Hamza, the spokesperson for Saraya al-Quds, the armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, disclosed that an Israeli captive attempted suicide three days ago due to his deteriorating mental state.

In response to this development, Saraya al-Quds has tightened security measures to ensure the safety of the Israeli captives. The news of the suicide attempt comes amidst growing discontent among the families of Israeli captives held in Gaza, who have been staging protests across the occupied territories, criticizing their government's handling of the prisoner swap talks. The incident has further underscored the urgency and sensitivity of the issue, as the mental well-being of the captives hangs in the balance. Concurrently, the Israeli military has acknowledged a significant rise in suicide cases among its own ranks, particularly among mobilized reserve troops, as the ongoing war takes a heavy toll on soldiers' mental health. The army's data reveals that 38 soldiers committed suicide in 2023 and 2024, with a staggering 28 of these cases occurring after October 7, 2023, coinciding with the escalation of the conflict. The surge in suicides is attributed to the unprecedented mobilization of approximately 300,000 reservists during the war.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2303930	2025-01-02T03:42:40-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/02/manar-05345980016772342712-e1677234357952.jpg

At least 10 people were killed and as many as 35 injured after a truck drove into a large crowd on Bourbon Street in New Orleans' French Quarter early on Wednesday during a New Year's celebration, according to the FBI and city leaders. The pick-up truck crashed into the crowd at high speed around 3:15 a.m. and within moments the driver started firing on police officers from inside the vehicle, New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said at an early morning news conference. Two officers were shot and are now being treated in stable condition. CNN and ABC News, citing unnamed officials, said the gunman was killed at the scene. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell told reporters that the driver was on a mission to kill as many people as possible. 'He was hell bent on creating the carnage and the damage that he did . . . This man was trying to run over as many people as he possibly could. It was not a DUI situation,' Cantrell said. Hundreds of police officers were in the city for New Year's Eve duty when the assault happened, Cantrell said. The driver of the truck swerved around barricades on his way into the crowd, she said. 'Last night, we had over 300 officers out here, and because of the intentional mindset of this perpetrator who went around our barricades in order to conduct this,' the mayor said.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2303281	2025-01-01T06:31:18-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-01282770017357418649.png
Imam Hails Martyr Suleimani’s Unique Sacrifices in Reviving Resis...	The Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, has praised the 'unique' sacrifices of Iran's top anti-terror commander, Lieutenant General Qassem Suleimani, who was assassinated by the United States in 2020. Addressing a gathering of families of martyrs, veterans, and resistance activists, Imam Khamenei described Martyr Suleimani's role in the fight against terrorism as 'matchless' and said his sacrifices and services 'must remain in our political teachings.' The Leader emphasized that Martyr Suleimani's 'constant strategy was to revive the Resistance Front,' and he 'always tried to revitalize the resistance' across the region. Defending the holy sites was a tenet for the revered commander, who invariably referred to Iran as a 'sacred shrine.' Imam Khamenei said Suleimani's global perspective and refusal to adopt a 'closed and limited outlook' were crucial characteristics that enabled him to detect and prevent dangers from beyond Iran's borders. 📹 Imam Khamenei in commemoration ceremony of the fifth anniversary of the martyrdom of Gen. Qasem Soleimani: The power of faith in #Lebanon and #Yemen will ultimately prevail pic.twitter.com/erIIOgxrdY — Khamenei Media (@Khamenei_m) January 1, 2025 The Leader underlined that the developments in the past few years, including the defense of holy shrines in Iraq, Syria, and across the region, have proven that the Islamic Revolution is 'alive.' He promised that 'the truth front will definitely emerge victorious,' with the 'flag of resistance' still flying high despite the efforts of 'ill-wishers.' Touching on the US assassination of Suleimani and his companion, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, Imam Khamenei emphasized that the IRGC's missile attack on the US-run Ain al-Asad base in Iraq was just the 'first slap' in retaliation. He also vowed that American bases in Syria would be 'trampled upon under the feet of Syrian youth,' as the country belongs to its people. The Leader's powerful tribute to Martyr Suleimani's legacy and the unwavering resilience of the Resistance Front has once again underscored the enduring impact of the Iranian commander's sacrifices in the fight against terrorism and the defense of the Islamic Republic's interests in the region.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2303215	2025-01-01T05:51:28-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-040528700173573947910.jpg
The American Role in Post-Regime Syria: Geopolitical Stakes and S...	Translated and edited by Al-Manar English Website The United States has long viewed Syria as a critical piece in its West Asian foreign policy. Geographically situated at the crossroads of vital regions, Syria’s strategic importance encompasses economic, political, and security interests. With the fall of the Syrian government in 2024, the United States has intensified efforts to move in on what many describe as its new 'golden opportunity' to secure a permanent place in the administration of the country. Strategic Importance of Syria Syria’s proximity to occupied Palestine, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey grants it a central role in shaping regional dynamics. Protecting 'Israel' remains a cornerstone of US policy, positioning Syria’s governance as a crucial factor in ensuring Tel Aviv’s security and its ability to conduct massive aggressions throughout the region with impunity. As a transportation hub and a regional bridge for various alliances, Syria influences both resistance movements and US takeover strategies. Efforts to undermine the Syrian state trace back to 2003, following the US invasion of Iraq. Under the 'domino effect' theory, Washington viewed Iraq as a gateway to transforming Syria and eroding resistance in Lebanon and Palestine to the Zionist project. Despite setbacks such as the failure of these initiatives in 2006 and 2007, the US pursued regime change in Syria, again during the Arab Spring in 2011, involving itself in the civil war in multiple ways during the term of Barack Obama who was president then. This culminated in the rise of opposition forces, with the support of 'Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham' (HTS) being their most recent initiative, leading to HTS’ seizing control of Damascus in 2024. US Goals and Regional Strategies The regime’s collapse presented Washington with an opportunity to reshape West Asian alliances and block rivals like Russia and China from leveraging Syria’s Mediterranean access. Key US objectives include preventing Syria from serving as a base for 'fundamentalist terrorism' or resistance movements targeting 'Israel'. Drawing parallels to the 'Camp David' framework that realigned Egypt, US policymakers aim to distance Syria from the Israeli genocidal war on Gaza and resistance networks. US occupation forces in Syria (photo from archive). Security expert Ali Rizk highlights, to Al-Manar, US efforts to sideline Iranian influence in Syria while engaging Turkey in shared security goals. However, tensions remain over issues such as the Kurdish autonomy. Turkey, a NATO ally, prioritizes neutralizing Kurdish militias and managing refugee repatriation, while 'Israel' reportedly prefers a fragmented Syrian state. Additionally, economic strategies—such as the proposed Qatari gas pipeline to Europe and the 'Indian corridor' trade initiative—reflect broader US ambitions to entrench its economic control. HTS and US Dynamics The rise of HTS in Damascus has highlighted a behind-the-scenes relationship with Washington. HTS seeks international recognition, leveraging security and political concessions to gain US favor. Leader Abu Mohammad Al-Joulani, now known as Ahmad Al-Shara’ has publicly aligned with American narratives, targeting Iran and Russia while downplaying the illegal US military presence in Syria, including key bases like Al-Tanf. Critics argue that US cooperation with HTS is transactional, reflecting America’s broader pattern of subordinating allies to its strategic interests. HTS’s silence on the 'Israeli' actions in southern Syria and the Palestinian plight underscores its pragmatic alignment with US priorities, even as it seeks relief from sanctions such as the Caesar Act to stabilize Syria’s economy. NEA A/S Leaf met today with HTS officials to discuss principles agreed upon by the U.S. and partners in Aqaba - support for an inclusive Syrian led political process that results in representative government, which respects the rights of all Syrians. — U.S. Embassy Syria (@USEmbassySyria) December 20, 2024 Challenges to US Influence Despite its gains, obstacles still remain preventing the US from consolidating its influence. Regional players like Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE vie for sway in Syria, complicating Washington’s efforts to reconcile competing interests which may force it to withdraw on some issues. Kurdish relations remain a contentious point, with potential conflicts further straining US leverage. Domestic dynamics, including HTS’s consolidation of power, risk alienating the Syrian populace, potentially undermining long-term stability. Regardless, the future of Syria’s governance will no doubt involve heavy US involvement, whether through strategic partnerships or economic integration, Washington’s role in post-regime Syria will reshape West Asia’s geopolitical landscape.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2303116	2025-01-01T04:43:10-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-05497840017357349751.jpg
Sheikh Qassem: Hezbollah Has Recovered, Resistance Persistent	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem said on Wednesday that Hezbollah has recovered and regained its strength, stressing that the resistance in Lebanon endures. During the Fourth International Conference to Honor Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi Mesbah Yazdi in Tehran, Sheikh Qassem stated the resistance’s deep-rooted faith and loyal manpower enable it to become stronger.

New US-UK Aggression Targets Sanaa as Israeli Circles Reflect Des...	US-British aggression aircraft launched on Tuesday air strikes on the capital, Sanaa. Yemeni sources reported that 10 raids targeted the 22 May Complex in Al-Thawra District and two raids hit Al-Ardi Complex in Al-Safiyah District. Multiple Israeli air raids on Yemen targeted on Thursday Sanaa and Hodeidah governorates, according to Yemeni media outlets. Meanwhile, the Zionist reports indicated that the enemy attacked certain targets in Yemen. Yemeni Strikes The Yemeni Armed Forces (YAF) executed two high-profile operations targeting key Israeli infrastructure on Tuesday, while simultaneously foiling a planned aerial assault by US forces. Brigadier General Yahya Saree, spokesperson for the YAF, revealed that the missile force launched a sophisticated hypersonic ballistic missile, dubbed Palestine-2, which struck its intended target of Ben Gurion Airport in the city of Yafa (Tel Aviv) with pinpoint precision. Yemeni Armed Forces Spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Sarea Concurrently, a Zulfiqar-type ballistic missile was deployed to strike a critical power station in southern occupied al-Quds, causing significant damage. The strikes sent shockwaves through the region, underscoring Yemen’s resolve to defend itself against foreign aggression. In a remarkable feat of coordination, the YAF’s naval, missile, and UAV forces also conducted a joint operation targeting the USS Harry S. Truman, an American aircraft carrier preparing to launch a major aerial attack against Yemen. Deploying a swarm of drones and cruise missiles, the Yemeni forces successfully thwarted the impending assault, dealing a blow to US military ambitions in the region. Saree emphasized that these operations serve as a clear message to ‘Israel’ and its allies, stating that Yemeni forces will continue to strike until the aggression against Gaza ceases and the suffocating blockade on the Palestinian strip is lifted. On Monday, sirens sounded across several city settlements and Israeli-occupied areas in central Palestine, amid a Yemeni missile attack. The attack, which came just hours after American and British forces launched strikes on Yemen’s al-Tuhayta district south of the port city of Hodeidah, sent shockwaves through the region. Israeli Circles The Yemeni strikes have formed a front of attrition amid the continuation of the missile and drone fire from Yemen faced by Israeli failure to cope with the peril, which drives the Zionists into despair. Zionist circles recommended pushing the Yemenis into an internal sedition in order to undermine their military capabilities threatening 'Israel', blockading Yemen, bombing Iran, without providing any guarantee that such steps could stop their Gaza support front. Israeli Channel 13 indicated that Tel Aviv does not the military capabilities needed to face the Yemeni threat, adding that the 'Houthis' have the ability to fire missiles every day and night.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2302808	2024-12-31T09:29:32-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-00471340017356661528.jpg
Lebanese Army Deploys Troops in Shamma Town after Withdrawal of I...	The Lebanese Army announced on Tuesday that it deployed its troops in Shamaa town, Tyre district, South Lebanon, after the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces. The Army Command posted that the move came in coordination with the United Nations and the withdrawal of the occupation forces followed contacts conducted by the ceasefire monitor committee. On November 27, 2024, a ceasefire took into effect in implementation of an indirect deal brokered by the United Nations, US, and France and ended a 66-day Israeli war on Lebanon. The Lebanese military units deployed at the Shamaa site they evacuated just before the war in light of the Zionist groun incursion. UNIFIL troops had scanned the area to detect unexploded munitions in preparation of the Lebanese Army deployment which precedes the return of the civilians.

Israeli Brutality Against Palestinian Prisoners Reaches New Heigh...	Hamas has slammed the Israeli regime for its savagery and blatant disregard for human rights following the deaths of five Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody. The Palestinian resistance movement asserted that the alarming rise in rights violations against the heroic Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons, including forced concealment, medical neglect, torture, and harassment, is a direct result of international inaction and the unwavering support provided to the Israeli occupiers by the United States. Hamas called upon the entire Palestinian nation to take to the streets in widespread rallies to show solidarity with the detainees who are repeatedly subjected to acts of aggression by the occupying forces. This call to action comes amidst the ongoing genocide and ethnic cleansing being perpetrated by Israel in Gaza. Hamas also urged all human rights organizations to take proactive measures in condemning the brutal policies of the occupying regime's officials.

Gantz: Gov’t Survival More Important to Netanyahu from Releasing ...	Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is concerned with the survival of his government rather than releasing the Israeli captives held by Hamas Palestinian resistance group in Gaza. For Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 'the survival of his government is more important… than the return of the abducted here and now,' Gantz stated at a conference organized by the Calcalist financial daily. 'Of the three goals of the war that concern the Gaza Strip, two have not yet been achieved – the collapse of Hamas’s rule and the return of our hostages,' the chairman of the so-called National Unity alliance noted, as quoted by The Times of Israel. 'It is more important for the prime minister to survive politically than to allow another civilian government in the Gaza Strip, and therefore the IDF will continue to wallow there for a long time.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a video message issued June 19, 2024. Turning to Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir whom he called the 'minister of chaos' — both of whom have been outspoken in their opposition to an agreement with Hamas — Gantz said that 'the truth is that both of you will not resign from the government even if there is a full and painful deal.'

‘Israel’ to Spend $150 mn on Hasbara to Polish Image	The Israeli Foreign Ministry’s budget for the so-called 'public diplomacy' in 2025 is expected to include massive allocation: $150 million — over 20 times what it was before the war began in 2023, Israeli media reported earlier last week. The dramatic expenditure comes as public opinion about the Zionist entity around the world has been intensely battered as a result of the brutal war on Gaza that has killed has killed more than 45,000 people and left the strip in ruins with much of its population facing displacement, disease, and hunger. Under the new budget, Israel’s Foreign Ministry will receive $150 million, on top of what it gets for its existing activities, for what’s officially known as public diplomacy, or in Hebrew, hasbara, The Jewish News of Northern California reported. This massive increase is aimed at reshaping international opinion through aggressive propaganda campaigns targeting American college campuses, social media platforms, and the foreign press. The effort will be coordinated with American Jewish organizations and the Israeli Diaspora Affairs Ministry, according to Drop Site News. 🚨Breaking: Israel announces a dramatic expansion to its ‘Hasbara’ (propaganda) operations in 2025 budget.

Politician Gideon Saar and his New Hope party agreed to rejoin the coalition in return for the funding and the appointment of Saar as the Zionist entity’s foreign minister. Israeli media reported that Saar doesn’t have a detailed plan for how to spend the money yet, but at the time he signed the coalition agreement with Netanyahu, his office released a statement saying it would be used to influence sentiment in the foreign press and on social media.

Netanyahu’s Illusion of 'Absolute Victory' Leaves Gaza in Ruins a...	After 452 days of relentless Israeli aggression on the besieged Gaza Strip, it has become painfully clear that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is consumed by a delusional pursuit of 'absolute victory' at any cost. Even as his own prisoners face almost certain death in Gaza, Netanyahu remains fixated on preserving his grip on power, prioritizing his own political survival over the lives of captured Israelis. Benjamin Netanyahu has clarified that the occupation state will resume the genocide in Gaza even if a deal is reached with Hamas. — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) December 30, 2024 Benny Gantz, leader of the so-called 'state camp in 'Israel',' has bluntly stated that Netanyahu 'gives more importance to his rule than to their return.' Meanwhile, informed Zionist sources quoted by Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper ominously warn that 'the war will not end as long as Hamas controls the Gaza Strip militarily and civilly' and threaten a return to fighting even if a deal is reached. As fierce clashes rage in northern Gaza between the Palestinian resistance and occupying forces, the Israeli army continues its genocidal crimes, displacing and starving some 80,000 Palestinians in Jabalia, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia since October 5th. The grim toll stands at over 4,000 martyred, 12,000 wounded, and 1,750 imprisoned.

They point out the dismal track record - only 8 prisoners rescued by 'Israel' over 452 days of bloodshed. Yet Netanyahu and his ministers stubbornly refuse to make any concessions, demanding nothing less than complete Palestinian surrender. This intransigence persists even as the resistance proves its resilience and ability to strike back against the occupation's brutality. Amidst the chaos and carnage, heart-wrenching scenes unfold daily. Hundreds of distress calls pour in from displaced Gazans whose makeshift tents and shelters are inundated by driving rains. The Civil Defense scrambles to evacuate citizens to other woefully inadequate spaces, many left shivering in the open, exposed to bitter cold. Thousands of tents housing the displaced lack even the barest necessities, providing scant protection against raging winds that threaten to uproot them entirely.

Shelling of a sewage pumping station disrupts emergency plans and raises the specter of a looming health and environmental catastrophe. In just the past 24 hours, the Israeli occupation army perpetrated three massacres, slaughtering 27 Palestinians and wounding 149. The total number of martyrs since October 7, 2023 has skyrocketed to a staggering 45,541, with 108,338 injured. Even UNRWA, the UN agency tasked with aiding Palestinian refugees, has not been spared the occupation's wrath. The agency reports 258 of its employees killed in Gaza since the war began, with about 650 attacks on its buildings and facilities. Over two-thirds of UNRWA's buildings, primarily schools, are damaged or destroyed. At least 745 Palestinians have been killed while seeking shelter and protection at UN sites.

Hezbollah Political Council Deputy Chief Mahmoud Komati stressed on Monday that Hezbollah is committed to the ceasefire in South Lebanon during the first 60 days mentioned in the text of the indirect deal. 'Day 61 will be different,' Komati affirmed, indicating that the Islamic Resistance would deal with the Israeli occupation forces if they do not withdraw from South Lebanon accordingly without giving further details. Hajj Komati noted that the Resistance supporters are demanding a swift response to the Israeli violations of the ceasefire. In an interview with Al-Manar TV, the former minister underlined that Hezbollah will not allow any local or foreign party to tamper with the red lines of the Resistance weaponry and the reconstruction program. The rocketry stockpile and the various military capabilities of the resistance are still there, Komati highlighted, adding that the missile fire at Tel Aviv on the last Sunday of the war made the Israeli enemy demand USA to finalize the dea. Hezbollah welcomes any initiative from any country that intends to help Lebanon implement the reconstruction program without political preconditions, Hajj Komati said. Hezbollah official warned that the performance of certain political parties in Lebanon against Lebanon serves the Israeli schemes, calling on them to demand the Zionist withdrawal from South Lebanon. 'Some of them provided the enemy with data about certain institutions, like Al-Qard Al-Hasan Association. Is this the proper war to build the nation?' The political talk about the disarmament of the resistance leads the country into chaos, Komati added, urging national dialogue among the various parties. Komati emphasized that Hezbollah supports the election of a new president in Lebanon, pointing out that those who used to demand the parliament to convene are not calling for postponing the vote session. Hezbollah official also underscored that the Resistance Party wants to have decent relations with the Arab countries without any political provocation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2301983	2024-12-30T12:57:46-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-02633150017355922524.jpg

It is worth noting that the Israeli occupation army failed to reach Taybeh town during the war which was ended by November 27 truce that stipulates the withdrawal of the enemy troops in two months.

Gaza Resistance Proves Resilient Despite Israeli Onslaught; Occup...	The indomitable spirit of the Palestinian resistance in the northern Gaza Strip continues to shine through despite the relentless onslaught of attacks by Israeli occupation forces. Even in the face of genocidal tactics, widespread home demolitions, forced displacement of civilians, and the deliberate destruction of hospitals and medical facilities, the resistance has only grown stronger and more resolute. The legitimacy of their struggle is undeniable after 451 days of enduring these egregious war crimes in the absence of any meaningful intervention from the international community or global human rights organizations. The occupation army itself has been forced to acknowledge the heavy toll inflicted upon it by Palestinian fighters, announcing that one of its officers from the Givati Brigade was seriously wounded in recent battles in northern Gaza. This comes on top of the army's admission hours earlier that a soldier was killed in the same area, with another gravely injured in a separate incident - bringing the total number of Israeli occupation soldiers killed in the latest operation in Jabalia to 40. Meanwhile, the Al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, revealed that it had carried out missile strikes targeting Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and illegal Israeli settlements surrounding Gaza over the past 48 hours. In a desperate bid to crush the resistance, the occupation forces have only intensified their attacks on the besieged enclave's already crippled healthcare system. Occupation troops raided hospitals, arresting four patients, one of them in critical condition, as they were being transferred from the Indonesian Hospital to Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. The Israeli military also issued orders for the complete evacuation of Beit Hanoun in the north.

Some Israeli officials have expressed cautious optimism about reaching a deal, emphasizing the need for an immediate full or partial ceasefire to avoid undermining supposed 'achievements' of the assault on Gaza. However, the Netanyahu government swiftly denied any progress. As the aggression grinds on, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to deepen. Seven Palestinians displaced by the fighting have died due to the severe cold, with more deaths expected amid deteriorating conditions and flooding of makeshift shelters. The municipality of Gaza highlighted the immense suffering of the displaced, lamenting the lack of resources to assist them as the city grapples with the aftermath of massive damage to critical infrastructure.

Yemen Strikes Back: 13 Missile Operations Target ‘Israel’ in 10 D...	The Yemeni Armed Forces have launched a blistering series of missile attacks against Israeli targets over the past 10 days. Brigadier General Yahya Saree, spokesman for the Yemeni military, revealed on Sunday that the country's missile units conducted at least 13 separate operations, primarily targeting the heart of Israel in Tel Aviv, using advanced hypersonic ballistic missiles. #معركة_الفتح_الموعود_والجهاد_المقدس pic.twitter.com/MUQZ4qJDav — أمين حيان Ameen Hayyan (@AmeenHa2024yan) December 28, 2024 The strikes, carried out between December 19 and 28, aimed to defend Yemen while sending a powerful message of support to Palestinians enduring Israel's devastating war on Gaza since October. In one notable attack on Saturday, Yemeni forces scored a direct hit on the strategic Nevatim Airbase in the Negev Desert with a cutting-edge Palestine-2 hypersonic missile. The Yemeni resistance movement Ansarullah has also joined the fray, targeting Israeli, American and British ships to pressure an end to the Gaza onslaught, effectively shutting down the crucial Eilat port and dealing a major economic blow to Israel. As the Palestinian death toll soars past 45,000, mostly women and children, with over 108,000 wounded, Yemen has vowed to keep up its missile barrage until Israel ceases its relentless aerial and ground assaults on the beleaguered Gaza Strip. The Yemeni counterattack underscores the growing regional outrage against Israel's genocidal campaign and the unwavering support for Palestinian resistance against occupation and oppression.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2301279	2024-12-30T00:32:32-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-07574720017345809391.jpg

Israeli Occupation Forces Intensify Ceasefire Violations in Leban...	Israeli occupation forces persist in violating the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon, conducting excavation and sabotage operations in villages they failed to penetrate during their recent aggression. These incursions are seen as attempts to compensate for setbacks faced due to Hezbollah's steadfast resistance, which forced Israeli forces to retreat in several areas. Today, Israeli enemy troops, including two Merkava tanks and additional military vehicles, advanced from their positions near the border town of Adaisseh towards Al-Taybeh and Deir Siryan, causing damage in those areas. The Lebanese Army maintained its deployment in the region, while Israeli forces reportedly warned UNIFIL against operating in the vicinity, subtly threatening the safety of international peacekeepers. UNIFIL's Stance and International Concerns Candice Ardell, Deputy Director of UNIFIL’s Public Information Office, emphasized that the safety of peacekeeping forces is a top priority. She reiterated the Israeli enemy's obligations under Resolution 1701 to ensure the freedom of movement and safety of UNIFIL personnel across southern Lebanon. Despite these assurances, the Israeli occupation forces conducted movements in both eastern and western sectors of southern Lebanon, including between Al-Naqoura and Alma al-Shaab. This follows recent Israeli gunfire over Naqoura and controlled detonations in nearby villages. Additionally, Israeli enemy aircraft breached Lebanon's airspace multiple times. Expert Analysis: A Strategic Shift? Lebanese military expert Brigadier General Dr. Hasan Jouni views these violations as attempts by the Israeli enemy to project power following its inability to claim victory during its aggression on Lebanon. Jouni suggested that Israel might be leveraging reported US guarantees granting it operational freedom in Lebanon, although such arrangements hold no legitimacy for the Lebanese state. Three Scenarios Ahead In a press interview, retired Brigadier General and military expert Mounir Shehadeh outlined potential scenarios in light of the ongoing Israeli enemy's violations and the responses from the resistance and international actors to this escalation. According to Shahadeh, military projections indicate three possible scenarios by the end of the 60-day review period: Retired Brigadier General Mounir Shahadeh outlined three potential scenarios as tensions continue: Israel’s withdrawal and cessation of violations. Israel’s withdrawal with continued sporadic violations. Escalation, with no withdrawal and sustained aggression. Shehadeh warned that if violations persist, Hezbollah might resort to force, underscoring that political and international measures have been insufficient to deter Israeli aggression.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2301070	2024-12-29T07:38:52-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-05168890017354867693.jpg
Israeli Enemy Justifies Haniyeh Assassination Over Alleged Role i...	The Israeli Channel 12 report claims that documents found in Gaza tunnels early in the war implicated Martyr Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas' political bureau, in orchestrating the October 7 'Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.' The report alleges that Martyr Haniyeh’s involvement placed him at the top of Israel's assassination list. Planning and Surveillance in Tehran According to the report, Mossad prepared extensively for the operation, tracking Martyr Haniyeh’s movements and identifying his residence in a heavily guarded facility belonging to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Tehran. Former Israeli occupation military intelligence chief Tamir Hayman described Martyr Haniyeh as a symbolic political figure whose targeting marks a shift in the Israeli occupation's approach. 'Previously, Haniyeh was seen as a public figure, with military leaders Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif being primary targets,' Hayman stated. Alleged Coordination and Tehran Operation Ronen Bergman, a Zionist intelligence analyst for the 'Yedioth Ahronoth' daily, claimed that captured documents revealed deep military coordination between Martyr Haniyeh and Hamas leadership in Gaza. Martyr Haniyeh, who had been based in Doha, reportedly traveled frequently to Istanbul, Moscow, and Tehran. Mossad decided to act in Tehran, avoiding potential diplomatic fallout with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan or Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. The report alleges Mossad identified Martyr Haniyeh's specific room in the IRGC facility, planting a large explosive device that was detonated at 1:30 AM on July 31, 2024. Hamas Rejects Allegations Meanwhile, the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has denied the Israeli enemy's claims surrounding the assassination of its political bureau chief, martyr Ismail Haniya. In a statement issued Sunday, Hamas refuted these claims, emphasizing that investigations conducted by a joint committee comprising its security apparatus and Iranian counterparts concluded the assassination was executed with a guided missile. The missile, weighing 7.5 kilograms of explosives, reportedly targeted Martyr Haniya’s mobile phone directly. Condemnation of Violations The group described the Israeli enemy's allegations as a desperate attempt to divert attention from what it termed a 'compound crime,' involving the violation of Iran’s sovereignty through the use of a missile to strike an official site within the country. Details of the Incident Martyr Haniya and his aide, Waseem Abu Shaaban, were martyred in late July in Tehran after attending the inauguration of Iran's new president. The strike targeted Haniya at his location in the Iranian capital. Israeli Enemy Admits Last Monday, Zionist War Minister Yisrael Katz publicly admitted for the first time to the Israeli enemy's role in Martyr Haniya’s assassination. Speaking during a broadcast by the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation, Katz also issued threats against leaders of the Yemeni Ansar Allah movement.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2300982	2024-12-29T07:13:50-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/07/manar-02916120017223999614.jpg
Hospital Attacks Escalate on Day 450 of Israeli Aggression on Gaz...	For 450 consecutive days, Israeli occupation forces have carried out systematic atrocities in Gaza’s northern regions of Jabalia, Beit Hanoun, and Beit Lahia. Since last October 5, over 80,000 Palestinians remain trapped, facing relentless bombardment, forced displacement, and starvation. The attacks have claimed more than 4,000 lives, with over 12,000 wounded and 1,750 detained. Health Sector in Crisis The latest assault saw the destruction of Kamal Adwan Hospital, rendering northern Gaza devoid of operational medical facilities. Today, an airstrike targeted Al-Wafa Rehabilitation Hospital in Gaza City, killing seven Palestinians. Additionally, the Al-Ma'amadani Hospital in eastern Gaza was shelled, highlighting the Israeli occupation's ongoing campaign against the health sector.

Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office dismissed reports of a 'mini-deal' before US President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. Meanwhile, Zionist hostage families issue an urgent plea to US President-elect Donald Trump, accusing Netanyahu of 'deception' and urging him to push for a comprehensive deal. Israeli media quoted Yehuda Cohen, father of hostage soldier Nimrod Cohen, saying in his message to Trump: 'Netanyahu is trying to deceive you. You might be the last hope to pressure him. Do not agree to a partial deal—it would be a death sentence for the remaining hostages.'

In northern areas, besieged residents report continuous and indiscriminate shelling, with stray dogs scavenging bodies left in the streets. Food supplies are critically low, raising fears of starvation. Ongoing Strikes and Casualties Israeli occupation drones struck a civilian vehicle near Al-Sawarha Cemetery in central Gaza, killing one and injuring others. Aerial assaults targeted houses in Khan Younis and Rafah, leaving multiple casualties. Medical sources confirmed the martyrdom of Hani Abu Khater, 38, from wounds sustained in a previous strike. Recently released prisoners from Israeli detention were transferred to Gaza hospitals for treatment, many having been arrested during the ongoing military campaign. Director of Gaza’s health services, Dr. Mounir Al-Barsh, condemned Israel’s justification for targeting medical facilities, describing them as baseless and inhumane. This unrelenting aggression highlights the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, as international calls for a halt to the Israeli occupation’s brutality grow louder.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2300883	2024-12-29T04:24:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-09818920017354787144.jpg
Russia’s Sergey Lavrov Warns NATO and US of 'Decisive Response' t...	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has issued a stern warning to the United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), stating that Moscow will respond decisively with 'military-technical countermeasures' if new missile threats are posed to Russia. Prepared for Any Scenario In an interview with the RIA Novosti news agency, Lavrov emphasized that Russia is ready for any eventuality, noting that any actions taken will aim to establish conditions conducive to balanced dialogue. He underscored Moscow's focus on comprehensive measures to reduce the risk of conflict while addressing the root causes of fundamental security contradictions. 'We are prepared for any scenario while considering measures to create acceptable conditions for equal dialogue,' Lavrov stated. NATO Expansion: A Persistent Threat Lavrov highlighted NATO's eastward expansion as a longstanding and critical factor in the current security crisis. 'This very issue largely triggered the Ukrainian crisis and continues to pose a direct threat to Russia’s security,' he said. He suggested that arms control discussions could be on the table but only as part of a broader agenda to address security concerns comprehensively. Revisiting NATO’s Double-Track Decision When asked about the possibility of NATO repeating its 'double-track decision,' Lavrov refrained from speculation. The double-track decision, made in the late 1970s, involved deploying US medium-range missiles in Europe while negotiating disarmament with the Soviet Union. Lavrov pointed out that Russia might abandon its unilateral moratorium on deploying ground-based intermediate- and short-range missiles. 'This decision has become practically untenable despite still being in effect,' he remarked. US Ignoring Warnings Lavrov accused the United States of disregarding warnings from Russia and China and proceeding to deploy such weapons globally. 'The US has arrogantly ignored Russia’s and China’s warnings and is actively deploying weapons of this type in various parts of the world,' he said. ❗️LAVROV: US AND NATO WILL BE REBUFFED IF THEY THREATEN RUSSIA WITH MISSILES 🧵 The US and NATO will receive a decisive rebuff in the form of military-technical countermeasures from Moscow if they create new missile threats for Russia, Russian FM Sergey Lavrov told RIA Novosti. pic.twitter.com/pddzrgTQ4E — Sputnik (@SputnikInt) December 29, 2024 Oreshnik Missile Test Highlights Russian Resolve Lavrov concluded by referencing the recent successful test of Russia’s advanced 'Oreshnik' medium-range hypersonic missile system. 'This test, conducted under combat conditions, convincingly demonstrated our capabilities and determination to implement necessary measures. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also emphasized that any response to these developments will be proportional and resolute, solidifying Russia's stance in the face of escalating global tensions,' he affirmed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2300828	2024-12-29T03:41:20-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/09/manar-09607150016947106646.jpg
