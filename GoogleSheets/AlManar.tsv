Sayyed Houthi: Yemen Will Resume Military Escalation against Isra...	Head of Yemen’s Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Al-Houthi denounced on Tuesday the resumed Israeli aggression on Gaza which synchronizes with a Zionist policy to starve the civilians in the Strip. In a televised speech, Sayyed Houthi stressed that the Israeli enemy does not abide by the stipulations of agreements, laws and commitments. The Israeli enemy planned to impose on Hamas Resistance Movement a process that focuses on the prisoners exchange, away from the halt of the war and the Zionist occupation withdrawal from the Strip stipulated by the ceasefire deal, Houthi said. Sayyed Houthi called on the Arab-Islamic countries to support Gaza and the Palestinian cause militarily and economically in order to encourage the rest of the nations to show solidarity for the Palestinian people, stressing that it is a religious and humanitarian duty. The Israeli enemy is benefiting economically from the a number of Arab countries, including Turkey, KSA, and UAE, Egypt and Jordan, he added. Yemen will resume the military escalation against the Israeli enemy and in support of Gaza, Sayyed Houthi said, affirming that the Yemenis will remain committed to this position and confront the US aggression on their country. In support of the oppressed Palestinian people and in response to the massacres perpetrated by the criminal Zionist enemy against the civilians in the Gaza Strip, the Yemeni Armed Forces, carried out on Tuesday an operation targeting the Nevatim Air Base using a Palestine 2 hypersonic ballistic missile.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2363671	2025-03-18T12:10:04-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-05386740017418049942.png

In support of the oppressed Palestinian people and in response to the massacres perpetrated by the criminal Zionist enemy against teh civilians in the Gaza Strip, the Yemeni Armed Forces, carried out an operation targeting the Nevatim Air Base using a Palestine 2 hypersonic ballistic missile. Spokesperson for the Yemeni Armed Forces, Brigadier General Yahya Sarea, said that this operation successfully achieved its objective. The Yemeni Armed Forces will expand their scope of targets in the occupied Palestine during the coming hours and days unless the aggression against Gaza stops, General Sarea maintained. 'Yemen, its leadership, people, and army, will not stand idly by while witnessing all these massacres against our people in Gaza. The Yemeni Armed Forces, with Allah's help, will mobilize all their capabilities and abilities to defend and support the oppressed in Palestine until these crimes against our people in Gaza stop. With Allah help, they will continue to confront the criminal American enemy and prevent Israeli navigation until the aggression stops, the blockade is lifted, and aid is allowed into the Gaza Strip.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2363616	2025-03-18T11:14:38-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/04/manar-09219370016189056621.jpg
Hezbollah Denounces Resumed Israeli War on Gaza: USA Seeks Destab...	Hezbollah issued on Tuesday a statement to condemn in the strongest terms the Zionist enemy’s resumption of its war of extermination against the Palestinian people in Gaza. The statement also denounced the Israeli enemy's attacks on the asleep children, women, and unarmed civilians amid the stifling siege and harsh starvation carried out by the enemy in flagrant violation of all international laws and humanitarian conventions. 'The decision of Netanyahu's terrorist government to turn against the ceasefire and resume the war in full partnership with the US administration amidst a shameful international silence confirms that this rogue entity and the US administration do not respect any commitments and agreements and that they are two sides of the same coin that thirsts for blood and knows only the rhetoric of killing and destruction.' According to Hezbollah statement, this also exposes the reality of the US administration in its continuous endeavor to destabilize the region through aggression against Palestine, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen with Washington's absolute support for its Zionist military tool and its endeavor to impose new policies and realities by force of fire. Hezbollah affirmed full and unwavering support for the valiant Palestinian resistance and the honorable people of Gaza, calling on the Arab and Islamic peoples as well as the free people of the world to expose the US-Zionist partnership in the war of annihilation against the Palestinian people. The statement also urged 'what remains of the free international community, the United Nations, the Security Council, and human rights and humanitarian organizations to take urgent action to stop this persistent crime against humanity and raise a loud voice to curb the Zionist-American brutality'. 'The Zionist enemy, which was unable to break the will of the resistance during fifteen months of brutal war, will not succeed in achieving what it failed to achieve through this renewed aggression of writing off the just Palestinian cause or displacing its people from their land, and Palestine will remain the central issue of the nation.' Gaza will remain the title of pride and steadfastness, and this people will remain an example to all peoples of the world in the struggle for truth and sanctities, the statement concluded. Hundreds of Palestinians have been so far martyred and many others have been injured as the Israeli occupation renewed its aggression on Gaza early on Tuesday.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2363528	2025-03-18T07:59:11-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-027725400166239486010.jpg
Int’l Calls to Return to Ceasefire in Gaza	The resumption of Israeli aggression on Gaza on Tuesday was met by international calls to return to ceasefire in the besieged enclave, as the number of martyrs surpassed 420 due to the ongoing bombardment. France condemned Israeli airstrikes, pointing at 'numerous civilian casualties.' In a statement given at a foreign ministry press briefing, France called for an immediate ceasefire and return to negotiations. France urged the Zionist entity to protect civilians and to stop blocking humanitarian aid, water and electricity from reaching the Strip. It also called for the unconditional release of all hostages held in Gaza. Meanwhile, the British government called on ‘Israel’ and Hamas to implement their ceasefire agreement for Gaza 'in full,' urging all parties to 'return urgently to dialogue' to end fighting. 'We want to see this ceasefire agreement reestablished as soon as possible,' said British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s spokesman, adding that reported civilian casualties from Israeli strikes overnight are 'appalling.' Over 400 Palestinians were killed and more than 500 others were injured in the Israeli air strikes that targeted Gaza Strip. pic.twitter.com/Oqc2HDh3Lk — Eye on Palestine (@EyeonPalestine) March 18, 2025 For its part, Russia condemned the renewed strikes on the Strip. 'Moscow deeply regrets Israel’s resumption of its military operation in the Gaza Strip,' the Russian foreign ministry said. 'Russia strongly condemns any action that leads to the death of civilians and destruction of social infrastructure.' Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry also joined in, denouncing the renewed escalation 'in the strongest terms' and calling on the international community to step in to stop what it describes as crimes against the Palestinians. Furthermore, Qatar’s foreign ministry warned that [Israel’s] escalating policies will ultimately ignite the region and undermine its security and stability,' it says in a statement. Egypt, Qatar Working to Pressure ‘Israel’: Report On the other hand, The Washington Post reported that Egypt and Qatar 'are working together to push for a renewed ceasefire in Gaza.' 'Egypt and Qatar are planning to have quick connection with Israel side for urgent ceasefire and to start arranging quick meetings in Cairo for entering the next phase and exchange hostages and prisoners in order to achieve peace,' the paper cited a former Egyptian official. 'Egypt is trying to contact the American side to put some pressure on [Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] to accept the ceasefire.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2363429	2025-03-18T06:58:56-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-07932950017423062929.jpg
Hamas Mourns Number of Governmental Officers Claimed by Israeli R...	Hamas Resistance Movement issued on Tuesday a statement to mourn a number of governmental officers claimed by the overnight Israeli aggression on Gaza. The statement indicated that the group of senior martyrs—symbols of national action in Gaza—ascended to Allah at dawn today following a treacherous Zionist strike that deliberately and directly targeted them and their families, including: - Martyr Commander Issam Al-Da’alis, Head of the Government Action Follow-up Committee. - Martyr Commander Yasser Harb, Member of Hamas' Political Bureau. - Martyr Commander Ahmad Al-Hattah, Deputy Minister of Justice. - Martyr Commander Major General Mahmoud Abu Wafah, Deputy Minister of Interior. - Martyr Commander Major General Bahjat Abu Sultan, Director General of Internal Security. 'As we mourn these great leaders and icons of our steadfast Palestinian people in Gaza—who stood firm alongside their families and people for over fifteen months, dedicating themselves to service, security, unity, and resilience—we reaffirm that the Zionist assassination crimes targeting Hamas leadership and national figures will not achieve their goals. These crimes will not break the will of our people or their strong bond with their leadership and resistance. Instead, they will further strengthen our people’s determination in confronting the occupation and its aggressive plans.' Hundreds of Palestinians have been so far martyred and many others have been injured as the Israeli occupation renewed its aggression on Gaza early on Tuesday.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2363341	2025-03-18T05:59:42-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2016/09/manar-07632360014745454023-e1698484116887.jpeg
Israeli Occupation Forces Raid West Bank Villages Amid Surging Ag...	The Israeli regime has launched a sweeping crackdown across the occupied West Bank, with reports of deadly raids, mass detentions, and the suffocation of dozens of Palestinian civilians.

Eyewitnesses reported that the occupying troops fired live ammunition and tear gas canisters indiscriminately, triggering fierce clashes with local residents. 'The occupying forces barged their way to the downtown part of the village, while simultaneously firing barrages of live ammunition and teargas canisters, triggering confrontations,' WAFA reported. The crackdown did not stop there. In the nearby village of Aboud, heavily-armed Israeli soldiers raided homes and businesses, unleashing a barrage of concussion grenades. WAFA also reported that dozens of Palestinians suffered from tear gas inhalation during a raid on the Al-Arroub refugee camp, north of Hebron. Underscoring the scale of the violence, the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights, Francesca Albanese, warned that the West Bank faces the threat of 'mass ethnic cleansing' by ‘Israel’ as the occupying entity intensifies its efforts to take over the entire Palestinian territory and displace its inhabitants. 'The threat of Israel's mass ethnic cleaning of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank is quite 'real,'' Albanese said, stressing that such actions constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity, and even genocide.

The regime was forced to agree to a ceasefire deal with the Gaza-based Palestinian resistance movement Hamas in January.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2363275	2025-03-18T04:43:13-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-05161350017416004571.jpg
Saree Warns: American Aggressors Will Face Full Consequences of E...	The Yemeni Armed Forces announced on Tuesday that they have targeted the US aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman using two cruise missiles and two drones. This marked the third assault on the carrier within just 48 hours. Yemeni military spokesperson Brigadier General Yahya Saree detailed that alongside the USS Truman, a US destroyer was also attacked with a cruise missile and four drones. The attacks appeared to have taken a toll on US naval operations, leading to what Saree described as a 'state of confusion' among American forces, prompting several warships to retreat towards the northern Red Sea. بيان القوات المسلحة اليمنية بشأن تنفيذ عملية عسكرية نوعية استهدفت حاملة الطائرات الأمريكية 'يو أس أس هاري ترومان' للمرة الثالثة خلال 48 ساعة الماضية، وكذا استهداف مدمرة أمريكية، ردا على العدوان الأمريكي الغاشم على بلدنا. pic.twitter.com/Y6qo93VwIH — أمين حيان Ameen Hayyan (@AmeenHa2024yan) March 18, 2025 'This aggressive posture by the United States leads to severe consequences for militarizing the Red Sea and puts international shipping traffic at risk,' Saree warned, underlying the Yemeni Armed Forces' determination to continue targeting hostile assets until the ongoing aggression against Yemen ceases. The military reaffirmed its readiness to confront any potential escalation from American or Israeli occupation forces in the coming days, stressing that they will not relent in their efforts against perceived threats in both the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea. In a show of solidarity, the Yemeni Armed Forces recognized the nationwide demonstrations by civilians who gathered to respond to a call made by leader Abdul-Malik Badr al-Din al-Houthi. This gathering coincided with the Day of Furqan, commemorating the historic Battle of Badr and symbolizing support for the Palestinian people and their rejection of American aggression against our country. The Yemeni Armed Forces also salute the steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and reaffirm their continued enforcement of the ban on 'Israeli' ships passing through the declared operational zone until the siege on Gaza is lifted. This came as the United States claimed to carry out major airstrikes across Yemen on Sunday night, hours after the Ansarullah resistance movement warned that the Yemeni Armed Forces would target the American aircraft carrier, and warships in the region. On Saturday night, the US carried out large-scale military strikes on the Yemeni capital Sana'a and multiple other provinces across the country, leaving dozens of people, including women and children, killed and injured. American and British warplanes launched 47 airstrikes on several sites in Yemen’s capital, Sana’a as well as on areas in the northern province of Sa’ada, the central province of al-Bayda, and the southwestern province of Dhamar. At least 31 people, mostly women and children, were killed in the aerial and naval attacks ordered by US President Donald Trump.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2362956	2025-03-18T01:31:58-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/03/manar-02664870017095804545.png

Hundreds of Palestinians have been so far martyred and many others have been injured as the Israeli occupation renewed its aggression on Gaza early on Tuesday. Medical sources said that many children were among at least 350 Palestinians martyred by the Israeli attacks which came as a surprise and shock for people in the Gaza Strip. Gaza’s Government Media Office said most victims were women, children and elderly people, with some 'entire families' wiped out. 'These brutal massacres committed by the Israeli occupation army reaffirm that this occupation only understands the language of killing, destruction and genocide,' said the media office. It called on the international community, including the UN, rights groups and aid organizations, to take immediate action to oppose Israel’s 'crimes' and hold Israeli leaders accountable. 'The world cannot continue to stand by,' it said. ⚡️BREAKING: At least 356 Palestinians, mostly children, have been killed since the early hours of the morning due to Israel’s airstrikes on Gaza following Netanyahu’s decision to end the ceasefire with the full support of U.S president Donald Trump. pic.twitter.com/e5s9DQEQGi — Suppressed News.

According to Maariv, Netanyahu had asked for his testimony on Tuesday to be cancelled, hours after the Israeli prime minister oversaw renewed attacks on the Gaza Strip. ‘Death Sentence’ for Captives Commenting on the renewal of the attacks, Izzat Al-Risheq, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, said ‘Israel’ is sacrificing the lives of its remaining captives in Palestine. 'Netanyahu’s decision to return to war is a decision to sacrifice the prisoners of the occupation and a death sentence against them,' A-Risheq said in a statement shared by CNN.

Netanyahu ‘Chose to Give Up Life’ of Captives: Families For their part, families of the Israeli captives in Gaza has blamed Netanyahu’s government for 'choosing to give up the lives of the hostages' following its renewed attacks in Gaza. 'We are horrified, furious and scared by the intentional shattering of the process of returning our loved ones from the terrible Hamas captivity,' a statement by the main group representing the captives’ families cited by The Times of Israel read.

Families of Israeli Captives: Netanyahu’s Government Chose to Sac...	The Israeli Captives' Families Committee has accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government of 'choosing to sacrifice the lives of captives' amid the renewed aggression on Gaza Strip. The committee said the government's decision to resume airstrikes before the last captive is returned from Gaza has 'realized the greatest fears of the families, prisoners, and Israelis.' They expressed horror, anger, and fear at the 'deliberate sabotage of the process of returning prisoners from Gaza.' 'Returning to fighting before the last prisoner is returned will cost us 59 captives still in Gaza, who can still be rescued and returned,' the committee warned. They accused the government of 'abandoning the prisoners' and said the claim that the military pressure is aimed at returning the captives is 'complete misinformation' as it puts captives and soldiers at risk. According to Israeli media, 24 of the 59 prisoners still believed to be alive in Gaza. The committee called for the ceasefire to be resumed, stating that 'there will be no security, no victory, and no salvation until the last prisoner is returned.' Hamas held Netanyahu 'fully responsible for the repercussions of the treacherous aggression on Gaza,' warning that the prime minister and his 'extremist government are making a decision to overturn the ceasefire agreement and are exposing prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate.' The movement called on mediators to hold Netanyahu accountable for violating and overturning the agreement. The renewed Israeli aggression has already resulted in over 356 deaths and dozens of injuries in just five hours, according to reports. ‘Israel’ also closed the Rafah crossing amid the escalation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2362769	2025-03-18T00:44:55-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/03/manar-07530390017108510391.jpg
Million-man Rally in Sanaa Challenges US Aggression on Yemen, Rei...	Al-Sabeen Square in Sanaa witnessed on Monday an exceptional million-man rally to challenge the US aggression on Yemen and reiterate support to the Palestinian people and resistance in Gaza against the Zionist siege and unfinished genocidal war. The leader of Yemen’s Ansarullah revolutionary group Sayyed Abdulmalik Al-Houthi on Sunday called for a 'million-strong' march of defiance after deadly US strikes hit the capital, Sanaa, and other areas. 'I call on our dear people to go out tomorrow on the anniversary of the Battle of Badr in a million-strong march in Sanaa and the rest of the governorates,' Sayyed Al-Houthi said in a televised address, referring to a celebrated military victory by the Prophet Muhammad. The Yemeni Armed Forces have announced that they have successfully targeted the US aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman not once, but twice within a 24-hour period in the northern Red Sea. According to Yemeni Armed Forces spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Saree, the strikes involved a combination of ballistic and cruise missiles as well as drones, and lasted for several hours. Saree stated that the attacks were in response to the carrier’s preparation to launch a hostile strike against Yemen. Over the weekend, a US aerial aggression on various Yemeni towns and cities claimed dozens of civilians. The participants in Monday's rallies held Yemen's and Palestine's flags in addition to banners which underlined solidarity with the Palestinian people. Member of the Yemeni politburo, Mohammad Ali Al-Houthi, addressed the rally, hailing the participants. Al-Houthi underlined the confrontation with the US aggression, stressing that it has been 10 years long. Despite the US terror, the Yemenis will continue supporting Gaza, Al=Houthi affirmed. 'We fear only Allah,' Al-Houthi addressed Trump.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2362373	2025-03-17T10:02:27-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-01731940017422309409.jpg

‘Israel’ Braced for New Turmoil as Netanyahu Plans to Dismiss Shi...	Dozens of leaders of protest groups throughout the Zionist entity say they plan a major demonstration in occupied Al-Quds (Jerusalem) Wednesday, in protest against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s intention to fire Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar. After meeting in Tel Aviv this morning, the groups announce their plan for a large-scale rally outside government offices as ministers meet to vote on dismissing Bar. Once the vote ends, demonstrators plan to march on to the Prime Minister’s Residence in central Jerusalem, where they are gearing up for a long-term stay, with tent camps. Meanwhile, the Israel Business Forum, which represents most private-sector workers from 200 of the Zionist entity’s largest companies, called on Netanyahu to backtrack from his intention to dismiss Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, calling it a 'destructive' move. 'Israel is in the midst of one of the most difficult periods in its history — from a security, economic and social perspective,' the business forum said in a statement. 'The last thing Israel needs is an internal battle in which the prime minister, in a severe conflict of interest, fires gatekeepers, in violation of the law — especially at this difficult time.' 'Israel’s enemies are watching with pleasure as Israel returns to the same path that led the country to the October 7 attack,' the forum warned. Instead, the forum urged Netanyahu to focus on 'what is truly important now: the return of the 59 hostages who were kidnapped under his watch… establishing a state investigation committee, according to the president’s agreement, and rehabilitating deterrence, the economy and society.' ''They were in their positions on October 7' - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar (dismissed) - Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi (resigned) - Defense Minister Yoav Gallant (dismissed) - Southern Command Chief Yaron Finkelman (resigned) -… — FlyingBeagle (@FlyingBeagle_) March 17, 2025 Bar Refuses to Resign For his part, Bar has set conditions for his departure while refusing to resign. He accused Netanyahu of repeated failures and rejected calls for his resignation. Bar stated on Monday that he would remain in his position until all captives were returned and called for an investigative committee involving all relevant parties, including political and government officials as well as the prime minister. He emphasized that such an inquiry was necessary for public safety. 'My national responsibility drives my decision to remain in office for the foreseeable future, given the risk of escalation, heightened security tensions, and the realistic possibility of renewed fighting in Gaza, where the Shin Bet plays a crucial role,' Bar said in a statement published by the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. Bar clarified that his dismissal was not linked to the events of October 7, 2023, and that investigations into the incident indicated that government policies over the past year played a key role in the security failure. He also criticized Netanyahu for demanding personal loyalty, stating that it was against the law and the public interest. With the dismissal of Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar #Netanyahu has now purged virtually all top Israeli security officials.

Iran Says It Will Respond to Trump’s Letter after Fully Reviewing...	Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei says Iran will give its response to a letter from U.S. President Donald Trump once the Islamic Republic completes undertaking a review of the letter. Baqaei made the comment on Monday in a weekly press briefing of the Foreign Ministry in Tehran nearly a week after Iran received Trump’s letter. The U.S. president announced on March 7 that he had written the letter to Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei, a month after he restored his 'maximum pressure' campaign against Iran, while expressing willingness to negotiate with the Islamic Republic. Baqaei said that Tehran does not intend to publicize the content of the letter, emphasizing that what has been published in the media is mostly speculation. However, he added, the context of the letter does not differ from what the U.S. president has said publicly. He said that Iran’s 'response to this correspondence will be made' through appropriate channels after a review of Trump’s letter is completed, rejecting any connection between the letter and the Sunday trip by Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi to Oman, which he had been scheduled in advance. The spokesperson further said that the U.S. has numerous ways to demonstrate its sincerity, but it sends contradictory messages as Washington expresses readiness for negotiations while it simultaneously imposes sanctions on Iran’s trade and manufacturing sectors. Diplomatic negotiations have their own rules that require parties to have a view based on mutual respect and interest, Baqaei said, adding that the U.S. has a poor record in honoring its commitments, and seeks to misuse negotiations as a political and propaganda tool rather than as a means to resolve differences. U.S. attacks on Yemen The spokesperson referred to the United States’ latest airstrikes on Yemen and its threats against Iran, saying that the Islamic Republic will firmly respond to any aggression against its territorial integrity, security, and national interests. The United States' attempt to attribute the resistance of the Yemeni people to other nations aligns with its agenda to amend its failures over the past 20 months, he said. The people and government of Yemen independently conduct actions they deem necessary to support Palestine, which reflects their decision to back the legitimate resistance of the Palestinian nation, he said. Baqaei condemned the U.S.’s attack on Yemen as a crime that violates international regulations and the United Nations Charter, calling for immediate action from the international community, Islamic countries, and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Iran’s diplomatic measures The Ministry of Foreign Affairs continues to fulfill its duties, including Araqchi’s visit to Oman, the trilateral Iran-Russia-China meeting in Beijing, today’s visit of the deputy foreign minister to Vienna for talks with officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the spokesperson said. Regarding the Iran-China-Russia meeting, Baqaei said that the trio regularly hold discussions on issues of mutual interests as well as regional and international developments, but the latest meeting, which was held on Friday, was proposed by the Islamic Republic and held for the first time. He said that this meeting laid the groundwork for a constructive path for trilateral support for the rule of law at the international level and the promotion of multilateralism. Representatives of the three countries discussed Iran’s nuclear issue, the spokesperson said, adding that the deputy foreign ministers also discussed cooperation within the BRICS group and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). Washington's Palestine stance Further in his presser, Baqaei pointed out to the United States’ decision to expel the South African ambassador to Washington, saying that it is not a covert issue that freedom of expression will be suppressed in the U.S. when it comes to supporting the Palestinian resistance and nation. Iran views this move as a violation of diplomatic and consular rights conventions, which also demonstrates an insult to principled human rights regulations regarding freedom of speech and belief. The U.S.'s anti-Muslim measures Baqaei said that the travel bans imposed by the Trump administration on nationals from 43 Muslim nations, including Iran, are a clear example of racism against certain religious and ethnic communities, which violates international human rights as well. The ban on Iranian nationals is specifically indicative of American politicians’ hostility toward the Iranian nation, and is part of pressure against the country, the spokesperson said. At the international level, the ban is a blow to the principle of interaction and understanding among nations, which promotes hatred among them. Iran’s assets case at ICJ Asked about Iran’s complaint at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) concerning the Islamic Republic’s proceedings against the U.S. regarding violations of the 1955 Treaty of Amity – seeking the unfreezing and return of nearly $2 billion in Iranian assets held in the U.S. – the spokesperson said that legal departments of the president’s office and the Foreign Ministry are following up on this case. Developments in Syria The spokesperson expressed regret over the latest military clash between Lebanon and Syria, saying that the only winner from these developments is Israel that seeks disintegration of Syria and the weakening of regional nations. Iran hopes that Syria’s rulers manage the developments in their country by taking into consideration the fact that Israel is seeking to take advantage of every opportunity to create division among Islamic countries. IAEA’s political stance The spokesperson reiterated Iran’s position that politicized approaches taken by IAEA officials would not have a positive and constructive impact on bilateral cooperation between the two sides. He also said that the deputy foreign minister’s trip to Vienna on Monday is in continuation of Iran’s cooperation with the agency. Considering a recent increase in threats against Iran’s peaceful nuclear sites, it is natural that the country steps up negotiations aimed at assessing related technical aspects and warning against the consequences of such threats. Europe’s JCPOA role The spokesperson said that European states had a unique opportunity to play a key role in reviving the 2015 Iran deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), but they failed to comply with their commitments under the agreement following the withdrawal of the United States in 2018. Baqaei also warned about the repercussions of the snapback mechanism – the automatic re-imposition of UN Security Council sanctions on Iran – on other signatories to the JCPOA. He also said that there is no reason for Western countries to resort to this mechanism, adding that the goal would be only to put more political pressure on the Islamic Republic. The U.S.'s anti-Iran pressure Answering a question on the United States’ threat to reduce Iran’s oil exports to zero, Baqaei said that the U.S. has a long history of adopting anti-Iran measures, including the American-British coup against the Iranian government during the nationalization of the oil industry. He emphasized that the Iranian nation is determined to overcome all challenges.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2362197	2025-03-17T06:05:16-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-06914720017419434506.jpg

The statement added: 'The targeting of civilians and vital facilities in Yemen once again reveals the true and ugly face of the US administration, which practices terrorism and bullying against nations who oppose its hegemonic policies in the region and the world. This barbaric aggression constitutes a war crime and a flagrant violation of international laws and norms.

Hezbollah stated 'The resilient Yemeni people, who have written heroic epics with the blood of their martyrs in support of the Palestinian cause and the besieged Gaza, and who stand firm under the wise and courageous leadership of their commanders, will not back down in the face of this cowardly aggression. Rather they will continue their honorable role in defending the nation's causes, and this will only increase their determination and steadfastness despite the ongoing unjust siege.' The statement concluded: 'We, in Hezbollah, affirm our full solidarity with dear and brave Yemen, its leadership and people. We call on all free peoples of the world, and all resistance forces in our region and the world, to unite and stand united in confronting the American-Zionist project that targets the countries and peoples of our nation.'

Palestinians, including those who were working in the humanitarian field alongside local journalists, have been trying to document what’s going on in Gaza, specifically for families who have been trying to cope with the aggravating humanitarian crisis. Commenting on the massacre, Hamas resistance group issued a statement, calling it a 'horrific massacre' and 'a continuation of Israeli war crimes against our people and a dangerous escalation that reflects its insistence on continuing its aggression and disregard for all international laws and conventions'. The Palestinian group also called on the mediators to pressure Netanyahu to move forwards with implementing the agreed ceasefire and prisoner exchange. Acute Malnutrition Doubles On the other hand, the United Nations’ children agency warned that one in three children under the age of two in the northern Gaza Strip suffers from acute malnutrition, as the Israeli total blockade of aid enters its third week. 🚨 Urgent: Acute child malnutrition in northern Gaza has doubled in just one month, as reported by UNICEF.

Among children under five, acute malnutrition has surged from 13 to 25 percent, it added, citing nutrition screenings carried out by UNICEF and its partners. The Israeli occupation halted the entry of all aid supplies to Gaza on March 2, hours after the first phase of its fragile ceasefire deal with the Palestinian group Hamas expired, raising fears of deepening hunger and more hardships for the territory’s population. The occupation regime has also cut electricity to a crucial water desalination plant, threatening Gaza’s potable water supply. Rights organizations have accused ‘Israel’ of crimes against humanity and violations of international laws for cutting off aid to Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2361053	2025-03-15T07:34:36-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-03854890017420492039.jpg
Hamas Says It Will Only Release US-Israeli Captive If ‘Israel’ Im...	Hamas says it would only release an American-Israeli and the bodies of four other captives if the Israeli occupation implements the existing ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, calling it an 'exceptional deal' aimed at getting the truce back on track. A senior Hamas official said long-delayed talks over the ceasefire’s second phase would need to begin the day of the release and last no longer than 50 days. The Associated Press quoted the official as saying that ‘Israel’ would also need to stop barring the entry of humanitarian aid and withdraw from a strategic corridor along Gaza’s border with Egypt. Hamas would also demand the release of more Palestinian prisoners in exchange for hostages, the official said, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks. Edan Alexander, 21, an American-Israeli, was captured from his military base in the occupied territories during Hamas’s October 7 attack in 2023. The family of US-Israeli captive Edan Alexander protests for his release in December 2024 in New York City. The White House said on Friday that it presented a 'bridge proposal' to Hamas on Wednesday to extend the ceasefire beyond Ramadan and Passover to allow time to negotiate a permanent ceasefire. The White House said the bridge proposal 'would have to be implemented soon — and that dual US-Israeli citizen Edan Alexander would have to be released immediately,' the White House said in a statement. Under the proposal, captives would be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, ‘Israel’ would allow humanitarian assistance to flow into Gaza, and the US would work toward a durable solution to permanently end the conflict, according to the White House. The US has proposed a 'bridge' plan to extend the Gaza ceasefire into April beyond Ramadan and Passover, allowing for time to negotiate a permanent cessation of hostilities, says the White House. 🔴 LIVE updates: pic.twitter.com/0CIAPevs1b — Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) March 14, 2025	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2360833	2025-03-15T02:33:52-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-09064390017417796723.jpg

The United States is proposing a 'bridge' plan to extend the ceasefire in Gaza into April beyond Ramadan and Passover and allow time to negotiate a permanent cessation of hostilities, the White House said in a statement on Friday. The proposal was presented on Wednesday by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and National Security Council official Eric Trager, according to a statement issued by their offices. 'Through our Qatari and Egyptian partners, Hamas was told in no uncertain terms that this 'bridge' would have to be implemented soon — and that dual U.S.-Israeli citizen Edan Alexander would have to be released immediately,' it added. Hamas Statement The Islamic Resistance Movement – Hamas had issued a statement to indicate that its leadership delegation received a proposal from the mediators yesterday regarding the resumption of negotiations. 'The movement handled it with responsibility and positivity, submitting its response at dawn today. The response included approval for the release of the Zionist soldier Idan Alexander, who holds American citizenship, in addition to the remains of four others with dual nationality.' The movement reaffirmed its full readiness to commence negotiations and reach a comprehensive agreement on the issues of the second phase, calling for the occupation to be held accountable for fulfilling its commitments in full. Israeli Aggression Despite the ceasefire, the Israeli enemy continued its aggression on the Palestinian people in Gaza Strip, claiming more martyrs. An Israeli bombardment in Al-Zeitoun neighborhood, South of Gaza, claimed 4 martyrs. An Israeli drone dropped bombs in the vicinity of a school in northern Gaza Strip, according to media reports.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2360723	2025-03-14T11:22:36-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-05476730017419762973.jpg

House Speaker, Nabih Berri, stressed that 'Lebanon will not accept, under any circumstances and regardless of the extent of pressure, to give up any inch or iota of its land or soil, or any of its sovereign rights,' adding that 'Lebanon will resort to all available means to protect and preserve these rights and liberate the remaining lands under Israeli occupation.' Speaker Berri’s remarks came during his meeting, at Ain El-Tineh residence, with a delegation from the newly elected administrative body of the Association For Specialization And Scientific Guidance. Speaker Berri considered that preserving Lebanon means preserving the South, 'which is a collective national responsibility and should be a point of consensus and unity, rather than a point of division'. Berri added: 'If we stand united, we can overcome any challenge that Lebanon may face. It is through unity that we have triumphed, while through division and fragmentation, Lebanon has suffered from hardships and dangers that have threatened its very existence. Today, more than ever, everyone is called upon to strengthen the atmospheres of unity and focus on themes that bring the Lebanese together, while avoiding what divides them.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2360613	2025-03-14T07:56:39-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-07687950017327071093.jpg
Hezbollah Committed to Reconstruction despite US-Israeli Schemes:...	Deputy Head of Hezbollah Executive Council sheikh Ali Daamoush indicated that the Israeli assaults and violations of Lebanon's sovereignty are aimed at forcing the Lebanese to accept the normalization of ties, stressing that 'our people reject to normalize relations with the terrorist entity.' Delivering Friday sermon at Sayyed Zainab Complex in Beirut's Dahiyeh, Sheikh Daamoush pointed out that, 'just as our people did not bow to pressures and wars, they would not surrender to the new American and Israeli schemes'. His eminence maintained that the state has to protect the Lebanese people from the dangers of normalization as well as the Israeli ambitions, adding that US administration's complicity is trying to impose political terms on the Lebanese government pertaining to the reconstruction file. Sheikh Daamoush underlined rejection of any political terms, including the disarmament of the Resistance, adding that the Lebanese government must assume its reconstruction responsibility without subjecting to those conditions and prevent any Israeli de facto in the border area. Hezbollah is committed to reconstruction and paying compensations despite all difficulties, adding that the Lebanese government is being given a chance to assume its responsibilities regarding reconstruction and defense.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2360580	2025-03-14T07:41:09-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-006841400174196326310.png

Biden Administration Guilty of Worsening US-Russian Relations, Tr...	The administration of the 46th US President Joe Biden is to blame for the fact that US-Russian relations have deteriorated so badly, US President Donald Trump has said. 'Crooked Joe Biden got us into a real 'mess' with Russia , but I'm going to get us out,' he wrote on the Truth Social network. 'Millions of people are needlessly dead, never to be seen again&#8230;and there will be many more to follow if we don't get the Cease Fire and Final Agreement with Russia completed and signed,' the American leader believes. On March 11, negotiations took place in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, between delegations from the United States and Ukraine. Following these discussions, a joint statement was issued, indicating that Ukraine is willing to accept the US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire. In return, Washington will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume military assistance to Kiev. On March 13, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to media inquiries by expressing gratitude to former President Trump for his involvement in the peace negotiations and endorsing the idea of a ceasefire. However, Putin raised several critical questions regarding the status of Ukrainian military personnel who had invaded the Kursk Region, the mechanisms for monitoring the ceasefire, and Ukraine's potential actions during this period. He stated that Moscow was open to proposals for ending hostilities in Ukraine, provided they paved the way for long-term peace and addressed the root causes of the crisis.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2360492	2025-03-14T06:13:05-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-06975040017419579799.jpg
China Hosts Iranian, Russian Diplomats for Nuclear Talks	In a significant diplomatic move, China welcomed high-ranking officials from Iran and Russia on Friday to rekindle stalled negotiations surrounding Iran's nuclear program. The Chinese government expressed optimism that these talks would enhance communication and coordination, aiming to resume dialogue as soon as possible. This meeting comes on the heels of intensified pressure from the United States under President Donald Trump, who has reinstated a 'maximum pressure' strategy that includes extensive sanctions against Iran. Since taking office again in January, Trump has advocated for a new nuclear agreement, but Iran remains steadfast, insisting that any negotiations can only proceed if US sanctions are lifted. Iranian, Chinese and Russian diplomats call for the lifting of 'unlawful sanctions' imposed against Iran, stressing Tehran’s right to peaceful uses of nuclear energy. pic.twitter.com/Huc0VvhtT0 — Mehr News Agency (@MehrnewsCom) March 14, 2025 Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi emphasized this position, stating, 'Ultimately, the United States should lift the sanctions,' before Iran will consider direct discussions. He further insisted that any talks must occur on an equal footing, free from coercion, and must safeguard the national interests of the Iranian people. The urgency of these diplomatic efforts has escalated following a recent report from the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which revealed a significant increase in Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium, now reaching 60% purity—dangerously close to weapons-grade levels. In response to Iran's advancements, Washington ramped up its pressure campaign this week, imposing sanctions on Iranian Petroleum Minister Mohsen Paknejad and targeting companies engaged in Iran's oil trade with China. Additionally, Trump sent a letter to Iranian Leader Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, urging for renewed nuclear discussions while warning of potential military action if Iran declines. In a reiteration of Iran's stance, Imam Khamenei stated, 'We do not have nuclear weapons and are not seeking them,' asserting that Iran's nuclear endeavors are purely peaceful.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2360305	2025-03-14T04:46:43-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-046896100174195278910.jpg
Israeli Occupation Army Presents New Probe into Colossal Failures...	Israeli occupation army presented on Friday a new probe into Hamas’ October 7 attack, highlighting the Israeli military colossal failures that allowed throngs of Palestinian fighters to overrun the kibbutz of Nir Oz without seeing a single soldier. The first soldiers to arrive at Nir Oz on October 7 did so some 40 minutes after the last fighter left, Israeli media reported, citing the probe by the occupation military. The investigation concluded that the Israeli military 'failed in its mission to protect' the residents of Nir Oz, largely because the military had never prepared for such an event. The Nir Oz probe was aimed at drawing specific operational conclusions for the military. It found that an unusually large number of Palestinian fighters invaded the Kibbutz, compared to other Israeli settlements attacked on October 7. The probe stated that calls by then-Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif at 8 a.m. on Palestinians to invade Israeli kibbutzim led to numerous fighters joining in the operation. This was exacerbated in the Nir Oz area due to the lack of Israeli troops defending the area, giving the fighters a sense of freedom, and because of footage circulating online of an Israeli tank that was disabled on the border and its crew abducted. The tank became a sort of attraction for Palestinians during the onslaught, with hundreds from Gaza’s Khuza’a reaching the area, many of whom would continue into the occupied territories and reach Nir Oz. Gazans celebrate near a disabled Israeli tank during October 7 attack (image from archive). The investigation team stated that 'the forces were not prepared, did not prepare or practice scenarios that occurred on October 7,' and that they were not given any alert that morning. 'Already at the beginning of the fighting, many of the commanders were injured in the area, and the chain of command collapsed,' the team said. It also stated that the Israeli military was unable to build an accurate picture of what was happening in the entire area, including in Nir Oz. 'The troops fought throughout the area, including along the fence and their posts, and failed to hold an assessment,' the probe said, adding that at no point did troops speak with anyone in Nir Oz during the attack to understand what was happening there.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2360316	2025-03-14T04:42:16-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/10/manar-03064070016966922168.jpg
Iran Slams New US Sanctions as Hypocrisy and Legal Infringement	In a fierce response to the latest round of sanctions imposed by the United States, Iran has condemned actions targeting Oil Minister Mohsen Paknejad and several entities linked to its crude exports as clear evidence of Washington's 'hypocrisy' and 'infringement of the law.' The remarks came from Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei on Friday, following a decision by the US Treasury Department to designate Paknejad and three entities involved in Iranian oil trade in China, along with three shipping vessels identified as blocked property due to their roles in these transactions. These sanctions were announced shortly after US President Donald Trump sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, threatening military action if Iran does not engage in negotiations for a new nuclear deal. Baghaei said the new bans refute the repeated claims by American officials about their readiness for negotiations and show the US hostility to the development, progress, and prosperity of the Iranian people. He also noted that the US 'addiction' to the policy of sanctions and pressure against independent countries violates the rule of law at the international level and poses a threat to international peace and security. 'The evil actions of the United States to disrupt Iran's economic and trade exchanges with other countries are a clear violation of the fundamental principles and rules of international law and free trade,' he said. 'The Islamic Republic of Iran holds the US government responsible for the consequences and effects of such unilateral and illegitimate actions.' The spokesman added that 'unseemly US actions' like the one targeting Iranian oil minister cannot affect the national resolve to defend the country's independence and dignity and strive for its development and prosperity. The Iranian Ministry of Petroleum echoed this sentiment, stating that Paknejad was sanctioned for his substantial efforts in selling Iranian oil. The ministry emphasized that such restrictions aim to exert maximum pressure on Iran, but noted that the country has consistently demonstrated its ability to evade sanctions and continue selling oil globally through various means. The US Treasury defended the sanctions as a move that further enhances Trump's 'maximum pressure' strategy against Iran. This approach has included withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear agreement and imposing a series of sanctions aimed at crippling the Iranian economy.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2360074	2025-03-14T02:10:56-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-06914720017419434506.jpg
Syria: Al-Sharaa (Joulani) Signs the Draft Constitutional Declara...	Syria's Interim President, Ahmad Al-Sharaa, signed on Thursday the draft 'Constitutional' Declaration. 'We hope the step would be a good opening for the Syrian people on the path of construction and development.' Al-Sharaa, who is also the head of HTS militant group, said after receiving the draft constitutional declaration from the committee in charge of drafting it. 'We hope that will be a new chapter for Syria to replace ignorance with knowledge and suffering with mercy,' Abu Mohammad Al-Joulani said. In turn, the Committee of Experts charged with drafting the Constitutional Declaration affirmed at a press conference that the Committee had adhered to complete the required work from the very first moment of its formation and had relied on the outcomes of the National Dialogue Conference in the constitutional declaration. The Committee clarified that the Declaration stipulates freedom of opinion, expression, information, publication, and the press, it also emphasizes the State’s commitment to the unity of the land and people and respect for cultural specificities. 'We were keen to include a special chapter on rights and freedoms to create a balance between societal security and freedom,' the committee stated noting that the Constitutional Declaration guaranteed the right to property ownership, women’s right to education and participating in the work and guaranteed their political rights. According to the committee, the declaration stipulates the importance of judges, their verdicts, and their independence. It also leaves the matter of dismissing, expelling, or reducing the powers of a member of the Assembly to the People’s Assembly. The People’s Assembly also assumes full legislative responsibility, while executive authority is assumed by President of the Republic. The transitional period is set at five years, and President of the Republic is granted the right to declare a state of emergency.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2359887	2025-03-13T10:43:22-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-06329310017418877429.jpg
Iranian Army’s Ground Forces Fully Ready to Respond to Any Threat...	Iran’s Army Ground Force Commander Brigadier General Kiumars Heidari says his forces have drawn up all the necessary plans and stand ready to respond to any threat against the country. Speaking to IRNA on Thursday, Heidari said the Iranian Army Ground Force is pursuing Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei’s order to maintain its constant readiness to be able to respond to any threat. He added that 11 brigades of the Army Ground Force have been stationed along the borders to establish sustainable security in the country. He emphasized that Iran has always been facing threats but the Armed Forces’ constant readiness has repelled them, which he called a realization of deterrence. 'Any enemy that foolishly thinks of attacking our country will regret it and retract its plan when it faces the combat readiness of the Ground Force,' Heidari said. During a meeting in Tehran on Wednesday, Anwar Gargash, diplomatic advisor to the president of the United Arab Emirates, submitted a letter from US President Donald Trump to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. The contents of Trump's letter, though, remain undisclosed. Trump himself claimed in an interview with Fox Business published on March 7 that he had sent a letter to Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei, offering talks toward a deal on Iran’s nuclear program, but warned that the alternative was a military intervention. Ayatollah Khamenei said on Wednesday that the call by the US president for negotiations with Iran is nothing but an attempt to 'deceive the world public opinion' and portray the Islamic Republic as the party not willing to give diplomacy another chance. Elsewhere in his remarks, Heidari said his forces hold military exercises at different times throughout the year based on the country’s conditions. He added that the Ground Force staged three major maneuvers in the eastern and western parts of the country in two months and has made plans to hold new drills in the next Iranian calendar year based on new methods to react to new threats. 'Next year will be a year of increasing our defensive and deterrence capabilities as well as a year for conducting modern exercises based on new approaches,' the Iranian commander emphasized.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2359854	2025-03-13T10:29:39-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-016358200174188696810.jpg
More Israeli Violations of Lebanon’s Sovereignty Recorded	The Israeli occupation forces deployed inside Al-Assi site on Thursday opened fire at the outskirts of the Lebanon border town of Mays Al-Jabal. Israeli enemy forces also fired machine guns from their post in occupied Al-Hamams Hill towards Al-Wazzani area, adjacent to the Lebanese Army checkpoint, according to Al-Manar correspondent in south Lebanon. The Israeli enemy also violated Lebanon's sovereignty when its warplanes and military drones spirally roamed the skies of Beirut and several towns across the country, including the city of Hermel and northern Bekaa villages in eastern Lebanon. Meanwhile, the Israeli enemy released, through Ras Al-Naqoura crossing, the Lebanese Army soldier it had kidnapped last Sunday from Bastra Farm. The Lebanese Army moved the soldier to the hospital to be treated as he was injured by the enemy gunfire before his arrest.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2359788	2025-03-13T08:51:37-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-05722930017418810875.png

The Israeli occupation steps up attacks against Syria as it takes more measures as part of its expansionist ambitions in the Arab country’s south. An Israeli air strike was reported on the Syrian capital, Damascus, on Thursday, with occupation military claiming it targeted command center belonging to the Palestinian resistance group, the Islamic Jihad. Videos and photos circulated on social media showed an explosion at the edge of a building followed by thick plumes of smoke. ⚡️🇸🇾BREAKING: Israel just bombed Damascus, Syria.

The agency added that it was not immediately clear if there were any casualties. Syria's state news agency said the building was located at the edge of Damascus. Meanwhile, the Israeli occupation has been attempting to strengthen ties with residents of southern Syria, especially the Druze community. Media reports said on Thursday that the Israeli occupation has sent 10,000 humanitarian aid packages to Syria’s Druze community, as a delegation of Druze clerics prepares to visit a pilgrimage site in the occupied territories on Friday for the first time since the occupation of Palestine in 1948. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said an aid, including basic goods such as oil, flour, salt, and sugar, was delivered to the conflict-affected southern province of Suwayda. On the other hand, a Druze source said that 'a de,' legation of dozens of Druze clerics will visit Israel on Friday adding that it follows an invitation from the Druze community in the occupied territories. Following the collapse of former president Bashar Al-Assad’s regime, the Israeli occupation destroyed most of the Syrian Army’s capabilities and occupied the demilitarized zone in southern Syria, including its strategic heights and fresh water sources. The Zionist regime has been also expanding contact channels with the residents of those areas, especially with the Druze community, offering financial incentives by securing job opportunities in the occupied territories. Such moves aimed at linking the economy of the Syrian south to the occupation authorities, and at strengthening the Israeli control over this region, by all means.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2359711	2025-03-13T07:28:25-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-02809640017418759897.jpg

UN Sounds Alarm on Unprecedented Starvation Crisis in Gaza	The United Nations' special rapporteur on the right to food, Michael Fakhri, has issued a grave warning regarding Israel's actions in Gaza, labeling it as 'the fastest starvation campaign in modern history.' Speaking at a press briefing in Geneva alongside other UN officials, Fakhri raised concerns over the dire situation affecting 2.3 million residents of Gaza. 'How is Israel able to starve 2.3 million people so quickly and so completely?' Fakhri questioned, emphasizing the devastating impact of Israel’s blockade, which has effectively halted all humanitarian aid to the region. He reiterated the alarming nature of the situation, stating, 'This is not a ceasefire by any definition. This is a slowing down of military violence, but … unfolding of death through starvation.' Hunger intensifies, and suffering worsens as the occupation continues to close the crossings and prevent the entry of humanitarian and relief aid into the Gaza Strip. pic.twitter.com/nDwbhk89qc — Eye on Palestine (@EyeonPalestine) March 13, 2025 Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, echoed Fakhri's sentiments, warning that even if hostilities ceased immediately, the consequences of destruction would continue, describing the ongoing crisis as a form of genocide. She highlighted the escalating violence in the West Bank, stating, 'The genocidal violence is leaking out,' and expressed frustration over the international community's inaction, questioning, 'How many warnings will we need?' Adding to the discourse, Ben Saul, the UN special rapporteur on human rights protection, condemned proposals from the US administration to relocate Gaza’s population, labeling such plans as illegal and a violation of international law. 'It would shatter the most fundamental rules of international order and the United Nations Charter since 1945,' Saul asserted, stressing that any future decisions regarding Gaza must align with the Palestinian people's aspirations. The UN's stark warnings highlight an urgent humanitarian crisis in Gaza, calling for immediate international attention and action to address the unfolding tragedy.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2359414	2025-03-13T03:23:56-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/06/manar-09914930017194058437.jpg

His release was reportedly postponed due to his health condition. Four other Lebanese captives, all civilians, were released by the Zionist occupation on Tuesday evening following a meeting of the cease-fire monitoring committee, which includes Lebanese, Israeli, American, French and UNIFIL representatives.

Tehran Stands Firm: No Talks with US Under Threats, Says Araqchi	Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi declared that Tehran will not engage in direct negotiations with the United States unless Washington guarantees a dialogue free from intimidation. This announcement comes on the heels of a significant diplomatic encounter, during which Anwar Gargash, the Diplomatic Advisor to the President of the United Arab Emirates, delivered a letter from US President Donald Trump to Iranian officials in a meeting held in Tehran.

Iran's Leader, Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, addressed the UAE delegation during their visit, characterizing Trump's overture for negotiations as an attempt to 'deceive the world public opinion.' Imam Khamenei also issued a stark warning, stating that should the US and its allies consider military action against Iran, they would face definitive retaliation and emerge as the ultimate losers. As diplomatic relations continue to strain, Tehran's position remains clear: negotiations can only proceed on their terms, ensuring a respectful and threat-free environment.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2359337	2025-03-13T01:07:32-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-05598670017418531718.jpg
Sayyed Houthi Underlines Yemen’s Armed Forces Decision to Prevent...	Head of Yemen’s Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Al-Houthi underlined on Wednesday the Yemeni Armed Forces decision to ban the Israeli navigation through the Red Sea, Bab Al-Mandab, the Gulf of Aden, and the Arab Sea in support of Gaza against the Zionist siege. Sayyed Houthi stressed that the decision has taken effect, knowing that he had earlier set a four-day deadline for the mediators mediators to pressure and persuade the Israeli enemy in order to reopen the crossings and allow back the entry of aid into the Gaza Strip. The Yemeni Armed Forces affirmed on Tuesday that any Israeli ship which attempts to violate this ban shall be targeted in the declared zone of operations. 'This ban shall continue until the crossings to the Gaza Strip are reopened and aid, food, and medicine are allowed in.' Sayyed Houthi highlighted that the Arab stillness and silence about the Israeli starvation and forcible displacement policy are a major sin and evasion from responsibility. The wane statement of the Arab and Islamic countries fail to support Gaza and deter the Israeli enemy backed by the US administration, Sayyed Houthi said. In this regard, Sayyed Houthi maintained that the Trump's administration shows support to 'Israel' stronger than that provided by Biden to the occupation entity, which encourages the enemy to escalate its aggression. All options are on table, Sayyed Houthi warned.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2359282	2025-03-12T11:43:23-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-05386740017418049942.png
Imam Khamenei Affirms Iran Growing Stronger: Loss of Resistance L...	Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei said Wednesday that if the Americans and their allies launch military attacks on Iran, retaliation is definite and they will be the loser. A meeting between Leader of Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Khamenei and university students was held on Wednesday during the holy month of Ramadan. 'The Islamic Republic of Iran, contrary to the flawed, baseless, and shallow views of its enemies, opponents, and rivals, and despite the absence of figures like Martyrs Raeisi, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, Haniyeh, Safieddine, Sinwar, and Deif, has become stronger in some issues compared to the same day last year, and in some matters, if it is not stronger, it is not weaker either,' the Leader said. 'Today, the bullies of the world say that everyone must obey us and prioritize our interests over their own, but the Islamic Republic of Iran is the only country that has firmly rejected this,' Ayatollah Khamenei said. 'The claim by the US President that they are ready to negotiate is a deception of world public opinion,' he asserted. Ayatollah Khamenei said that negotiations with Washington will not remove the sanctions on Iran, as some people might argue, adding that the talks will increase the pressures. The Leader stressed that negotiations will not resolve any problems. 'Iran spent several years negotiating a nuclear deal, but the US president tore down the deal,' Ayatollah Khamenei said, explaining more that 'When we know that they do not comply with talks, there is no need for such talks.' 'If we had wanted to acquire nuclear weapons, the United States could not have stopped us,' the Leader said. He continued to warn the Americans against thinking about military actions against Iran, saying that any attack will receive a response that will inflict more losses on them. 'Iran does not seek war, but if the Americans and their cohorts do a damn thing whatsoever, Iran's retaliation is decisive and definite, and the one who will be the loser would be America.' 'Iran is capable of dealing a blow to the aggressor and will definitely hit it back,' Ayatollah Khamenei further said. During today's meeting, which occurred on the 11th day of the holy month, the students shared their views, concerns, and questions with the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in an open and friendly atmosphere. The event began with representatives from various student organizations presenting their opinions and suggestions on a range of topics, including political, social, scientific, and cultural matters.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2359216	2025-03-12T10:10:01-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-06986630017417992921.jpg

Russia Studying Ukraine Ceasefire Proposal, Awaits Details: Kreml...	The Kremlin said on Wednesday it was studying a proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, after American and Ukrainian officials said the ball was in Moscow’s court. The United States agreed on Tuesday to resume weapons supplies and intelligence sharing after Kyiv said at talks in Saudi Arabia that it was ready to support a ceasefire proposal. The Kremlin said it was carefully studying the results of the meeting and would await details from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. 'We are carefully studying the statements,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding that officials in Moscow were familiarizing themselves with the joint statement issued after breakthrough talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials. Peskov did not rule out a conversation between Trump and Putin later, which the US president said Tuesday was in the cards. The Kremlin does not exclude that the issue of a telephone conversation between Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump may come up in the wake of the US-Ukrainian negotiations and could be organized quickly, Dmitry Peskov said: pic.twitter.com/AUXy9kst1s — TASS (@tassagency_en) March 12, 2025 The Russian spokesman suggested a reporter was getting 'a little ahead' of himself by asking if Russia intended to tie a ceasefire proposal to the lifting of international sanctions imposed over the war in Ukraine. 'Rubio and Waltz said that they would pass on detailed information to us through various channels about the essence of the conversation that took place in Jeddah. First, we must receive this information,' Peskov said.

Israeli Premier Shouts as He Takes Stand for 17th Time in His Cor...	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shouted during his corruption trial in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, local media said. Netanyahu appeared in the Tel Aviv District Court to defend himself against corruption charges for the 17th time since the resumption of his trial on Dec. 10, 2024. According to the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, Netanyahu shouted during the session but was warned by the judge to lower his voice. 'They (judges) put me and my family through the gates of hell. I want to spend a few more minutes to show that this (allegation) is absurd. I have the right to defend myself,' Netanyahu shouted and banged on the table. The Israeli premier appears twice before the court to defend himself against the charges and he is scheduled to appear in seven more sessions. Netanyahu faces three separate cases of corruption filed in 2019 against him: Case 1,000, Case 2,000, and Case 4,000, which include accusations of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust. He denies any wrongdoing, calling the accusations 'fake.' Netanyahu, whose trial began on May 24, 2020, is the first sitting Israeli leader to take the stand as a criminal defendant in the country’s history. Under Israeli law, he is not required to resign unless convicted by the Supreme Court, a process that could take several months. Netanyahu also faces charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, with the International Criminal Court issuing arrest warrants for him and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in November 2024 over atrocities in Gaza, where more than 48,500 people, mostly women and children, have been killed since Oct. 7, 2023.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2358974	2025-03-12T05:54:46-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-01718750017417840759.jpg
Tehran to Receive Trump’s Message via Arab Country, Eyes Nuclear ...	Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi announced on Wednesday that US President Donald Trump has sent a message, but Tehran has yet to receive it. He stated that it is expected to reach them through an Arab country. Commenting on a closed-door UN Security Council session on Iran’s nuclear program, Araghchi described the meeting as 'an unusual and surprising move,' questioning the intentions of the countries that called for it. 'We hope the Security Council fulfills its duty properly and does not get influenced by the political maneuvers of certain states,' he added. Nuclear Negotiations Continue Regarding nuclear talks, Araghchi reaffirmed Iran's readiness for negotiations based on mutual respect. 'We have always been open to talks and engaged in negotiations under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). These discussions are ongoing.' He noted that while the US withdrew from the JCPOA long ago, Iran continues negotiations with European countries, with a new round scheduled soon. 'We are also engaged in talks with China and Russia, and a trilateral meeting is set to take place in the coming days,' he stated. Iran’s Foreign Ministry had earlier confirmed a meeting between Iran, China, and Russia in Beijing on Friday at the deputy foreign minister level, focusing on nuclear developments and sanctions relief. Iran’s Nuclear Program Within NPT Framework Araghchi stressed that Iran remains committed to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), stating, 'Our nuclear program operates within the NPT framework. It is dynamic, growing, and evolving, but always in line with our commitments.' Regarding EU policies, he criticized European inaction following the US withdrawal from the JCPOA. 'They made commitments they failed to fulfill. Now, they must take responsibility, and this will be addressed in our negotiations.' Dismissing claims of Iran’s isolation, Araghchi asserted, 'The Islamic Republic enjoys extensive diplomatic ties, and consultations with various nations are ongoing.' Judiciary Spokesman: 'Iran Will Not Negotiate with Bullies' Judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir dismissed Trump’s call for talks, stating that the US president disregards international principles, driven by a materialistic Western mindset to achieve illegitimate goals. 'Iran does not negotiate with bullies,' he declared. Jahangir criticized Washington’s 'maximum pressure' policy, accusing the US of using negotiations as a pretext for domination, plotting, and imposing sanctions. 'Iran will not engage with aggressors seeking to impose their will,' he said. He also condemned the US for its long history of hostility toward Iran, citing its support for coups, separatists, and terrorists; backing Saddam Hussein in the Iran-Iraq war; imposing harsh sanctions since the Carter administration; downing an Iranian passenger plane; exerting diplomatic and media pressure; assassinating nuclear scientists and Iranian generals; violating the JCPOA; and making baseless human rights accusations. 'This is just a fraction of the US's crimes against the Iranian people,' he concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2358864	2025-03-12T05:29:42-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-02593680017417825601.jpg

Israeli attacks killed at least eight more Palestinians on Wednesday as truce talks continue in Qatar amid tightened blockade on the coastal enclave. The Israeli occupation stepped up attacks on Gaza, killing at least eight people, including a child, who was shot and martyred near Deir Al-Balah, Palestinian media reported. The attacks took place in Gaza’s Rafah and Khan Younis, according to Palestinian media. The city of Rafah, located in the far south of the Gaza Strip, is experiencing a daily tragedy. Since the ceasefire agreement came into effect on January 19, the hope of returning to their homes seems to have evaporated for many residents of the city. — Palestine Info Center (@palinfoen) March 12, 2025 Government Media Office in Gaza announced on Wednesday that 137 Palestinians have been martyred since the ceasefire took effect in the besieged enclave on January 19.

Media reports said that the talks 'are behind closed doors,' and that there is absolutely zero information coming out. Hamas announced the start of a new round of ceasefire negotiations on Tuesday evening. The Israeli occupation wants Hamas to release half of the remaining captives in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas instead wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire’s second phase, in which the remaining captives would be released and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2358908	2025-03-12T04:42:34-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-09064390017417796723.jpg

Yemen Resumes Strikes on Israeli Ships as Gaza Crossing Deadline ...	Yemen has announced the resumption of strikes against Israeli vessels in critical maritime regions off its coast, following the expiration of a deadline for ‘Israel’ to reopen the Gaza Strip’s crossings. The Yemeni Armed Forces confirmed the decision on Wednesday, citing a directive from Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, leader of the Ansarullah resistance movement. Al-Houthi had previously granted ‘Israel’ a four-day ultimatum to reopen the crossings that have been shut down in an attempt to pressure Hamas into releasing Israeli captives held in Gaza. This blockade has exacerbated the already dire humanitarian situation in the region, where Palestinians have endured over 15 months of Israeli aggression. #معركة_الفتح_الموعود_والجهاد_المقدس pic.twitter.com/ydBfL1lB7V — أمين حيان Ameen Hayyan (@AmeenHa2024yan) March 11, 2025 With mediators unable to achieve a resolution, Yemen has taken a firmer stance in support of the Palestinian cause. 'Effective immediately, all Israeli ships are banned from navigating designated operational zones, including the Red Sea, Arabian Sea, Bab al-Mandab Strait, and Gulf of Aden,' the Armed Forces stated. They warned that any Israeli vessels attempting to breach this prohibition would face targeted strikes. This ban will remain in effect until crossings into Gaza are reopened and humanitarian aid, including food and medical supplies, is allowed entry. The Yemeni forces reiterated their solidarity with the Palestinian people, highlighting their unwavering support for resistance efforts in both Gaza and the occupied West Bank, which has also faced intensified Israeli aggression. Yemeni officials, including al-Houthi, had made clear their readiness to resume military operations should humanitarian relief not reach Gaza. The initial strikes against Israeli shipping began after the outbreak of war on October 7, 2023, severely impacting Israel’s economy and contributing to rising commodity prices for settlers in the occupied territories.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2358688	2025-03-12T01:05:29-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2018/07/manar-08269560015324214764.jpeg
Do Whatever You Wish: Pezeshkian to Trump	When you threaten me, I don't want to negotiate with you. Do whatever damn thing you can,' according to the Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in response to US President Donald Trump's bullying call for direct talks. 'You should be ashamed of yourself after what you did to [Ukrainian President] Zelensky recently,' Pezeshkian said in a speech on Tuesday in an apparent reference to recent unprecedented live televised quarrel between visiting the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky with President Donald Trump and his Vice President JD Vance in the White House. The Iranian president pointed to the reiteration of threats against Iran by the US president and said that 'When you threaten me, I don't want to negotiate with you. Do whatever damn thing you can.' The Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei recently rejected the US bullying call for talks with Tehran as dishonorable and senseless. More recently, Ayatollah Khamenei said that calls for negotiations by 'bully states' are aimed at dominating others, not resolving issues. Donald Trump pulled out his country out of the Iranian nuclear deal unilaterally in May 2018 and reasserted his futile Maximum Pressure Campaign against Tehran when he returned to the White House earlier this year. Iran has said it will not negotiate under pressure.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2358611	2025-03-11T11:14:00-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-03057120017417168215.jpg
Six Civilians Killed in Israeli Airstrike on Central Gaza City	Six civilians were killed when the Israeli occupation bombed a group of citizens in the center of Gaza City. Moreover, the occupation military tanks targeted gathering of civilians near the Netzarim checkpoint in central Gaza. A female citizen was killed by Israeli drone attck in the town of Al-Shawka, east of Rafah city, south of the Gaza Strip. The occupation forces also opened fire on citizens' homes east of the town of Khuza'a, east of Khan Yunis city, south of the Gaza Strip, and a shell was fired from an Israeli tank at the eastern area of the town of Abasan Al-Jadida, east of Khan Yunis city. The death toll in the Gaza Strip has risen to 48,503 since the start of the aggression on October 7, 2023, and the number of injuries has risen to 111,927. Despite the ceasefire agreement coming into effect on January 19, the occupation continues its aggression on the Gaza Strip, where dozens of citizens have been killed and injured in recent weeks, in addition to the continued incursion of its tanks and the demolition of more citizens' homes. The occupation’s closure of the crossings & blocking of aid entry for the 10th consecutive day foreshadow a risk of famine in Gaza: Hamas The Zionist occupation continues to close all crossings with the Gaza Strip, blocking the entry of humanitarian aid and basic needs, aggravating the suffering of more than two million Palestinians in Gaza, according to a statement issued by Hamas Resistance Movement. Closing Gaza’s crossings constitutes a breach of the ceasefire deal, which stipulates facilitating the aid entry into Gaza without any restrictions, Hamas affirmed. Hamas maintained that such closure represents a blatant violation of international humanitarian law, the Geneva Conventions, and amounts to a war crime and collective punishment threatening the lives of innocent civilians. 'Denying the flow of food, medicine, fuel, and basic relief means has led to a spike in food prices and a severe shortage in medical supplies, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Closing the crossings and blocking the entry of heavy machinery disrupts the efforts to recover the bodies buried under rubble, as well as the rehabilitation and reconstruction works in Gaza, which double the suffering of the people who already live in harsh conditions.' Hamas called on the mediators to pressure the occupation into adhering to its commitments under the ceasefire agreement and open Gaza’s crossings to ensure the flow of humanitarian aid, and end the collective punishment policy that the occupation authorities has adopted against our people. Hamas condemned using aid as a political blackmail card, confirming that such aggressive policies will neither break the will of our people, nor will they achieve the occupation’s objectives. 'Our Palestinian people will remain steadfast and continue their struggle until regaining their legitimate rights.' It is worth noting that a new round of talks are expected to start late Tuesday in Doha to address the main obstacles hindering the implementation of the ceasefire agreement amid Israeli insistence of breaching and disrespecting the deal.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2358534	2025-03-11T10:44:51-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-00850200017417150783.jpg

Three Palestinians were martyred at dawn today, Tuesday, by the Israeli occupation army in the city of Jenin, while the occupation continued its campaign of raids on several areas in the occupied West Bank, in light of its military operation in Jenin and Tulkarm. Meanwhile, the occupation army launched a campaign of raids on homes and large-scale arrests in the town of Azzun, east of the city of Qalqilya, and arrested about 200 young men. The Palestinian Ministry of Health confirmed that two young men were shot dead by Israeli fire, while a 58-year-old woman, Faiza Abu Ghali, succumbed to gunshot wounds sustained at the Jalameh military checkpoint. Eyewitness reports indicated that Israeli occupation forces had opened fire on ambulances, deliberately preventing medical assistance from reaching the injured in Jenin's eastern neighborhood. As military operations expanded, Israeli occupation forces focused their efforts on Azzun, deploying armored vehicles and conducting house-to-house searches. Numerous young men were subjected to field investigations during these raids, adding to the mounting tensions that have persisted for over 50 consecutive days in Jenin. The occupation forces also stormed several areas in the city of Jenin and its camp, especially in the eastern neighborhood of the city, while they besieged the town of Qabatiya and shelled a house with shells, while medical sources confirmed that the occupation forces injured a young man in Jenin, and the Red Crescent confirmed that the occupation forces prevented its crews in Jenin from reaching an injury in the eastern neighborhood. In addition, the occupation forces stormed the city of Nablus and the old Askar camp and arrested a number of young men, while the forces stormed the town of Birzeit, north of Ramallah, amidst the outbreak of clashes and the firing of live ammunition by the forces, before withdrawing, leaving a young man injured by live ammunition in the foot, and 3 detainees after severely beating them. The occupation launched an arrest campaign in the city of Hebron and its suburbs for the third consecutive day, while the Red Crescent confirmed that its crews dealt with 4 live ammunition injuries in the town of Beit Fajjar in the Bethlehem Governorate, who were transferred to the hospital. This comes at a time when settler attacks on Palestinians and their property continued, and the head of the Umm Safa village council, northwest of Ramallah, Marwan Sabah, confirmed that settlers burned a garage and a number of cars after an attack they carried out on the village.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2358270	2025-03-11T04:57:31-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-06422250017416942387.jpg
Mass Executions, Sectarian Killings Reported in Syria’s Coastal R...	Armed groups loyal to Syria’s interim government have carried out mass executions as part of a campaign described as 'cleansing,' according to CNN, citing eyewitnesses and video footage. The violence has escalated into large-scale killings in coastal regions under the control of the Syrian military administration. Wave of Sectarian Killings Syria is witnessing its worst violence since the fall of the Al-Assad regime late last year. The Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) reported that at least hundreds have been killed, including dozens of civilians who fell victim to widespread executions by Syrian Defense Ministry forces. Many of the killings were reportedly carried out on sectarian grounds. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the massacres—39 documented since March 6—have primarily taken place in the coastal regions of Latakia and Tartous. The violence erupted following attacks by fighters claiming affiliation with 'Coastal Shield' against forces loyal to Syria’s new ruling authority. In response, government forces launched retaliatory operations, executing civilians and engaging in ethnic cleansing, which continues to this day. Eyewitness Accounts Residents have described scenes of horror. One survivor from Latakia recounted, 'Armed men moved from house to house, killing people for sport. Bodies were scattered in the streets.' Bashir, another witness, said his 70-year-old uncle and 60-year-old aunt were brutally killed in Banias, a coastal city in Tartous. 'They were Alawites with no political ties,' he said, expressing fears for his own safety and that of his children. A woman from Homs, Rasha Sadiq, said her family members were executed by fighters supporting Syria’s new ruling authority. 'They heard gunfire and sectarian chants before being killed,' she said. Video Evidence of Atrocities Social media footage shows convoys of armed men heading toward Latakia and Tartous before the violence erupted. Some videos depict fighters chanting sectarian slogans, while others show victims being taunted before execution. As violence intensifies, efforts are underway to evacuate students from Suwayda and Jaramana studying in Latakia, amid worsening security conditions.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2358259	2025-03-11T04:50:00-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-04557200017416945465.jpg
Iran Slams US Decision to Cut Iraq’s Electricity Waiver	Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi condemned the Biden administration's decision to revoke Iraq’s waiver for importing electricity from Iran. Labeling the move as 'extremely deplorable,' Araghchi criticized the US for targeting the Iraqi population by blocking access to essential services like electricity, particularly as the nation braces for the sweltering summer months. This announcement follows the US suspension of a waiver that allowed Iraq to import Iranian electricity, heightening concerns about the stability of Iraq's power grid. The chairman of Iraq's parliament finance committee warned that such restrictions could lead to a catastrophic collapse of the country’s electrical infrastructure. The US National Security Council defended the decision, stating it aligns with the National Security Presidential Memorandum 2, which aims to reduce Iran’s crude oil exports to zero. Spokesman James Hewitt emphasized that Washington remains steadfast in its 'maximum pressure campaign' to ‘’curb Iran’s nuclear program’’, ballistic missile development, and support for anti-Israel groups. Hewitt further urged the Iraqi government to swiftly reduce its dependence on Iranian energy sources. Currently, about 80% of Iraq’s electricity is generated using natural gas, which heavily relies on imports from Iran. In recent years, Iraq has entered agreements with Iran to import significant amounts of electricity and gas, highlighting the deep economic ties between the neighboring countries. As diplomatic tensions rise, Araghchi reaffirmed Iran's commitment to supporting the Iraqi people and standing firm against what unlawful US actions. The fallout from this US decision continues to loom large over Iraq’s energy landscape and regional relations.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2358138	2025-03-11T02:28:14-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-06199350017416852519.jpg
Lebanese Army: Israeli Enemy Kidnapped Off-duty Soldier in Kfarch...	The Lebanese Army Command - Orientation Directorate - issued on Monday a statement to detail the circumstances of the Zionist attack on a soldier in the outskirts of Kfarchouba town. 'On March 9, 2025, after contact was lost with one of the Lebanese army soldiers, and as a result of follow-up and investigation, it became clear that members of the Israeli enemy forces had opened fire at the soldier while he was wearing civilian clothes in the outskirts of the southern Lebanese border town of Kfarshouba, which resulted in his injury, and then he was transferred into the occupied Palestinian territories.' The statement added 'This attack comes as part of a series of repeated and increasing attacks by the Israeli enemy on citizens, the latest of which was the shooting at a soldier on March 9, 2025 in the town of Kfar Kila - Marjeyoun, which led to his martyrdom, coinciding with the enemy’s continued violations of Lebanon’s sovereignty and security.' The Israeli enemy also opened fire at a school hosting an Iftar meal in Ramya town, South Lebanon.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2357973	2025-03-10T10:58:01-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-07313510017416294775.png
Hamas Denounces Israeli Enemy’s Failure to Withdraw from Philadel...	Hamas Resistance Movement issued on Monday a statement to condemn and reject the occupation's violation of the ceasefire agreement and its failure to withdraw from the Salah al-Din (Philadelphi) Corridor area. The Zionist occupation failed to comply with the gradual pull-out of its troops from the Salah al-Din (Philadelphi) Corridor during the first phase, and also did not begin its withdrawal on the 42nd day, as stipulated in the agreement, Hamas statement added. 'Yesterday marked the 50th day of the agreement, by which the withdrawal was set to be completed, but so far that has not happened.' Hamas stressed that 'this blatant violation is a clear breach of the agreement and an apparent attempt to sabotage it and render it meaningless'. The continued violations confirm the occupation’s disregard for agreements and its manipulation of international commitments. These violations place responsibility on the mediators to pressure the occupation into fulfilling its commitments and immediately ending its presence in the Salah al-Din (Philadelphi) Corridor, the statement underscored. Hamas called on the mediators and the international community to intervene immediately to ensure the occupation’s withdrawal, and resume negotiations for the second phase without further delay. Adhering to the agreement and completing the negotiations is the only way to secure the release of the prisoners, and any procrastination means tampering their fate and the fealings of their families, Hamas statement concluded. The Israeli negotiating team left for Qatar Monday for talks aimed at extending the fragile Gaza ceasefire, after 'Israel' cut the Palestinian territory’s electricity supply to ramp up pressure on Hamas. Ahead of the negotiations, 'Israel' disconnected the only power line to a water desalination plant in Gaza, a move Hamas denounced as 'cheap and unacceptable blackmail'.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2357951	2025-03-10T10:15:56-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2016/09/manar-07632360014745454023-e1698484116887.jpeg
Militants Affiliated with Al-Sharaa Regime Continue Committing Hu...	Groups of militants affiliated with the Ministry of Defense stormed Harison town in Baniyas countryside, where they looted and burned houses and civilian properties. This followed the announcement by Damascus government about the accomplishment of the 'security campaign' in the Syrian coastline. More than 1,300 people were killed by the militants in the three days to late Sunday, with civilians comprising 973 of the dead, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said in a statement. It is worth noting that Harison town has come under attack with different weapons, although inhabitants had escaped to farmlands. Meanwhile, the town’s residents have appealed to urgent intervention and called upon the UN delegation, which arrived at Baniyas yesterday and has toured areas in the Syrian coastline, to visit their town. The living situation in the Syrian coastline has deteriorated dramatically with the suspension of delivering foodstuffs and basic products for days in light of the ongoing 'security campaign'.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2357852	2025-03-10T07:56:54-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-07238160017416186033.png
Russia’s Coexistence with West to Depend on Its Readiness to Reco...	Russia's coexistence with the countries of the collective West will depend on their behavior and their willingness to acknowledge and rectify past mistakes, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated in an interview with the New Regions of Russia magazine. 'I believe the main lesson is clear: in matters crucial to our country's survival, we must rely solely on ourselves and on the trusted friends who stood by us in our time of need,' he remarked. 'Regarding our coexistence with our Western neighbors, much will hinge on their actions and their readiness to recognize and amend the errors they have made, including their persistent desire to achieve a strategic defeat for our nation.' Lavrov emphasized that the past three years have marked a 'moment of truth.' Following the initiation of the special military operation to protect the people of Donbass and Novorossiya, the collective West revealed its true nature. He remarked, 'The ostensible rule of law and basic standards of decency have been cast aside. The so-called European values - such as the inviolability of property, the presumption of innocence, freedom of speech and movement, and access to information - have dissipated like smoke.' He continued, 'Those who once lectured everyone on how to live, who proclaimed themselves champions of democracy and human rights, hastily rallied behind the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev without a moment's hesitation.' According to the Russian foreign minister, the world has witnessed the hegemonic instincts driving the ultra-liberal ruling elites of the West. 'The predatory, colonial habits of the former colonial powers of the EU and Britain, along with their inherent vices - arrogance, deceitfulness, and a lack of order in business conduct - persist. De facto, a new global 'divide' has emerged: on one side is the Western minority, while on the other is the global majority,' he stated. 'This majority includes all those countries, as well as individuals of good will within the West itself, who advocate for the establishment of a multipolar world based on a balance of interests.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2357808	2025-03-10T06:26:43-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/09/manar-09607150016947106646.jpg
Tehran Reiterates: No Letter Received from U.S. President	Tehran has once again said that it has not received a letter from U.S. President Donald Trump, days after he claimed to have sent such a letter to Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baqaei said during a press conference on Monday that Iran has not received any letter from the US president. In an interview on Friday, Trump claimed that he had sent a letter to Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, and proposed to negotiate with Iran on a new deal. Iran says it has not received any such letter, reiterating its position of not negotiating with Washington under pressure. 'Some foreign governments and domineering figures insist on negotiations, while their goal is not to resolve issues but to exert control and impose their own agendas,' Ayatollah Khamenei said on Saturday, dismissing the idea of negotiation with the U.S. Baqaei also said during his presser that the most significant event in the past week was the extraordinary meeting of the foreign ministers of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Jeddah, which was held at the proposal of the Islamic Republic of Iran to address developments in the occupied Palestinian territories. He said the meeting specifically aimed to make a decision regarding the plot to forcibly displace the people of Gaza to neighboring countries. 'On the sidelines of the meeting, the foreign minister also held good discussions with his counterparts from several Islamic countries,' he added. ‘We are witnessing widespread violations of international humanitarian law’ In response to a question about the adoption of a resolution by the United Nations General Assembly and Switzerland’s responsibility regarding international documents, Baqaei said the resolution, adopted in September 2014, called on Switzerland, as the custodian and initiator of international humanitarian law instruments, particularly the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, to ensure the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure during armed conflicts. He explained that the resolution called for holding a meeting to approve the provisions of international humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territories and Gaza. 'We were very saddened and surprised that Switzerland ultimately decided not to hold this conference, and this issue was one of the matters discussed in the recent [OIC] meeting,' he said. 'The foreign ministers of the OIC also expressed regret over the cancellation of this conference. We do not pass judgment, but the reality is that over the past two years, there have been widespread violations of international humanitarian law, yet no response has been observed from those who consider themselves the custodians of this matter.' Recent events in Syria ‘a crucial test’ for the new rulers Addressing the situation in Syria, Baqaei expressed deep concerns about distressing and tragic incidents as well as reports of insecurity, violence, and hostage-taking in various parts of the Arab country. 'Any act of violence, killing, and attacks on military personnel is condemned and cannot be justified in any way. The targeting of segments of the Alawite, Christian, Druze, and other minorities has truly wounded human emotions and conscience both in the region and internationally,' he said. He described the tragic events as a very serious and real test for Syria’s rulers to fulfill their responsibilities in safeguarding the lives and property of all Syrians, adding that this responsibility also extends to all parties that consider themselves influential in Syria’s developments. 'We have conveyed our concerns through appropriate channels to the countries that have a presence and influence in Syria, and we sincerely hope that the killings and violence against different segments of the Syrian people will come to an end,' the spokesman said. Israel's brutalities against Palestinians Referring to the Israeli regime's ongoing genocidal atrocities against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip that have claimed the lives of at least 48,450 people, mostly women and children, he pointed to the Islamic Republic’s call on various countries to impose sanctions on the regime as a means of punishing it for the atrocities. 'The demand for an end to any form of support for this regime has been put forward. If we acknowledge that genocide has occurred in Gaza, including the cutting off of water and electricity, which is beyond doubt, then, under the Genocide Convention, countries have obligations to use all means available to stop the genocide,' Baqayi said. The spokesperson said that the first step towards enacting the sanctions was to halt the supply of weapons to the regime. 'This is a demand of Islamic countries and was explicitly stated in the Jeddah summit resolution,' Baqayi said while referring to the resolution that was passed at the end of an Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) summit in the Saudi city of Jeddah earlier this month. 'Countries must cease all trade relations with the regime. This is not limited to Islamic countries. Just two weeks ago, the African Union also addressed this issue in its resolutions,' the spokesperson said.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2357775	2025-03-10T05:25:06-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-07402710017416094986.jpg
Israeli Occupation Forces Arrest Palestinians Across West Bank; 1...	Israeli occupation forces launched a raid early Monday morning in several cities across the occupied West Bank, detaining a number of Palestinians, including released prisoners and the wife of a detainee. Local sources reported that Israeli occupation forces arrested the wife of prisoner Ahmed Salmi after storming her home in the Kafr Saba neighborhood of Qalqilya, located in the northern West Bank. Additionally, Mahmoud Abu Hamid, a young man from Qalqilya, was arrested at the Deir Sharaf checkpoint west of Nablus. Arrests and Clashes The occupation forces also raided the city of Nablus in the northern West Bank, arresting citizen Amer Snoubar from his home in the western part of the city. During the raid, clashes and armed confrontations erupted between Israeli occupation forces and local resistance fighters in the Old City of Nablus. In Hebron, Israeli occupation forces carried out a series of arrests, targeting several released prisoners. Local sources also reported that Israeli forces raided the city of Bethlehem in the southern West Bank, arresting four young men after storming their homes. As the Israeli assault on Jenin enters its second month, occupation forces arrested Omar Al-Wahsh and released prisoner Ali Al-Samar during a raid in the town of Yamoun, west of Jenin in the northern West Bank. Enemy Plans to Build Over 1,000 New Settler Units In a separate development, the Israeli occupation government plans to approve the construction of 1,030 new settlement units in the towns of Sur Baher and Jabal Mukaber in occupied Jerusalem. According to a plan published by Hebrew media, 380 housing units are expected to be built in the 'Nof Tzion' settlement near Jabal Mukaber, along with a school, two synagogues, and commercial areas. In addition, 650 more housing units are planned near the Sur Baher neighborhood, between the Ramat Rahel settlement and the Har Homa neighborhood, along with commercial areas, a primary school, a synagogue, a community center, and kindergartens. This settlement expansion continues to encircle the city of Jerusalem, threatening its Arab neighborhoods and placing them in greater danger of displacement and demographic manipulation. The Israeli occupation aims to create what it refers to as 'Greater Jerusalem' by legally annexing settlements on Palestinian land, altering the city's character, and erasing its identity. Strategic Plan for Greater Jerusalem The Zionist government also plans to annex settlements such as Maale Adumim, Beitar Illit, Givat Ze'ev, Efrat, and Maaleh Mikhmas, as well as others to the north, east, and south of Jerusalem. This would not only surround the city but also penetrate its core, cutting off vital geographic links between Bethlehem, Hebron, Ramallah, and Nablus. The annexation of these settlements would effectively isolate occupied Jerusalem from the West Bank, severing essential communication and transportation links, and threatening further displacement of Palestinian residents. This move is part of a broader Israeli strategy to impose a Jewish majority in Jerusalem, using settler demographics to solidify control over the city and alter its Arab identity.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2357588	2025-03-10T02:55:48-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-05161350017416004571.jpg
Iranian Foreign Ministry Affirms No Room for Negotiation Under Th...	Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ismail Baghaei affirmed that negotiations under pressure and threats hold no meaning, emphasizing that Iran will never accept talks conducted under coercion. OIC Meeting on Gaza Displacement Speaking at his weekly press conference, Baghaei highlighted the most significant diplomatic event of the past week—the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) meeting in Jeddah. Convened at Iran’s initiative, the meeting aimed to address the Israeli enemy's plans to forcibly displace Gaza’s residents. He noted that the late Iranian Foreign Minister Hussein Amir-Abdollahian held productive discussions with his counterparts on the sidelines of the gathering. Denial of US Message and Condemnation of Threats Responding to former US President Donald Trump’s claim of having sent a message to Iran, Baghaei categorically denied the assertion, stating, 'We have received no such message.' Regarding US officials’ threats against Iran, Baghaei condemned them as violations of international law and acts of aggression. 'The threat of force is prohibited under international regulations and constitutes a criminal act,' he stressed. Referring to bullying of the US government, Iran’s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson said the Islamic Republic of Iran will never accept negotiations under pressure. pic.twitter.com/8w1w3sFDfO — Mehr News Agency (@MehrnewsCom) March 10, 2025 Baghaei added that while such threats have persisted in various forms over the years, they have only been met with steadfast resistance from the Iranian people. Baghaei criticized Washington’s approach of presenting Iran with a false choice between 'war or negotiation,' describing it as unserious and unacceptable. He reiterated that Iran views diplomacy as a process based on mutual respect and has consistently adhered to this principle. However, he made it clear: 'Negotiation under pressure and threats is meaningless, and Iran will never accept such terms.' Concerns Over Escalating Violence in Syria Baghaei also addressed recent developments in Syria, revealing that Iran has been actively engaged in consultations regarding the situation. He expressed deep concern over reports of escalating violence and insecurity in parts of the country. 'Iran strongly condemns all acts of violence, killings, and attacks targeting civilians—such actions are unacceptable under any circumstances,' he stated. Referring specifically to the recent attacks on members of Syria’s Alawite community, Baghaei described them as a 'deep wound to the human conscience.' He emphasized that the incident serves as a critical test for the Syrian government and other stakeholders to uphold their responsibilities in protecting Syrian lives. Iran, he noted, has conveyed its concerns through the appropriate diplomatic channels to influential parties involved in the Syrian conflict. Baghaei concluded, warning that such incidents only serve to further complicate Syria’s already fragile political landscape.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2357544	2025-03-10T02:05:00-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-08000540017328864512.jpg
Sheikh Qassem: Hezbollah’s Strength Unbroken, Resistance Determin...	Hezbollah's Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem addressed a broad range of issues, emphasizing the resilience of Hezbollah, its commitment to confronting occupation, and the unwavering spirit of its people. In an exclusive interview with Al Manar on Sunday, His Eminence stated, 'The people of the resistance are the noblest and most honorable. Now, I understand even more the relationship between Sayyed Nasrallah and the people—it is beyond words.' A Divine Funeral Procession Sheikh Qassem noted that the decision to delay the funeral due to security concerns was ultimately shaped by unfolding circumstances. 'After Sayyed Nasrallah’s martyrdom, there was coordination with Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, and we agreed to postpone the funeral to safeguard the people. As time passed, the situation necessitated further delays. The turnout was unparalleled. I felt that the people were declaring, ‘We remain loyal to you, Sayyed Nasrallah.’ Resistance is not merely a phase—it is a deeply rooted belief embraced by men and women, young and old,' His Eminence affirmed. Sheikh Qassem described the funeral as more than a farewell—it was a pledge of loyalty to the resistance. 'This procession bridged the past and future. The people weren’t just mourning; they were renewing their commitment.' He praised Hezbollah’s steadfast supporters, recalling families who had lost loved ones yet remained resolute. 'One woman gave three martyrs, two sons-in-law, and two grandchildren—ready to sacrifice more. Another offered her only son and stood prepared to give again. Who can defeat such a people? They stand firm, always ahead of their enemies, defying every conspiracy.' Unwavering Support Sheikh Qassem highlighted the massive turnout, with 20,000 organizers managing the funeral. He thanked Iraq, Iran, Palestine, Yemen, Tunisia, and all who stood in solidarity, noting that 'even when flight paths were blocked, Iranian delegations still found a way to attend.' Sheikh Qassem rejected claims that the resistance had been weakened. 'Beirut's Camille Chamoun Sports City was packed by 6 a.m. This funeral was a defining moment. People can say what they want about victory or defeat—every major event holds meaning, from resisting aggression to the Battle of the Mighty Warriors and our strategic patience against Israeli attacks.' Sayyed Nasrallah and Leadership Transition He recalled his last meeting with Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on September 18, 2024, and their final phone call on September 21, 2024. 'After Sayyed Nasrallah’s assassination, I spoke with Sayyed Hashem Safieddine about the burial and leadership transition. I proposed that he take on the role of secretary general. But before any formal announcement, Sayyed Hashem was also martyred. When I heard of his assassination, it felt like an earthquake—my life turned upside down. Yet, I felt no fear or hesitation, only divine guidance,' Sheikh Qassem asserted. Resistance Capabilities and Readiness Sheikh Qassem reaffirmed Hezbollah’s military strength. 'After Sayyed Hashem’s martyrdom, I contacted our military leadership and asked to be briefed on what remains—not what we lost. Hezbollah’s structure is vast, and our capabilities are immense. Despite security challenges, we quickly regained control, conducted internal investigations, and held accountable those responsible for lapses.' His Eminence revealed that Hezbollah had adjusted its battlefield strategies, reaching an agreement with its military leadership on targeting enemy positions, including strikes on the occupied city of Tel Aviv. 'Had the enemy been able to advance on the ground, they would have done so—not just towards southern Lebanon but beyond, as they did in 1982 when they invaded Beirut.' Israeli Enemy's Defeat and the Power of Resistance Sheikh Qassem highlighted the direct hits on Israeli targets, including the occupied city of Tel Aviv and Zionist Prime Minister Netanyahu’s residence, as a turning point. 'The Israeli enemy sought negotiations after realizing our capabilities. We did not enter these talks from a position of weakness. We never wanted this war, but when the enemy asked for a ceasefire, we negotiated while fully capable of continuing the fight.' His Eminence emphasized Hezbollah’s precision in targeting military sites, avoiding non-military targets despite having the ability to strike them. 'We chose to focus on military objectives to deny the Israeli enemy any excuse to escalate its crimes further.' Resistance: A Path of Sacrifice and Victory Addressing concerns about the resistance’s future, Sheikh Qassem affirmed, 'The resistance is strong and ongoing, though it has endured sacrifices. Could anyone expect it to continue without them? Yes, we have made great sacrifices, but we understand that facing Israel, the US, and their allies requires paying a price. We are up against a massive force that has used every means of brutality against the resistance in Palestine and Lebanon.' His Eminence emphasized the heavy toll on the Israeli enemy, both militarily and economically. 'Their casualties are mounting, their economy is strained, and their forces are suffering significant losses. This confirms that the resistance remains steadfast.' No Secret Agreements in the Ceasefire Deal Hezbollah's Sheikh Qassem rejected claims of secret clauses in the ceasefire agreement. 'The deal explicitly mentions 'south of the Litani River’ five times. This is the framework we adhere to.' He dismissed speculation about US-Israeli side agreements, affirming that the ceasefire falls under UN Resolution 1701. 'During the 60-day period, Israel committed multiple violations. The Lebanese army has repeatedly expressed readiness to deploy, but Israel has blocked it.' His Eminence warned of the broader Zionist project, citing Israeli violations, including the presence of rabbis at contested sites. 'This is not just about aggression; it’s part of a larger expansionist agenda.' Resistance Will Not Back Down Sheikh Qassem reaffirmed Hezbollah’s commitment to resisting occupation. 'If the Israeli enemy continues its occupation, it will face resistance from the army, the people, and the resistance. Some believe diplomacy alone can achieve liberation—but history proves otherwise. Resistance is what forced Israel out of southern Lebanon in 2000.' 'We live in this land together, and we will continue to defend it together. Has Israel’s brutality silenced some voices? No matter—the resistance will never stop, and we will never surrender,' Sheikh Qassem emphasized. His Eminence pointed out that the Lebanese foreign minister provides the Israeli enemy with excuses to continue its aggression and should demand an end to the occupation. He also condemned Israeli attacks on civilians, affirming that the resistance will never stop and will continue to defend the homeland.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2357236	2025-03-09T15:08:03-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-00033290017415551359.jpg
Syria Patriarchs Reject Massacres Endangering Innocent Citizens, ...	A statement issued by Syria patriarchs denounced on Sunday the massacres against the innocent citizens, stressing that those horrific acts must be sopped. Syria patriarchs urged an imminent national reconciliation, underlining the importance of establishing a state that respects all the citizens and protects the nation's territorial integrity. A UK-based war monitor said more than 1,000 people have been killed in two days of revenge killings in the country’s western region.

Fox News reported that the total number of victims of the sectarian killings in western Syria is around 4000 as the HTS militants escalate their crimes.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2356730	2025-03-09T08:33:30-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-09888290017415344039.png
Kfarkila Border Town Bids Farewell to 50 Martyrs as Close Israeli...	Hezbollah and the Resistance supporters held on Sunday a massive funeral to mourn 50 martyrs in Kfarkila border town which has been confronting the Israeli barbarism since October 7, 2023. The mourners bade farewell to the martyrs who have been claimed by the Zionist aggression and confirmed commitment to the resistance path, disregarding the Zionist drones and occupation troops deployed near the town. Member of 'Loyalty to Resistance' bloc, MP Ali Fayyad, wondered how would the Lebanese government confront the Israeli violations amid the failure of the complaints to the ceasefire monitor committee. The Lebanese people have the right to be updated by the government on its plans to face this danger, MP Fayyad affirmed.

Former Mayor Injured in Tel Aviv Car Explosion	Former Bat Yam Mayor Shlomo Lahiani was injured Sunday afternoon when his car burst into flames following a powerful explosion on Ayalon Highway near the La Guardia Interchange. Another man, approximately 35 years old, was moderately wounded in the blast. The explosions occurred on the southbound lanes of the Ayalon Highway near the La Guardia interchange, according to the Zionist police, who say they are probing what was behind the blast. Emergency responders received the report at 3:27 pm, and Magen David Adom (MDA) paramedics treated both men at the scene before transporting them to Wolfson Medical Center in Holon. Lahiani sustained minor injuries, while the second victim suffered moderate blast-related wounds. 'We saw two vehicles in the middle of the road and two injured men nearby, both suffering from blast injuries and limb wounds,' said MDA medics Neriah Ben Moshe and Shai Bechar. 'We provided initial treatment and evacuated them in stable condition.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2356620	2025-03-09T07:45:47-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-04559230017415314991.png
Gaza Ceasefire Talks to Be Resumed in Doha amid Ongoing Israeli A...	The Israeli enemy said it would send a delegation to Doha on Monday to resume ceasefire and prisoner exchange talks with Hamas to enter the next phase of the truce. Hamas cited 'positive indicators' for the resumption of talks on the ceasefire but denied reports suggesting any temporary ceasefire agreement during Ramadan. Hamas spokesperson Mahmoud Mardawi reiterated commitment to the agreed-upon terms of the truce while pushing for the next stage of negotiations. Gaza continues to face mounting hardships this Ramadan. In Khan Younis, six bakeries have been forced to close due to severe fuel shortages as a result of Israel's ongoing blockade on aid into the Strip. The shortage is adding to the already dire humanitarian crisis that continues to unfold. Meanwhile, Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on Sunday that US President Donald Trump's widely condemned plan to relocate millions of Gazans to other countries was 'taking shape', but acknowledged it would be a massive logistical undertaking. 'This plan is taking shape, with ongoing actions in coordination with the administration&#8230; It involves identifying key countries, understanding their interests — both with the US and with us — and fostering cooperation,' Smotrich said at an event in parliament, adding that preparations were underway to establish a large-scale body to oversee the displacement.

A Palestinian citizen was killed and several others were injured in the early hours of Sunday by Israeli occupation forces' gunfire in the Shujaiya neighborhood, east of Gaza City. According to medical sources, a Palestinian from Ebeid family was killed and others were wounded when Israeli occupation forces opened fire in the Shujaiya area. The victims were targeted while in the vicinity, resulting in casualties. At least 48,458 Palestinians have been killed and over 11.897 have been injured since October 2023 - the Gaza Health Ministry revealed. Five civilians were brought to hospitals across the Gaza Strip overnight in the past 24 hours. The toll adds to thousands trapped under the rubble that the ministry has presumed dead - making the toll over 61,000.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2356532	2025-03-09T06:30:46-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-04560780017415270405.jpg
Israeli Enemy Continues Its Wide-scale Aggression on Tulkarm	The Israeli aggression on the northern West Bank province of Tulkarm has entered its 42nd consecutive day, resulting so far in massive house demolitions, widespread destruction, and mass displacement of Palestinians. Israeli occupation forces have deployed additional military reinforcements towards the city and its refugee camps on Sunday, setting up checkpoints across the area and hindering the movement of local residents. In the Tulkarm refugee camp, Israeli occupation forces have maintained their presence in the area, blocking anyone from entering the camp and targeting anyone trying to approach. Almost the entire population of the camp have been displaced since the beginning of the assault. According to witnesses, the camp has been turned into an almost deserted zone, with only a few families remaining in certain alleys near the entrances. The destruction of infrastructure, homes, and businesses has been extensive, with many buildings demolished, damaged, or set on fire, while some of the remaining houses have been converted into military outposts. In Nour Shams refugee camp, eyewitnesses reported that Israeli soldiers have installed surveillance cameras on the rooftops of homes they have seized and converted into military barracks. Meanwhile, the camp is witnessing widespread destruction of infrastructure, with many homes either completely demolished or severely damaged. Remaining structures have been repurposed as military outposts, with explosions frequently heard throughout the area. According to latest estimates, more than 9,000 residents have been forcibly displaced from the Nour Shams refugee camp, while 12,000 have been displaced from the Tulkarm refugee camp. Earlier this week, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) declared that the Jenin, Tulkarm, and Nour Shams camps in the northern West Bank are now uninhabitable due to the extensive damage caused by the ongoing military operations. UNRWA described this assault as the longest and most destructive since the Second Intifada in 2000. The scale of displacement has been the largest in the West Bank since 1967, with approximately 40,000 people forced to leave their homes. The agency also warned that entire communities have been nearly emptied, with severe damage to civilian infrastructure, including homes, making it uncertain whether the displaced will have a place to return to. Clashes, meanwhile, erupted between Palestinian youths and IOF after the enemy troops stormed Qasra town in southern Nablus. Palestinian sources mentioned that 171 settlers stormed Al-Aqsa Mosque in the early morning.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2356499	2025-03-09T06:06:53-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-04123940017415256099.jpg
Iran Rejects Calls for Negotiations by ‘Bullying’ Powers: Leader	Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei says that calls for negotiations by 'bullying' powers are not aimed at resolving issues; rather, they are an attempt to impose their demands on the Islamic Republic. 'The Islamic Republic of Iran will certainly not accept their expectations,' Ayatollah Khamenei said during a meeting with heads of the three branches of government and other senior civil and military officials in Tehran on Saturday. U.S. President Donald Trump claimed on Friday that he had sent a letter to Ayatollah Khamenei, asking that negotiations be reopened. Trump has been signaling a willingness to negotiate with Iran to 'make a deal' since he took office for a second term in January. However, on February 5, he signed a presidential memorandum to restore a campaign of 'maximum pressure' on Iran that he had launched in his first term. During his first term, Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from a multilateral nuclear deal with Iran, signed by his predecessor, Barack Obama, in 2015, and re-imposed tough economic sanctions on the country, which the accord had lifted. Ayatollah Khamenei emphasized that the bullying powers do not seek to negotiate solely on the nuclear issue. He said that, for them, negotiations serve as a pathway to impose new expectations, particularly regarding Iran’s defense capabilities and international standing. 'They aim to create doubt in the public’s mind about why, despite their expressed readiness for talks, we are unwilling to negotiate,' he said. 'However, their true goal is not negotiation but rather dominance and imposition.' Ayatollah Khamenei also criticized the European parties to the nuclear deal for accusing Iran of not living up to its commitments under the agreement, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). 'You say Iran has not fulfilled its nuclear commitments. Well, did you fulfill yours?' the Leader said. Following the U.S.’s exit from the JPCOA in 2018, the European signatories-Britain, France, and Germany— urged Tehran to stick to its contractual obligations, promising to compensate for any economic harm incurred. Iran waited for an entire year before it began rolling back its nuclear commitments after the Europeans failed to deliver on that promise. On Saturday, Ayatollah Khamenei opened his remarks by paying tribute to former President Ebrahim Raisi, who lost his life in a tragic helicopter accident on May 19, 2024. The Leader then thanked President Pezeshkian for his 'motivation' to get things done. 'It is very valuable, this motivation and this feeling that, ‘We can, and we will definitely do it.’' Before Ayatollah Khamenei delivered his remarks, President Masoud Pezeshkian addressed the attendees. The Ramadan meeting with officials is one of the most significant annual meetings by Ayatollah Khamenei, during which he elaborates on key issues and outlines the general policies of the Islamic Republic.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2356356	2025-03-09T01:30:54-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-09652480017415126444.jpg
Massacres in Syrian Coast: Over 500 Civilians Killed in Sectarian...	The new authorities in Syria have bolstered the presence of military security forces in the coastal region of the country, specifically in the western areas, as part of efforts to assert control over territories that have witnessed violent clashes. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, over 500 Alawite civilians have been killed by security forces and allied militia groups over the past two days. Violent Clashes Leave Hundreds Dead Local residents in Syria's coastal region reported widespread killings during ongoing military operations and clashes between the new authorities' forces and opposition fighters. The violence, which began two days ago, has been described as the fiercest since the fall of the previous regime on December 8. The Syrian Observatory confirmed the deaths of 532 Alawite civilians in Syria’s coastal areas and the Latakia mountains, allegedly at the hands of security forces and affiliated groups. The deaths are said to have been part of targeted sectarian and regional executions, accompanied by 'field executions' and widespread looting of homes and property. The total death toll from the ongoing violence has now reached 745, including 213 fighters from both sides. The Observatory reported 93 casualties among the military forces loyal to the new authorities and 120 among opposition fighters. Several mass graves are being prepared in Tartous to bury the dozens of Alawites who were massacred by HTS forces. Follow Press TV on Telegram: pic.twitter.com/rGE4OyiYkQ — PressTV Extra (@PresstvExtra) March 8, 2025 Rising Fears of Escalating Human Rights Violations Amid these alarming developments, warnings have intensified regarding the worsening violations against civilians, especially with reports of field executions and enforced disappearances in the coastal region. These acts are feared to escalate tensions further, potentially igniting new cycles of revenge-driven violence. Syria-based sources reported indiscriminate attacks on civilians along sectarian and regional lines, while calls for an independent investigation into these atrocities have grown louder. Many have demanded accountability to prevent further escalation and to avoid plunging the country into deeper sectarian strife. Testimonies of Violations from the Ground Local testimonies from Syria’s coastal region confirm the involvement of armed groups aligned with the new Syrian government. These groups have been accused of carrying out abductions and forced disappearances in areas like the village of al-Sunubar in the Jableh countryside. Reports also indicate that armed groups executed entire families after forcibly entering their homes, despite these families having no direct involvement in the fighting elsewhere. Additional reports from Baniyas and Jableh indicated civilian deaths, including several academics, doctors, and intellectuals. In Baniyas, an eyewitness, Samir Haidar (67), recounted how 'armed groups,' including 'foreign elements,' killed civilians by shooting them. #اللاذقية فيديو من قوات القتال الليلي يظهر عناصر الميليشيات الإرهابية المسلحة أثناء محاصرتها عقب الهجوم الغادر على المشفى الوطني في مدينة اللاذقية. كيف وصل هؤلاء المسلحين إلى داخل المنازل المحيطة بالمشفى ونفذوا هجومهم؟؟ هل المهاجمين هم أصحاب المنازل أم متعاونين مع المسلحين أم… pic.twitter.com/Jn0L2z5Cdw — المرصد السوري_Syrian Observatory (@AlmarsadSyria) March 8, 2025 Security Forces Reinforced Although clashes subsided on Saturday, Syrian state news reported that security forces had reinforced their presence, especially in Banias, Latakia, and Jableh, aiming to 'maintain security.' Syria's interim government spokesperson, Hassan Abdul Ghani, urged all field units to strictly follow military and security instructions, prohibiting any interference with civilians or homes unless authorized by defense officers. The International Committee of the Red Cross called for respect for civilian lives and safe access for humanitarian workers to provide medical assistance and evacuate the wounded and deceased. Tensions began Thursday in rural Latakia after security forces arrested a wanted individual, leading to clashes when fighters opened fire on government troops, according to the Syrian Observatory. Social media posts, particularly on Facebook, shared accounts of civilians from the Alawite community being killed, with one activist reporting that her mother and siblings were 'slaughtered' in their home. Residents of Banias called for intervention to protect them, with several distress posts on Facebook. Videos shared by activists and the Observatory on Friday showed dozens of civilian bodies piled together in front of a house, with blood stains nearby, as women wept in the background. Other footage showed soldiers forcing individuals to crawl before shooting them at close range. Since the regime's fall, reports of retaliatory acts, including home confiscations, field executions, and abductions, have surfaced intermittently, though authorities dismiss them as 'isolated incidents' and pledge to hold those responsible accountable.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2356235	2025-03-08T13:07:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-06246270017413462617.jpg
Imam Khamenei: Western Negotiations Aim to Impose Their Demands, ...	Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei affirmed that certain arrogant governments insist on negotiations not to resolve issues but to impose their expectations through deception and coercion. He made it clear that the Islamic Republic of Iran will never yield to such demands. Honoring Martyr President Ebrahim Raisi Speaking on Saturday evening during a meeting with the heads of Iran’s three branches of power and senior state officials, Imam Khamenei honored the memory of Martyr President Ebrahim Raisi. Referencing Raisi’s speech at the gathering, he stated, 'The president delivered a comprehensive, well-structured, and insightful address. What stood out to me, as I have told him many times, is his strong drive and determination—an invaluable quality.' Western Civilization: A Contradiction to Islamic Values Addressing broader ideological concerns, he emphasized that the principles of Western civilization fundamentally contradict Islamic values, making them incompatible. While Iran should benefit from global advancements, he stressed that it must not depend on Western ideological foundations. Iran's Supreme Leader pointed to Western double standards as evidence of the flawed nature of their civilization, particularly regarding freedom of information. 'Can you freely mention the names of Hajj Qassem Soleimani, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, or Martyr Haniyeh on Western-controlled digital platforms? Can you question the officially accepted narrative of Nazi Germany’s actions against the Jews?' he asked. Three European countries claim that #Iran hasn’t fulfilled its nuclear commitments, have you fulfilled yours?! pic.twitter.com/xKhJ4OCAhL — Khamenei Media (@Khamenei_m) March 8, 2025 Dismissing European claims that Iran has failed to meet its commitments, Imam Khamenei described such accusations as political bullying and arrogant falsehoods. 'Even ingratitude has its limits,' he remarked. Economic Reforms and National Stability Imam Khamenei also underscored the importance of internal cohesion among state institutions as a crucial factor in addressing national challenges. Among the most pressing priorities, he highlighted the need to reform the foreign currency system and strengthen the national currency, urging experts to devise effective policies. He also stressed the necessity of swift and decisive action across all sectors, particularly in enhancing citizens' living standards. He warned that Iran’s adversaries seek to undermine the Islamic Republic’s ability to manage economic affairs, a strategy that could lead to serious consequences. Sanctions Are Not the Only Challenge While acknowledging the impact of sanctions on Iran’s economic difficulties, Imam Khamenei clarified that they are not the sole cause, as internal structural issues also play a significant role.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2356191	2025-03-08T11:33:31-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-00298250017414622368.jpg

Head of Yemen’s Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Al-Houthi noted that the Israeli enemy has been procrastinating fulfilling its obligations pertaining to the humanitarian items of the ceasefire agreement. In a televised speech, Sayyed Houthi added that, however, Hamas Resistance Movement has shown full commitment to the truce deal. Sayyed Houthi underlined the the Israeli enemy has diminished or blocked the humanitarian aid flow to Gaza, committed killings and closed the Strip's border crossings. The Yemeni leader affirmed that the Zionist escalation which also included the assaults on the Palestinian people and sanctities in the occupied Al-Quds and Bank and the persecution against the Palestinian prisoners, which martyred a number of them. The Israeli enemy is seeking the judaization of the West Bank and displace its residents, Sayyed Houthi said. Trump’s administration officials are among the most prominent Zionists and adopt displacement and judaization, according to the Yemeni leader. Sayyed Houthi stressed that the entire Arab Umma must take a clear stance that supports Gaza, adding that the statement of the Arab Summits do not grant the Palestinians any benefits. In light of the Zionist return to the starvation policy against the Palestinian people, the Yemeni Armed Forces will resume their naval war against the Israeli enemy in a four-day deadline, Sayyed Houthi threatened.

Israeli Occupation Authorities Deny Unrestricted Muslim Access to...	The Palestinian Ministry of Awqaf and Religious Affairs has announced that Israeli occupation authorities have refused to hand over all sections of the Ibrahimi Mosque in the Old City of Hebron to the Ministry, as is customary on Fridays during the holy month of Ramadan. In a statement released today, the Ministry called the move a dangerous and unprecedented step, particularly given its timing during the holy month of Ramadan. The Ministry said this was part of a systematic plan to obstruct the full opening of the mosque's halls and courtyards to Muslim worshippers. According to the Ministry, the traditional procedure for the first Friday of Ramadan involves the Ministry's Director and custodians receiving full responsibility for the mosque, preparing to open it entirely to Muslim worshippers. However, this year, officials were shocked when the Israeli occupation authorities prevented access to the Eastern Gate area, which is designated for female worshippers during Friday prayers. This development marks a significant deviation from past practices, where the mosque would be fully accessible to all Muslims on the Fridays of Ramadan. The Ministry expressed concern that, if approved, this move would lead to a permanent shift in control over the mosque, with new restrictions being imposed gradually, furthering efforts by Israeli authorities to take full control over the site. The Ministry further stressed that this action appeared to be aimed at appeasing settler groups who oppose the full opening of the mosque to Muslim worshippers. There are growing fears that these efforts are part of a broader strategy to convert the entire mosque into a synagogue for Jewish worship. Since the beginning of Ramadan, Israeli occupation forces have also restricted access to the mosque for Palestinians under the age of 25. Hamas Statement Hamas issued a statement that the Zionist occupation's attacks against the mosques in the occupied West Bank during the blessed month of Ramadan are a clear escalation of religious warfare. 'Our people will not remain silent in the face of the desecration of their sacred sites.' 'Since the start of the holy month of Ramadan, the Zionist occupation has been intensifying its criminal actions, assaults and desecration against the mosques across the occupied West Bank, including the incursions into Al-Aqsa Mosque and their attempts to judaise it, as well as the ongoing attempts to fully seize the Ibrahimi Mosque,' he added. 'Furthermore, the desecration and burning of several mosques in Nablus city early today reflect the occupation’s relentless religious war, which comes as part of the broader aggression against our people and land.' Our Palestinian people and their resistance will remain steadfast, serving as a strong shield to protect their mosques and holy sites, which endure attacks and desecration by the occupation and its terrorist settlers, Hamas said.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2355487	2025-03-07T07:40:14-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-03853440017413620096.jpg
Israeli Military Spokesman Retires in Move Widely Seen as Dismiss...	The Israeli occupation military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, is to end his role in the coming weeks and retire from the army, in a move widely seen as dismissal by the new Israeli Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir. The occupation military announced the move by Hagari, the Israeli popular wartime spokesman, adding that it was 'agreed upon' with Zamir. Though, it has been seen as a de facto dismissal, as Hagari was not given a promotion for his work as a spokesman during the war. 'The chief of staff wished to express his great appreciation to Rear Adm. Hagari for his years of significant combat service for the State of Israel. Rear Adm. Hagari performed his role as IDF spokesman during one of the most complex wars in the country’s history, in a professional and dedicated manner,' the military said, according to the Times of Israel. Despite being a popular spokesman among the public, the political echelon, especially Defense Minister Israel Katz, clashed with Hagari. It is thought that Katz would not sign off on promoting Hagari, the Israeli media outlet reported. It added that Zamir was expected to promote a senior officer from the Ground Forces as the next Israeli military spokesman. Hagari has been widely seen as the propaganda mouthpiece of the occupation army. He was known for his alleged 'Hamas operatives list' during the raid of Rantisi Hoispital in Gaza in November 2023. Back then, it was clear that the alleged 'list' (written in Arabic) was a calendar of the week days rather than the names of Hamas operatives.

Hundreds of Haredi Israelis Escorted by IOF to Lebanese Border Ar...	In yet another Israeli violation to Lebanon’s sovereignty, Israeli occupation forces escorted hundreds of Haredi Israelis n Friday to a site in the Lebanese territory near the border with occupied Palestine. Israeli media reported that the site was 'the apparent burial place of a Babylonian scholar on the Lebanon border.' The Times of Israel reported that the burial spot 'straddles the Blue Line border position and is situated within a militarized compound hemmed in between an Israeli post and a UNIFIL base.' It added that Friday’s move 'comes after weeks of illegal attempts to reach the site.' Al-Manar correspondent reported that the site, known as Al-Abbad tomb, lies in the Lebanese territory, specifically in the border town of Houla. Footage published by Army Radio shows the ultra-Orthodox Hassidim praying at the site this morning. ⚡️Source: Hundreds of Haredi Jews settlers, under the protection of the Israeli army, stormed Al-Abbad Tomb, located inside Lebanon on the outskirts of the town of Houla, this morning and performed Talmudic rituals. pic.twitter.com/yTWCu6QNmt — Warfare Analysis (@warfareanalysis) March 7, 2025 Meanwhile on Friday, Al-Manar correspondent in south Lebanon reported that two people were injured by Israeli fire as they were inspecting their land in the border town of Kfar Kila. Israeli occupation forces have been staging repeated violations to the Lebanese territories since the ceasefire with the Zionist enemy took effect on November 27, following 66-day brutal war on Lebanon. The deadline for Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon following the two-month ceasefire was illegally renewed from January 26 until February 18, when the occupation forces withdrew, but kept in several areas in the Lebanese territories.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2355366	2025-03-07T04:38:06-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-04715140017413510364.jpg
Israeli Occupation Tightens Grip on West Bank and Al-Quds: Raids,...	The Israeli regime has been tightening the grip on occupied West Bank and Al-Quds, with occupation forces stepping up raids and arrests on Friday, as well as imposing oppressive restrictions on prayers at Al-Aqsa Mosque on the holy month of Ramadan. Palestinian media reported heavy restrictions on prayers at Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied Al-Quds. Al-Manar correspondent in Al-Quds reported that the oppressive Israeli measures were hindering the access of prayers in the holy compound.

The Islamic Waqf (Endowment) Ministry in Al-Quds said that about 90,000 worshippers performed the first Friday prayer of Ramadan at Al-Aqsa Mosque. ‘Israel’ Refuses to Hand over Ibrahimi Mosque Meanwhile on Friday, the Palestinian Waqf Ministry said that Israeli occupation authorities refused to hand over sections of the Ibrahimi Mosque in Al-Khalil’s (Hebron) old city, as is customary on Fridays during Ramadan, calling the move a 'dangerous and unprecedented' step. Israeli forces barred Palestinian journalists from the courtyards of the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. Earlier, the Palestinian Waqf Ministry said the occupation refused to hand over the mosque — a Ramadan Friday custom — to allow Palestinians full access. pic.twitter.com/IIgcYDDeZ1 — The Palestine Chronicle (@PalestineChron) March 7, 2025 For his part, Hamas official Haroun Nasser Al-Din called on Palestinians in the occupied territory to 'mobilize and rally' to protect the Ibrahimi Mosque. The Israeli occupation’s 'continuous and escalating steps constitute a blatant attack on the status of the Ibrahimi Mosque, and a blatant and dangerous violation within the series of ongoing attacks on Islamic sanctities', Nasser Al-Din added. West Bank Raids, Demolitions On the other hand, the Israeli occupation forces (IOF) went ahead with raids and demolitions in several areas across the West Bank. Palestinian media reported on Friday that the IOF raided the city of Tubas. Earlier at dawn, the occupation forces raided Nablus, as they stormed a mosque in the Old City and prevented Fajr prayers. ⚡️BREAKING: Israeli forces stormed Al-Nasr Mosque in the Old City of Nablus in the West Bank, burning Qur’an and eventually setting the mosque on fire.

The move comes after dozens of homes were recently demolished in Tulkarem and Jenin. In a statement, UNRWA said these large-scale demolitions are 'an alarming new pattern', have 'an unprecedented impact on Palestine refugees' and 'seek to permanently change the characteristics of the camps in the northern West Bank'.

Dozens Killed, Injured as Clashes Erupt in Syria’s Coast	Dozens have been reportedly killed or injured as clashes erupted in Syria’s west between forces of the new administration and opposition groups. According to Defense Ministry in Syria’s transitional administration, ruled by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), massive military reinforcements were sent to the Jableh region and its countryside in Latakia Governorate to support the security forces, according to the official statement.

The SOHR reported on Friday that casualties were recorded on the Syrian coast after HTS militants were ambushed. The Mediterranean province of Latakia, which is populated by Alawites and Shia Muslims, is home to the Hmeimim air base – a strategic Syrian base that Russia operates. Clashes with the opposition groups, whom the new administration accuses of being affiliated with the former regime, came after strikes were reportedly launched by helicopters on the village of Beit Ana and the surrounding forests and artillery strikes on a neighboring village. Alawite leaders had called in a statement on Facebook for 'peaceful protests' in response to the helicopter strikes, which they said had targeted 'the homes of civilians.' Syrian protesters near Hmeimim base, south east of Latakia, demand protection from Russia during the ongoing clashes that are happening between HTS-led security forces and ex-SAA cells. pic.twitter.com/opASXjignU — The Cradle (@TheCradleMedia) March 7, 2025	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2355245	2025-03-07T03:19:06-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-06246270017413462617.jpg

Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem is scheduled to appear in an interview with Al-Manar TV on Sunday at 20:30 (Beirut Time). The interview would be the first since Sheikh Qassem was elected as a Secretary General to tackle the battle of supporting the Palestinian people and their resistance, the main perils endangering the Islamic Resistance, and a number of issues pertaining to the situation in Lebanon and the region. In a moment of historic significance, Sheikh Qassem addressed on February 23 the massive crowds mourning the martyrdom of Sacred Martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and his companion, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine. Reaffirming Hezbollah’s unwavering stance on Palestine, Sheikh Qassem asserted that 'Palestine is our right and our compass. We support its liberation and will confront Trump’s displacement scheme. Lebanon is the final homeland for its people, and we are its people.' 'The sacrifices we have made are unparalleled, just as the level of Israeli criminality in Gaza and the region is unprecedented. The battle to support Gaza is part of our belief in liberating Palestine.' 'The Israeli enemy aimed to eliminate the resistance in both Gaza and Lebanon, but the scale of sacrifices was immense, and the resilience was unparalleled—this is a great achievement.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2355058	2025-03-06T11:58:11-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-05815110017289897581.jpg
Lebanese Army: Israeli Violations Threaten Lebanon’s Stability	The Lebanese Army said that the Israeli enemy has continued violations of Lebanon’s sovereignty by land, sea, and air, citing a series of recent attacks targeting civilians in South Lebanon and the Bekaa region. In a statement, the army highlighted the Israeli ongoing occupation of Lebanese territory and repeated border breaches, warning that these actions threaten Lebanon’s stability and could have broader regional repercussions. The army also stressed that such violations directly contradict the ceasefire agreement. Meanwhile, Lebanese military units are facilitating the return of displaced residents to the south by clearing unexploded ordnance, removing debris, and reopening roads, according to the statement. The army command confirmed it closely monitors the situation and coordinates necessary measures with the five-nation committee overseeing the ceasefire agreement and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Israeli Violations Al-Manar correspondent reported on Thursday that an Israeli drone targeted civilians with stun grenades while inspecting destroyed houses in the Tal Al-Nahas area. The correspondent added that a large number of Israeli enemy drones fly at very low altitudes over most areas of southern Lebanon. Al-Manar reporter noted that an Israeli glider threw stun grenades on citizens inspecting their destroyed houses in Tal Nhas town, South Lebanon, with no casualties recorded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2354937	2025-03-06T10:02:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-024325600174128411710.jpeg
Trump’s Threats Complicate Gaza Ceasefire Deal: Hamas	Hamas on Thursday condemned U.S. President Donald Trump's recent threats against the group, saying they complicate matters regarding the Gaza ceasefire agreement and encourage 'Israel' not to implement its terms. 'There is an agreement that was signed, and Washington was the mediator in it,' Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said in a statement, adding that the deal 'includes the release of all (hostages and) prisoners in three stages. Hamas has implemented what it was required to do in the first stage, while 'Israel' is evading the second stage.' The statement noted that the U.S. administration is required to pressure 'Israel' to enter negotiations on the second phase as stipulated in the ceasefire agreement. Trump issued what he called the 'last warning' to Hamas on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday, saying, 'Release all of the hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you.' 'I am sending 'Israel' everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don't do as I say,' he said in the post. Unlike his predecessor, Joe Biden, Trump conspicuously announces his administration’s support for the Israeli war schemes in Gaza. A Gaza ceasefire and hostage release agreement, brokered by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States, took effect on Jan. 19. During the initial 42-day phase of the deal, dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees were freed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2354827	2025-03-06T07:40:10-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2016/09/manar-07632360014745454023-e1698484116887.jpeg

Salam added that the finance minister Yassin Jaber has been tasked with drafting a ministerial law that reconsiders the taxes which may affect the purchase power of the citizens in order to be included in 2026 state budget. The information minister Paul Morcos also said that the cabinet approved a draft law that exempts those affected by the Israeli aggression from paying certain taxes.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2354783	2025-03-06T06:44:46-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-01006320017412722714.jpeg
Israeli Occupation Forces Continue Aggression in West Bank’s Tulk...	For the 39th consecutive day, Israeli occupation forces continue their assault on the city of Tulkarm and for the 26th day on Nur Shams refugee camp, carrying out large-scale demolitions, infrastructure destruction, and military reinforcements. Israeli forces began on Thursday morning demolishing several residential buildings in the Al-Manshiya neighborhood of Nur Shams, following demolition orders issued a day earlier for 17 homes. The demolitions, under the pretext of constructing a new road to alter the camp’s geographic landscape, targeted properties belonging to several Palestinian families. 🎥 VIDEO: Israeli occupation forces demolish 17 homes in Nur Shams camp in Tulkarem, leaving widespread devastation. pic.twitter.com/naVPbssmQA — Palestine Info Center (@palinfoen) March 6, 2025 Residents were given just two hours to enter the camp and retrieve their belongings, yet occupation forces obstructed the evacuation process, firing live rounds to intimidate them. Since the onset of the assault, Nur Shams camp has faced relentless attacks, with Israeli forces repeatedly raiding homes, forcibly displacing residents, and turning houses into military outposts. The camp has suffered extensive infrastructure devastation, including the destruction of homes, shops, and vital facilities through demolitions, bombings, and arson. In recent days, Israeli bulldozers have razed more than 11 homes as part of a broader scheme to carve out a road from the camp’s main square to Al-Manshiya. Meanwhile, in Tulkarm refugee camp, Israeli forces maintain a strict siege, preventing entry and exit while conducting raids on abandoned homes, looting their contents, and forcibly evacuating residents, particularly in the Al-Matar neighborhood. Witnesses report that Israeli bulldozers continue to tear up roads, destroy property, and seal off streets with dirt barriers, including the camp’s main northern entrance, which has suffered unprecedented destruction. The occupation has also reinforced its military presence with fuel tankers and additional troops, positioning forces in front of residential buildings seized on Nablus Street, a key route connecting Tulkarm and Nur Shams. This has severely disrupted civilian movement. Additionally, Israeli occupation forces have seized multiple homes in the eastern Tulkarm neighborhoods of Dhanaba and Izbat Al-Jarad, expelling their residents and converting them into sniper posts and military bases. Armored reinforcements have also been deployed from checkpoints at Tulkarm’s southern and eastern entrances, leading to further incursions into the town of Anabta and the city's southern entrance before returning to their original positions.

Panama President Says Trump Lied about Panama Canal’s ‘Reclaiming...	Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino has accused his US counterpart Donald Trump of 'lying' about Washington taking back the Panama canal. 'Once again, President Trump is lying. The Panama Canal is not in the process of recovery,' Mulino wrote on X. 'I reject, on behalf of Panama and all Panamanians, this new affront to the truth and to our dignity as a nation,' Mulino wrote on Wednesday, after Trump said that his administration had started to take back the vital waterway. 'To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama canal, and we’ve already started doing it,' Trump said in his speech to Congress on Tuesday. 'We’re taking it back.' Trump’s comments came hours after – under mounting pressure from Washington –the Hong Kong firm Hutchison said it had agreed to sell its lucrative Panama canal ports to a US-led consortium. Hutchison subsidiary PPC has for decades run ports at Balboa and Cristóbal on the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the interoceanic waterway. But since taking office in January, Trump has complained that China controls the canal – a vital strategic asset that the United States once ran. He has refused to rule out a military invasion of Panama to regain control, sparking angry protests and a complaint to the United Nations by the Central American country.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2354343	2025-03-05T10:29:43-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-07048050017411993748.png
Britain, France and Germany Urge ‘Israel’ to abide by Obligations...	Israel' must meet international obligations regarding the provision of humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza, the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany said in a joint statement on Wednesday. 'We call on the government of 'Israel' to abide by its international obligations to ensure full, rapid, safe and unhindered provision of humanitarian assistance to the population in Gaza,' the statement read. 'Humanitarian aid should never be contingent on a ceasefire or used as a political tool,' it added, calling on all parties to uphold the ceasefire. Zionist media revealed that the US administration backs Netanyahu’s steps to halt the humanitarian aid flow to Gaza, knowing that the Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has threatened to cut off the water and power supply to Gaza. The Zionist barbarism justifies such barbaric steps by pushing the Palestinian resistance to surrender and release the Zionist captives. Zionist analysts mentioned that the Palestinians are given the two choices of either death or surrender.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2354288	2025-03-05T08:45:14-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-01555490017411930553.png
US Rejects Arab Leaders Plan for Gaza, Insists on Trump’s Displac...	The Trump administration has rejected a long-awaited plan for the reconstruction of Gaza endorsed by Arab leaders, saying the president stands by his own vision which includes expelling the territory’s Palestinian residents and transforming it into a 'riviera' owned by the United States. 'The current proposal does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance,' US National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement Tuesday night. 'President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas. We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.' Speaking in Cairo, PA President Mahmoud Abbas pledged that general elections will be held in the West Bank, Gaza and 1948 lands for the first time in nearly two decades 'if circumstances are suitable.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu still refuses to say what he envisions for Gaza’s post-war future, except to say that he endorses Trump’s plan for 'a different Gaza.' And he thinks neither the PA nor Hamas should govern Gaza. The $53 billion proposal by Arab nations calls for rebuilding Gaza by 2030. The first phase calls for starting the removal of unexploded ordnance and clearing more than 50 million tons of rubble left by Israel’s bombardment and military offensives. Jordanian officials told CNN earlier that the plan will be presented to President Donald Trump in the coming weeks. Although Arab states endorsed Egypt’s plan, the extent of its regional support remains uncertain. Notably, the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – wealthy Gulf nations whose financial backing would be vital for any postwar strategy – were absent from the summit. Meanwhile, Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune boycotted the meeting, citing 'imbalances and shortcomings' and criticizing it as being 'monopolized by a limited and narrow group of Arab countries.' Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters on Tuesday that the group’s arms were non-negotiable. 'The weapon of the resistance is a red line, and it is not negotiable,' he said. 'We will not accept (any deal) to trade it for reconstruction or the entry of aid.' Osama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official, said last month that the group will not disarm and may even grow after the war in Gaza. The current ceasefire in Gaza, in place since January, remains in doubt after its first phase expired on Saturday. 'Israel' has blocked the entry of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza to pressure the resistance to make concessions and has warned of additional consequences, raising fears of a return to fighting. An emergency Arab summit in Cairo on Tuesday adopted Egypt’s reconstruction plan to rebuild the Gaza Strip, as it rejected the displacement of Palestinians.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2354079	2025-03-05T05:38:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-00292800017411819127.jpg
Israeli Occupation Forces Escalate Violations, Drone Strike Injur...	In yet another flagrant violation of Lebanon’s sovereignty, Israeli occupation forces launched a series of drone strikes on the southern town of Ras Naqoura this afternoon, wounding two civilians. According to Al-Akhbar newspaper, an Israeli drone targeted two vehicles belonging to brothers from the Jahir family while they were inspecting their land, leaving them injured. The National News Agency reported that multiple drone strikes hit a car near a waste dump south of a UNIFIL site in Ras Al-Naqoura. The two injured brothers, who had been collecting scrap metal, were rushed to the hospital for treatment. The agency further revealed that as Lebanese Army personnel and civilians attempted to reach the site, Israeli drones launched another strike to prevent access. This attack follows an Israeli drone strike in Rashkananiyeh, Tyre district, just a day earlier, which killed one person and wounded several others. Later, Al-Manar's correspondent reported that Israeli drones renewed their assault on the targeted vehicle in Ras Al-Naqoura, striking again as the Lebanese Army attempted to evacuate the wounded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2354068	2025-03-05T05:18:00-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-02208130017411802012.png
Shin Bet Acknowledges Historic Failure in Preventing Oct. 7 Attac...	The Zionist entity's domestic security agency Shin Bet acknowledged on Tuesday its failure in preventing Hamas's attack on Oct. 7, 2023, saying that if it had acted differently the deadliest day in 'Israel's' history could have been averted. The Internal Security Agency, as it is formally known, said that an internal probe 'reveals that if the Shin Bet had acted differently, both in the years leading up to the attack and on the night of the attack &#8230; the attack could have been prevented.' The acknowledgment comes days after an Israeli military investigation noted similar failings in protecting Israelis during the attack, which left hundreds dead and was followed by a devastating Israeli war on the Gaza Strip, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed. In the opening lines of the summary of findings from the Shin Bet investigation, the agency's chief Ronen Bar takes responsibility for failures, saying that 'as the head of the organization, I will bear this heavy burden on my shoulders for the rest of my life.' However, he added that in order to truly understand how the unprecedented attack was not stopped, there needed to be a broader probe into the role of the Israeli security and political elements and the cooperation between them. According to the summary, the investigation focused on two key areas – the direct reasons that led to the Shin Bet's failure to recognize the immediate threat from Hamas, and the developments preceding the attack. It noted that 'the investigation found no indication that the Shin Bet underestimated the enemy,' the Palestinian group Hamas. 'On the contrary, there was a deep understanding of the threat, initiatives, and a desire to neutralize the threat, particularly targeting Hamas leadership,' the summary said. The investigation found that prior knowledge of a Hamas attack plan was not treated as an 'actionable threat' and there was an overarching assessment that Hamas was more focused on 'inciting violence' in the occupied West Bank. Additionally, the investigation found that 'a policy of quiet had enabled Hamas to undergo massive military buildup,' with financial aid from Qatar going directly to Hamas's military wing. In conclusion, the agency said in its summary, 'the Shin Bet failed to provide a warning regarding the scope of the attack and the large-scale raid by Hamas'. 'The warning issued on the night of Oct. 7 was not translated into operational directives, and the response given by the Shin Bet &#8230; was insufficient to prevent or thwart the large-scale attack.' Israeli media outlets disclosed on Monday more details from the probe into the military and security failure in face of the Palestinian resistance attack on October 7, 2023.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2354002	2025-03-05T04:15:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-00034900017411769238.jpg
Amnesty International Calls for War Crimes Investigation into Isr...	Amnesty International has urged the international community to investigate war crimes committed by the Israeli occupation military during the Israeli aggression on Lebanon. On Wednesday, the organization raised alarms over repeated attacks targeting health facilities, ambulances, and paramedics in Lebanon, which they say violate international law. In a comprehensive report, Amnesty International emphasized the urgent need to probe the Israeli military's actions during the war, particularly noting that health facilities and personnel are afforded special protections under international humanitarian law. The organization revealed a shocking series of incidents, stating that between October 3 and 9, four Israeli attacks on healthcare sites in Beirut and southern Lebanon resulted in the deaths of 19 medical workers and injuries to 11 others, alongside significant damage to ambulances and medical facilities. .@amnesty : Israel’s unlawful attacks on medical facilities and personnel in #Lebanon are not only serious violations of international humanitarian law and likely #WarCrimes , but also have devastating consequences for civilians more broadly. — Avner Gidron (@AvnerGidron) March 5, 2025 'Given the scale of these attacks, it is imperative for the Lebanese government to involve the International Criminal Court,' the report urged, highlighting the need for accountability and justice for victims. Amnesty International called for Lebanon to grant jurisdiction to the ICC to investigate these crimes committed on its territory and to demand compensation for the violations incurred. Former Lebanese Health Minister Firas Abiad indicated a grim picture of the humanitarian crisis, reporting 67 attacks on hospitals, including 40 direct hits, which have collectively resulted in the deaths of 16 individuals and injuries to many more. The chaos has extended to rescue operations, with 238 attacks on emergency services accounting for 206 fatalities, as well as damage to 256 emergency vehicles, including ambulances and fire trucks. Amnesty's investigation concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that the health facilities or vehicles targeted were being used for military purposes at the time of the attacks. 'The Israeli occupation military has yet to provide adequate justification for its actions,' the report stated, reiterating that the attacks have severely compromised Lebanon's already fragile healthcare system.

Trump’s Historic Congressional Address: From Egg Prices to Flag o...	In a lengthy Congressional address, former President Donald Trump declared, 'America is back,' setting the tone for a speech that touched on a multitude of hot-button issues including soaring egg prices, the fight against 'wokeness,' and even aspirations for a flag on Mars. This unprecedented address drew significant attention not only for its length but also for the charged political atmosphere as Democrats disrupted proceedings, leading Speaker Mike Johnson to denounce the interruptions as a 'breach of decorum' and ultimately remove Congressman Al Green from Texas. 100 minutes of the world according to Trump — Axios (@axios) March 5, 2025 Trump outlined sweeping policy reversals, including a freeze on federal hiring, regulations, and foreign aid. He highlighted his decision to terminate what he called the 'ridiculous Green New Scam,' boasting of withdrawing from international agreements that he deemed detrimental to American interests, including the Paris Climate Accord and the World Health Organization. Turning to domestic economic issues, Trump placed the blame for skyrocketing egg prices squarely on President Biden, vowing to combat inflation as a key priority of his administration. He proclaimed, 'We’re working hard to get it back down,' while promising a national energy emergency to tap into America's vast energy resources. 'It’s called drill, baby, drill,' he enthused, pledging to enhance production of critical minerals and rare earths. The former president also outlined a bold trade policy, announcing a 25% tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber, and steel, stating that this would not only protect American jobs but also safeguard 'the soul of our country.' He expressed a commitment to reshaping U.S. foreign trade dynamics, pledging to address what he called long-standing injustices suffered at the hands of trade partners like Canada and Mexico. As the address wrapped up, Trump even touched on ambitions that reached beyond Earth, hinting at plans for a US flag on Mars—a symbolic nod to the nation’s goals in space exploration. As the speech unfolded, the partisan divide in Congress was palpable, yet Trump's message resonated with many supporters keen on his vision of a resurgent America, free from what he describes as the shackles of bureaucracy and social issues. The implications of this address will likely continue to dominate discussions throughout the political landscape as the nation moves forward.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2353738	2025-03-05T01:13:09-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-04049230017411659282.jpg
