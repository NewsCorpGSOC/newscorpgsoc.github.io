IRGC Chief: Routes to Support Resistance Still Open, Not Limited ...	Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Commander Major General Hossein Salami stressed on Thursday that routes to support Resistance Front are still open and that they are not limited to Syria, noting that the IRGC forces were the last people to leave the country following the downfall of former president Bashar Al-Assad’s government. Speaking to a gathering of IRGC commanders, Maj. Gen. Salami hailed the former Syrian President Bashar Assad for its foreign policy and siding with the Resistance Front. 'Syria had the brightest and most salient record among Arab countries in confronting Zionism, and it was the only country that did not accept any of normalization plans and was always in a state of confrontation, offensive, defensive, and resistance towards the United States and the Israeli regime,' Maj. Gen. Salami said in remarks carried by Mehr News Agency. 'After destroying ISIL's control, we had to withdraw our non-necessary forces from Syria,' he continued. 'Over the past 13-year period, we have tried to make Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Palestinian movement largely independent&#8230;' the IRGC commander continued.

'We couldn't engage the entire IRGC and Basij in a place where its army was just bystander.' The IRGC commander further said that Iranian intelligence had warned the Syrian government about the increasing activities of the armed opposition groups. 'Even our brothers (IRGC intel forces) were able to find the axes of their attack using intelligence techniques and conveyed the intellects to the political and military level in Syria, but because the will to change, war, and resistance in its true sense did not exist, unfortunately, we say what happened.' In this context, he affirmed that the routes to support the Resistance Front are still open and that they are not limited to Syria.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2288893	2024-12-12T01:52:18-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/08/manar-05368670017225129456.jpg

Russia Completed its Mission in Syria Some Time ِِِAgo: Kremlin	Russia assisted Syria in countering terrorists and stabilizing the situation after 2015, but subsequent actions were up to the country’s government, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. 'A while ago, Russia helped the Syrian Arab Republic in combating terrorists and ensuring stability when the situation posed a threat to the entire region. We put in significant effort toward that goal. Russia completed its mission at that point,' he said. 'Afterward, it was the [Bashar] Assad government that took charge in its own country, striving to ensure development, but unfortunately, the situation reached the point it did,' Peskov said, adding that 'now, we need to proceed based on the realities on the ground.' Asked how a potential change of government in Syria would affect Moscow’s geopolitical influence in the Middle East, the presidential spokesman emphasized that 'Russia maintains dialogue with all countries in the region.' 'We are committed to continuing in this manner,' Peskov said. In late November, armed opposition forces launched a large-scale offensive on the Syrian army’s positions and entered Damascus on December 8, while government troops withdrew from the capital. A Kremlin source told TASS on Sunday that Assad and his family members had arrived in Moscow. Russia granted them asylum on humanitarian grounds.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2288343	2024-12-11T06:59:23-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2016/08/manar-08251680014726505203.jpg

The 'real command room' for the plot in Syria belongs to the US and the Israeli regime, the Leader told thousands of Iranians at Imam Khomeini Hussainiya in Tehran, pointing to unquestionable evidence for it. No one should doubt that what has taken place in #Syria is the product of a joint US-Israeli plot. — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) December 11, 2024 Pointing the finger to Turkey’s role in the recent developments, Imam Khamenei said: 'Yes, a neighboring government of Syria has played an obvious role in this regard and is still playing it now, everyone can see this. But the main agent and the main conspirator are the US and the Zionist regime.' A government in a neighboring country of Syria has played and is still playing a clear role in what’s happening. However, the primary conspirators and control room are in the United States and the Zionist regime. We have evidence of this that leaves no room for doubt for anyone. — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) December 11, 2024 His eminence affirmed that Syria will be liberated by the Syrian youth. 'With God’s help, the occupied Syrian regions will be liberated by the hands of the Syrian youth,' he said in remarks carried by Al-Manar, adding: 'Don’t have doubt that Syria will be liberated and that the Resistance Front will force the US out of the region.' 'The ignorant analyst who doesn’t know the meaning of resistance believes that if the resistance weakens, Islamic Iran will also weaken… I tell him, with God’s help, Iran is strong and capable and will become even stronger,' Imam Khamenei stated.

Russia Strongly Believes Syria Should Be Sovereign and Unified, A...	Russia is providing sanctuary to Bashar Al-Assad, having transported the former Syrian leader there 'in the most secure way possible' after the collapse of his government, Russia’s deputy foreign minister said in an interview Tuesday. 'He is secured, and it shows that Russia acts as required in such an extraordinary situation,' Sergei Ryabkov told NBC News, becoming the first Russian official to confirm Assad’s presence in the country. 'I have no idea what is going on with him right now,' Ryabkov said, adding that it 'would be very wrong for me to elaborate on what happened and how it was resolved.' President Bashar Al-Assad during a visit to Moscow in March 2023. The Kremlin said on Monday that President Vladimir Putin had made the decision to grant asylum in Russia to Assad. Asked if the Kremlin would hand over Assad for trial, Ryabkov said Russia is not a party to the convention that established the International Criminal Court. Assad 'was accused by the same group of countries and governments that continuously defeat attempts to live their own ways as it happened in Iraq, in Libya and in many more,' Ryabkov said, adding that it was 'amazing, but it is also very revealing,' that the U.S. 'configures its reaction and response' depending on whom the court is prosecuting. Whoever ends up governing Syria, be it the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) militant group, which led militants as they stormed across Syria, or someone else, Ryabkov said, Russia 'forcefully and strongly' believes that Syria 'should be sovereign, unified and integral.' 'We will not have a situation there, hopefully, that will mean separation of parts of Syria from one another,' he added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2287771	2024-12-11T00:09:57-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2019/07/manar-08865710015637816978.jpg

Hezbollah Calls for Taking All Necessary Measures to Prevent Isra...	Hezbollah issued on Tuesday a statement to maintain that the Israeli entity's occupation of additional Syrian territories and targeting of military capabilities there constitutes a dangerous and strongly condemned act of aggression. The UN Security Council, the international community, and Arab and Islamic nations bear the responsibility of rejecting as well as ending this aggression and protecting the Syrian people during this critical and pivotal stage of their history, the statement noted. 'We have always warned against Israeli ambitions across the region and resisted them to prevent the occupation from achieving its goals. We have repeatedly emphasized that the aggression on Gaza is a war of extermination and a stepping stone to altering the region’s landscape and ending the Palestinian cause.' Hezbollah stressed that the complete silence of the Arab, Islamic, and international entities about the criminal aggression on Syria, backed by unlimited American support, and the failure to take practical measures to confront this aggression and support the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights, have emboldened the Zionist entity to expand its transgressions against the region. 'All necessary steps must be taken to prevent the Israeli entity from achieving its goals. Silence or mere observation of this brutal aggression against Syria and its people is unacceptable. What is happening in Syria today, both on popular and political levels, and the resulting internal and external political choices, is the exclusive right of the Syrian people, free from any external pressures or influences.' We hope Syria will stabilize through the choices of its people, achieve its revival, and remain firmly in the position of rejecting Israeli occupation and preventing foreign interventions in its affairs, the statement read. Hezbollah affirmed would continue to stand by Syria and its people in defending their right to shape their future and confront their enemy, the usurping Israeli entity. The Israeli air force went ahead with striking Syria’s military capabilities, with over 300 strikes being staged in the last few days. a Hezbollah issued late Monday a statement which stressed that the ongoing crimes committed by the Zionist enemy on Syrian territory, whether by occupying more lands in the Golan Heights or striking and destroying the defensive capabilities of the Syrian state, represent a blatant aggression and a insolent violation of the sovereignty of the Syrian state and people and constitute an attempt to destabilize this brotherly country.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2287529	2024-12-10T12:40:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-04165050017056142612.png

Israeli Massacres in Gaza Continue as Ceasefire and Prisoner Swap...	The ongoing genocide in Gaza marks its 431st day, with a new massacre in the north leaving at least 20 Palestinians dead and several others injured in an Israeli airstrike on Beit Hanoun. More casualties were reported in Al-Nuseirat, Rafah, and Zeitoun. Amid these massacres, discussions within the Israeli occupation entity suggest a potential prisoner swap and ceasefire with Hamas, though Zionist Prime Minister Netanyahu's office downplays reports of progress. The Qatari Foreign Ministry has stated that negotiations continue, but any developments are premature. Hamas has reportedly provided Egypt with a list of elderly and ill Zionist prisoners for release in the first phase of the ceasefire. They also presented names of Palestinian prisoners they seek to free. Sources close to Hamas said their delegation briefed Egypt's intelligence minister on these efforts, but no breakthrough occurred in the talks. Hamas emphasized its commitment to ending the conflict and supporting the management of Gaza. Meanwhile, a Zionist official suggested that a prisoner swap could be finalized in one to two weeks, claiming conditions are favorable, according to Yedioth Ahronoth. However, sources close to Hamas stated that the deal hinges on the Zionist entity agreeing to Egypt’s proposal. Reports from Israeli Channel 12 reveal that it remains uncertain whether Hamas will drop its demand for a permanent ceasefire. Hamas is aware of Israeli occupation’s resistance to any concessions regarding future military operations. The Zionist cabinet will meet on Thursday to discuss the situation, with reports indicating that Netanyahu may struggle to secure coalition support for the deal. This comes ahead of a visit by US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who will discuss the ceasefire, developments in Lebanon and Syria, and the Gaza prisoner swap with Israeli officials. Ongoing Genocide in Gaza: 44,758 Martyrs, 106,134 Injured As Israeli occupation airstrikes continue across Gaza, claiming the lives of nearly 60 Palestinians, the death toll since the onset of the massacre on October 7 has reached 44,758, with over 106,000 injured. The Israeli occupation forces have carried out 9,905 attacks, including 7,160 against families, and have wiped out 1,410 families, resulting in 5,444 martyrs. Today, 13 Palestinians were martyred in an Israeli bombing in central Gaza. Meanwhile, 25 Palestinians died and many others were injured or went missing when Israeli forces targeted an apartment building in Beit Hanoun. In the Nuseirat camp, a Palestinian fisherman was martyred by Israeli naval fire, while seven others were killed in an airstrike on a home in the same camp. In northern Gaza, 25 civilians were killed when Israeli airstrikes destroyed a home in Abed Rabbo. Israeli forces also targeted civilian homes in Gaza City with heavy artillery, while six fishermen were arrested off the coast of Deir Al-Balah. In Rafah, two bodies were recovered after an Israeli drone attack on the Al-Zuhur neighborhood. Additionally, Israeli artillery shelled the Al-Tuwam and Al-Saftawi areas in northern Gaza. Israeli occupation forces demolished a house in Rafah and more homes in the west of the Jabaliya camp. A bombing in the Maghazi camp left several children injured, and a six-month-old girl was injured in an attack on a displaced persons' tent in the south. For 67 days, northern Gaza has been under siege, with no access to humanitarian or medical aid due to constant Israeli attacks and blockades. The Civil Defense has been unable to operate in northern Gaza for 49 days, leaving thousands of residents without critical care.

Netanyahu in Court for Corruption Amid Protests	Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared today, Tuesday, before the Central Court in the occupied city of Tel Aviv to testify in response to charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust brought against him by the public prosecutor. This marks a pivotal moment in the five-year-long legal battle, as Netanyahu, the central figure in corruption cases 1000, 2000, and 4000, begins presenting his defense. Netanyahu’s testimony is expected to span several weeks, with the court requiring his attendance three times a week for extended hours. According to Israeli Occupation Army Radio, this is an unprecedented event, as a sitting 'prime minister' stands trial while still in office. Outside the courthouse, protesters gathered, including families of Zionist prisoners in Gaza, criticizing Netanyahu for prioritizing his military offensives over resolving prisoner exchanges or achieving a ceasefire with Palestinian resistance factions. Demonstrators chanted, 'A year of devastation—we will not forget or forgive,' and echoed the charges against Netanyahu: 'Bribery, fraud, and betrayal of trust.'

His testimony was ultimately moved to Tel Aviv’s Central Court for security reasons. Netanyahu arrived at the court at 10:00 a.m., having sought to reduce his required court days, citing ongoing military operations in Gaza and Syria—a request denied by the judges. Zionist Speaker of the Knesset Amir Ohana’s argument that the court should coordinate Netanyahu’s schedule with him was also rejected, as Netanyahu had waived his parliamentary immunity. The Corruption Cases Netanyahu faces three major corruption cases. First, in Case 1000, he is accused of accepting expensive gifts and personal benefits from businessmen, including Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan, in exchange for political favors, such as securing a 10-year US visa for Milchan. Second, in Case 2000, he allegedly negotiated with Yedioth Ahronoth publisher Arnon Mozes, proposing to limit the free distribution of rival newspaper Israel Hayom in return for favorable coverage in Yedioth. Third, in Case 4000, Netanyahu is charged with striking a deal with businessman Shaul Elovitch, owner of the Walla news site, to secure positive media coverage in exchange for regulatory benefits facilitating the merger of Elovitch’s companies, Bezeq and Yes.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2287100	2024-12-10T03:45:11-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-06725410017338309854.jpg

According to the report, a significant number of prisoners in the Etzion Detention Center are suffering from severe food poisoning after consuming spoiled meals provided by the prison administration. A lawyer from the Commission of Detainees' Affairs visited nine of the affected detainees, who exhibited similar symptoms of 'abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, weakness, fatigue, facial yellowing, significant fluid loss, and an inability to stand.' This is not the first time such an incident has occurred at Etzion, with previous cases of food poisoning documented over the years. The Commission of Detainees' Affairs has accused the prison administration of 'deliberately subjecting detainees to harsh punishment since the start of the (Israeli) assault on Gaza,' including prolonged hunger, poor-quality meals, and severe beatings and solitary confinement for those who protest. Amani Sarahna, the media coordinator for the Palestinian Prisoners Society, stated that Etzion is a temporary detention and investigation center, where detainees are later transferred to other facilities. The prison currently holds 111 detainees, none of whom received medical treatment for the food poisoning. The Commission of Detainees' Affairs has called on international organizations to 'intervene urgently to alleviate their suffering and ensure their protection in Israeli prisons.' The commission's lawyer reported that the detainees' severe symptoms indicate a deliberate attempt to punish and mistreat the prisoners. This disturbing revelation sheds light on the ongoing human rights abuses faced by Palestinian detainees in Israeli custody, further highlighting the need for immediate intervention and accountability.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2287166	2024-12-10T03:10:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-03554820017312583591.png

Israeli Air Force Chief Says Failed to Flag Drone Fired from Yeme...	Israeli Air Force chief Tomer Bar said on Tuesday that a drone fired from Yemen which hit a building in the city of Yavne yesterday without any sirens was mistakenly thought to pose no threat. A statement from the Israeli occupation military said that after Bar investigated the incident, it was found that the drone was initially flagged as suspect, and was slated to be shot down, before officials decided instead not to, believing it to be a civilian aircraft. Tomer Bar, Israeli Air Force chief (image from archive). Since the drone was not classified as a threat, no sirens were sounded, the statement added. Bar said that the 'Air Force failed in the incident and did not provide protection and warning to Israeli citizens.' He noted that in the future, sirens should be sounded even if a drone is not fully determined to be a threat. Earlier on Monday, Yemeni Armed Forces announced a drone strike on a target in Yavne, in support of the oppressed people of Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2286913	2024-12-10T00:16:23-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-04236860017338178481.jpg

Hezbollah Denounces Israeli Expanding Occupation of Golan Heights...	Hezbollah issued late Monday a statement which stressed that the ongoing crimes committed by the Zionist enemy on Syrian territory, whether by occupying more lands in the Golan Heights or striking and destroying the defensive capabilities of the Syrian state, represent a blatant aggression and a insolent violation of the sovereignty of the Syrian state and people and constitute an attempt to destabilize this brotherly country. The Resistance Party maintained that this aggressive occupation of Syrian territories comes with the continued aggression of the Zionist army on Lebanon and its daily violations as well as attacks on Gaza, which places the peoples in front of an imminent danger that confirms the unity of the their path and the necessity of rejecting and confronting this aggression. 'While we condemn these attacks, we warn against the consequences of their continuation. We also call on the world, especially the Arab and Islamic worlds, to take firm positions against these crimes and to exert pressure in all political and legal fields to stop this series of attacks, as all the justifications put forward by the enemy are flimsy allegations.' Hezbollah maintained that all the enemy attempts to control new Syrian lands cannot consecrate any kind of rights, as all of this can only be called an ongoing occupation in the Golan region since 1967. Finally, Hezbollah reiterated its support for Syria, underlining the necessity of preserving its unity in terms of people and territory. The Zionist air force launched on Monday more than 100 air raids on Syrian military airports as well as weaponry caches and factories. Israeli Army Radio announced that fighter jets bombed more than 100 sites inside Syria in the past few hours. Israeli air raids destroyed Syrian warships at port of Latakia, according to media reports.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2286748	2024-12-09T15:01:55-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-027725400166239486010.jpg
Iran Condemns Zionist Regime’s Repeated Attacks on Syrian Infrast...	Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Esmail Baghaei Hamaneh strongly condemned the Zionist regime's repeated encroachment on Syrian infrastructure and the occupation of other parts of the Syrian Golan. Baghaei condemned the Zionist regime's repeated encroachment on Syrian infrastructure over the past two days and the occupation of other parts of the Syrian Golan, and condemned the supporting the regime by Western countries and their silence and inaction against this clear violation of the law, which the Zionist regime considers as confirmation of its aggressive actions. Referring to the action of the Zionist regime in the military attack on Syrian territory - in a situation where the Syrian people are facing changes caused by the change of the regime - Baghaei called this act of aggression a clear violation of the UN Charter and demanded an immediate response from the UN Security Council to stop the aggression and holding the occupying regime accountable. Baghaei warned that the Israeli regime is exploiting the situation in Syria to expand its genocidal campaign against Palestinians. 'These days they are abusing the complicated situation in #Syria for ever-expanding their genocidal campaign in #Palestine,' Baghaei wrote in a message on social media platform X on Monday to mark the anniversary of the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which was adopted on December 9, 1948. Citing UN Special Rapporteur for Palestine Francesca Albanese, Baghaei noted that the Israeli regime is founded on the goal of erasing Palestinians and that its entire political system is directed towards that objective. 'Genocide is defined as a specific set of acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group,' he said. 'It is high time that the int'l community stood up in support of humanity and put an end to this horrific century-long genocide,' he said. Baghaei pointed out that the Israeli regime has defied all six provisional measures by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which ruled early this year that Israel must prevent any acts contrary to the Genocide Convention.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2286715	2024-12-09T13:03:33-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-04255540017337782001.jpg

‘Israel’ Bombs Syria, Occupies Mount Hermon	The Israeli enemy staged several air strikes on Syria on Sunday, as its military occupied Jabal Al-Sheikh (Mount Hermon) near the Golan Heights and warned Syrians living in five villages close to the occupied portion of the strategic area to 'stay home'.

Members of Astana Format Call for Dialogue in Syria: Lavrov	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has affirmed that the guarantor states of the Astana process- Russia, Iran and Turkey- have agreed on facilitating the stopping of military operations in Syria, stressing that steps will be taken on the ground. The states also agreed to call on the Syrian government and the opposition to start dialogue and implement Security Council Resolution 2254. During a press conference on Saturday following a meeting with his Iranian and Turkish counterparts within the Astana format in Doha, Lavrov said 'we agreed to take steps to stop military operations and we will take steps on the ground. As for the de-escalation zone in Idlib, we said that commitments within the framework of Astana platform do not allow support for 'Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham' and demand separation between the opposition and this terrorist organization. Lavrov also said 'we emphasized Syria’s sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity, the immediate cessation of hostilities, and refusal to allow terrorists to seize territory in Syria. We agreed also to call on the Syrian government and the opposition to start dialogue and implement UN Resolution 2254, which strongly affirms the unity and sovereignty of Syrian territory and condemns any attempts by terrorists to disrupt the lives of Syrians. The Russian Foreign Minister continued by saying 'according to the information available to us, the advance of 'Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham' from Idlib to other areas, the capture of the city of Hama, and the approach to Homs were planned in advance, and are an attempt to change the balance of power on the ground. We will oppose and confront this, and we will support the legitimate authorities in Syria. At the same time, we will support and push for the establishment of a dialogue between the government and the opposition in accordance with what was stipulated in UN Resolution 2254.' Lavrov stressed the need to adhere to Astana process outcomes and strictly implement the de-escalation agreements as a main framework for addressing the crisis in Syria. He said 'Russia continues to provide military assistance to the Syrian army through its military base in Hmeimim, and is trying to do everything in its power to combat terrorists in Syria with the aim of eliminating them. Russia will continue to fight terrorist groups in Syria even if they say they are no longer terrorists.'

Syrian Army Redeploys in Daraa and Sweida, Restores Control in Ho...	The Syrian Army announced on Saturday that its forces in Daraa and Sweida provinces, in southern Syria, have repositioned and established a robust security perimeter in the area. In a statement, the General Command of the Army and Armed Forces clarified that this redeployment followed attacks by terrorist elements on scattered army checkpoints, aiming to divert the military's focus as it advances against terrorist groups in Homs and Hama provinces. The statement reaffirmed the army's commitment to safeguarding the nation and its citizens, vowing to confront terrorism decisively. While the Syrian Army battles armed groups in Homs and Hama, militants in southern Syria have targeted army positions in Daraa and Sweida. A Syrian military source denied reports by certain media outlets claiming that terrorists had entered the Al-Qaryatayn area, southeast of Homs. The source stressed that Syrian forces remain fully stationed and prepared in the region. Another military source reported that Syrian forces in Hama and Homs carried out heavy artillery and rocket strikes on terrorist strongholds and supply lines, achieving direct hits. In parallel, joint Syrian-Russian airstrikes targeted militant gatherings in northeastern Homs, killing dozens of fighters and destroying their equipment. According to Syrian state television, over 2,500 militants from Jabhat al-Nusra and its affiliates were killed last week during army offensives supported by joint airpower. A military source revealed that some militants resort to entering villages briefly, coercing residents to allow staged videos of their presence to mislead audiences and undermine public morale. In northern Homs, the Syrian Army executed a strategic operation in the Dar al-Kabira–Talbiseh–Rastan axis, eliminating dozens of militants. This triggered widespread panic, disarray, and mass desertion among their ranks. The Syrian Army also dismissed reports circulated by certain media and terrorist-affiliated platforms alleging troop withdrawals from positions around Homs.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2285384	2024-12-07T05:20:13-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-09505150017335770421.jpg

Sheikh Qassem: Victorious Hezbollah Committed to Reconstruction a...	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem stressed on Thursday that the enemy sought to crush the resistance through its aggression but was met with the 'Battle of The Formidable in Might'. In a televised speech, Sheikh Qassem said, 'For 64 days, we endured sacrifices, pain, martyrs, and injuries with patience, resilience, and reliance on Allah.' According to Sheikh Qassem, three key factors contributed to Allah’s victory for us in this battle: 1. The presence and steadfastness of martyrdom-seeking fighters on the battlefield. 2. The blood of the martyrs, especially that of His Eminence Sayyed Nasrallah, which inspired the fighters to persevere. 3. The restoration of leadership and control structures within the party, enabling effective management of the 'Battle of The Formidable in Might'. Hezbollah Leader hailed the steadfastness of the displaced Lebanese people for their contribution to the victory, detailing Hezbollah plan to fund the reconstruction and thanking the Iranian-Iraqi-Yemeni financial support in this regard. Sheikh Qassem stressed that those whose houses were completely destroyed will receive a 14-thousand-dollar pay in order to purchase a new furniture and rent a house for a year. His eminence also underlined the Lebanese government in raising the debris, treating the infrastructure problems and contributing to the reconstruction project. Sheikh Qassem pointed out that the legendary resilience of the fighters astonished the world, displaying unparalleled courage and bravery on the frontlines. 'We achieved victory because the enemy failed to accomplish its objectives, marking their defeat. Our resistance remains steadfast, will endure, and will shine even brighter.' We agreed to the ceasefire mechanism outlined by Resolution 1701, which is not a new or standalone agreement, he added. Sheikh Qassem noted that Resolution 1701 mandates 'Israel's' withdrawal and prohibits armed presence south of the Litani River, adding that the provisions outlined in Resolution 1701 include mechanisms for Lebanon to reclaim its borders within the specified timeframe. 'Israel has committed over 60 violations of the ceasefire agreement, and the government is responsible for addressing those breaches. The Lebanese state is accountable for monitoring Israeli violations, while the resistance provides an opportunity to ensure the success of the ceasefire agreement.' Sheikh Qassem indicated that 'Israel' has no influence on our internal relationships or our ties with the Lebanese Army, adding that Hezbollah’s strength stems from supporting the rights of Palestinians and Lebanese to liberate their land.' We will evaluate the crises and war we endured, drawing lessons to improve and advance in all fields, Sheikh Qassem said. His eminence expressed gratitude to those who hosted the displaced, to the various entities offering support, whether governmental or civilian, and to the countries that provided aid. Meanwhile, Sheikh Qassem said that the aggression against Syria is backed by America and 'Israel', adding that the Takfiri groups in Syria were tools serving 'Israel' and America. Hezbollah will stand alongside Syria to thwart this aggression, Sheikh Qassem affirmed. 'We face a dangerous expansionist Israeli project, and I call on you to support the resistance against 'Israel'. Takfiri groups aim to shift Syria from its position of resistance to one that serves the Israeli enemy.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2284394	2024-12-05T10:27:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-09018800017334231657.png

Amnesty International Investigation Concludes ‘Israel’ Committing...	Amnesty International human rights group has concluded that the Zionist entity’s war on Gaza meets the legal threshold for genocide, in a report it said it was a 'wake-up call' for the international community. The report, published on Thursday, titled 'You Feel Like You Are Subhuman': Israel’s Genocide Against Palestinians in Gaza. The London-based rights organization said its findings were based on 'dehumanizing and genocidal statements by Israeli government and military officials', satellite images documenting devastation, fieldwork and ground reports from Gazans. It is the culmination of months of research by Amnesty, including extensive witness interviews, analysis of 'visual and digital evidence', including satellite imagery, and statements made by senior Israeli government and military officials. 'Month after month, Israel has treated Palestinians in Gaza as a subhuman group unworthy of human rights and dignity, demonstrating its intent to physically destroy them,' Amnesty chief Agnes Callamard said in a statement. 'Our damning findings must serve as a wake-up call to the international community: this is genocide. It must stop now,' she added.

'Our research reveals that, for months, Israel has persisted in committing genocidal acts, fully aware of the irreparable harm it was inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza,' Callamard said. 'It continued to do so in defiance of countless warnings about the catastrophic humanitarian situation and of legally binding decisions from the International Court of Justice [ICJ] ordering Israel to take immediate measures to enable the provision of humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza,' she added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2284009	2024-12-05T00:27:14-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-09111270017298671932.jpg

Hezbollah Can Resume Battle against Israeli Enemy with Long-range...	Deputy Chief of Hezbollah Politburo, Hajj Mahmoud Komati, indicated on Wednesday that the mechanism of the implementation of the ceasefire deal in southern Lebanon is vague, adding that the US deliberate leniency gave the Israeli enemy the chance to violate the Lebanese sovereignty. In a TV interview, Komati stressed that the response of the Islamic Resistance came after the Israeli attacks on the Lebanese civilians and violations of the ceasefire. The Islamic Resistance carried out on Monday, December 2, its first attack on Zionist military sites since the ceasefire took into effect last Wednesday, November 27, 2024, targeting Ruwaisat Al-Alam occupation post in KfarShuba Hills area. When Hezbollah realized that the Lebanese and American officials disregarded the Israeli violations, it carried out the attack on the Israeli occupation site, which pushed everyone to move to implement the mechanism of the ceasefire, he said. Komati pointed out that Hezbollah is waiting for and will cooperate with the committee tasked to overlook the truce implementation, but that the developments, in this regard are not satisfactory. Hezbollah will be patient for a period of time, yet can resume the battle against the Israeli enemy with long-range missiles, if needed, Komati added. Regarding the Lebanese presidential elections, Komati reiterated Hezbollah commitment to the nomination of the former minister Sleiman Frangieh, calling on the parliamentary bloc to reach a minimum consensus in this domain.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2283877	2024-12-04T11:29:42-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-027725400166239486010.jpg

Israeli Army Warns 30 Soldiers against Overseas Travel over War C...	The Israeli occupation military warned some 30 soldiers and officers who fought in the Gaza Strip to avoid traveling abroad after pro-Palestinian groups filed complaints against them for war crimes. At least eight of them — including troops who had traveled to Cyprus, Slovenia and the Netherlands — were told to immediately leave those nations due to fears they could be arrested or questioned, Ynet reported. The military currently does not bar soldiers from traveling abroad, but it does take a 'risk assessment' for troops who served in Gaza before approving their request, the report said. Since the beginning of the war, the army has asked soldiers to not publish footage online of their abuses in Gaza, to avoid it being used against them in a potential criminal investigation in another country. Journalists who have accompanied troops in Gaza have also been asked to blur the faces of soldiers for the same reason.

It is worth noting that for the 61st consecutive day, northern Gaza has been under an Israeli siege and starvation amidst violent aerial and artillery bombardment, and the complete isolation of the northern governorate from Gaza. For the 43rd day, the occupation forces continue to forcibly disrupt the work of civil defense in the northern Gaza Strip due to the ongoing Israeli targeting and aggression, and thousands of citizens there are now without humanitarian and medical care. In turn, UNRWA stated that it was forced to stop delivering food and other supplies to Gaza via the Kerem Abu Salem border crossing due to the looting carried out by 'armed gangs.' Despite being the main corridor for humanitarian aid, the agency made the decision on Sunday after it was informed that trucks carrying food supplies had been 'completely hijacked' after crossing into Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2283558	2024-12-04T03:21:20-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-08604690017306480946.jpg
Norway Wealth Fund Divests from Israeli Telecommunication Company...	Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, announced it has sold all of its shares in an Israeli telecommunications company as it provides telecoms services to the Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. In its recommendation, released late on Tuesday, the fund’s watchdog said it was divesting from Bezeq, the Zionist entity’s largest telecoms group. 'The company, through its physical presence and provision of telecom services to Israeli settlements in the West Bank, is helping to facilitate the maintenance and expansion of these settlements, which are illegal under international law,' the recommendation read. 'By doing so the company is itself contributing to the violation of international law,' it added, according to Reuters news agency. The $1.8 trillion fund has been an international leader in the environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment field. It owns 1.5% of the world's listed shares across 8,700 companies, and its size carries influence. The watchdog said it noted that the company had said it was also providing telecoms services to Palestinian areas in the occupied West Bank, but that did not outweigh the fact that it was also providing services to Israeli settlements. The watchdog makes recommendations to the board of the Norwegian Central Bank, which has the final say on divestments. The fund has now sold all its stock in the company. Israeli settler units in the occupied West Bank (photo from archive). Before that, it had cut its stake during the first half of 2024, owning 0.76% of the company's shares valued at $23.7 million at the end of June, down from a holding of 2.2% at the start of the year, fund data showed. The watchdog's new definition of ethical breaches was partly based on the International Court of Justice finding in July that 'the occupation itself, Israel's settlement policy and the way Israel uses the natural resources in the areas are in conflict with international law', according to an August 30 letter it addressed to the finance ministry. Since the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023, the council had been investigating whether more companies fall outside its permitted investment guidelines. Before the announcement to divest, the fund had divested from nine companies operating in the occupied West Bank. Their operations include building roads and homes in Israeli settlements in East Al-Quds (Jerusalem) and the West Bank and providing surveillance systems for an Israeli wall around the occupied West Bank.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2283459	2024-12-04T01:47:32-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-00726770017333054101.jpg
More Israeli Violations of Ceasefire in South Lebanon	The Israeli enemy escalated its attacks on South Lebanon, committing more violations of the ceasefire still holding since last Wednesday. On Nov. 27, a cease-fire agreement took effect, ending a two-month, all-out Israeli war on Lebanon. In this regard, Zionist drones targeted the towns of Beit Leif, Deir Siryan and Shebaa, claiming a shepherd. A heavy gunfire also targeted Majdal Zoun. The Israeli warplanes, in turn, raided the area between Mleikh and Sojod in Iqlim Al-Tuffah in the context of its ongoing aggression. The following photo shows the moment of an Israeli air raid on Kfar Milke town in Sidon district. Meanwhile, an Israeli air raid on a residential building in Haris town,South Lebanon, totally destroying it.

PA, Hamas Agree to Form Committee to Run Post-War Gaza: Report	The Palestinian Authority and Hamas have signed a document agreeing to form a joint committee that would run the post-war Gaza Strip, Al-Araby Al-Jadeed Arab news site reported on Tuesday. The report said it has a copy of the document that was signed to formulate the committee, to be made of 10-15 leading Palestinian figures. It comes a day after Egypt’s foreign minister said that rival Palestinian groups Fatah and Hamas were in Cairo for talks seeking to bring post-war Gaza. The talks are part of Egypt’s broader mediation efforts to broker a ceasefire between the Zionist entity and the Hamas resistance group and to expand humanitarian access to the enclave. Displaced Palestinians line up to receive food at a distribution center in Gaza's Deir Al-Balah (November 26, 2024). The document laid out six commitments largely designed to unite the West Bank and Gaza under one political entity. They would be responsible for overseeing health and economic services, agriculture and vital infrastructure. Meanwhile on Tuesday, Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar reported that an Israeli delegation is to visit Cairo in the coming days for talks on more details regarding a potential captive and ceasefire deal between Hamas and the Zionist entity.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2282953	2024-12-02T23:27:28-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-02514580017267356425.jpeg
US Says Ceasefire Holding: Washington 'Hasn’t Determined if Israe...	The US State Department said on Monday that the ceasefire between the Zionist entity and Hezbollah is thus far 'successful, broadly speaking,' adding that Washington has not 'determined' if Tel Aviv violated the ceasefire. 'The ceasefire is holding,' Matthew Miller, the department’s spokesman, told reporters at the daily press briefing, after the Israeli enemy staged airstrikes on several areas across south Lebanon earlier on Monday. The ceasefire, brokered by the United States and France, has 'been successful in stopping the fighting and getting us on a path where we are not seeing the daily loss of life that we had seen for two months prior,' the spokesman added. Miller said that violations were expected, especially in the opening weeks 'when things are very fragile.' The ceasefire agreement, which took effect on Wednesday (November 27), contains a mechanism for reporting potential violations and for the ways that Washington and Paris will respond to them, he said. That mechanism will become more formalized in the coming days, the spokesman noted. 'When we get reports of potential violations, we have a mechanism that we put in place with the government of France to look at those potential violations, determine if they are in fact, violations, and then engage with the parties to ensure that they aren't repeated,' Miller said. Later on Monday, Miller said that Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, and the two discussed developments in Gaza and Lebanon. Blinken pointed to the 'importance of bringing all of the hostages home and ending the war in Gaza,' while stressing the 'importance' of implementing the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon. .@SecBlinken spoke with Israeli Minister Dermer.

Our Commitment to UN Resolution 1701 is Conditioned by Israel’s C...	Hezbollah Political Council Deputy Chief Mahmoud Komati underlined the contradiction between the US-Israeli calls for separating Lebanon's and Gaza's dossiers and the current endeavor to link the hostage deal with the Lebanese front. In a TV interview, Komati indicated that Hezbollah's resistance and political activity are very powerful politically, adding that the Resistance is not in need of any military or security action in order to preserve the political participation. Komati mentioned that Hezbollah resorted to silence about the Zionist violations, yet the enemy escalated its attacks, which made the Resistance response very necessary. We clearly said that Hezbollah's commitment to the UN Resolution 1701 is conditioned by the Israeli commitment too, he reiterated. Komati stressed that the Lebanese Army possesses the patriotic will to fight the enemy, yet lacks the weaponry needed for that mission. The Islamic Resistance carried out on Monday its first attack on Zionist military sites since the ceasefire took into effect last Wednesday, November 27, 2024, targeting Ruwaisat Al-Alam occupation post in KfarShuba Hills area.

In a blatant violation of the ceasefire and the Lebanese sovereignty, the Israeli enemy escalated Monday its attacks on South Lebanon and Bekaa, leaving one martyr, two injuries, and materialistic losses. The Zionist escalation started in South Lebanon with machine gun bursts fired by the Israeli army towards safe houses in the town of Naqoura, in a scene that reflects the persistence in targeting civilians and infrastructure. This was followed by an airstrike on the town of Ainata near the municipality building, injuring a citizen in the Bint Jbeil-Maroun al-Ras triangle area. A Zionist drone bombed a motorcycle near the Marjeyoun power station, killing one person according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health.

Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported that the US administration warned 'Israel' against the cease-fire violations, adding that the presidential envoy Amos Hochstein notified Tel Aviv officials that the deal is being violated by the Zionist side. For his part, the French foreign minister Jean Noel Barrot told his Zionist counterpart Gideon Saar about the necessity of stopping the ceasefire violations. On Nov. 27, a cease-fire agreement between Lebanon and Israel took effect, ending over 14 months of fighting between the Israeli army and Hezbollah. Lebanese media reported around 73 Israeli violations of the cease-fire deal since it came into force last week, turning it to be a mere ease-fire.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2282623	2024-12-02T07:09:14-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-04391680017331520878.jpg
US-Israeli Captive Confirmed Dead, IOF Announces	The Israeli occupation military confirmed Monday that an Israeli American soldier, previously believed to have been captured alive by Hamas during its Oct. 7, 2023 attack against the Zionist entity, is now presumed dead. Capt. Omer Neutra, 21, a New York native who enlisted in the Israeli military, was captured when Hamas fighters attacked the occupation settlements in Gaza enclave. It was previously thought he was being held hostage since then, but officials have announced it is thought he was killed on the day of the Hamas attack and his body was then taken into the Gaza Strip. Believing their son to be alive, the soldier's parents, Ronen and Orna Neutra, led a public campaign for over a year, speaking at rallies in both 'Israel' and the U.S., addressing the Republican National Convention, and maintaining contact with the Biden administration in a bid to secure his release. Hamas is still holding approximately 100 hostages inside Gaza, with at least a third believed to be dead. The Biden administration is renewing its push for a ceasefire and the release of the remaining captives after nearly a year of stalled negotiations between 'Israel' and Hamas. The situation remains dire, but diplomats see a glimmer of hope following a recent ceasefire between 'Israel' and Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based resistance group allied with Hamas.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2282568	2024-12-02T06:38:47-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-04473770017331503025.png

In a major setback for the Israeli occupation, its forces were forced to withdraw from the eastern part of Nablus in the northern West Bank after confronting fierce resistance from Palestinian fighters. The al-Quds Brigades and al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, both based in Nablus, claimed responsibility for the clashes that erupted as Israeli occupation troops tried to storm the city. The Palestinian fighters engaged the Israeli forces with heavy gunfire and explosive devices, thwarting their incursion. According to local sources, over 20 Israeli military vehicles, accompanied by bulldozers, had entered Nablus on Sunday evening from the Awarta and Beit Furik checkpoints, apparently to secure access for Israeli settlers to the nearby Joseph's Tomb. However, the determined resistance from the Palestinian factions forced the Israelis to pull out after hours of intense confrontations.

During the meeting, President al-Assad emphasized the broader implications of combating terrorism, stating, 'Confronting terrorism, dismantling its structure, and cutting off its sources not only benefits Syria but also contributes to the stability of the entire region.' He reaffirmed Syria’s commitment to defeating terrorist organizations, saying, 'The Syrian state, army, and people remain steadfast in their determination to fight terrorism across all its territories.'

The Iranian Mehr News Agency reported, 'Araghchi arrived in Damascus on Sunday as the first stop of his regional tour, focusing on recent developments in Syria.'

Before departing Tehran, Araghchi expressed confidence in Syria’s ability to overcome these challenges, stating, 'The Syrian army will once again triumph over the terrorists.' He further criticized the roles of external actors, asserting, 'The United States, the Zionist entity, and Takfiri groups have shown they are aligned in their objectives, but their actions will ultimately fail, as they have before.' The discussions underscore the close coordination between Syria and Iran in addressing shared security concerns and maintaining regional stability. The Syrian President expressed gratitude for Iran's unwavering support, extending his greetings to Ayatollah Khamenei and Iranian President Pezeshkian, acknowledging the strong bonds between the two nations. President Assad lauded Iran’s steadfast commitment to regional stability and security, particularly in supporting Syria’s ongoing battle against terrorism. He emphasized the importance of collective regional efforts to eradicate the scourge of terrorism, noting that its persistence benefits only the enemies of Muslim nations, especially the Israeli regime. Highlighting the significance of Minister Araghchi’s visit, Assad described it as a meaningful gesture of solidarity under the current sensitive circumstances. He affirmed that the visit reflects Iran’s strong message of support for the countries in the resistance front as they confront the challenges posed by the Israeli regime. The discussions underscored Syria and Iran’s shared vision of regional cooperation and their determination to address common threats to stability and security.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2282348	2024-12-01T12:42:41-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-09296260017330855762.jpg
Victorious Return: Resistance Community Rebuild Lives Amid Post-W...	With heads held high, the people of the resistance are triumphantly returning to their homes after the Islamic Resistance secured a significant victory against Israeli forces during 66 days of aggression on Lebanon. The assault left widespread destruction across southern villages, the Bekaa Valley, and Beirut’s southern suburbs (Dahiyeh). According to the latest statistics released by the Ministry of Health last Thursday, the Israeli aggression claimed the lives of 3,961 people and left 16,520 others injured. Life is gradually resuming in the areas affected by the Israeli occupation aggression as displaced families return after being forcibly uprooted by the brutal Israeli crimes and massacres against unarmed civilians. Businesses, pharmacies, bakeries, and cafés are reopening, while specialized teams and municipalities work tirelessly to clear debris and reopen roads. As they return, residents honor the memory of the martyrs, whether fallen in heroic battles or through Israeli occupation bombardments of homes. Many visited cemeteries to recite prayers for the souls of those who gave their lives during the conflict. Beirut's Dahiyeh Alive Again In Beirut’s southern suburbs (Dahiyeh), the resilience of the resistance community stands in sharp contrast to the disarray within Netanyahu's government, which struggles to encourage settlers to return to northern occupied territories.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has condemned the atrocities and disasters unfolding in the region, attributing them to the backing of the United States and certain European countries. He called on Islamic nations to prevent the US and Israeli occupation from exploiting the conflict in Syria. Speaking with optimism, President Pezeshkian expressed hope that Islamic countries would step in to resolve the Syrian crisis and not allow external powers to manipulate the situation again. He emphasized the need to address the nation's challenges through strength and expertise. In a separate address to the Iranian Islamic Consultative Assembly on Parliament Day, the president highlighted his administration's efforts to improve foreign relations, particularly with neighboring countries. 'In the short time since the formation of our government, we have engaged in dialogue with our neighbors, sharing our perspectives and policies,' he stated. President Pezeshkian also affirmed that the Islamic Republic has no intention of escalating wars or bloodshed. 'Those who perpetuate war and violence in this region and across the world are the very ones who claim to champion peace, human rights, and humanity,' he asserted. He criticized the hypocrisy of nations capable of leveraging science and technology to bomb children and women in hospitals and schools. 'In this war, over 10,000 innocent children have been martyred. The global community witnesses these atrocities in silence, and this silence is disgraceful,' he added. President Pezeshkian held the United States and European countries responsible for the catastrophes in the region, citing their support for Israel and extremist groups. He reaffirmed that Iran 'has never and will never covet the territory of any nation in the region.' He further noted a positive shift in regional dynamics, highlighting that for the first time, all nations in the region collectively condemned Israeli aggression against Iran. 'We express our gratitude to our neighboring countries for their unified stance,' Pezeshkian concluded. Araghchi Strongly Supports Syria's Government, Army Against Terrorists Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reaffirmed Iran's unwavering support for Syria's government and army in their fight against terrorist groups.

Sheikh Qassem: Hezbollah’s Victory Surpasses That in 2006, Resist...	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem addressed on Friday the nation two days after the ceasefire took into effect and ended a two-month Zionist war on Lebanon, stressing that we are witnessing a major victory. Sheikh Qassem stressed that Hezbollah achieved a victory that is greater than that reached in 2006 despite all the sacrifices made and the Western support to the Israeli enemy, adding that we emerged triumphant because we prevented the enemy from eradicating the Resistance. When we launched the support front, we reiterated that we do not seek war but are ready for it if imposed by the 'Israeli' enemy, Sheikh Qassem said. His eminence added that the occupation built its plans 64 days ago based on eradicating Hezbollah, letting the northern settlers to return home, and establishing a new Middle East, adding that 'Israel' anticipated achieving its objectives in a short time after targeting our leadership system and the capabilities we possessed. Sheikh Qassem indicated that Hezbollah managed to remain steadfast on the frontlines and began striking the enemy's internal front, placing 'Israel' in a significant defensive position, noting that, during this war, the number of displaced in 'Israel' has grown from 70,000 to hundreds of thousands. According to Hezbollah leader, the Resistance has proven its readiness, with the plans set by His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah being effective and accounting for all developments. 'The occupation bet on internal discord with the hosts, but this gamble failed due to cooperation among sects and factions. The legendary and sacrificial [Martyrdom-Seeking] steadfastness of the fighters astonished the world, terrified the Israeli army, and sowed despair among the enemy.' 'We declare that, as a result of the 'The Formidable in Might' battle, we are witnessing a great victory because we prevented the enemy from destroying Hezbollah, weakening the Resistance, and forced the enemy to justify itself to its public,' Sheikh Qassem said. 'The Resistance has endured and will continue; this victory belongs to everyone who contributed to it, whether through bullets, martyrdom, wounds, prayers, words, or support. This victory is for every honorable and free individual who supported the Resistance and condemned the Israeli aggression.' Hezbollah leader affirmed, 'Defeat surrounds the enemy from all sides. A ceasefire and cessation of aggression have been agreed upon. This agreement is not a treaty or a new accord requiring signatures from states; rather, it is a set of procedural implementations of Resolution 1701, focusing on the area south of the Litani River.' Sheikh Qassem stressed that the coordination between the Resistance and the Lebanese Army will be of the highest level to ensure the implementation of this agreement, adding that no one should bet on any disagreement between us and the army; this agreement falls under the framework of Lebanese sovereignty. 'We thank Allah for our victory, and we express gratitude and pride in the Resistance fighters on the ground who humiliated the enemy and confronted it with legendary resilience. We extend our thanks to our great martyrs who paved the way for strength and dignity—every one of our martyrs is great because they transcended this world and rejected humiliation.' Hezbollah leader underscored that the central focus of the agreement today is south of the Litani River, affirming the withdrawal of the 'Israeli army' from all areas it has occupied. His eminence voiced gratitude to the Master of the Nation’s Martyrs for being the spark of victory and paving this path, alongside your companion, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, saluting the wounded, civil defense teams, and heartfelt respect and thanks to our people—the most honorable and purest. We honor your sacrifices and the martyrdom of your loved ones in the field of honor, and we deeply appreciate the displaced and those whose homes were destroyed, his eminence said. Sheikh Qassem also thanked the steadfast and resistant political negotiator, Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, Prime Minister Najib Mikati for his efforts, the leadership of the army and security forces, and the honorable media. His eminence expressed gratitude to the Islamic Republic of Iran and its leader, Imam Khamenei, for his guidance, support, and adherence to the path of Imam Khomeini, as well as to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the martyr Hajj Qassem Soleimani, who laid the foundations and contributed significantly, and to the compassionate Iranian people. 'We will work with our people to rebuild and restore, focusing in this phase on dignified shelter. We will also cooperate with the state, all organizations, and countries willing to assist Lebanon in making it even more beautiful than before.' Our national efforts will involve collaboration and dialogue with political forces that believe the homeland belongs to everyone, according to Sheikh Qassem who added, 'We will prioritize completing constitutional institutions, particularly ensuring the timely election of a president.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2281336	2024-11-29T10:50:04-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-05116920017329061932.jpg
Israeli Enemy Violates Ceasefire, Opens Fire at Civilians in Sout...	Since the ceasefire took into effect early Wednesday, the Israeli enemy has been repeatedly violating its stipulations, opening fire at civilians and destroying properties. The Zionist violations have been accompanied by arrogant media publications which try to impose a new reality that contradicts with the Israeli military failure in face of Hezbollah fighters during the war. The Lebanese government that signed the agreement is requested today to put an end to these violations before the enemy goes too far, which entails the Lebanese people to move again in face of the Zionist aggression. In this regard, the Israeli occupation forces opened fire at a funeral in Khiam, pushing its tanks to the western side of the town. The Israeli enemy also cut off olive trees and bulldozed roads in Kfar Kila in the context of imposing a new reality on the border region.

Terrorist Groups Move in Syria’s North just after Israeli Failure...	The Syrian army, backed by the Russian air force and allies, have been confronting a major attack launched by the terrorist groups on the territories it controls in Aleppo Countryside since Wednesday. The militant move comes immediately after the ceasefire in South Lebanon took into effect as Israeli invasion due to the fierce resistance of Hezbollah fighters, which raises several questions about the Zionist role in pushing the takfiris to operate in Syria again in an attempt to undermine its support to the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon. Well-informed sources mentioned that the militant offensive was almost repelled, adding that the Syrian military managed even to contain the terrorist move and launch a counterstrike. The terrorist offensive launched by the takfiri groups in Aleppo western countryside represents a major violation of the ceasefire agreement concluded in 2020 in accordance with Astana talks. The Syrian Army announced in a statement that its military units repelled a major attack launched by the terrorist groups in the countryside of Aleppo and Idlib, adding that the militant suffered much losses.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280566	2024-11-28T12:54:49-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-003734500173282726510.jpg

Egyptian Team Visits ‘Israel’ to Present ‘Comprehensive Vision’ f...	An Egyptian security delegation is reportedly expected to arrive in Tel Aviv in the coming hours in an effort to reach a Gaza captive and ceasefire deal. According to Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar, the Cairo officials are expected to present a 'comprehensive vision' for an agreement, amid optimism that a deal can be reached in the wake of ceasefire with Lebanon. The report said the plan calls for a truce that will initially last a month or two and will see the gradual release of Israeli captives held in Gaza, with first priority given to older captives or those who are sick. Concurrently, 'broader and longer discussions will take place, without military pressure on the ground,' the report added. Egyptian officials will request that Hamas be given a period of several days after the truce begins in order to provide a list of the living hostages. The plan would also see the Rafah Border Crossing between Egypt and Gaza quickly returned to operation, under the supervision of the Palestinian Authority, with Egyptian oversight. ‘Israel’ would be given, according to the report, the right to veto those crossing to Egypt, with Cairo guaranteeing it will secure a Palestinian commitment that Hamas will not be allowed to control either the crossing or the Strip 'during the coming period.' The deal would also see an increase in humanitarian aid for Gaza, and medications would enter the Strip for the hostages that need, Al-Akhbar added. The report also said that ‘Israel’ will initially be permitted to maintain its military positions within Gaza, but without carrying out operations. Israeli media also reported the visit, with Israeli Channel 12 saying a team from the Egyptian intelligence will visit Tel Aviv on Thursday. The Times of Israel also cited Al-Akhbar report, adding that: 'While not mentioned in the report, the potential deal is also assumed to include the release of Palestinian prisoners.' Earlier on Wednesday families of Israeli captives held for over a year in the Gaza Strip temporarily blocked the entrance to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Knesset office, demanding that he meet with them and promote a hostage deal. Relatives of Israeli captives held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip block the entrance to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Knesset office, in occupied Al-Quds (November 27, 2024). The protesters were removed by Knesset security. They then went down one floor and blocked the stairs leading to the faction wing of the building, where the various political parties hold meetings and press conferences Israeli media reported.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280170	2024-11-28T03:27:49-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-07819070017319274025.jpg
Resistance Unbreakable: Imam Khamenei Declares Israel’s Doom, Al-...	The Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, has asserted that the Israeli regime is doomed to perish from the West Asia region. Imam Khamenei stated that the ongoing anti-Israeli operations by regional resistance movements cannot be quelled. 'Al-Aqsa Storm cannot be quenched, and the usurping Zionist regime is destined for departure,' Khamenei's official Persian-language account wrote in a post on Wednesday, accompanied by an illustration of an Israeli tank buried half in the ground with a white flag protruding from its cannon. Leader: Israel destined for departure; al-Aqsa Storm can’t be quenched — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) November 28, 2024 The resistance movements, including Hamas from the Gaza Strip, Islamic Jihad, Lebanon's Hezbollah, and their counterparts in Iraq and Yemen, launched the 'Al-Aqsa Storm' operation last October after the Israeli regime began a genocidal war against the coastal enclave. The operation has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israeli troops and officers, as well as the destruction of a considerable amount of their advanced Western-funded equipment. Hezbollah's successful performance in the operation also forced the regime into approving a ceasefire deal with the movement, ending Tel Aviv's 13-month deadly aggression against Lebanon. In a statement, Hezbollah hailed the operation's success, stating that their fighters 'were able to bring down its (the enemy's) goals and defeat its army.' Hamas also praised Hezbollah's prowess, saying the ceasefire deal had shattered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 'illusion' of reshaping West Asia by force. Khamenei's remarks come after he called for the prosecution of all Israeli political and military officials for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and demanded the death sentence for Netanyahu. Regarding the ceasefire agreement, Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Esmail Baghaei announced that Iran welcomed the cessation of Israeli aggression against Lebanon, reiterating its steadfast support for the Lebanese government, people, and Resistance. Baghaei emphasized Iran's commitment to peace in the region and highlighted its ongoing diplomatic efforts to halt hostilities in Gaza and Lebanon over the past 14 months, which have killed tens of thousands and caused widespread destruction of vital infrastructure. 'The result of the warmongering and crimes committed by the Zionist regime, fully supported by the United States and certain European governments, is the martyrdom of 60,000 innocent people, the wounding of 120,000 individuals, and the displacement of over 3.5 million oppressed people in Palestine and Lebanon,' Baghaei said.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280181	2024-11-28T03:25:49-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-081728400173279314410.jpg
