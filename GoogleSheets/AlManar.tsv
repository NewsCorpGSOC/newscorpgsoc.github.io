What’s Left of Sayyed Safeiddine Speech after Being Elected as Sa...	Here an image of what’s left of the speech written by martyr Sayyed Hashem Safeiddine after being elected as successor of Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah. Below is the text of the speech: 'Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent example for whoever has hope in Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah often. When the believers saw the enemy alliance, they said, 'This is what Allah and His Messenger had promised us. The promise of Allah and His Messenger has come true.' And this only increased them in faith and submission. Among the believers are men who have proven true to what they pledged to Allah.1 Some of them have fulfilled their pledge ˹with their lives˺, others are waiting ˹their turn˺. They have never changed ˹their commitment˺ in the least.' (Al-Ahzab, 21-22-23) First, I extend heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs and sympathy with those who have injured over their sufferings due to the Israeli aggression on our country, asking Allah to reward their patience. I address you O’ dear ones in our beloved country Lebanon as well as Arab and Muslim countries. I address the free people of the world and all those who refuse oppression and fight the tyrants. There is no doubt that sadness and grief dominate our hearts over crimes and massacres committed by the Israeli enemy. Such crimes have been carried out amid US cover and international silence that reaches the extent of incitation for nearly a year against the people of Gaza, and the Palestinian people in general, all the way to Lebanon, which has been subjected to these hideous and unjust attacks. Our grief is deep, great and indescribable for the loss of our leader, our master and our inspiration, our Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. His eminence led this blessed and victorious resistance, which achieved unprecedented victories and accomplished great events that were and will remain immortal, thanks to his leadership, wisdom and courage, and above all, due to his faith, sincerity and readiness to sacrifice everything he had for the sake of the cause. This cause, he believed in and has been committed to, along with his people, his family and the families of the martyrs and the wounded.' What's left of Sayyed Hashem Safeiddine's speech. Sayyed Safeiddine was to deliver the speech at the same day when he was martyred in an Israeli strike on Mraijeh area, in Beirut’s southern suburb, Dahiyeh, on October 4, a week after the massive strikes that killed Sayyed Nasrallah. Hundreds of thousands, including figures and activists from all over the world, bid farewell to the Hezbollah secretary generals last Sunday, in a mass funeral at Beirut's Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2349558	2025-02-26T03:16:54-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-02758960017405682681.jpg

West Bank: Israeli Occupation Forces Intensify Aggression, Demoli...	The Israeli occupation continues its aggressive campaign in the northern West Bank, with the city of Tulkarm and its adjoining camp experiencing heightened hostilities for the 31st consecutive day. The situation has escalated significantly in the nearby Nour Shams camp, which has been under siege for 18 days.

Authorities claim the demolitions are necessary to clear the way for a new road linking the camp's agency area to the Balawneh neighborhood, but residents are left grappling with the destruction of their homes and the surrounding community infrastructure.

As the Israeli siege continues, calls for assistance grow louder, yet access for relief crews is being obstructed by Israeli occupation forces, further compounding the dire humanitarian situation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2349393	2025-02-26T01:35:54-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-04260240017375344106.jpeg
Israeli Occupation Forces Intensify Strikes on Syria During Groun...	Israeli aircraft launched a wave of intense aerial strikes across Syria, coinciding with a ground invasion into key towns within the Quneitra countryside and the Daraa governorate. The overnight aggression targeted critical areas, including Daraa, al-Suweida, and the outskirts of Damascus. Witnesses reported seeing Israeli drones actively surveilling the Quneitra province, while Israeli warplanes executed bombings in the strategic al-Kiswah region and circled over the capital. Israeli warplanes have launched multiple airstrikes across southern Syria, hours after the conclusion of the Syrian National Dialogue Conference, which had issued a statement condemning Israel’s military actions. — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) February 25, 2025 Local media noted that at least six loud explosions echoed through the Suweida countryside, signaling the extent of the airstrikes. Israeli media sources claimed that military infrastructure, including weapons caches belonging to the former Syrian regime, were destroyed in the barrage. Furthermore, a Syrian Arab Army camp in the eastern Daraa countryside was reportedly among the targets hit. Israeli Security Minister Israel Katz confirmed the offensive, stating, 'The Israeli Air Force is striking hard in southern Syria,' emphasizing that the government 'will not allow Southern Syria to turn into Southern Lebanon.' Since the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime, Israeli occupation forces have launched an unprecedented military campaign, decimating strategic defenses including cruise missile systems, ballistic missile systems, and air defense mechanisms, alongside significant damage to the Syrian naval fleet and research facilities. This latest aggression is part of an ongoing ground offensive aimed at securing additional territory, specifically within the strategic Mount Hermon region and other southern provinces. Reports indicate that the current Israeli advance in northern Quneitra and Daraa marks the deepest penetration into Syrian territory since the new regime took power, with objectives focused on complete control of southern Syria.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2349206	2025-02-25T23:45:40-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01888760017405559355.jpg
Israeli Drone Raid on Bekaa Leaves Casualties, Hezbollah Warns	Zionist drone raided late Tuesday the Shaara area in the eastern Mount Range above the town of Janta in Bekaa, leaving two martyrs and two injuries. Member of Loyalty to Resistance parliamentary bloc, Dr. Ibrahim Al-Moussawi, commented in a statement on the Zionist aggression, describing it as a serious violation and a blatant and explicit aggression that breaches the executive procedures of Resolution 1701. 'Once again in less than a month, the Israeli enemy forces are carrying out a criminal aggression deep inside Lebanese territory, which resulted in the martyrdom of two people and the injury of two others. This constitutes a serious violation and a blatant and explicit aggression that breaches the executive procedures of Resolution 1701, which places the responsible parties concerned and guarantors of the implementation of the agreement before their responsibilities in firmly confronting the enemy’s violations of Lebanese sovereignty.' MP Al-Moussaiw affirmed that his persistent and systematic escalation by the enemy without any serious and responsible action by the international guarantors shows their indifference or inability at best, and confirms the enemy’s disavowal of any serious obligations and its lack of respect for the international community as a whole. 'The Lebanese state, represented by the presidency, the government and the army, is requested to take immediate action by all available means to quickly put an end to the Zionist criminality and stop this ongoing aggression on the Lebanese and violation of the sovereignty of the state over its lands.' If the criminal attacks against Lebanon by the enemy continue without the international community taking deterrent punitive measures or condemning the enemy and obligating it to respect the approved agreements and understandings, it shall be considered an encouragement to it to continue its acts of aggression, according to MP Al-Mouusawi who added that this may turn to be an implicit acceptance and collusion with it in the policy of killing, destruction, bulldozing and violation of sovereignty, which is completely condemned and contradicts the simplest principles of respecting the sovereignty of states and protecting their peoples and properties. The Zionist border violations also included throwing flares at the outskirts of Naqoura and Alma Al-shaab.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2349151	2025-02-25T11:32:15-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00168520017405119261.jpg

Five Occupation Posts in South Lebanon Source of Fear: Israeli Ci...	The Israeli media covered up the issue of the northern settlements few days before the government decision to return the displaced settlers takes effect, highlighting the large-scale case of confusion and fear. Around 100 thousand settlers were evacuated from the North when Hezbollah started its border battle against the Zionist enemy in support of Gaza on October 8, 2023. March 1 is the set date for the return of the settlers who cast doubts on the government intention to rebuild the houses and infrastructure facilities in the northern settlements which lie zero to five kilometers away from Lebanon borders. The Zionist failure to eradicate Hezbollah threat during the all-out war on Lebanon exacerbated the situation of the northern settlements which witnessed a massive destruction caused by Hezbollah missiles. Talia Corland, a settler from Al-Manara settlement, said: 'I lost my house, and darkness prevails at night in Al-Manara. We are not sure if the government would help in the reconstruction of the many destroyed buildings.' Kiryat Shmona settler, Shern Ohaion, said that the Israeli government obliged her to return to the settlement despite her rejection and concerns about the future of her children in the area. Avichai stern, Kiryat Shmona mayor, said that the Israeli government is trying to return the settlers at any expense, wondering what would happen when the Zionist troops complete their withdrawal from Lebanon. The Israeli media indicated that discussions run by various circles in the Zionist entity estimated that Hezbollah would not give an open-ended chance for the Lebanese government to seek diplomatically the Israeli withdrawal. i24 Channel mentioned that Hezbollah would try to target the five Israeli occupation posts in South Lebanon and that no one know when that would happen. The Zionist media affirmed that the US administration has approved the Israeli occupation of the five posts in South Lebanon, adding that the Americans have granted 'Israel' the permission to strike any target inside Lebanon. It is worth noting that the Zionist enemy completed its withdrawal from South Lebanon on February 18, 2025, keeping five occupation positions in Mount Jal Al-Deir (Aitaroun), Al-Hamames Hill (Al-Khiam), Mount Blat (between Ramyah and Marwaheen), Houla-Markaba Main Road, and Al-Labbouneh Hill (Outskirts of Naqoura and Alma Al-Shaab).	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2349019	2025-02-25T09:52:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07987610017405059369.png
Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah’s Funeral: A Farewell of Defiance, A Lega...	A massive sea of mourners flooded the streets of Beirut on the historic day of February 23, 2025, honoring the funeral of martyred Hezbollah Secretaries-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Sayyed Hashem Safieddine. The location: Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium. The numbers: over 1.4 million people from more than 80 countries, including numerous Arab and international delegations. They gathered to pay their final respects and express unwavering loyalty to the resistance and its fallen leader. Amid emotional scenes, the stadium and surrounding areas echoed with thunderous chants as clenched fists were raised toward the sky, reaffirming the covenant of loyalty. It was a moment where grief merged with resolve, and sorrow stood hand in hand with strength. Beirut’s Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium buzzes with devoted mourners (Feb. 23, 2025) 'Today, we bid farewell to an exceptional, historic leader, a national, Arab, and Islamic figure who has become a symbol of freedom for oppressed people around the world,' Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem told the massive crowd. He added, 'This gathering is an unparalleled expression of loyalty in Lebanon’s history.' 'Sayyed Hassan’s steadfast commitment to the resistance centered on Palestine and Jerusalem, and he played a pivotal role in revitalizing this cause, sacrificing his life on the front lines,' Qassem emphasized. 'We will honor his legacy, continue on this path, and uphold his will—no matter the cost.' The Hezbollah leader also stated that 'Israel' 'can no longer sustain its occupation and aggression,' declaring that the resistance is 'entering a new phase—one that requires new tools, strategies, and approaches.' Sheikh Qassem underscored that the armed resistance remains strong, ever-ready, and firmly rooted in international law—its legitimacy unshakable by any foreign power. He insisted that Israel must withdraw from all occupied territories, affirming that the resistance is 'written in blood, not ink on paper.' Addressing the enemy, he declared, 'Writhe in your anger. The resistance stands strong and unwavering.' The event drew numerous political, diplomatic, and religious figures from Lebanon and beyond, reflecting broad international participation. Among the attendees were Lebanese officials, including Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, as well as representatives of President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam. A high-profile Iranian delegation, led by Speaker Mohammad Qalibaf and Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, took part, along with a four-member team representing Iran’s Supreme Leader Sayyed Ali Khamenei. Iraqi and Yemeni delegations also played a prominent role, reaffirming their solidarity with Lebanon and its resistance. Palestinian resistance factions participated to renew their commitment to the struggle against Israeli occupation. Additionally, revolutionaries and supporters from countries spanning from Indonesia to Venezuela attended, demonstrating global solidarity with Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and the broader resistance movement. The blessed coffins of the two Secretary-Generals carried on a hearse made it through the great crowd, relaying messages unspoken by Sheikh Naim. Messages from the souls of millions to their enemy, who arrogantly laid claim to the sky in same fighter jets that committed the heinous act of murdering the two great leaders and their comrades in the midst of a crowded residential area still bustling with the same people that then stood in the stadium to tell them thus: 'We, without him, yet remain.' The message given by the people is one echoed by the many sacrifices that several groups of them gave, groups who were honored in the great event. First, without marking any sort of hierarchy, came the families of the thousands of martyrs that transcended to the beyond in this battle and all the battles that came before it. Their shoulders, adorned with sashes honoring their sacrifices glinted in the center of the stadium underneath the bright sun, signaling their acceptance of Allah’s great will and their readiness to continue giving all of what is most dear to them for this beautiful journey. Second, the many wounded fighters and civilians who literally and figuratively sacrificed life and limb to be there in that moment. Many of whom had their eyesight, hands and fingers stolen by the treachery of the enemy during the pager and handheld radio attacks that injured and killed both civilian and soldier. They, with eyes and hands concealed behind bands emblazoned with the revolutionary mottos of Karbala and the great Imam, Imam Hussein (as), were there to say that they would fight even if the battle took each of their five senses away.

In the Shia religion, respect for martyrs and veterans is an important principle pic.twitter.com/qwBAKOU0Aa — Abshar Tasnim (@Abshar_Tasnim2) February 24, 2025 Third, the warriors who faced the enemy at every valley, mountain peak, fjord and ravine stomped their boots against the ground in defiance as they carried their dearly beloved leader for one final time to his resting place. In their unwavering stance, in their covered faces and stern brows, in the folds of their tempered bodies lies the message they carry to the enemy and the responsibility they inherit from the great Sayyed Hasan and his comrades who came before him, a message of immortal vigilance over the people they are entrusted with. National, international, continental, heroic and self-sacrificial were the titles of the directives that littered the inside and outside of the stadium, messages from the masses and from individuals who dared not to miss those moments for the world. Moments which they all fought, struggled, traveled and patiently waited for, now a reality they all experienced together. As the sun set over Beirut, the funeral of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Sayyed Hashem Safieddine became more than a moment of mourning—it was a declaration of resilience, unity, and defiance. From Lebanon to the farthest reaches of the world, the presence of millions affirmed that the resistance is not tied to a single leader but is an undying force carried in the hearts of those who believe in its cause. The chants, the vows, and the steadfast gazes of the attendees sent a resounding unified message: the struggle continues, the legacy endures, and the path carved in sacrifice will not be abandoned. In the face of adversity, the resistance stands unshaken, ready for the battles ahead, with the spirit of its fallen leaders guiding its every step.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2348997	2025-02-25T07:43:34-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01555610017403255724.jpg

The funeral ceremonies then began and included a scout show, and the participants organized a massive march led by the banner bearers, the scout musical groups, and the bearers of the honorable coffin. The mourning procession passed through the streets of Deir Qanoun town as the mourners chanted slogans which reiterate commitment to the Resistance and Karbala path. 'Death to Israel', 'Death to America', 'Far from us is disgrace' were among many slogans chanted by the participants in the funeral. A ceremony was held to honor the martyr Sayyed Al-Hashemi, where a group of the Mujahideen of the Islamic Resistance and the Imam Mahdi (may God hasten his reappearance) Scouts took the oath and pledged allegiance in front of the holy coffin, Sheikh Mohammad Hasan Akhtari, representative of Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei, delivered a speech in which he explained that his participation in the funeral ceremony of Hashemite Martyr came upon the assignment of His Eminence Imam Khamenei to share with Lebanon and the Resistance this big loss of the two dear martyrs Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and Sayyed Hashem Safieddine. He said: 'We have come to convey to you the condolences of Imam Khamenei, his emotions and feelings, and the condolences of the Iranian people,' reiterating the support of the Islamic Republic of Iran as well as its government, people and resistance to Lebanon and its people as well as resistance. Sheikh Akhtari said: 'This is our path to God,' stressing that 'the resistance will triumph with God’s help, for this is a divine promise.' After that, the funeral prayers were performed for the pure body of the martyr Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, led by the Imam of the town of Deir Qanoun Al-Nahr, Sheikh Ibrahim Qasir, before the Hashemite martyr was buried next to the martyrs who preceded him.

Member of Loyalty to Resistance bloc, Dr. Hasan Fadlallah, affirmed that Martyr Sayyed Safieddine rejected all the proposals which urged him to leave the operations room, adding that his eminence insisted on the importance of the leader’s steadfastness.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2348326	2025-02-24T09:18:13-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-04710240017404174431.jpg

On the 37th day of the ceasefire in Gaza, the Israeli broadcasting authority quotes cabinet members as saying that Netanyahu intends to extend the first phase of the deal without moving to the second one in light of halting the release of the seventh batch of the Palestinian prisoners.

'Witkoff met on Saturday in Miami with Ron Dermer, the Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs, who is leading the Israeli negotiations team. It was the second meeting between the pair in 48 hours to discuss the second phase of the hostage deal.'

Outraged by the historical funeral of the Master of the Nation's Martyrs Martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and Hashemite Martyr Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, the Israeli enemy attempted to intimidate the sea of mourners in Beirut by flying a swarm of war jets at low altitude over Beirut. In response, the mourners, who are also the followers of the brave and wise leader martyr Sayyed Nasrallah, challenged the Israeli arrogance and chanted the slogans: 'Death to Israel'. 'Death to America', and 'Far from us is disgrace.' Yedioth Ahronoth commented, 'Israeli war jets flew over the funeral location, but the attendees chanted: 'Death to Israel', 'Death to America', 'Labbaik Ya Nasrallah' [We are at your service O' Nasrallah].' Huge numbers of mourners flocked into Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium and the surrounding areas in Beirut and Dahiyeh to mourn Hezbollah's two chiefs Martyr Sayyed Nasrallah and Martyr Sayyed Safieddine. The funeral represents a major sign of victory and steadfastness for Hezbollah as the enemy as well as its puppets in Lebanon as well as some Arab countries tried to promote the idea that the Islamic Resistance has collapsed. However, Hezbollah command showed unmatched bravery in the war, sacrificing two Secretary Generals and a considerable number of commanders in a very short period without showing any sign of collapse. Nonetheless, the systems of command and control remained effective, and the resistance fighters kept bravely fighting in the border region throughout the 66 days of the war.

Hezbollah’s Sheikh Qassem Promises Sayyed Nasrallah: Resistance W...	In a moment of historic significance, Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem addressed the massive crowds mourning the martyrdom of Sacred Martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and his companion, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine. Speaking via video screens at Beirut’s Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium, Sheikh Qassem delivered a powerful speech, pledging that the resistance would endure despite all sacrifices. Saluting the throngs of mourners, he declared, 'O’ most honorable people, you have upheld the covenant!' His eminence emphasized Sayyed Nasrallah’s pivotal role in leading the resistance to the nation and uniting the nation with the resistance. A Tribute to Hezbollah's Great MartyrSayyed Nasrallah, Sayyed Hashem Sheikh Qassem honored Hezbollah martyred secretary general Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah as 'a historic and unparraleld leader—a beacon for the free people of the world, a beloved figure among the resistance fighters, the oppressed, and the downtrodden.' 'He was a man who led the resistance to the nation and the nation to the resistance, with his unwavering focus always on Palestine and Al-Quds,' his eminence added. Sheikh Qassem highlighted that Sayyed Nasrallah assumed the presidency of Hezbollah’s Executive Council in 1989 before becoming Secretary General in 1992, a position he held until the day of his martyrdom. 'This great man was wholly devoted to Islam and Wilayah to Ahlul Bayt (AS). He was sincere, loyal, compassionate, generous, humble, resolute, courageous, wise, strategic, and deeply beloved by the resistance fighters.' A Solemn Pledge of Loyalty In a heartfelt vow to the martyred leader, Sheikh Qassem pledged, 'We will honor your will. We will continue on this path, even if we are all martyred and even if our homes are destroyed over our heads.' He further praised Sayyed Nasrallah’s unwavering commitment to the Palestinian cause, affirming: 'Sayyed Nasrallah's contribution to reviving the Palestinian cause was immense, and we will remain steadfast in this covenant.' Sheikh Qassem also extended his condolences and congratulations to the families of the two great martyrs, the families of all resistance martyrs, and their supporters. Resistance and the Struggle for Palestine Reaffirming Hezbollah’s unwavering stance on Palestine, Sheikh Qassem asserted that 'Palestine is our right and our compass. We support its liberation and will confront Trump’s displacement scheme. Lebanon is the final homeland for its people, and we are its people.' 'The sacrifices we have made are unparalleled, just as the level of Israeli criminality in Gaza and the region is unprecedented. The battle to support Gaza is part of our belief in liberating Palestine.' 'The Israeli enemy aimed to eliminate the resistance in both Gaza and Lebanon, but the scale of sacrifices was immense, and the resilience was unparalleled—this is a great achievement.' A New Phase Sheikh Qassem emphasized that the resistance remains strong in numbers and capabilities. 'Our people remain strong. Now, we have entered a new phase—one with different tools and methods,' his eminence declared. Sheikh Qassem sent a direct and clear message to Washington saying, 'Your project is doomed. You will not achieve through politics what you failed to accomplish on the battlefield.' Israeli Occupation Blatant Ceasefire Violations Addressing the ongoing battle along Lebanon’s southern border, Sheikh Qassem revealed that despite deploying over 75,000 soldiers, the Israeli enemy has failed to enter Lebanese territory. His eminence accused the Israeli enemy of repeatedly violating the ceasefire agreement while reaffirming Hezbollah’s commitment to it. 'We are facing a brutal occupation and relentless aggression. Yet, the resistance remains strong and unwavering. The inevitable victory is coming,' his eminence stated. Sheikh Qassem made a firm promise to Lebanese prisoners held by the Israeli occupation, vowing, 'We will not abandon you. We will exert all necessary pressure to secure your freedom.' Sheikh Qassem also outlined Hezbollah’s strategic approach to the confrontation. 'We have taken a clear step: the Lebanese state must assume its responsibilities. As for us, we will act according to circumstances—we will open fire when we see fit, and we will exercise patience when we see fit,' his eminence declared. Defying US Pressure, Challenging Sovereignty Advocates Sheikh Qassem directly addressed the United States, warning that its schemes would fail. He urged Washington to abandon its conspiracies, emphasizing that patience should not be mistaken for weakness, as Hezbollah would never accept occupation in silence. Turning to Lebanese advocates of sovereignty, he questioned their silence in the face of Israeli and US aggression. He challenged them to reflect on their inaction, asking, 'Where were you when an agreement was possible? Why do we hear no condemnation from you against the Israeli enemy?' Hezbollah’s Unwavering Commitment Reaffirming Hezbollah’s ideological roots, Sheikh Qassem declared the party’s allegiance to the path of resistance, tracing its lineage to Imam Khamenei, Imam Khomeini, Imam Sayyed Musa Sadr, Sayyed Abbas Al-Mousawi, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, Hajj Qassem Soleimani, and Hajj Imad Mughniyeh. He reiterated that resistance remains the foundation and will persist as long as occupation continues. At the same time, Hezbollah remains committed to building a strong and just Lebanese state under the Taif Agreement, upholding national unity, civil peace, and inclusive governance. He also reaffirmed Hezbollah’s unbreakable alliance with the Amal Movement, warning against attempts to divide them: 'Our bond is sealed with blood. We stand as one in position, choices, and politics.' A Final Farewell to Sayyed Nasrallah Concluding his speech, Sheikh Qassem bid a final farewell to the martyred leaders, saying, 'Rest in God's peace, O Sayyed Nasrallah, alongside your loyal companion, Sayyed Safieddine. Rest with the prophets and the martyrs&#8230; This is a day of God, a day like the one of Imam Hussain (AS), O' grandsons of Imam Hussain.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2347226	2025-02-23T05:34:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00040920017403174178.jpg

‘Israel’ Delays Release of Palestinian Prisoners After Hamas Hand...	The Israeli government has reportedly postponed the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, despite a recent prisoner swap with Hamas. According to reports, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to delay the release of the seventh group of Palestinian prisoners, citing the need for further consultations 'based on the goal of returning all of our hostages - the living and the dead.' The decision comes after Hamas handed over six Israeli captives to ‘Israel’ on Saturday, as part of the initial 42-day phase of the ceasefire agreement that took effect on January 19th. Under the agreement, 33 Israeli captives were to be released in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. However, with four Israeli captives still remaining to be released in the first phase, Netanyahu has now decided to hold off on the planned release of 602 Palestinian prisoners, pending further discussions. 🛑Breaking | The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office: 'We have decided to suspend the release of Palestinian prisoners until we ensure the liberation of the next hostages without provocative ceremonies.' pic.twitter.com/8UpzlY3UMJ — Eye on Palestine (@EyeonPalestine) February 22, 2025 The delay has angered the families of the Palestinian prisoners, who are now organizing protests to demand that Israel honor the terms of the ceasefire deal and proceed with the planned prisoner release.

He warned that the catastrophic situation in Gaza requires 'mediators to pressure the occupation to implement the humanitarian protocol and provide our people with shelter and relief supplies.' The Palestinian resistance group has previously warned that it could delay the release of Israeli captives if the Israeli occupation military violates the ceasefire deal.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2346027	2025-02-22T22:44:44-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-067688600174004439410.jpeg

Six Days in War Crowned Hashemite Martyr’s Decades of Hezbollah I...	The martyrdom of the great Islamic fighting leader, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, represents the pinnacle of sacrifice and a beacon for generations to continue on the path of resistance, the path walked by the great martyr leader His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah …' On October 23, Hezbollah issued the statement which eulogizes the second Secretary General Hashemite Martyr Sayyed Hashem Saffiedine in face of the barbaric Israeli war on Lebanon in 2024. Rarely do organizations, governments and various public bodies have their leaders on the top of sacrifice. Hezbollah has been presenting the brilliant sample of leaders who reject to hide behind in the rear lines of the military confrontation. The challenge of the martyrdom of Sayyed Nasrallah on September 27 was an extravagantly heavy load on Hezbollah command leading a historical war of defense against the Israeli war on Lebanon. Announcing the decision to hold the funeral of the two great martyrs on February 23, 2025, Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem said that Sayyed Safieddine would be mourned in his capacity as a Secretary General. Sheikh Qassem highlighted that after being elected to the position just four days following Sayyed Nasrallah’s martyrdom, Sayyed Safieddine was martyred on October 3, 2024. Thus, Martyr Sayyed Safieddine assumed the military responsibility to maintain the steadfastness of the resistance in the confrontation with the enemy by ensuring the missile fire. The grave danger did not lead the new commander to escape or hide in a safe position. His eminence insisted on leading the Islamic Resistance from the alternative operations chamber after the targeting the basic one and the martyrdom of Sayyed Nasrallah. Sayyed Safieddine had six days to lead the resistance before the treacherous Israeli warplanes targeted the alternative operations chamber. Member of Loyalty to Resistance bloc, Dr. Hasan Fadlallah, affirmed that Martyr Sayyed Safieddine rejected all the proposals which urged him to leave the operations room, adding that his eminence insisted on the importance of the leader's steadfastness. Institutional Resistance The Hashemite Martyr scribed numerous stories of success in the domain of Hezbollah's institutional resistance being the chief of the Party's Executive |Council, concerned with the social and economic institutions affiliated with Hezbollah. Hezbollah's main doctrine was based on protecting the people and securing their basic needs. Thus the Party struggled to attach the victory of the military resistance to a success in the domain of civil service. In this regard, Martyr Sayyed Safieddine followed the path of the martyred Secretary General of Hezbollah Sayyed Abbas Al-Moussawi, inspecting the poor neighborhoods in Beirut's Dahiyeh. On the basis of securing the people's needs, Martyr Sayyed Safieddine performed proficiently as the head of Hezbollah civil institutions in the fields of medicine, education, and finance. During his tenure, Hezbollah institutions witnessed a remarkable development, especially the medical sector which managed to successfully cope with the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in Lebanon. Upon the escalation of the economic siege on Lebanon in 2019, Hezbollah established Al-Sajjad cooperatives with a discount card that helps break the goods monopoly and provide the underpaid citizens with the needed commodities amid the great traces of Martyr Sayyed Safieddine. Educationally, Martyr Sayyed Safieddine contributed to the huge leap of Al-Mahdi Schools and the establishment of Al-Maaref University which also showed a steady and fast progress in the academic performance in Lebanon. Martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and Martyr Sayyed Hashem Safieddine attend the opening of Maaref University in 2015 The educated thinker and religious scholar spent half of 62-year lifetime fighting in defense of the Islamic Resistance and securing the needs of its supporters. The Hashemite martyr rejected to escape at the hardest moment of the 2024 Israeli war on Lebanon, showing unmatched bravery. This type of leaders that Hezbollah is proud of having continuously crowning the great jihadi journey, which descends from Karbala of Imam Hussein (A.S.) till either martyrdom or victory.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2345565	2025-02-22T07:58:03-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00328420017402398482.jpg

Hamas has, however, refuted these allegations, calling them 'pure lies' and part of a 'war of extermination.' As the first phase of the exchange deal progresses, the negotiations for the second phase are ongoing, with the United States setting a two-week goal for Hamas and the Israeli occupation to reach an agreement. The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has stressed its commitment to the ceasefire agreement, emphasizing that the reconstruction of Gaza must be done with national consensus and without external interference.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2345312	2025-02-22T01:58:40-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-09247860017402182992.jpg
Trump Was Ready to Stop Military Aid to Ukraine over Zelensky’s I...	US President Donald Trump was reportedly so fed up with Vladimir Zelensky’s recent impudence that he was ready to pull US military assistance from Ukraine, three US officials close to the situation told Axios. Six administration officials told Axios that Zelensky also rubbed Vice President Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz the wrong way with his recent behavior. The portal's sources in the White House explained what has caused America's about-face on Zelensky. Thus, he refused to sign an agreement with the United States on rare earth metals and, as Trump noted, 'was rude' to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant during his visit to Kiev. At a security conference in Munich, Zelensky 'surprised' Vance and Rubio by claiming he could not personally approve the rare earth metals deal, publicly refusing to pursue it. Zelensky caused even greater indignation among the US administration with his ill-advised comments about the Russian-American consultations in Riyadh and his assertion that Ukraine should be at the negotiating table. Trump later called Zelensky a dictator, saying that his popularity with Ukrainians had tanked to 4%, and that elections should be held in Ukraine. The last straw, according to the portal's sources, was when the head of the Kiev regime said that Trump had become a 'victim of Russian disinformation,' which the White House considered an insult. In an interview with the National Pulse edition Vance slammed Zelensky for making derogatory comments publicly, noting that this is not a good way to deal with President Trump. On February 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin noted that Kiev's hysteria about its absence at the Russia-US negotiations was inappropriate, since Moscow and Washington had bilateral issues to discuss	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2345180	2025-02-21T13:36:17-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2020/12/manar-07429450016081960808.jpg
Hezbollah Will Neither Abandon Resistance Nor Let Lebanon Return ...	Deputy Chief of Hezbollah Executive Council Sheikh Ali Daamoush stressed that the Resistance Party rejects Lebanon's subjection to US-Israeli dictates and threats to strike Beirut's airport as well as vital facilities. Delivering Friday sermon, Sheikh Daamoush called on the Lebanese government to tackle the Iranian flights file as it pertains to Lebanon's sopvereignty and dignity. 'US-Israeli ban on the landing of the Iranian flights at Beirut's airport confiscates the Lebanese decision, blatantly intervenes in Lebanon's international relations, and paves way for more dictates which may never end,' his eminence said. Sheikh Daamoush also underlined Hezbollah would neither accept Israeli occupation of even an inch of the Lebanese territory nor abandon the resistance path which would be the response to the Zionist aggression. Hezbollah official underscored that Hezbollah will never let Lebanon return to the time of weakness, stressing that the nation has the right to defend itself by all means and at whatever cost. 'We are powerful thanks to our faith, will, determination and the bravery of our resistance, army and people.' Sheikh Daamoush also affirmed, 'We are invited on Sunday to attend the funeral of an exceptional, historic leader in a civilized scene.' The funeral will be neither a referendum to measure the popular support for the resistance whose role obtains legitimacy when the occupation exists, nor a way to restore prestige because it has not been lost, according to Sheikh Daamoush. Sheikh Daamoush confirmed that the funeral will be attended by the loyal supporters of the resistance who will reiterate commitment to the path of the martyred leader who spent his honorable life defending Lebanon, its sovereignty and national dignity, achieved victories, thwarted the enemy’s goals, held the cause of Palestine and the causes of the nation, and ascended as a martyr all the way to Al-Quds, truly deserving the title: Master of the Martyrs of the Nation. The day when Hezbollah martyred leaders Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and Sayyed Hashem Safeiddine will be laid to rest won’t be forgotten by the free people of the world, the committee tasked with organizing the funeral announced on Friday.

Al-Qanou stressed that Hamas remains 'committed to the ceasefire agreement as long as the Israeli occupation is committed to it.'

However, the talks on the second phase, which were supposed to begin on February 3, have yet to materialize. Netanyahu's Refusal to Negotiate Leads to Captives' Deaths The stalled negotiations come amid growing public outrage over the return of four Israeli captives, including a mother and her two children, who were killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza during the 15-month war. Hamas has accused Netanyahu of being responsible for their deaths, stating that the 'criminal Netanyahu is crying today over the bodies of his prisoners who returned to him in coffins.' The opposition has also blamed Netanyahu for the captives' deaths, arguing that he stalled the prisoner swap for months to avoid jeopardizing his fragile coalition, which includes far-right ministers pushing for the continuation of the war in Gaza. The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and his former minister of military affairs Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. Additionally, the International Court of Justice is considering accusations that Israel committed genocide in its war on Gaza. As the ceasefire talks remain in limbo, the people of Gaza continue to grapple with the aftermath of the devastating conflict, which claimed the lives of at least 48,319 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured 111,749 others.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2344806	2025-02-21T02:25:51-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2016/09/manar-07632360014745454023-e1698484116887.jpeg

Three Bus Explosions Rock Occupied Tel Aviv, Triggering Panic Amo...	Three buses exploded on Thursday evening at different locations in the 'Bat Yam' settlement, south of the occupied city of 'Tel Aviv,' sending shockwaves across the Israeli entity. According to Israeli media, the 'Shin Bet' has launched an investigation into the suspected placement of explosive devices inside the buses, which reportedly caused the blasts. Zionist officials also confirmed the discovery of two additional unexploded devices. In response to the explosions, train services in Bat Yam were entirely suspended.

Hundreds of Resistance fighters from the military wings of Palestinian factions participated in the solemn event, which was attended by the commander of the Eastern Battalion of the al-Qassam Brigades in Khan Younis. According to reports, the Israeli media had initially reported that 'Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu withdrew his participation in the ceremony to receive the bodies of the four Israeli captives.' However, the Israeli commanders of the eastern and northern battalions in the Khan Younis Brigade, whom the army had claimed to have killed, were present at the ceremony.

The military spokesperson for the al-Quds, the military wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) movement, Abu Hamza, also announced the decision to release the remains of Lifshitz, asserting that Israeli forces intentionally killed him during the war on Gaza. In a statement, Hamas acknowledged that they had 'preserved the lives of the Israeli captives, provided them with what we could, and treated them humanely, but their army killed them along with their captors.' The movement stressed that 'the Zionist enemy army killed its prisoners by bombing their detention centers, and the Nazi occupation government bears full responsibility for repeatedly obstructing the exchange agreement.' The exchange process is expected to be completed next Saturday, with the release of six living Israeli captives and the freeing of over 600 Palestinian prisoners, including those serving life and long sentences, as well as those who were released in the 'Shalit deal' and later re-arrested.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2344091	2025-02-20T01:40:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-067688600174004439410.jpeg
Fierce Clashes Erupt as Israeli Occupation Forces Raid West Bank,...	The Israeli occupation forces (IOF) stormed several cities and refugee campsin the occupied west bank, resulting in deadly confrontations with Palestinian resistance fighters. The raids began in the city of Nablus, where the IOF descended upon the vicinity of the National Hospital, the eastern district, the Askar refugee camp, and the town of Beita. However, the IOF were met with fierce resistance, as Palestinian fighters detonated an improvised explosive device (IED) in the Askar camp, leading to an exchange of fire. Elsewhere, the IOF arrested several Palestinians, including liberated prisoner Salloum Jawde in Nablus and Jamil Abu Hashash in the Fawar refugee camp near Hebron. In Ramallah, a Palestinian woman was detained in the town of Kobar, while four others were arrested in the towns of Turmus Ayya and Burham. The IOF also stormed the al-Dheisheh refugee camp in Bethlehem, leaving behind a trail of destruction after raiding the home of Palestinian Mounir al-Jaafari, who is currently being sought by the occupation forces. The widespread crackdown has resulted in the forced displacement of an estimated 40,000 Palestinians from their homes across the West Bank, marking the highest recorded number since the occupation of the territories in 1967.

The raids continued in Nablus, where a 15-year-old boy was injured by Israeli gunfire during confrontations in the town of Beita, and in the village of Tell, where clashes erupted as the IOF stormed Palestinian homes.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2343970	2025-02-19T23:32:13-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-02065920017355558258.jpg
Israeli Occupation Forces Kill Three Palestinians in Northern Wes...	Israeli occupation forces Wednesday evening killed three Palestinians in Al-Far'a refugee camp, south of the occupied West Bank city of Tubas, according to security sources. They said that the occupation forces besieged and targeted a house in the refugee camp, firing missiles and gunfire toward it and killing three Palestinians. They added that the occupation forces were withholding their bodies. Meanwhile, medical sources said that following the withdrawal of Israeli forces, ambulance crews and paramedics entered the house and found body parts scattered along with traces of blood inside. The occupation forces barged their way into the camp to reinforce special forces who sneaked their way earlier into a house and fired ENERGA anti-tank missiles at it. 'Israel' has been launching a massive onslaught on the refugee camp for the 18th consecutive day, conducting house-to-house raids, forcing out the families, ransacking the houses, turning them into outposts, and causing the stock of foodstuff to run out. The enemy forces deliberately ploughed through infrastructure, destroying main water pipelines, leading to a water crisis and causing a power outage in parts of the town and the camp.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2343871	2025-02-19T13:35:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-05150850017400009048.png
Supreme Leader Says Iran’s Definite Policy is to Expand Ties with...	Leader of the Islamic Revolution Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei has said expanding ties with neighboring countries remains the 'definite policy' of the Islamic Republic, as he received Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in Tehran. The Qatari Emir arrived in Tehran earlier in the day on an official visit and sat down for talks with President Masoud Pezeshkian before meeting Ayatollah Khamenei. 'One of the policies announced by the administration of Mr. Pezeshkian is the expansion of ties with neighbors,' Ayatollah Khamenei said during the meeting, which was also attended by President Pezeshkian. He noted that the Pezeshkian administration has already taken good measures to enhance relations with neighboring countries, achieving some level of progress thus far. Ayatollah Khamenei expressed hope that the agreements reached earlier in the day between Iranian and Qatari officials would benefit both countries, enabling them to fulfill their 'neighborly duties' more effectively. In his remarks, the Leader emphasized that Iran considers Qatar a 'friendly and brotherly country,' despite some 'unclear and unresolved' matters, including the issue of frozen Iranian assets. Approximately $6 billion in Iranian funds remain frozen under U.S. sanctions and are currently held in a Qatari bank after being released by South Korea in September 2023. The Leader criticized the United States for obstructing the agreement to return the funds to Iran. 'We know that the U.S. is the main obstacle to the implementation of an agreement that had been reached in this regard,' he said, adding that Iran expects Qatar to resist pressure from Washington and return Iran’s assets. For his part, Qatar’s Emir expressed satisfaction with his meeting with Ayatollah Khamenei and praised the Leader for Iran’s support of the Palestinian people. He acknowledged the ongoing tensions in the West Asia region, saying regional countries should cooperate more to address the current situation. The Emir also referred to the agreements reached between Iran and Qatar, and said the two countries will soon establish a joint commission to increase the volume of bilateral trade. Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian held on Wednesday constructive talks with Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani who arrived in Tehran on a state visit to hold talks with Iranian officials in order to discuss regional issues and deepen bilateral relations between the two neighboring countries.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2343816	2025-02-19T11:19:40-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-057342900173999274110.jpg
Archbishop Hanna: Palestine is Loyal to Martyr Sayyed Nasrallah’s...	Archbishop Atallah Hanna, Archbishop of Sebastia for the Greek Orthodox in occupied Palestine delivered a message in eulogy of the Nation’s Master of Martyrs, Hezbollah Secretary-General His Eminence, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah. 'Dear beloved, in a few days, Lebanon will witness a great and exceptional event—the funeral of His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and the martyrs who were with him. From Al-Quds, we stand in reverence and honor for the sacrifices of His Eminence Sayyed Nasrallah, his companions, and his associates—those who stood with Palestine, defended Palestine, and paid a heavy price for Palestine. We are loyal to these sacrifices; all Palestinians are loyal to the sacrifices of His Eminence and his comrades,' he said. 'As we offer our condolences and send a message of sympathy from the heart of our sacred city, we affirm that we will never forget those who stood with Palestine and defended it in the darkest times and the most difficult circumstances. Today, there is a conspiracy against the Palestinian cause. Our enemies seek to displace our people and liquidate our cause, but Palestinians will not raise the flag of surrender. They remain steadfast in their rights, principles, and convictions. The word 'surrender' does not exist in our Palestinian vocabulary.' 'Dear beloved, we are all one family, one nation, standing against colonial projects that do not target Palestine alone but the entire nation. Our message has always been and will always be that Palestine is the compass. Those whose compass is Palestine are in the right place, and those whose compass is elsewhere are in the wrong place. We call upon them to correct their deviation and realign their compass in the right direction,' Archbishop Hanna added. 'Dear beloved, our message in these times is that we must be united as a nation—Christians, Muslims, and all sects and denominations. They want us to be fragmented and divided, to speak the language of sectarianism, and to be internally divided so that they can pass their projects under the well-known colonial strategy of 'divide and rule.' They seek to fragment us to facilitate their colonial plans that target Palestine and the entire nation.' 'We, Christians and Muslims in this East, will remain one nation. Our compass is Al-Quds, our cause is Palestine, and we must not allow anyone or any entity to advance their schemes aimed at further division and fragmentation. We are one family—this is how we were, and this is how we shall remain,' Archbishop Hanna concluded.

IRGC Busts Vast Espionage Network Linked to US, ‘Israel’ in North...	The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander of Iran's Mazandaran province has announced that intelligence services from the US, ‘Israel’, and other adversarial countries have been actively trying to infiltrate Iran using foreign nationals and frequent travelers as cover. IRGC provincial commander Brigadier General Siavash Moslemi announced the successful crackdown on Wednesday, stating that the operation not only foiled significant security threats but also prevented potential crises from unfolding. IRGC dismantles Israeli-US linked networks in northern Iran pic.twitter.com/yYZmstv9kJ — IRNA News Agency (@IrnaEnglish) February 19, 2025 According to Moslemi, intelligence services from the US, ‘Israel’, and other hostile nations have been actively attempting to infiltrate Iran by posing as foreign nationals and displaced persons. Many of these foreign agents were operating under the guise of commercial companies, cultural centers, and charities, seeking to collect classified data and establish influence networks within the country. However, IRGC forces were able to identify and dismantle the espionage cells through meticulous intelligence monitoring, the commander added. This latest takedown comes on the heels of other recent IRGC operations against foreign spy networks. In January, the elite force arrested members of a network involved in gathering information about sensitive Iranian facilities in Khuzestan province for a foreign intelligence agency. In December, the IRGC also apprehended an individual in Ardabil province on charges of affiliation with the spy agency of a neighboring country. Additionally, Iran's Intelligence Ministry announced in late October that it had dismantled a separatist group linked to the Israeli regime that was planning to infiltrate the country from Iraqi Kurdistan in order to incite street riots and carry out assassinations. One of the group's key members was killed, while two others were arrested, and their weapons were confiscated during the operation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2343442	2025-02-19T05:12:55-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00858110017399707694.jpg

Many Israeli Fathers and Mothers Will Cry Because of Five Posts i...	It is surely needless to recall that the Zionist entity has always evaded commitment to the resolutions of the legitimacy institutions in the world and the international laws since its very existence is illegitimate. The wicked essence of Zionism makes power the only way for the states and people affected by the Israeli barbarism to regain their rights. The resistance groups in Lebanon and Palestine have been a conspicuous instance. In the same context, the ceasefire agreement in South Lebanon, concluded on November 27, 2024, stipulates the full Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon. However, the Zionist enemy decided to keep five occupations posts within the Lebanese territories in South Lebanon after the extended withdrawal deadline on February 18. The Israeli occupation army alleged that the five posts will remain temporarily in an attempt to reduce the effects of the major breach of the agreement on Tel Aviv diplomatically. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun held an emergency meeting at the Baabda Presidential Palace with Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam to address the latest developments along Lebanon’s southern border and the escalating Israeli violations. The leaders reaffirmed Lebanon’s unified national stance, emphasizing the urgent need for Israeli occupation forces’ full withdrawal from occupied Lebanese territories in accordance with international treaties and UN resolutions, particularly Resolution 1701. They also reiterated Lebanon’s full commitment to the resolution in its entirety while condemning Israel’s repeated breaches of its provisions. Despite the five occupation posts, the residents of the southern towns of Yaroun, Maroun al-Ras, Blida, Mays al-Jabal, Houla, Markaba, Adaisseh, Kfar Kila, and al-Wazzani entered their villages and towns after the Israeli enemy had been defeated. Al-Manar reporter Ali Shoeib highlighted the grandiosity of the scene of the Zionist withdrawal and the residents' return to the border villages, stressing that the five occupation posts do not have any military significance. Shoeib added that the Israeli enemy wants the five posts to reassure the Zionist settlers before their scheduled return to the border settlements on March 1. However, Metula mayor told the settlements' displaced residents to avoid returning due to the security threats in the region. Israeli media outlets indicated that the settlers may not be reassured by the five occupation posts in South Lebanon, adding that they will likely see Hezbollah convoys near the borders soon. Maariv newspaper described the step of maintaining posts in South Lebanon as a strategic Israeli mistake, adding that many fathers and mothers will cry because of this move. It is worth noting that around 100 thousand settlers left northern Palestine because of Hezbollah attacks on Zionist targets in support of Gaza against the Israeli genocidal war. The Israeli media reports massive destruction of houses and infrastructure in the northern settlements because of Hezbollah fire.

‘Foolish’ American Plan for Gaza Will Lead Nowhere: Imam Khamenei	Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei says the United States’ 'foolish American plan' for Gaza will lead nowhere. Ayatollah Khamenei received the secretary-general of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement, Ziyad al-Nakhaleh, and his accompanying delegation in Tehran on Tuesday. The Leader congratulated the Palestinian resistance on their victory against Israel in Gaza, where the occupying regime has been forced to enter into a ceasefire agreement with Hamas after failing to dismantle the resistance groups, a chief objective of its genocidal war in the enclave. 'The great work of the leaders and fighters of the Palestinian resistance in creating unity and cohesion and steadfastness against the enemy, and moving the complex negotiations forward, along with the patience and perseverance of the (Palestinian) people, has brought honor to the resistance in the region,' Ayatollah Khamenei said. Ayatollah Khamenei noted that this victory has set 'a new benchmark' in resistance against the occupying regime. The Leader pointed out that the Israeli regime is now negotiating the release of its prisoners held in Gaza in exchange for a substantially larger number of Palestinian prisoners and with the same resistance groups that it had vowed to destroy going into the war. 'Currently, global public opinion is in favor of Palestine, and under these circumstances, no plan will succeed without the consent of the resistance and the people of Gaza,' he said. Ayatollah Khamenei was referring to a proposed plan by U.S. President Donald Trump to 'take over' Gaza after the enclave has been forcibly cleared of its more than two million residents. The plan has been widely rejected by both the Palestinians and the broader Arab world. During the meeting, Nakhalah congratulated Ayatollah Khamenei on the Palestinian victory and expressed gratitude for the Islamic Republic's continuous support of the resistance. 'The Palestinian resistance has, in fact, been at war with the United States and the West for the past year and a half,' he said. 'Despite the unequal balance of (military) power, the Palestinian resistance has been able to achieve great victories.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2342859	2025-02-18T07:40:41-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-06876130017398932317.jpg

Israeli occupation forces have intensified their military operations in the northern West Bank, inflicting casualties and detaining locals in the cities of Tulkarm and Nablus. According to eyewitness accounts, Israeli troops have tightened their siege on Tulkarm's eastern neighborhood, forcing residents to remain in their homes while raiding businesses and damaging infrastructure. Several Palestinians have also been detained at newly installed checkpoints on the roads connecting Tulkarm to nearby refugee camps.

This escalation is part of a broader Israeli occupation military campaign dubbed 'Operation Iron Wall' that was launched in January, targeting the Jenin area. The offensive has already displaced over 40,000 refugees from the Jenin, Nur Shams, and Al-Faraa camps, according to UNRWA. More than half of the 13,000 residents of the Nur Shams refugee camp have fled since the start of the Israeli operation on Saturday. UNRWA's Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini has warned that this displacement is the largest in the West Bank since 1967.

Baabda Presidential Meeting: Lebanon Asserts Right to All Means f...	Lebanese President Joseph Aoun held an emergency meeting at the Baabda Presidential Palace with Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam to address the latest developments along Lebanon’s southern border and the escalating Israeli violations. The leaders reaffirmed Lebanon’s unified national stance, emphasizing the urgent need for Israeli occupation forces' full withdrawal from occupied Lebanese territories in accordance with international treaties and UN resolutions, particularly Resolution 1701. They also reiterated Lebanon’s full commitment to the resolution in its entirety while condemning Israel’s repeated breaches of its provisions. Lebanese Army’s Role in Defending Sovereignty The participants highlighted the essential role of the Lebanese Army, affirming its complete readiness to assume full responsibilities along the internationally recognized borders. This step is crucial to safeguarding national sovereignty, protecting the residents of southern Lebanon, and ensuring their security and stability. Citing International Commitments The meeting also recalled the joint statement issued by the Presidents of the United States and France on November 26, 2024, which reaffirmed commitments to security arrangements and the implementation of Resolution 1701. The leaders specifically noted the statement’s declaration: 'The United States and France will work with the Israeli enemy and Lebanon to ensure the full implementation of this arrangement.' Additionally, they referenced Clause 12 of the same statement, which explicitly outlined 'the implementation of a detailed plan for the phased withdrawal and redeployment between Israeli Occupation Forces and the Lebanese Armed Forces within a maximum of 60 days.' Clause 13 further emphasized that 'the United States and France understand that the Israeli enemy and Lebanon will accept the above commitments in parallel with this declaration.'

Reaffirming Israel’s Presence as an Occupation: The continued Israeli presence on any part of Lebanese territory is deemed an occupation, carrying all legal consequences under international law. Pursuing Full Implementation of the November 27 Declaration: Lebanon will persist in its efforts through the Military Technical Committee and the Tripartite Mechanism to ensure the complete application of the declaration. Negotiating for the Release of Lebanese Prisoners: Lebanon will engage in discussions with the International Monitoring Committee and the International Red Cross to secure the release of Lebanese detainees held by the Israeli enemy. Finally, the Lebanese leadership reaffirmed the state’s unwavering commitment to its full national rights and sovereignty over all its territories, asserting Lebanon’s right to employ all necessary means to ensure the complete withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2342650	2025-02-18T03:59:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-06512810017398796766.jpg

Israeli Enemy Says Will Keep Five Occupation Posts in South Leban...	The Israeli enemy will complete early Tuesday its withdrawal from all South Lebanon towns and villages, yet it will keep five occupation positions within the Lebanese territories. The Israeli media outlets mentioned that the occupation army would finish its pull-out from Lebanon on Tuesday in the morning, adding that five Zionist posts would be kept within Lebanese territory under the pretext of protecting the border settlements from Hezbollah. Al-Manar reporter Ali Shoeib mentioned that the situation in the border area on Monday indicates that the enemy will complete its withdrawal by the end of the extended deadline, clarifying that the Zionist enemy did not carry out movements inside the villages. International Red Cross and the Lebanese Army managed to pull out the body of the martyr Khadija Atwi from inside the town of Houla still occupied by the Israeli enemy, knowing that the martyr died after she was left bleeding due to a Zionist gunshot inside her town on Sunday. Houla residents challenged the Israeli occupation and entered their hometown even before the Lebanese army. Meanwhile, the occupation forces have escalated their aggression on Lebanon hours before their withdrawal stipulated by the ceasefire, which took effect on November 27, 2024. Tuesday's violations were started by a vehicular incursion into KfarShouba town in the eastern sector of South Lebanon. Massive explosions were executed by the Israeli enemy in several towns, including Mays Al-Jabal, Yaroun, Teir Harfa, and Adaisseh. The Israeli enemy also carried out some construction works in Kfarkila, placing barbed wires along the border fence and a near gate and paving a road with base course materials. On the other hand, the Israeli warplanes and drones flew over several Lebanese towns, raiding Litani River course and Teir Harfa. Earlier, Israeli drones assassinated Hamas leader Mohammad Shaheen in the southern Lebanese city of Sidon. The strike hit his vehicle near the coastal corniche, just meters from a Lebanese Army checkpoint.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2342232	2025-02-17T11:44:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01611620017398214507.png
Hezbollah Statement Denounces Suspicious Attack on President Jose...	Hezbollah condemned in a statement on Monday the attack on the monument of President Joseph Aoun in Jarmaq-Aishiyeh area, South Lebanon. Hezbollah considered that 'this suspicious attack is a seditious act, especially at this sensitive time, as the country prepares for a pivotal day represented by the entitlement of the Israeli withdrawal from the South.' Hezbollah pointed out that 'this condemned behavior strongly contradicts the values and principles that Hezbollah believes in and were embodied by the Master of the Martyrs of the Nation, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah. It also contradicts Martyr Sayyed Nasrallah's approach and convictions. Hezbollah stressed its condemnation of this act that seeks to harm the relationship with the President of the Republic,' and called for 'thwarting all suspicious attempts to destabilize the nation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2342100	2025-02-17T07:25:09-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-04165050017056142612.png
Lebanese Nationals Protest Being Stranded in Iran over Israeli Th...	Lebanese nationals held a sit-in on Monday in the Iranian city of Qom protesting being stranded and unable to return home over Israeli threats after an Iranian plane was denied permission to land in Lebanon’s capital last week. The Lebanese nationals expressed their dissatisfaction with the government's decision that prevented them from returning to their homeland. Lebanese actor Mahdi Fakhreddin who is stranded in Iran demanded the provision of alternative options for the nationals, noting that many of those stranded have commitments in their homeland. For his part, Spokesman of the stranded Lebanese Sheikh Abbas Zgheib stressed that the Lebanese nationals’ right to return to their homeland and to freely move in their country, is preserved by the Lebanese constitution, urging the Lebanese President Joseph Aoun to act in a bid to get the stranded national back home. Thousands of Lebanese national head for Iran or reside in the Islamic Republic for pilgrimage, education or work there, with the Lebanese government hindering their return as it subduing to the US and Israeli dictations. Meanwhile, Lebanese Ambassador to Tehran Hasan Abbas said that communication is still ongoing between the Lebanese and Iranian authorities to secure the return of the Lebanese stranded in Iran since Thursday, following the Lebanese decision to prevent Iranian air carriers from landing at Beirut airport due to Israeli threats. In an interview with Al-Manar, the Lebanese ambassador said that the 'atmosphere is generally positive,' and that the foreign ministers of the Islamic Republic and Lebanon discussed the matter 'to ultimately find a way out of the crisis.' In this context, Abbas said that he is contacting the stranded citizens through the Lebanese Committee in Iran to secure their residence in the Islamic Republic and their return home soon. He explained that a number of travelers and families returned Lebanon via other countries, and that the remaining number is estimated at about two hundred people, most of whom were visiting the holy shrines. ⚡️⭕️ #Lebanon: Al-Mayadeen correspondent in Beirut: Protesters continue to block the airport road in protest against preventing an #Iranian plane from heading from Tehran to Beirut Under the orders of CENCTOM , Lebanese citizens are stranded in Iran as the Lebanese state… pic.twitter.com/0TB7YYwarB — Middle East Observer (@ME_Observer_) February 13, 2025	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2342023	2025-02-17T06:44:28-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-06865200017398030472.jpg
Israeli Occupation Used Palestinian Elderly as Gaza Human Shield:...	The Israeli occupation military forced an 80-year-old Palestinian man to act as a human shield in Gaza by tying an explosive cord around his neck and threatening to have his head blown off, an investigation has found. A senior officer from the occupation army’s Nahal Brigade tied the explosive cord around the man’s neck before he was ordered to scout houses the Israeli outlet The Hottest Place in Hell found in an investigation. After eight hours, soldiers ordered the man to flee with his wife from their home in Gaza City’s Zeitoun neighborhood in May, said +972 magazine, which reported the piece in partnership with The Hottest Place in Hell. But when another Israeli battalion spotted the elderly couple on the street, they were shot dead on the spot, according to Israeli occupation soldiers present at the scene. The Israeli soldiers had initially encountered the couple in their home. They told Arabic-speaking soldiers that they were unable to flee to southern Gaza due to mobility difficulties. But even in his condition, the soldiers forced the unnamed 80-year-old to walk ahead of them with his cane, while his wife was detained in their house. Additional details of the methods of warfare used in Gaza by the Israeli military and the deployment of civilians as human shields, then executed. The amount of evidence on the use of the practice in Gaza is unprecedented. It is clearly a military policy. pic.twitter.com/GbTagI6Wjy — Nicola Perugini (@PeruginiNic) February 16, 2025 A soldier told the investigation that the Israeli commander had decided to use the Palestinian couple as 'mosquitoes', referring to a procedure where the Israeli army forces Palestinian civilians to serve as human shields to protect the Israeli forces from being shot or blown up. 'He entered each house before us so that if there were [explosives] or a militant inside, he would [take the hit] instead of us,' one soldier said. 'He was told that if he did anything wrong or didn’t follow orders, the soldier behind him would pull the cord, and his head would be torn from his body.' The man was forced to act as a human shield for eight hours, before he was ordered, along with his wife, to walk towards the so-called 'humanitarian zone' in southern Gaza. But the soldiers did not care to tell nearby Israeli divisions that the couple was going to pass through the area, according to the testimonies. 'After 100 meters, the other battalion saw them and immediately shot them,' a soldier said. 'They died like that, in the street.' More reports emerge on the Israeli occupation army’s war crimes committed against the Palestinian people throughout 16 months of genocidal war in Gaza, with the atrocities of the so-called 'most moral army in the world' are being exposed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2341968	2025-02-17T05:16:33-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/12/manar-09560120017027419721.jpg

In a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement, an Israeli airstrike targeted a civilian vehicle on Monday morning in Sidon’s coastal corniche, just meters from a Lebanese Army checkpoint. Lebanese Army forces immediately cordoned off the area, later granting journalists access to document the targeted vehicle. The attack also triggered severe traffic congestion, as security measures led to road closures around the site. The Lebanese Health Ministry later confirmed that the strike claimed the life of one civilian, while emergency responders, including ambulances and fire brigades, rushed to the scene. This marks the first Israeli attack on Sidon since the ceasefire took effect on November 23 and the second strike within 24 hours, following the targeting of another civilian vehicle on Jarjouh Road in the Iqlim Al-Tuffah region. Later on Monday, Lebanon’s Al-Jamaa Al-Islamiya (Islamic Group) announced the martyrdom of Hamas military official Mahmoud Shaheen, who was killed in the Sidon airstrike.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2341814	2025-02-17T03:07:00-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00287420017397903525.jpg
Lebanese Residents Fearlessly Enter Houla Southern Town as Israel...	In a bold move, residents of the southern Lebanese town of Houla entered their hometown on Sunday without waiting for official authorization or directives. Pushing past Lebanese Army checkpoints and maneuvering through dirt mounds and trenches left by Israeli bulldozers, they made their way from the western entrance into the heart of the town. Al-Manar’s correspondent entered Houla, located along Lebanon’s southern border with occupied Palestine, to document the destruction left behind by Israeli forces before their withdrawal. As residents moved through most of the town’s neighborhoods, reaching roads leading to Mays Al-Jabal and Markaba, Israeli occupation forces launched a new assault. Residents enter the southern town of Houla (Feb. 16, 2025) IOF Block Lebanese Army, Red Cross from Evacuating Martyr’s Body Israeli occupation forces have denied entry to the Lebanese Army and the Red Cross into the center of Houla to retrieve the body of Khadija Atwi, who was killed earlier today by Israeli gunfire. The forces also prevented the evacuation of several trapped civilians, including the martyr’s sister. The Municipality of Houla has urgently called on the Lebanese Army, UNIFIL, and the International Red Cross to intervene swiftly and facilitate an immediate evacuation, warning that civilians may be forced to spend the night exposed to the elements. 🚨13-year-old Khadija Atwi, the daughter of Hezbollah martyr on the road to Al-Quds Hussein Mohamad Atwi, is the martyr who ascended in the town of Houla in southern Lebanon after the IOF opened fire on civilians, injuring several and kidnapping 5 people. Glory to the martyrs. pic.twitter.com/TpAynIUXmx — Mohsin Raza (@Levantregion) February 16, 2025 Meanwhile, Lebanon’s General Directorate of Civil Defense reported that its teams transported two injured civilians to Tebnin Governmental Hospital after they were wounded in the Israeli assault on Houla. According to the statement, responders faced significant field challenges as Israeli forces barred ambulances from entering, forcing them to reach the wounded on foot. The Zionist forces opened fire directly on civilians in Houla, resulting in one fatality and the detention of five residents. Some of the captives were later released. Later on Sunday, Al-Manar’s correspondent reported that Israeli artillery targeted the southwestern outskirts of Houla with 120mm shells. Health Ministry Condemns Abduction of Paramedics The Lebanese Ministry of Public Health strongly condemned the abduction of paramedics affiliated with Islamic Scout Rescue by Israeli occupation forces. The paramedics were taken to an unknown location while carrying out their humanitarian duty of evacuating the wounded from the town of Houla. The ministry denounced the act as a 'blatant violation of international and humanitarian laws, which protect medical and emergency teams in the line of duty.' It called for the immediate release of the abducted paramedics and urged for the necessary protection of medical and emergency personnel while they perform their duties. Israeli Breaches Continue in Border Villages While resilient southerners reclaimed Houla, other border villages in the central sector—including Maroun Al-Ras, Yaroun, and the outskirts of Aytaroun—witnessed further Israeli violations throughout the day. Israeli occupation forces were spotted near the western outskirts of Maroun Al-Ras, specifically around the Hussainiyah Square area. The dirt road leading into the village had previously halted Israeli advances when residents mobilized in early protests. However, Israeli troops have now resumed fortification efforts, reinforcing dirt barriers south of the village. In recent days, Zionist forces have advanced toward Maroun al-Ras' northern outskirts, conducting excavation work along the main road. Since Saturday, occupation forces have returned to the village’s western periphery, intensifying earthworks and trench reinforcements. Israeli activity has been concentrated in the village’s western and southwestern outskirts, with troops advancing toward the border with occupied Palestine. Escalation Near Aitaroun and Eastern Border Movements At the border of Aitaroun, Israeli occupation forces have been constructing new dirt barriers on the high ground known as 'Jal Al-Deir.' Two Merkava tanks have been stationed atop these fortifications, and in recent days, Israeli troops have transported concrete blocks and installed surveillance and monitoring poles in the area. Meanwhile, in Yaroun, Israeli occupation forces have been absent for most of the day following two explosions that occurred in the village last night. Further east, Israeli tanks were seen maneuvering around Kfar Jouba, north of Kfar Shouba, near a local water reservoir. An Israeli bulldozer was also spotted carrying out excavation operations in the Al-Sadana area. Two Israeli Merkava tanks and a military bulldozer advanced into the vicinity of the water reservoir north of Kfar Shouba, carrying out excavation work in the Al-Sadana area (Feb. 16, 2025) Also on Sunday, the Israeli occupation army carried out a large explosion in the Al-Sadana area on the outskirts of Kfar Shouba	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2340978	2025-02-16T12:33:11-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01004240017397371018.jpg
Hezbollah’s Sheikh Qassem Warns Against Palestinian Displacement,...	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem reaffirmed on the anniversary of the group's martyred senior leaders that the Islamic Resistance will unwaveringly continue its journey, drawing strength from the legacy of its martyrs who paved the way for resilience and honor through their ultimate sacrifices. Opening his address on Sunday, Sheikh Qassem extended congratulations to the Muslim nation on the birth anniversary of the 12th Shiite Imam, the awaited Imam Mahdi (AS), reaffirming Hezbollah’s unwavering commitment to his banner—symbolizing truth and humanity. He also reflected on the 20th anniversary of the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, calling for the preservation of national unity in the face of adversity. Hezbollah Martyred Leaders: Icons of Resistance Sheikh Qassem honored the legacy of Hezbollah’s senior martyred leaders, beginning with martyr Sheikh Ragheb Harb, a beloved figure who stood with courage against the Israeli occupation in the early years of the Zionist invasion of Lebanon. His eminence emphasized that the Israeli invasion of 1982 aimed not only to uproot Palestinian resistance but was part of a broader effort to eliminate resistance in Lebanon and the region. However, the outcomes of this invasion were far from what the enemy had anticipated. Sheikh Qassem also paid tribute to martyr Sayyed Abbas Al-Mousawi, describing him as the very embodiment of a true resistance leader—always on the front lines, instilling an unwavering spirit of victory among the fighters. His eminence quoted martyr Sayyed Abbas’ iconic words: 'Kill us, and we will grow stronger.' Turning to the legendary martyr Hajj Imad Moghniyeh, Sheikh Qassem lauded his spiritual devotion, which guided Hezbollah's fighters. He highlighted Moghniyeh’s innovative strategies and expertise in both security and military fields. 'These martyred leaders shared a common ideology and mission, grounded in authentic Islamic values and an unyielding commitment to jihad in the face of injustice, with the Israeli enemy always their primary target,' Sheikh Qassem concluded. Stance on Palestinian Displacement On the political front, Sheikh Qassem deemed US President Donald Trump’s stance on the Palestinian issue as highly dangerous, aiming to eradicate Palestine and its people. He characterized these positions as a form of 'political genocide,' following the failure of the US-Israeli plans during Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. Hezbollah's Sheikh Qassem condemned any attempt to forcibly displace Palestinians from their land, firmly rejecting their relocation to Jordan, Egypt, or Saudi Arabia. Additionally, Sheikh Qassem warned that every action carried out by the Israeli enemy is under direct US management. His eminence called on Arab and Islamic nations to take a clear and decisive stance against this scheme, stressing the grave impact of the US plan on the entire region. Furthermore, he affirmed that Hezbollah is prepared to contribute to any Arab or Islamic initiative aimed at resisting the displacement of Palestinians. Lebanese Government and Sovereignty Affairs Regarding Lebanese internal issues, Sheikh Qassem expressed satisfaction with the formation of the Lebanese government, considering it a vital constitutional achievement. He emphasized the need for the proper functioning of constitutional institutions and highlighted the key role played by the national duo in ensuring the election of the President of the Republic. 'The Lebanese PM decided to prevent the Iranian plane from landing under the pretext of aviation and civilian safety, yet this was in execution of the Israeli decision,' Sheikh Qassem stated. Regarding the anticipated Israeli withdrawal on February 18, Sheikh Qassem firmly stated that there is no justification for the continued Israeli occupation of any part of Lebanese territory. His eminence called on the Lebanese state to adopt a firm and resolute stance, rejecting any potential compromises, including the so-called 'five positions.' Sheikh Qassem also highlighted Lebanon’s responsibility to rebuild what was destroyed by Israeli aggression. He reassured the people, stating that Hezbollah would not abandon them in efforts related to housing, restoration, or reconstruction. His eminence assured that homes would be rebuilt to even higher standards than before. Furthermore, Sheikh Qassem proposed that the government implement a system of administrative appointments based on competitive exams, selecting the most qualified individuals free from political quotas, to improve the efficiency of Lebanon’s administration. Iranian Aircraft and UNIFIL Discussing the Lebanese government's decision to prevent the landing of an Iranian plane in Beirut's Rafic Hariri Airport, Sheikh Qassem stated that this decision was in direct response to an Israeli directive, disguised under the pretext of 'aviation and civilian safety.' Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem statement on Feb. 16, 2025 His eminence called on the Lebanese government to reconsider this decision and adopt a more assertive, sovereign stance. Sheikh Qassem also reiterated Hezbollah's firm opposition to any attack on UNIFIL forces, emphasizing the importance of maintaining their safety and the peacekeeping mission. Additionally, he reaffirmed Hezbollah's full preparation for Sayyed Nasrallah’s funeral on February 23, with diverse participation, urging supporters for wide attendance and discipline.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2341451	2025-02-16T11:34:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-06446200017397342586.png

Hezbollah: The Army’s Use of Tear Gas Against Protesters Is a Rep...	In a statement, Hezbollah confirmed that the 'popular sit-in organized by the group yesterday to condemn Israeli interference in Lebanese affairs and the violation of national sovereignty was a peaceful movement and a civilized expression of a popular position rejecting unjustified submission to external dictates.' However, Hezbollah indicated that 'the protesters were surprised by some members of the Lebanese army firing tear gas bombs at them, in a reprehensible act that constitutes an unjustified attack on peaceful citizens. It is a suspicious attempt to drag the army into a confrontation with its people.' Expressing concern, Hezbollah called on the army leadership to urgently investigate this 'reprehensible attack' and take appropriate measures to preserve the military's role in protecting stability and civil peace. Hezbollah also called on the Lebanese government to fulfill its responsibilities in protecting peaceful protesters and their right to express their positions and demands. The group demanded the government reverse its decision to prevent an Iranian aircraft from landing at Beirut airport and take serious measures to prevent Israeli encroachment on national sovereignty. Condemning an incident that targeted the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) the previous day near Rafik Hariri International Airport, Hezbollah stressed its 'absolute rejection of any targeting' of UNIFIL or harm to public and private property. Thousands of Lebanese citizens participated in the Hezbollah-called sit-in on the old road leading to Beirut's airport, protesting Israeli violations of Lebanese sovereignty and refusing to submit to Israeli threats. The protesters also demanded the government facilitate the return of Lebanese citizens stranded in Tehran after authorities prevented an Iranian aircraft from landing in Beirut.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2340725	2025-02-16T04:47:49-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-001802500173971005910.jpg
Europe Will Not Be Part of Ukraine Peace Talks, US Envoy Says	The United States has indicated that Europe will not have a seat at the table for the upcoming Ukraine peace talks, according to Donald Trump's Ukraine envoy. Speaking at a global security conference in Munich, the envoy, Jim Kellogg, bluntly stated: 'I'm (from) a school of realism. I think that's not gonna happen' when asked about European participation. The news has sparked concerns among European leaders, who have insisted they must be involved in any negotiations that impact their own security. 'There's no way in which we can have discussions or negotiations about Ukraine, Ukraine's future or European security structure, without Europeans,' Finland's President Alexander Stubb told reporters. The US has taken an increasingly unilateral approach to the Ukraine conflict, with Trump shocking allies by calling Russian President Vladimir Putin without consulting European partners or the Ukrainian government. Trump administration officials have also made clear that they expect European NATO allies to take primary responsibility for the region, as the US shifts focus to issues like border security and countering China. This has fueled fears that Europe may be cut out of a peace deal that could significantly impact their interests, particularly if it is seen as too favorable to Russia. In a sign of the growing tensions, the US has sent a questionnaire to European capitals asking what they could contribute to security guarantees for Ukraine. 'The Americans are approaching European capitals and asking how many soldiers they are ready to deploy,' one European diplomat revealed.

Allies Often Worse Than Enemies': Trump Announces Reciprocal Tar...	US President Donald Trump today announced sweeping 'reciprocal tariffs' hitting both allies and competitors, in a dramatic escalation of an international trade war that economists warn could fuel inflation at home. Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said he decided to impose reciprocal duties, telling reporters that US allies were often 'worse than our enemies' on trade issues. The levies would be tailored to each US trading partner and consider factors including value added tax (VAT). Trump has announced a broad range of tariffs targeting some of the biggest US trading partners since taking office, arguing that they would help tackle unfair practices — and in some cases using the threats to influence policy. The president has referred to tariffs as a way to raise revenue, remedy trade imbalances and pressure countries to act on US concerns. Trump's announcement came hours before he was due to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington. It remains unclear when exactly the tariffs would take effect, if imposed. Analysts have warned that reciprocal duties could bring a broad tariff hike to emerging market economies such as India and Thailand, which tend to have higher effective tariff rates on US products. Countries such as South Korea that have trade deals with Washington are less at risk from this move, analysts believe.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2338899	2025-02-14T06:30:38-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2020/11/manar-02037370016046496872.jpg

He said Hamas had, conversely, 'achieved all of its goals, chief among them: continuing its rule in Gaza.'

At its simplest, this plan involves ethnically cleansing the northern Gaza Strip of people; and then besieging the region, including stopping the entry of humanitarian supplies, to starve out anyone left, including Palestinian fighters. The original plan, also known as the Eiland Plan after its creator, was seen by Palestinians and rights groups as part of a long-term project of ethnic cleansing that would result in the reestablishment of Zionist settlements in Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2338866	2025-02-14T06:06:06-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07800290017395417976.jpg
Yemenis Stage Mass Rallies in Solidarity with Palestine, Axis of ...	Tens of thousands of Yemenis have taken to the streets in the country's northwestern province of Sa'ada, staging massive rallies in solidarity with the Palestinian people and rejecting US President Donald Trump's plan to displace Gazans.

Al-Houthi stressed that Yemen stands by Palestine, and the US will witness the full extent of the Yemeni military prowess, which he said the US has not experienced so far. He warned that the missiles and forces dispatched by the US to Palestinian territories will fail to displace the people of Gaza. The senior Yemeni official also pointed to the recent collision of the US aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman with a large merchant vessel in the Mediterranean, saying the incident exposes the anxiety and distress that the US Navy is enduring as a result of battles with the Yemeni armed forces. Al-Houthi reiterated Yemeni people's unwavering support for the Palestinian nation, adding that their million-man marches over the past 15 months attest to such a stance. He stressed that all options are on the table, and Yemeni armed forces stand fully prepared for any possible scenario, especially after recent remarks by Ansarulalh leader Abul-Malik al-Houthi that Yemen will intervene, even militarily, if the US and Israel attempt to enforce the Gaza displacement plan by force or collude with Arab regimes to implement it.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2338756	2025-02-14T05:34:58-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00178670017395401224.jpg

Member of the Loyalty to Resistance parliamentary bloc, Dr. Ibrahim Al-Moussawi, called on all the Lebanese parties to condemn the Israeli violations of the national sovereignty and loudly hold the international competent institutions responsible for stopping the Zionist attacks against the Martyr President Rafik Hariri International Airport. In a statement issued to comment on on the crisis of Lebanese citizens stranded abroad as a result of the Israeli threat to target the Iranian plane that will transport them from Iran, MP Al-Moussawi said, 'the Lebanese who are optimistic about the reactivation of the work of constitutional institutions are holding the government responsible and demanding that it take the necessary measures to guarantee Lebanon’s sovereignty at all its public facilities, most importantly the airport, so that the enemy does not think that it is free to practice aggression and violate sovereignty as it pleases.' 'The Lebanese state, with all its apparatuses, must assume its responsibilities to end this matter and work to return its citizens to their country immediately and not comply with Israeli threats under any name or circumstance.' At the same time, Al-Moussawi called on the honorable citizens and all those who are keen on the interests of their country and families to be deeply aware and rational and to make room for solutions to this emerging crisis, stressing that the expression of rejection of these Israeli violations and infringements of our sovereignty to be peaceful and responsible. Hundreds of demonstrators staged a sit-in on Thursday evening off Beirut International Airport, protesting against the prevention of an Iranian plane carrying Lebanese citizens from landing at the airport. Dozens of young men blocked the airport road by burning tires, in rejection of the decision to prevent the plane from landing, which includes arbitrarily preventing citizens from returning to their homeland.

Sayyed Houthi: We Will Militarily Confront Trump’s Gaza Displacem...	Head of Yemen’s Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi vowed a military action if 'Israel' or the US proceed with a plan to displace the Gaza Strip residents into other countries. 'Our position concerning support for the Palestinian nation and their fighters is firm and principled, and we will resolutely stand by their side,' he said in a televised speech from Yemeni capital Sanaa on Thursday. 'If the US manages to advance its plot against Gaza, we will take military action to prevent it, and act within the framework of our religious duties. We will not sit idly by.' He added that 'Israel' has not yet fulfilled its commitments under the Gaza ceasefire agreement by preventing the entry of aid, basic commodities and tents into the Strip. Houthi took a swipe at the Zionist regime for violating the terms of the ceasefire in Gaza due to the encouragement of the deceitful US administration, which denies all rights. The Ansarullah chief also rejected the US president’s call for the cancellation of the Gaza ceasefire unless the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas frees all remaining Israeli captives by Saturday, stating that 'Hell is for you (Donald Trump) and people of your kind like tyrants, criminals and oppressors.' Houthi emphasized that Trump’s Gaza displacement plan is more like a joke and naive talk from the president of a country that proclaims to be civilized. 'Trump's plan to displace the Palestinian people from their homeland is a confiscation of a right from which many other rights are derived. Trump is a criminal and accustomed to making careless and ridiculous remarks.' Houthi underlined that Trump's plan to displace Palestinians from Gaza reflects his insistence on the criminal plan to deny Palestinians’ rights and justice for them. A drone view captures Palestinians, forcibly displaced to southern Gaza by IOF, making their way back to their homes in the north after a ceasefire took effect in central Gaza (Reuters: Jan 27, 2025) 'Trump's plan for Gaza is evil and cruel. It appears that he is serious about implementing the scheme, and is putting pressure on some Arab countries to accept it. We are not surprised by the US president’s plot as it shows the tyranny and criminal record of his country. There are no boundaries to the ambitions of Trump, who believes in the aggressive and unjust Zionist plan and seeks to realize it,' he stated. The Ansarullah leader stated that Trump, who unveiled the so-called 'Deal of the Century' during his term in office, is now poised to perpetrate the 'Crime of the Century' during his second term. 'Through his plan, Trump seeks to obtain what the Israeli aggression on Gaza failed to achieve, namely, displacing the Palestinians from their land. When the Americans raise the issue of displacing the Palestinian people from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, they seek to completely liquidate the Palestinian cause,' Houthi said. He warned that the plan to forcibly relocate Palestinians is part of the Zionist project that seeks to expand the occupying entity’s influence and is aimed at holy sites, especially the al-Aqsa Mosque. 'Trump’s Gaza plan cannot succeed as long as Arabs, especially the Arab countries neighboring Palestine, do not accept it. A great responsibility lies with Arab and Muslim countries to clearly reject it, and more importantly express their vehement opposition. 'The US seeks to entrap Arab regimes in a major scandal and act against the interests of their countries and peoples,' Houthi noted. He warned that approving the American plan would have very serious consequences for the national security of Arab countries, and the entire West Asia region.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2338382	2025-02-13T11:54:43-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01327440017394764775.jpg

Video Shows Martyr Sayyed Nasrallah Anticipating Displacement Per...	The US President Donald Trump did not disclose a secret scheme when he raised the issue of forcibly displacing Gaza residents in order to turn it into an American real-estate project. The dark scenario, which completely eradicates the Palestinian cause and threatens all the Arab countries, was anticipated by the former Secretary General of Hezbollah Martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah. In a speech on the anniversary of Hezbollah's martyred commanders, Sayyed Nasrallah warned that the enemy was planning to displace the residents of Gaza, West Bank, and the Palestinian territories occupied in 1948. Hezbollah decided since the start of the Zionist genocidal war on Gaza to support the Palestinian resistance militarily in order to frustrate such schemes despite the heavy sacrifices made for this sake. Palestinians displaced from Gaza to neighboring countries under a 'U.S. proposal' would not have the right to return to the enclave, US President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox News about his proposal to 'own' the Gaza Strip and develop real estate there. After visiting Washington and meeting Trump, the Jordanian King Abdullah II held a phone call with the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to discuss the latest issued related to the Palestinian cause. The two leaders reaffirmed the unified positions of Egypt and Jordan, including the crucial necessity to fully implement the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, continue the release of hostages and detainees, and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid in order to alleviate the severe humanitarian suffering in the Strip. President El-Sisi and King Abdullah II also reiterated the imperative to immediately start the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip without displacing the Palestinian people from their land. Furthermore, they stressed the necessity to stop the practices carried out by Israeli occupation forces against the Palestinians in the West Bank. 'The Arab world has fought [this idea] for 100 years. After resisting this for 100 years, we Arabs are not about to capitulate now.'

Imam Khamenei Highlights Iran’s Military Power Feared by Foes	Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei has hailed the participation of people in Monday rallies across the country on the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, saying President Masoud Pezeshkian’s 'clear and decisive' speech complemented the great popular movement. The Leader made the remarks during a Wednesday meeting with scientists, specialists, and officials from Iran’s defense industry, as well as several families of martyrs from the country’s defense sector. 'This recent Bahman 22 (February 10) was one of the most outstanding celebrations of the [Islamic] Revolution – one of the most significant ones,' Ayatollah Khamenei said, describing the rallies as a 'popular uprising' in the face of the enemy’s massive propaganda campaign against the Islamic Revolution. 'The people indeed rose up on Monday; they took to the streets, chanted slogans, expressed their views in the media, and this happened across the entire country. It was a popular uprising, a great national movement,' he said. ‘Rallies conveyed message of unity’ The Leader further said the participation of young people and the broad turnout across the country, including in villages despite bitterly cold and highly unfavorable weather, conveyed a 'message of unity' from the Iranian nation. Emphasizing the significance of the huge turnout, Ayatollah Khamenei noted that Iranians had done something 'extraordinary' by showcasing their 'identity, dignity, strength, and resilience' in the face of 'foolish threats' repeatedly made against them. 'Complementing this great popular movement on Bahman 22 were the clear and decisive remarks of the esteemed president, who voiced the people’s concerns and articulated what needed to be said,' he said. 'I always reiterate to my audience, to the dear young people to whom I am deeply attached and devoted, that actions must be taken at the right time. The Iranian nation acted at the right time on Monday; they did what needed to be done exactly when it needed to be done. They showed themselves at the right moment.' Prior to the meeting, Ayatollah Khamenei visited the Eghtedar-1403 exhibition for an hour, which showcased the latest achievements and capabilities of the country’s defense industry scientists and specialists. The exhibition featured advanced equipment and new technologies used in air defense, ballistic and cruise missiles, smart munitions, space technology, drones and aviation, naval vessels, and energy systems. Referring to the exhibition, the Leader described the issue of defending the nation and ensuring the country’s security as extremely important, stating that Iran’s defensive power is now widely recognized – admired by the 'friends of the Revolution' and feared by its enemies – making it a significant asset for the country. Ayatollah Khamenei recalled a time when global bullies refused to sell Iran essential defense equipment, even at heavy prices. He noted that those same powers now demand that Iran refrain from selling military equipment to others, emphasizing the vast gap between their past stance of 'we won’t sell to you' and their current plea of 'don’t sell to others,' a gap that has been bridged through the 'efforts of Iranian scientists and the sharp minds of young specialists.' Highlighting Iran’s remarkable defense advancements despite ongoing sanctions, the Leader said that the country’s defense industry has reached a point where if any part or equipment is withheld, Iranian youth produce an even better version domestically.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2337667	2025-02-12T13:39:46-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-014585500173939637610.jpg

Sheikh Yazbek: Israeli Withdrawal Deadline Approaching, Hezbollah...	Head of Hezbollah’s Juristic Council Sheikh Mohammad Yazbek issued on Wednesday a statement which tackles the latest developments and affirms that the Resistance is the fortress of Lebanon. Sheikh Yazebk started his statement by felicitating the nation on the anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, saying: 'In these days, the days of the victorious and blessed Islamic Revolution, the triumph of the oppressed over the oppressors, these are the days of authentic Mohammadan Islam. We extend our warmest congratulations to the Imam of our time and to the nation on this blessed occasion&#8230;' Sheikh Yazbek added: 'Today, we have experienced great crises and tragedies, particularly when we lost the lover of Imam Mahdi, the lover of Allah, the inspired leader, the martyr of the nation, His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah—may Allah sanctify his pure soul—who was an entire nation in one man. He was the one who proclaimed: 'We will never abandon you, O Hussein,' and he never did. Instead, he attained martyrdom on the very path laid down by Imam Hussein. Peace be upon you, upon your supporter and brother, and upon our brother, His Eminence Sayyed Hashem Safieddine—may Allah sanctify his pure soul—who was your steadfast supporter, just as Al-Abbas was to Imam Hussein, in this blessed journey to lift oppression from the oppressed, in victory for the truth, and in defense of Palestine and Al-Quds. You both, along with those who stood with you on this sacred path to Al-Quds, dedicated your efforts to supporting and assisting Gaza. You gave your lives for this cause, driven by divine duty, human responsibility, and noble values, for the dignity of the oppressed. You did not ignore the cries and pleas of the children, women, and men of Gaza; rather, you answered their call. Yes, this is how you established this blessed Resistance, which has now entered its fourth decade, evolving from one era to the next. This dear and honorable Resistance has brought dignity to the entire nation, not just Lebanon. It has been the shield and the guardian of this homeland’s freedom. You and all the leaders and martyrs, every single one of you who has stood in the battlefield against the 'Israeli' enemy, have ensured that despite 64 days of battle, the enemy was unable to advance. Instead, the fighters of this Resistance stood firm, like the supporters of Imam Hussein, as the men of Allah and Imam Mahdi—men who insisted on confrontation, who fought for a dignified life for their nation, their people, and their homeland.' Sheikh Yazbek pointed out, 'When we agreed to the ceasefire, it was to protect this homeland and preserve others. However, this enemy has no covenant or pact. What it failed to achieve in war, it now seeks to accomplish by violating the ceasefire—wreaking havoc on our land and our people, destroying buildings, and assaulting civilians, while the United States backs it. The supervisory committee has failed to fulfill its role. We gave an opportunity for all to understand the situation. The state must implement what was agreed upon and take responsibility.' 'However, after 60 days had passed without action, our people in the south rose up and advanced toward the villages occupied by the enemy. They breached the barriers and made sacrifices, offering martyrs and wounded in their struggle to return. This return is a victorious one—a triumph after triumph. This Resistance belongs to the people. We congratulate our people on their return, their steadfastness, and their unwavering will. The enemy sought to break their resolve but failed. Yes, we are the followers of the Islamic path—the path of honor and dignity, the path drawn for us by our Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him).' Sheikh Yazbek addressed the Southerners, 'You, the honorable, the resistors, the people who do not fear the enemy, those who face death with courage—this Resistance is yours. You are its backbone and at its forefront. You are the ones who teach the enemy a lesson, just as our people in Gaza have done by achieving victory and denying the enemy any of its objectives. The enemy failed to accomplish anything in Lebanon, just as it failed in Palestine and Gaza, his eminence added. 'And now, those who seek to bargain today—such as Trump, who believes he can turn Gaza into real estate for sale—let them be disgraced along with all their allies. The entire world should know that as long as there are those who declare, 'There is no god but Allah,' the true owners of the land remain deeply rooted in it, just like our people in the south, in Jabal Amel, and across Lebanon. They have offered the dearest sacrifices and will never abandon the land they have watered with their blood.' Sheikh Yazbek called on the state to fulfill its responsibilities in confronting this occupation. We are approaching the end of the deadline that was granted. 'After that, as our Secretary-General, His Eminence Sheikh Naim Qassem, has stated: 'We will then reassess our actions moving forward.' We are fully prepared for whatever is necessary to preserve our dignity, our honor, and Lebanon’s sovereignty.The Resistance is defending Lebanon—it is the fortress of this nation. Lebanon needs those who will stand in its defense. When the state takes up its role in protecting the borders, we will stand with it and support it. This was evident when our people stood with the army as they advanced into the occupied villages. We all look forward to that day.' Sheikh Yazbek concluded, 'We also look forward to February 23, the day when the martyr of the nation, the sacred leader, His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, will be laid to rest. This national funeral will be a tribute to the homeland, for which he gave his blood, his very existence, and his Resistance. The Resistance will remain; its banner will never fall. As Sayyed promised, the flag will continue to be raised—it is a promise that will be fulfilled. We ask Allah Almighty to grant our nation honor and dignity.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2337579	2025-02-12T13:05:02-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07784730017393942971.jpg
Israeli War Jets Create Sonic Booms over Beirut as Lebanese Offic...	As the withdrawal deadline, stipulated by the ceasefire agreement, comes closer, the Israeli enemy escalated pressure to gain a new extension in order to continue its attacks and violations. The ceasefire took effect on November 27, 2024, ending a 66-day Zionist war on Lebanon. After the end of the 60-day withdrawal deadline, the bias US sponsor of the agreement supported the Israeli enemy to keep its occupation forces in South Lebanon till February 18, 2025. Few days before the deadline, the Israeli enemy started exerting various forms of pressures to delay the withdrawal. In this regard, the Israeli media quoted some officials as claiming that the Army would remain in South Lebanon for a longer term although some outlets reported the contrary. In this regard, Israeli Channel 14 mentioned that, under the ceasefire agreement, and unless there is any change, the 'Israeli' army will withdraw from Lebanon within a week. Al-Hadath TV Channel alleged that the Lebanese officials agreed a new extension of the withdrawal deadline till after next April. However, President Michel Aoun and House Speaker Nabih Berri categorically denied the Israeli-motivated rumors, reiterating the demand that the Israeli occupation forces withdraw from South Lebanon before February 18. Few hours after the Lebanese political stance confirmed rejection of the withdrawal deadline, the Israeli war jets created sonic booms over several Lebanese areas, including Beirut, for the first time since November 27. The Zionist mock raids were also carried out over Bekaa and Al-Matn.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2337524	2025-02-12T10:46:26-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01178340017393859748.png

Israeli Occupation Forces Escalate Violations in Southern Lebanon...	Israeli occupation forces persist in violating Lebanese sovereignty by maintaining a presence in several points within southern villages, where their troops are seen actively moving. These operations include frequent incursions by both foot and armored patrols, alongside ongoing sweeping operations and repeated explosions. The latest of these occurred last night in the town of Yaroun, which has recently witnessed multiple bombing and demolition operations. Additionally, the Israeli occupation army has set fire to homes and carried out explosive attacks in the town of Adaisseh. Tensions Rise on the Southern Border Zionist forces launched bursts of gunfire from the town of Maroun Al-Ras, targeting the outskirts of the city of Bint Jbeil. In the southern area near the town of Aita Al-Shaab, which borders the Blue Line with occupied Palestine, an explosion targeted a farm at the border. Lebanese Rejection of Israeli Request The Lebanese Ministry of Defense was informed today, Wednesday, by the UNIFIL ceasefire monitoring committee that the Israeli army has requested to remain at certain points in southern Lebanon until February 28. However, this request has been firmly rejected by the Lebanese authorities. Delays in Ceasefire Monitoring Discussions A scheduled meeting of the committee overseeing the implementation of the ceasefire agreement was postponed from Thursday to Friday for further consultations on the fate of the ceasefire, which is set to expire next Tuesday. Al-Manar's correspondent reported on Wednesday that Israeli occupation forces continue to set fire to several homes in the town of Adaisseh, while a Merkava tank remains on standby behind earthen barriers at the town entrances leading from Rab Thalatheen and Taybeh. Additionally, Israeli bulldozers are conducting earthworks at the outskirts of Al-Dhahirah, while Israeli artillery has targeted Wadi Al-Shebaa. Also on Wednesday, the acting Lebanese Army Commander, Major General Hassan Aouda, inspects army deployment centers in the eastern sector of southern Lebanon. Aouda arrived earlier at the François Hajj Barracks in Marjayoun, marking his first visit to the border region in southern Lebanon.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2337315	2025-02-12T06:11:35-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00807440017393678339.jpg
