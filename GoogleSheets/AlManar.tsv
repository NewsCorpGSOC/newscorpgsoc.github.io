‘Israel’ Starts New Phase of Escalation in South Syria: Preparati...	The Israeli occupation has begun a new phase of escalation in Syria’s south, in preparation for indirectly annexing it, echoing the escalation taking place in the West Bank, Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar reported on Thursday. The paper said the escalation in south Syria has been through several paths, 'some under the pretext of 'protecting minorities,' and others through the de facto authority that it imposes by force.' The move comes after 'After destroying most of the Syrian Army’s capabilities following the collapse ex-president Bashar al-Assad’s regime on December 8, and after occupying the demilitarized zone in southern Syria, including its strategic heights and fresh water sources,' Al-Akhbar reported. If completed, this means that the Zionist entity will grab three governorates: Sweida, Daraa and Quneitra, according to the report. Meanwhile, the new Syrian administration, led by the transitional president Ahmad Al-Sharaa, keeps mum after the man repeatedly voiced unwillingness to engage in any confrontation with the Israeli occupation, the Lebanese daily added. The escalation comes as the Israeli occupation continues to carry out aerial attacks on Syria, with strikes being reported late Tuesday on Daraa, Sweida, and the outskirts of Damascus. On the other hand, the Israeli occupation has been building military outposts and bases in the so-called demilitarized buffer zone with Syria, amid several attempts of ground advance in the nearby area. In parallel with the direct and indirect military control over southern Syria, the Israeli occupation forces began expanding contact channels with the residents of those areas, offering financial incentives by securing job opportunities in the occupied territories, in an effort to link the economy of the south to the occupation authorities, and to strengthen the latter's control over this region, by all means, according to the paper. Meanwhile on Thursday, Zionist Defense Minister Israel Katz said that Israeli occupation forces were 'staying indefinitely' in the so-called buffer zones in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza. Earlier this week, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said that the Zionist entity will not allow Syria’s new army or the insurgent group that led the ouster of Al-Assad to 'enter the area south of Damascus.' Israeli Prime Minister #Satanyahu stated that Israeli forces will remain in Syria's buffer zone, specifically on Mount Hermon for ‘an unlimited period of time’ Israel will demand disarmament of Syrian army in southern Syria, will not 'tolerate any threat to Druze community' pic.twitter.com/Dq98MR4E4t — Owner Of Al-Quds (@_Alone_Warrior_) February 24, 2025	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2350449	2025-02-27T06:21:20-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-02684300017406657368.jpg
Israeli Troops Will Remain in Lebanon, Syria, Gaza 'Buffer Zones'...	Zionist Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Thursday that Israeli occupation forces were 'staying indefinitely' in a buffer zone on the border with Lebanon, adding their deployment there was 'situation-dependent.' 'There is a buffer zone (on the border with Lebanon), it wasn’t easy but I stood my ground, and we received a green light from the United States, we gave them a map, and we are staying indefinitely — this is situation-dependent, not time-dependent,' Katz said at a conference, according to a statement issued by his office. It is worth noting that the Zionist enemy completed its withdrawal from South Lebanon on February 18, 2025, keeping five occupation positions in Mount Jal Al-Deir (Aitaroun), Al-Hamames Hill (Al-Khiam), Mount Blat (between Ramyah and Marwaheen), Houla-Markaba Main Road, and Al-Labbouneh Hill (Outskirts of Naqoura and Alma Al-Shaab). Southern Syria Katz also pointed out that southern Syria must remain demilitarized at all costs — and that 'Israel' will ensure that it does. 'Joulani came to power in Syria, traded in his trousers for suits, and he speaks well. We don’t trust him. We trust only the IDF,' the minister stated. Gaza Israeli Defense Minister added that the Philadelphi Corridor on the border between Gaza and Egypt will remain a 'buffer zone.' 'The Philadelphi Corridor will remain a buffer zone just like the borders with Lebanon and Syria,' Katz said. 'Israel' is scheduled to start withdrawing from the 14-kilometer (8.69-mile) corridor on Saturday under a Gaza ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement with Hamas. An Israeli official, however, confirmed Thursday that Tel Aviv will not withdraw from the corridor on Saturday. 'We will not leave the Philadelphi Corridor,' the public broadcaster KAN quoted the official as saying. He said Israel will not allow Hamas 'to again roam our borders with pickup trucks and guns, and we will not allow them to rearm through smuggling.' The Israeli army captured the corridor during its genocidal war on Gaza, which has killed more than 48,300 people, mostly women and children, and left the enclave in ruins. The Israeli war was brought to a halt under the ceasefire agreement, which took hold in Gaza on Jan. 19. Last November, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. 'Israel' also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2350394	2025-02-27T05:32:48-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-05414040017322736387.jpg
Website Publishes List of Canadian Israelis who Served in the IOF	The non-profit news website The Maple published a list of 85 Canadians with Israeli citizenship who have served in the Israeli occupation army. The website announced that this is the initial list and that it intends to publish additional lists of additional Canadians that have joined the Israeli military. The article, entitled 'Meet 85 Canadians That Have Fought For Israel,' featured in online publication The Maple provides a link to the list. NEW: I created a database containing profiles of 85 Canadians that have fought in the Israeli military. This is the largest such collection of names and stories in Canada, by far. — Davide Mastracci (@DavideMastracci) February 24, 2025 According to the article, its purpose is to provide a database of 'mini-profiles for as many Canadians that have fought in the Israeli military at any point as I could find,' said its author, because 'there is little existing research in Canada beyond one-off news articles about who these soldiers are and how they came to make the life choices that they did.' The list has sparked anger by Israeli circles, with Israeli Channel 14 describing the move a 'scandal'. 'I don’t think it’s an acceptable thing to happen in Canada,' Rebecca Garner, who served in the IDF from 2011 to 2014, and whose name was enrolled in the list, told the National Post, a Canadian English-language broadsheet newspaper.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2350306	2025-02-27T02:08:57-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-09000340017314003295.jpg
Hamas Asserts: The Occupation Government Has No Choice but to Beg...	The Islamic Resistance movement Hamas announced that the path to further negotiations has been cleared, prompting the Israeli occupation government to embark on the second phase of talks. The statement highlights that the enemy’s false excuses have been rendered invalid, and now they 'have no choice but to commence.' Hamas charged that the Israeli government's efforts, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to obstruct a ceasefire deal, only exacerbate the suffering of captives and their families. 'The only way to secure the release of the captives is through constructive negotiation and a firm commitment to the agreement,' the statement asserted. Under the current prisoners' exchange deal, four Palestinian journalists were freed today after being abducted from the Gaza Strip for documenting Israeli crimes during the former aggression on the enclave. pic.twitter.com/SPwsFZdxqj — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) February 27, 2025 In the statement, Hamas renewed its full commitment to the ceasefire agreement, 'with all its details and provisions,' and its readiness to enter into negotiations related to the second phase of the agreement. Last night, Wednesday, the seventh batch of liberated Palestinian prisoners arrived in the city of Ramallah, following a prisoner exchange between the Palestinian resistance and the occupation government in its first phase of the ceasefire agreement. The Prisoners' Information Office said that the number of prisoners who will be released in the seventh batch of the first phase of the 'Free Flood' deal is 620 prisoners. ‘Israel’ launched a genocidal war on the Gaza Strip on October 7, 2023, after Hamas carried out a historic operation against the usurping entity in retaliation for its intensified atrocities against the Palestinian people.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2350218	2025-02-27T01:56:12-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-03224260017378138647.jpg

The gathering has drawn a large turnout of political, religious, cultural, and military figures from Lebanon and abroad, alongside massive public crowds. Throughout the morning of Wednesday, high-ranking officials, diplomats, and military representatives arrived to extend their condolences and pay tribute to the fallen leaders. Among the prominent attendees were former Lebanese President Michel Aoun, caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, and a delegation of social and political figures. A large group of ambassadors in Lebanon also took part, along with a representative of Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei.

What’s Left of Sayyed Safeiddine Speech after Being Elected as Sa...	Here an image of what’s left of the speech written by martyr Sayyed Hashem Safeiddine after being elected as successor of Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah. Below is the text of the speech: 'Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent example for whoever has hope in Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah often. When the believers saw the enemy alliance, they said, 'This is what Allah and His Messenger had promised us. The promise of Allah and His Messenger has come true.' And this only increased them in faith and submission. Among the believers are men who have proven true to what they pledged to Allah.1 Some of them have fulfilled their pledge ˹with their lives˺, others are waiting ˹their turn˺. They have never changed ˹their commitment˺ in the least.' (Al-Ahzab, 21-22-23) First, I extend heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs and sympathy with those who have injured over their sufferings due to the Israeli aggression on our country, asking Allah to reward their patience. I address you O’ dear ones in our beloved country Lebanon as well as Arab and Muslim countries. I address the free people of the world and all those who refuse oppression and fight the tyrants. There is no doubt that sadness and grief dominate our hearts over crimes and massacres committed by the Israeli enemy. Such crimes have been carried out amid US cover and international silence that reaches the extent of incitation for nearly a year against the people of Gaza, and the Palestinian people in general, all the way to Lebanon, which has been subjected to these hideous and unjust attacks. Our grief is deep, great and indescribable for the loss of our leader, our master and our inspiration, our Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. His eminence led this blessed and victorious resistance, which achieved unprecedented victories and accomplished great events that were and will remain immortal, thanks to his leadership, wisdom and courage, and above all, due to his faith, sincerity and readiness to sacrifice everything he had for the sake of the cause. This cause, he believed in and has been committed to, along with his people, his family and the families of the martyrs and the wounded.' What's left of Sayyed Hashem Safeiddine's speech. Sayyed Safeiddine was to deliver the speech at the same day when he was martyred in an Israeli strike on Mraijeh area, in Beirut’s southern suburb, Dahiyeh, on October 4, a week after the massive strikes that killed Sayyed Nasrallah. Hundreds of thousands, including figures and activists from all over the world, bid farewell to the Hezbollah secretary generals last Sunday, in a mass funeral at Beirut's Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2349558	2025-02-26T03:16:54-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-02758960017405682681.jpg

Israeli aircraft launched a wave of intense aerial strikes across Syria, coinciding with a ground invasion into key towns within the Quneitra countryside and the Daraa governorate. The overnight aggression targeted critical areas, including Daraa, al-Suweida, and the outskirts of Damascus. Witnesses reported seeing Israeli drones actively surveilling the Quneitra province, while Israeli warplanes executed bombings in the strategic al-Kiswah region and circled over the capital. Israeli warplanes have launched multiple airstrikes across southern Syria, hours after the conclusion of the Syrian National Dialogue Conference, which had issued a statement condemning Israel’s military actions. — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) February 25, 2025 Local media noted that at least six loud explosions echoed through the Suweida countryside, signaling the extent of the airstrikes. Israeli media sources claimed that military infrastructure, including weapons caches belonging to the former Syrian regime, were destroyed in the barrage. Furthermore, a Syrian Arab Army camp in the eastern Daraa countryside was reportedly among the targets hit. Israeli Security Minister Israel Katz confirmed the offensive, stating, 'The Israeli Air Force is striking hard in southern Syria,' emphasizing that the government 'will not allow Southern Syria to turn into Southern Lebanon.' Since the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime, Israeli occupation forces have launched an unprecedented military campaign, decimating strategic defenses including cruise missile systems, ballistic missile systems, and air defense mechanisms, alongside significant damage to the Syrian naval fleet and research facilities. This latest aggression is part of an ongoing ground offensive aimed at securing additional territory, specifically within the strategic Mount Hermon region and other southern provinces. Reports indicate that the current Israeli advance in northern Quneitra and Daraa marks the deepest penetration into Syrian territory since the new regime took power, with objectives focused on complete control of southern Syria.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2349206	2025-02-25T23:45:40-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01888760017405559355.jpg
Israeli Drone Raid on Bekaa Leaves Casualties, Hezbollah Warns	Zionist drone raided late Tuesday the Shaara area in the eastern Mount Range above the town of Janta in Bekaa, leaving two martyrs and two injuries. Member of Loyalty to Resistance parliamentary bloc, Dr. Ibrahim Al-Moussawi, commented in a statement on the Zionist aggression, describing it as a serious violation and a blatant and explicit aggression that breaches the executive procedures of Resolution 1701. 'Once again in less than a month, the Israeli enemy forces are carrying out a criminal aggression deep inside Lebanese territory, which resulted in the martyrdom of two people and the injury of two others. This constitutes a serious violation and a blatant and explicit aggression that breaches the executive procedures of Resolution 1701, which places the responsible parties concerned and guarantors of the implementation of the agreement before their responsibilities in firmly confronting the enemy’s violations of Lebanese sovereignty.' MP Al-Moussaiw affirmed that his persistent and systematic escalation by the enemy without any serious and responsible action by the international guarantors shows their indifference or inability at best, and confirms the enemy’s disavowal of any serious obligations and its lack of respect for the international community as a whole. 'The Lebanese state, represented by the presidency, the government and the army, is requested to take immediate action by all available means to quickly put an end to the Zionist criminality and stop this ongoing aggression on the Lebanese and violation of the sovereignty of the state over its lands.' If the criminal attacks against Lebanon by the enemy continue without the international community taking deterrent punitive measures or condemning the enemy and obligating it to respect the approved agreements and understandings, it shall be considered an encouragement to it to continue its acts of aggression, according to MP Al-Mouusawi who added that this may turn to be an implicit acceptance and collusion with it in the policy of killing, destruction, bulldozing and violation of sovereignty, which is completely condemned and contradicts the simplest principles of respecting the sovereignty of states and protecting their peoples and properties. The Zionist border violations also included throwing flares at the outskirts of Naqoura and Alma Al-shaab.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2349151	2025-02-25T11:32:15-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00168520017405119261.jpg

Five Occupation Posts in South Lebanon Source of Fear: Israeli Ci...	The Israeli media covered up the issue of the northern settlements few days before the government decision to return the displaced settlers takes effect, highlighting the large-scale case of confusion and fear. Around 100 thousand settlers were evacuated from the North when Hezbollah started its border battle against the Zionist enemy in support of Gaza on October 8, 2023. March 1 is the set date for the return of the settlers who cast doubts on the government intention to rebuild the houses and infrastructure facilities in the northern settlements which lie zero to five kilometers away from Lebanon borders. The Zionist failure to eradicate Hezbollah threat during the all-out war on Lebanon exacerbated the situation of the northern settlements which witnessed a massive destruction caused by Hezbollah missiles. Talia Corland, a settler from Al-Manara settlement, said: 'I lost my house, and darkness prevails at night in Al-Manara. We are not sure if the government would help in the reconstruction of the many destroyed buildings.' Kiryat Shmona settler, Shern Ohaion, said that the Israeli government obliged her to return to the settlement despite her rejection and concerns about the future of her children in the area. Avichai stern, Kiryat Shmona mayor, said that the Israeli government is trying to return the settlers at any expense, wondering what would happen when the Zionist troops complete their withdrawal from Lebanon. The Israeli media indicated that discussions run by various circles in the Zionist entity estimated that Hezbollah would not give an open-ended chance for the Lebanese government to seek diplomatically the Israeli withdrawal. i24 Channel mentioned that Hezbollah would try to target the five Israeli occupation posts in South Lebanon and that no one know when that would happen. The Zionist media affirmed that the US administration has approved the Israeli occupation of the five posts in South Lebanon, adding that the Americans have granted 'Israel' the permission to strike any target inside Lebanon. It is worth noting that the Zionist enemy completed its withdrawal from South Lebanon on February 18, 2025, keeping five occupation positions in Mount Jal Al-Deir (Aitaroun), Al-Hamames Hill (Al-Khiam), Mount Blat (between Ramyah and Marwaheen), Houla-Markaba Main Road, and Al-Labbouneh Hill (Outskirts of Naqoura and Alma Al-Shaab).	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2349019	2025-02-25T09:52:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07987610017405059369.png
Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah’s Funeral: A Farewell of Defiance, A Lega...	A massive sea of mourners flooded the streets of Beirut on the historic day of February 23, 2025, honoring the funeral of martyred Hezbollah Secretaries-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Sayyed Hashem Safieddine. The location: Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium. The numbers: over 1.4 million people from more than 80 countries, including numerous Arab and international delegations. They gathered to pay their final respects and express unwavering loyalty to the resistance and its fallen leader. Amid emotional scenes, the stadium and surrounding areas echoed with thunderous chants as clenched fists were raised toward the sky, reaffirming the covenant of loyalty. It was a moment where grief merged with resolve, and sorrow stood hand in hand with strength. Beirut’s Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium buzzes with devoted mourners (Feb. 23, 2025) 'Today, we bid farewell to an exceptional, historic leader, a national, Arab, and Islamic figure who has become a symbol of freedom for oppressed people around the world,' Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem told the massive crowd. He added, 'This gathering is an unparalleled expression of loyalty in Lebanon’s history.' 'Sayyed Hassan’s steadfast commitment to the resistance centered on Palestine and Jerusalem, and he played a pivotal role in revitalizing this cause, sacrificing his life on the front lines,' Qassem emphasized. 'We will honor his legacy, continue on this path, and uphold his will—no matter the cost.' The Hezbollah leader also stated that 'Israel' 'can no longer sustain its occupation and aggression,' declaring that the resistance is 'entering a new phase—one that requires new tools, strategies, and approaches.' Sheikh Qassem underscored that the armed resistance remains strong, ever-ready, and firmly rooted in international law—its legitimacy unshakable by any foreign power. He insisted that Israel must withdraw from all occupied territories, affirming that the resistance is 'written in blood, not ink on paper.' Addressing the enemy, he declared, 'Writhe in your anger. The resistance stands strong and unwavering.' The event drew numerous political, diplomatic, and religious figures from Lebanon and beyond, reflecting broad international participation. Among the attendees were Lebanese officials, including Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, as well as representatives of President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam. A high-profile Iranian delegation, led by Speaker Mohammad Qalibaf and Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, took part, along with a four-member team representing Iran’s Supreme Leader Sayyed Ali Khamenei. Iraqi and Yemeni delegations also played a prominent role, reaffirming their solidarity with Lebanon and its resistance. Palestinian resistance factions participated to renew their commitment to the struggle against Israeli occupation. Additionally, revolutionaries and supporters from countries spanning from Indonesia to Venezuela attended, demonstrating global solidarity with Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and the broader resistance movement. The blessed coffins of the two Secretary-Generals carried on a hearse made it through the great crowd, relaying messages unspoken by Sheikh Naim. Messages from the souls of millions to their enemy, who arrogantly laid claim to the sky in same fighter jets that committed the heinous act of murdering the two great leaders and their comrades in the midst of a crowded residential area still bustling with the same people that then stood in the stadium to tell them thus: 'We, without him, yet remain.' The message given by the people is one echoed by the many sacrifices that several groups of them gave, groups who were honored in the great event. First, without marking any sort of hierarchy, came the families of the thousands of martyrs that transcended to the beyond in this battle and all the battles that came before it. Their shoulders, adorned with sashes honoring their sacrifices glinted in the center of the stadium underneath the bright sun, signaling their acceptance of Allah’s great will and their readiness to continue giving all of what is most dear to them for this beautiful journey. Second, the many wounded fighters and civilians who literally and figuratively sacrificed life and limb to be there in that moment. Many of whom had their eyesight, hands and fingers stolen by the treachery of the enemy during the pager and handheld radio attacks that injured and killed both civilian and soldier. They, with eyes and hands concealed behind bands emblazoned with the revolutionary mottos of Karbala and the great Imam, Imam Hussein (as), were there to say that they would fight even if the battle took each of their five senses away.

In the Shia religion, respect for martyrs and veterans is an important principle pic.twitter.com/qwBAKOU0Aa — Abshar Tasnim (@Abshar_Tasnim2) February 24, 2025 Third, the warriors who faced the enemy at every valley, mountain peak, fjord and ravine stomped their boots against the ground in defiance as they carried their dearly beloved leader for one final time to his resting place. In their unwavering stance, in their covered faces and stern brows, in the folds of their tempered bodies lies the message they carry to the enemy and the responsibility they inherit from the great Sayyed Hasan and his comrades who came before him, a message of immortal vigilance over the people they are entrusted with. National, international, continental, heroic and self-sacrificial were the titles of the directives that littered the inside and outside of the stadium, messages from the masses and from individuals who dared not to miss those moments for the world. Moments which they all fought, struggled, traveled and patiently waited for, now a reality they all experienced together. As the sun set over Beirut, the funeral of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Sayyed Hashem Safieddine became more than a moment of mourning—it was a declaration of resilience, unity, and defiance. From Lebanon to the farthest reaches of the world, the presence of millions affirmed that the resistance is not tied to a single leader but is an undying force carried in the hearts of those who believe in its cause. The chants, the vows, and the steadfast gazes of the attendees sent a resounding unified message: the struggle continues, the legacy endures, and the path carved in sacrifice will not be abandoned. In the face of adversity, the resistance stands unshaken, ready for the battles ahead, with the spirit of its fallen leaders guiding its every step.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2348997	2025-02-25T07:43:34-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01555610017403255724.jpg

Israeli Enemy Flies Swarm of War Jets at Low Altitude over Martyr...	Outraged by the historical funeral of the Master of the Nation's Martyrs Martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and Hashemite Martyr Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, the Israeli enemy attempted to intimidate the sea of mourners in Beirut by flying a swarm of war jets at low altitude over Beirut.

The delegation, led by the leader's representative in Iraq, Ayatollah Sayyed Mojtaba Al-Husseini, included Ayatollah Sheikh Mohammad Hasan Akhtari, Sheikh Mohsen Qomi, and Sayyed Reza Taqavi. In a letter recited by Ayatollah Husseini, Imam Khamenei paid tribute to Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, describing him as 'a great mujahid and a pioneering resistance leader in the region.' His eminence declared that 'Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah (God bless his soul) has now reached the pinnacle of honor. His pure body is laid to rest in the land of jihad for the sake of Allah, but his soul and his path will shine ever brighter with each passing day, illuminating the way for those who follow.' Addressing the Israeli enemy, Imam Khamenei affirmed that 'resistance against oppression, tyranny, and arrogance will endure and will not cease until the ultimate goal is achieved, God willing.' He also honored martyred Secretary General Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, saying, 'His blessed name and luminous face will remain a shining star in the history of this region. He was a loyal and devoted supporter, an inseparable part of the leadership of the resistance in Lebanon.' Imam Khamenei concluded his letter with a heartfelt tribute: 'May the peace of Allah and His righteous servants be upon these two towering fighters and upon all the courageous resistance fighters who have recently risen as martyrs, as well as upon all the martyrs of Islam. I send my special greetings to you, my dear sons, the valiant youth of Lebanon.'

Hezbollah’s Sheikh Qassem Promises Sayyed Nasrallah: Resistance W...	In a moment of historic significance, Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem addressed the massive crowds mourning the martyrdom of Sacred Martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and his companion, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine. Speaking via video screens at Beirut’s Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium, Sheikh Qassem delivered a powerful speech, pledging that the resistance would endure despite all sacrifices. Saluting the throngs of mourners, he declared, 'O’ most honorable people, you have upheld the covenant!' His eminence emphasized Sayyed Nasrallah’s pivotal role in leading the resistance to the nation and uniting the nation with the resistance. A Tribute to Hezbollah's Great MartyrSayyed Nasrallah, Sayyed Hashem Sheikh Qassem honored Hezbollah martyred secretary general Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah as 'a historic and unparraleld leader—a beacon for the free people of the world, a beloved figure among the resistance fighters, the oppressed, and the downtrodden.' 'He was a man who led the resistance to the nation and the nation to the resistance, with his unwavering focus always on Palestine and Al-Quds,' his eminence added. Sheikh Qassem highlighted that Sayyed Nasrallah assumed the presidency of Hezbollah’s Executive Council in 1989 before becoming Secretary General in 1992, a position he held until the day of his martyrdom. 'This great man was wholly devoted to Islam and Wilayah to Ahlul Bayt (AS). He was sincere, loyal, compassionate, generous, humble, resolute, courageous, wise, strategic, and deeply beloved by the resistance fighters.' A Solemn Pledge of Loyalty In a heartfelt vow to the martyred leader, Sheikh Qassem pledged, 'We will honor your will. We will continue on this path, even if we are all martyred and even if our homes are destroyed over our heads.' He further praised Sayyed Nasrallah’s unwavering commitment to the Palestinian cause, affirming: 'Sayyed Nasrallah's contribution to reviving the Palestinian cause was immense, and we will remain steadfast in this covenant.' Sheikh Qassem also extended his condolences and congratulations to the families of the two great martyrs, the families of all resistance martyrs, and their supporters. Resistance and the Struggle for Palestine Reaffirming Hezbollah’s unwavering stance on Palestine, Sheikh Qassem asserted that 'Palestine is our right and our compass. We support its liberation and will confront Trump’s displacement scheme. Lebanon is the final homeland for its people, and we are its people.' 'The sacrifices we have made are unparalleled, just as the level of Israeli criminality in Gaza and the region is unprecedented. The battle to support Gaza is part of our belief in liberating Palestine.' 'The Israeli enemy aimed to eliminate the resistance in both Gaza and Lebanon, but the scale of sacrifices was immense, and the resilience was unparalleled—this is a great achievement.' A New Phase Sheikh Qassem emphasized that the resistance remains strong in numbers and capabilities. 'Our people remain strong. Now, we have entered a new phase—one with different tools and methods,' his eminence declared. Sheikh Qassem sent a direct and clear message to Washington saying, 'Your project is doomed. You will not achieve through politics what you failed to accomplish on the battlefield.' Israeli Occupation Blatant Ceasefire Violations Addressing the ongoing battle along Lebanon’s southern border, Sheikh Qassem revealed that despite deploying over 75,000 soldiers, the Israeli enemy has failed to enter Lebanese territory. His eminence accused the Israeli enemy of repeatedly violating the ceasefire agreement while reaffirming Hezbollah’s commitment to it. 'We are facing a brutal occupation and relentless aggression. Yet, the resistance remains strong and unwavering. The inevitable victory is coming,' his eminence stated. Sheikh Qassem made a firm promise to Lebanese prisoners held by the Israeli occupation, vowing, 'We will not abandon you. We will exert all necessary pressure to secure your freedom.' Sheikh Qassem also outlined Hezbollah’s strategic approach to the confrontation. 'We have taken a clear step: the Lebanese state must assume its responsibilities. As for us, we will act according to circumstances—we will open fire when we see fit, and we will exercise patience when we see fit,' his eminence declared. Defying US Pressure, Challenging Sovereignty Advocates Sheikh Qassem directly addressed the United States, warning that its schemes would fail. He urged Washington to abandon its conspiracies, emphasizing that patience should not be mistaken for weakness, as Hezbollah would never accept occupation in silence. Turning to Lebanese advocates of sovereignty, he questioned their silence in the face of Israeli and US aggression. He challenged them to reflect on their inaction, asking, 'Where were you when an agreement was possible? Why do we hear no condemnation from you against the Israeli enemy?' Hezbollah’s Unwavering Commitment Reaffirming Hezbollah’s ideological roots, Sheikh Qassem declared the party’s allegiance to the path of resistance, tracing its lineage to Imam Khamenei, Imam Khomeini, Imam Sayyed Musa Sadr, Sayyed Abbas Al-Mousawi, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, Hajj Qassem Soleimani, and Hajj Imad Mughniyeh. He reiterated that resistance remains the foundation and will persist as long as occupation continues. At the same time, Hezbollah remains committed to building a strong and just Lebanese state under the Taif Agreement, upholding national unity, civil peace, and inclusive governance. He also reaffirmed Hezbollah’s unbreakable alliance with the Amal Movement, warning against attempts to divide them: 'Our bond is sealed with blood. We stand as one in position, choices, and politics.' A Final Farewell to Sayyed Nasrallah Concluding his speech, Sheikh Qassem bid a final farewell to the martyred leaders, saying, 'Rest in God's peace, O Sayyed Nasrallah, alongside your loyal companion, Sayyed Safieddine. Rest with the prophets and the martyrs&#8230; This is a day of God, a day like the one of Imam Hussain (AS), O' grandsons of Imam Hussain.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2347226	2025-02-23T05:34:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00040920017403174178.jpg

‘Israel’ Delays Release of Palestinian Prisoners After Hamas Hand...	The Israeli government has reportedly postponed the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, despite a recent prisoner swap with Hamas. According to reports, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to delay the release of the seventh group of Palestinian prisoners, citing the need for further consultations 'based on the goal of returning all of our hostages - the living and the dead.' The decision comes after Hamas handed over six Israeli captives to ‘Israel’ on Saturday, as part of the initial 42-day phase of the ceasefire agreement that took effect on January 19th. Under the agreement, 33 Israeli captives were to be released in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. However, with four Israeli captives still remaining to be released in the first phase, Netanyahu has now decided to hold off on the planned release of 602 Palestinian prisoners, pending further discussions. 🛑Breaking | The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office: 'We have decided to suspend the release of Palestinian prisoners until we ensure the liberation of the next hostages without provocative ceremonies.' pic.twitter.com/8UpzlY3UMJ — Eye on Palestine (@EyeonPalestine) February 22, 2025 The delay has angered the families of the Palestinian prisoners, who are now organizing protests to demand that Israel honor the terms of the ceasefire deal and proceed with the planned prisoner release. In a statement, Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou urged ‘Israel’ to 'remain committed to the remaining terms of the agreement and the implementation of the humanitarian protocol.' He warned that the catastrophic situation in Gaza requires 'mediators to pressure the occupation to implement the humanitarian protocol and provide our people with shelter and relief supplies.' The Palestinian resistance group has previously warned that it could delay the release of Israeli captives if the Israeli occupation military violates the ceasefire deal.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2346027	2025-02-22T22:44:44-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-067688600174004439410.jpeg

Six Days in War Crowned Hashemite Martyr’s Decades of Hezbollah I...	The martyrdom of the great Islamic fighting leader, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, represents the pinnacle of sacrifice and a beacon for generations to continue on the path of resistance, the path walked by the great martyr leader His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah …' On October 23, Hezbollah issued the statement which eulogizes the second Secretary General Hashemite Martyr Sayyed Hashem Saffiedine in face of the barbaric Israeli war on Lebanon in 2024. Rarely do organizations, governments and various public bodies have their leaders on the top of sacrifice. Hezbollah has been presenting the brilliant sample of leaders who reject to hide behind in the rear lines of the military confrontation. The challenge of the martyrdom of Sayyed Nasrallah on September 27 was an extravagantly heavy load on Hezbollah command leading a historical war of defense against the Israeli war on Lebanon. Announcing the decision to hold the funeral of the two great martyrs on February 23, 2025, Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem said that Sayyed Safieddine would be mourned in his capacity as a Secretary General. Sheikh Qassem highlighted that after being elected to the position just four days following Sayyed Nasrallah’s martyrdom, Sayyed Safieddine was martyred on October 3, 2024. Thus, Martyr Sayyed Safieddine assumed the military responsibility to maintain the steadfastness of the resistance in the confrontation with the enemy by ensuring the missile fire. The grave danger did not lead the new commander to escape or hide in a safe position. His eminence insisted on leading the Islamic Resistance from the alternative operations chamber after the targeting the basic one and the martyrdom of Sayyed Nasrallah. Sayyed Safieddine had six days to lead the resistance before the treacherous Israeli warplanes targeted the alternative operations chamber. Member of Loyalty to Resistance bloc, Dr. Hasan Fadlallah, affirmed that Martyr Sayyed Safieddine rejected all the proposals which urged him to leave the operations room, adding that his eminence insisted on the importance of the leader's steadfastness. Institutional Resistance The Hashemite Martyr scribed numerous stories of success in the domain of Hezbollah's institutional resistance being the chief of the Party's Executive |Council, concerned with the social and economic institutions affiliated with Hezbollah. Hezbollah's main doctrine was based on protecting the people and securing their basic needs. Thus the Party struggled to attach the victory of the military resistance to a success in the domain of civil service. In this regard, Martyr Sayyed Safieddine followed the path of the martyred Secretary General of Hezbollah Sayyed Abbas Al-Moussawi, inspecting the poor neighborhoods in Beirut's Dahiyeh. On the basis of securing the people's needs, Martyr Sayyed Safieddine performed proficiently as the head of Hezbollah civil institutions in the fields of medicine, education, and finance. During his tenure, Hezbollah institutions witnessed a remarkable development, especially the medical sector which managed to successfully cope with the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in Lebanon. Upon the escalation of the economic siege on Lebanon in 2019, Hezbollah established Al-Sajjad cooperatives with a discount card that helps break the goods monopoly and provide the underpaid citizens with the needed commodities amid the great traces of Martyr Sayyed Safieddine. Educationally, Martyr Sayyed Safieddine contributed to the huge leap of Al-Mahdi Schools and the establishment of Al-Maaref University which also showed a steady and fast progress in the academic performance in Lebanon. Martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and Martyr Sayyed Hashem Safieddine attend the opening of Maaref University in 2015 The educated thinker and religious scholar spent half of 62-year lifetime fighting in defense of the Islamic Resistance and securing the needs of its supporters. The Hashemite martyr rejected to escape at the hardest moment of the 2024 Israeli war on Lebanon, showing unmatched bravery. This type of leaders that Hezbollah is proud of having continuously crowning the great jihadi journey, which descends from Karbala of Imam Hussein (A.S.) till either martyrdom or victory.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2345565	2025-02-22T07:58:03-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00328420017402398482.jpg

As the first phase of the exchange deal progresses, the negotiations for the second phase are ongoing, with the United States setting a two-week goal for Hamas and the Israeli occupation to reach an agreement. The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has stressed its commitment to the ceasefire agreement, emphasizing that the reconstruction of Gaza must be done with national consensus and without external interference.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2345312	2025-02-22T01:58:40-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-09247860017402182992.jpg
Trump Was Ready to Stop Military Aid to Ukraine over Zelensky’s I...	US President Donald Trump was reportedly so fed up with Vladimir Zelensky’s recent impudence that he was ready to pull US military assistance from Ukraine, three US officials close to the situation told Axios. Six administration officials told Axios that Zelensky also rubbed Vice President Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz the wrong way with his recent behavior. The portal's sources in the White House explained what has caused America's about-face on Zelensky. Thus, he refused to sign an agreement with the United States on rare earth metals and, as Trump noted, 'was rude' to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant during his visit to Kiev. At a security conference in Munich, Zelensky 'surprised' Vance and Rubio by claiming he could not personally approve the rare earth metals deal, publicly refusing to pursue it. Zelensky caused even greater indignation among the US administration with his ill-advised comments about the Russian-American consultations in Riyadh and his assertion that Ukraine should be at the negotiating table. Trump later called Zelensky a dictator, saying that his popularity with Ukrainians had tanked to 4%, and that elections should be held in Ukraine. The last straw, according to the portal's sources, was when the head of the Kiev regime said that Trump had become a 'victim of Russian disinformation,' which the White House considered an insult. In an interview with the National Pulse edition Vance slammed Zelensky for making derogatory comments publicly, noting that this is not a good way to deal with President Trump. On February 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin noted that Kiev's hysteria about its absence at the Russia-US negotiations was inappropriate, since Moscow and Washington had bilateral issues to discuss	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2345180	2025-02-21T13:36:17-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2020/12/manar-07429450016081960808.jpg
Hezbollah Will Neither Abandon Resistance Nor Let Lebanon Return ...	Deputy Chief of Hezbollah Executive Council Sheikh Ali Daamoush stressed that the Resistance Party rejects Lebanon's subjection to US-Israeli dictates and threats to strike Beirut's airport as well as vital facilities. Delivering Friday sermon, Sheikh Daamoush called on the Lebanese government to tackle the Iranian flights file as it pertains to Lebanon's sopvereignty and dignity. 'US-Israeli ban on the landing of the Iranian flights at Beirut's airport confiscates the Lebanese decision, blatantly intervenes in Lebanon's international relations, and paves way for more dictates which may never end,' his eminence said. Sheikh Daamoush also underlined Hezbollah would neither accept Israeli occupation of even an inch of the Lebanese territory nor abandon the resistance path which would be the response to the Zionist aggression. Hezbollah official underscored that Hezbollah will never let Lebanon return to the time of weakness, stressing that the nation has the right to defend itself by all means and at whatever cost. 'We are powerful thanks to our faith, will, determination and the bravery of our resistance, army and people.' Sheikh Daamoush also affirmed, 'We are invited on Sunday to attend the funeral of an exceptional, historic leader in a civilized scene.' The funeral will be neither a referendum to measure the popular support for the resistance whose role obtains legitimacy when the occupation exists, nor a way to restore prestige because it has not been lost, according to Sheikh Daamoush. Sheikh Daamoush confirmed that the funeral will be attended by the loyal supporters of the resistance who will reiterate commitment to the path of the martyred leader who spent his honorable life defending Lebanon, its sovereignty and national dignity, achieved victories, thwarted the enemy’s goals, held the cause of Palestine and the causes of the nation, and ascended as a martyr all the way to Al-Quds, truly deserving the title: Master of the Martyrs of the Nation. The day when Hezbollah martyred leaders Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and Sayyed Hashem Safeiddine will be laid to rest won’t be forgotten by the free people of the world, the committee tasked with organizing the funeral announced on Friday. In a press conference, the committee’s Head Hussein Fadlallah tackled the final preparations of the funeral held on Sunday at Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2345147	2025-02-21T11:17:03-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-08017930017401654092.png

In an interview with UNews on Friday, Bzeih revealed that she was harassed by the security forces who also requested her relative to delete the filmed video. She was among the Lebanese nationals who were stranded in Iran over Israeli threats to target the airport if the Iranian plane carrying them would land in the facility last week.

Hamas: Ceasefire Talks Stall as Netanyahu Refuses to Negotiate fo...	The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas has accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of procrastinating on negotiations for the second phase of the ceasefire deal in Gaza. According to Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif Al-Qanou, the 'second phase negotiations have not practically begun, and we are ready to engage in them as stipulated in the agreement.' Al-Qanou stressed that Hamas remains 'committed to the ceasefire agreement as long as the Israeli occupation is committed to it.' Hamas stated that talks with Israel on the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal have not yet started. 'Netanyahu is deliberately stalling the implementation of the second phase of the ceasefire agreement,' Hamas spokesperson Abdullatif Al-Qanou said. Israel continues to… pic.twitter.com/9O6YI2iSXa — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) February 21, 2025 The ceasefire, which was reached last month after 15 months of devastating conflict, consists of three phases, with the first phase involving the release of 33 Israeli captives in exchange for around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. However, the talks on the second phase, which were supposed to begin on February 3, have yet to materialize. Netanyahu's Refusal to Negotiate Leads to Captives' Deaths The stalled negotiations come amid growing public outrage over the return of four Israeli captives, including a mother and her two children, who were killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza during the 15-month war. Hamas has accused Netanyahu of being responsible for their deaths, stating that the 'criminal Netanyahu is crying today over the bodies of his prisoners who returned to him in coffins.' The opposition has also blamed Netanyahu for the captives' deaths, arguing that he stalled the prisoner swap for months to avoid jeopardizing his fragile coalition, which includes far-right ministers pushing for the continuation of the war in Gaza. The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and his former minister of military affairs Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. Additionally, the International Court of Justice is considering accusations that Israel committed genocide in its war on Gaza. As the ceasefire talks remain in limbo, the people of Gaza continue to grapple with the aftermath of the devastating conflict, which claimed the lives of at least 48,319 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured 111,749 others.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2344806	2025-02-21T02:25:51-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2016/09/manar-07632360014745454023-e1698484116887.jpeg

Three Bus Explosions Rock Occupied Tel Aviv, Triggering Panic Amo...	Three buses exploded on Thursday evening at different locations in the 'Bat Yam' settlement, south of the occupied city of 'Tel Aviv,' sending shockwaves across the Israeli entity. According to Israeli media, the 'Shin Bet' has launched an investigation into the suspected placement of explosive devices inside the buses, which reportedly caused the blasts. Zionist officials also confirmed the discovery of two additional unexploded devices. In response to the explosions, train services in Bat Yam were entirely suspended. Israeli so-called security forces issued urgent instructions for all bus drivers in the 'Tel Aviv' area to inspect their vehicles, with media reports suggesting that a large-scale operation had been planned. Zionist Authorities Scramble to Contain the Situation The Bat Yam municipality confirmed that two of the explosions occurred at bus stops while the vehicles were unoccupied, resulting in no injuries. However, Zionist officials acknowledged that the full details remain unclear and that extensive search and precautionary measures are underway to rule out any further threats. Meanwhile, Israeli enemy police issued a statement confirming that they suspect a deliberate attack, citing the multiple bus explosions. A wide number of Israeli occupation security forces were deployed to the affected sites, launching a manhunt for possible suspects while bomb disposal teams examined suspicious objects in the area. Growing Panic Among Settlers Israeli media later reported that another explosive device was discovered inside a bus at the 'Yamit 2000' amusement park near Tel Aviv, escalating fears of further incidents. Public anxiety surged, with widespread reports of additional bomb threats at multiple locations around the city following the Bat Yam explosions. The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth cited preliminary assessments indicating that the bus explosions in Bat Yam were an act of resistance.

Fierce Clashes Erupt as Israeli Occupation Forces Raid West Bank,...	The Israeli occupation forces (IOF) stormed several cities and refugee campsin the occupied west bank, resulting in deadly confrontations with Palestinian resistance fighters. The raids began in the city of Nablus, where the IOF descended upon the vicinity of the National Hospital, the eastern district, the Askar refugee camp, and the town of Beita. However, the IOF were met with fierce resistance, as Palestinian fighters detonated an improvised explosive device (IED) in the Askar camp, leading to an exchange of fire.

Supreme Leader Says Iran’s Definite Policy is to Expand Ties with...	Leader of the Islamic Revolution Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei has said expanding ties with neighboring countries remains the 'definite policy' of the Islamic Republic, as he received Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in Tehran. The Qatari Emir arrived in Tehran earlier in the day on an official visit and sat down for talks with President Masoud Pezeshkian before meeting Ayatollah Khamenei. 'One of the policies announced by the administration of Mr. Pezeshkian is the expansion of ties with neighbors,' Ayatollah Khamenei said during the meeting, which was also attended by President Pezeshkian. He noted that the Pezeshkian administration has already taken good measures to enhance relations with neighboring countries, achieving some level of progress thus far. Ayatollah Khamenei expressed hope that the agreements reached earlier in the day between Iranian and Qatari officials would benefit both countries, enabling them to fulfill their 'neighborly duties' more effectively. In his remarks, the Leader emphasized that Iran considers Qatar a 'friendly and brotherly country,' despite some 'unclear and unresolved' matters, including the issue of frozen Iranian assets. Approximately $6 billion in Iranian funds remain frozen under U.S. sanctions and are currently held in a Qatari bank after being released by South Korea in September 2023. The Leader criticized the United States for obstructing the agreement to return the funds to Iran. 'We know that the U.S. is the main obstacle to the implementation of an agreement that had been reached in this regard,' he said, adding that Iran expects Qatar to resist pressure from Washington and return Iran’s assets. For his part, Qatar’s Emir expressed satisfaction with his meeting with Ayatollah Khamenei and praised the Leader for Iran’s support of the Palestinian people. He acknowledged the ongoing tensions in the West Asia region, saying regional countries should cooperate more to address the current situation. The Emir also referred to the agreements reached between Iran and Qatar, and said the two countries will soon establish a joint commission to increase the volume of bilateral trade. Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian held on Wednesday constructive talks with Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani who arrived in Tehran on a state visit to hold talks with Iranian officials in order to discuss regional issues and deepen bilateral relations between the two neighboring countries.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2343816	2025-02-19T11:19:40-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-057342900173999274110.jpg
Archbishop Hanna: Palestine is Loyal to Martyr Sayyed Nasrallah’s...	Archbishop Atallah Hanna, Archbishop of Sebastia for the Greek Orthodox in occupied Palestine delivered a message in eulogy of the Nation’s Master of Martyrs, Hezbollah Secretary-General His Eminence, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah. 'Dear beloved, in a few days, Lebanon will witness a great and exceptional event—the funeral of His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and the martyrs who were with him. From Al-Quds, we stand in reverence and honor for the sacrifices of His Eminence Sayyed Nasrallah, his companions, and his associates—those who stood with Palestine, defended Palestine, and paid a heavy price for Palestine. We are loyal to these sacrifices; all Palestinians are loyal to the sacrifices of His Eminence and his comrades,' he said. 'As we offer our condolences and send a message of sympathy from the heart of our sacred city, we affirm that we will never forget those who stood with Palestine and defended it in the darkest times and the most difficult circumstances. Today, there is a conspiracy against the Palestinian cause. Our enemies seek to displace our people and liquidate our cause, but Palestinians will not raise the flag of surrender. They remain steadfast in their rights, principles, and convictions. The word 'surrender' does not exist in our Palestinian vocabulary.' 'Dear beloved, we are all one family, one nation, standing against colonial projects that do not target Palestine alone but the entire nation. Our message has always been and will always be that Palestine is the compass. Those whose compass is Palestine are in the right place, and those whose compass is elsewhere are in the wrong place. We call upon them to correct their deviation and realign their compass in the right direction,' Archbishop Hanna added. 'Dear beloved, our message in these times is that we must be united as a nation—Christians, Muslims, and all sects and denominations. They want us to be fragmented and divided, to speak the language of sectarianism, and to be internally divided so that they can pass their projects under the well-known colonial strategy of 'divide and rule.' They seek to fragment us to facilitate their colonial plans that target Palestine and the entire nation.' 'We, Christians and Muslims in this East, will remain one nation. Our compass is Al-Quds, our cause is Palestine, and we must not allow anyone or any entity to advance their schemes aimed at further division and fragmentation. We are one family—this is how we were, and this is how we shall remain,' Archbishop Hanna concluded.

In particular, as reported in early February, forces of the 11th Separate Air Assault Brigade, the 810th Separate Marine Infantry Brigade, the Veterans and Arbat volunteer formations, UAV operators of the Rubicon Center, the 40th Separate Marine Infantry Brigade and the 177th Separate Marine Infantry Regiment participated in repelling eight waves of Ukrainian army attacks. Putin has stated on many occasions that the Russian troops fighting in the Kursk direction are operating efficiently, competently and audaciously.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2343706	2025-02-19T07:41:20-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/02/manar-015138000167639631010.jpg

IRGC Busts Vast Espionage Network Linked to US, ‘Israel’ in North...	The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander of Iran's Mazandaran province has announced that intelligence services from the US, ‘Israel’, and other adversarial countries have been actively trying to infiltrate Iran using foreign nationals and frequent travelers as cover. IRGC provincial commander Brigadier General Siavash Moslemi announced the successful crackdown on Wednesday, stating that the operation not only foiled significant security threats but also prevented potential crises from unfolding. IRGC dismantles Israeli-US linked networks in northern Iran pic.twitter.com/yYZmstv9kJ — IRNA News Agency (@IrnaEnglish) February 19, 2025 According to Moslemi, intelligence services from the US, ‘Israel’, and other hostile nations have been actively attempting to infiltrate Iran by posing as foreign nationals and displaced persons. Many of these foreign agents were operating under the guise of commercial companies, cultural centers, and charities, seeking to collect classified data and establish influence networks within the country. However, IRGC forces were able to identify and dismantle the espionage cells through meticulous intelligence monitoring, the commander added. This latest takedown comes on the heels of other recent IRGC operations against foreign spy networks. In January, the elite force arrested members of a network involved in gathering information about sensitive Iranian facilities in Khuzestan province for a foreign intelligence agency. In December, the IRGC also apprehended an individual in Ardabil province on charges of affiliation with the spy agency of a neighboring country. Additionally, Iran's Intelligence Ministry announced in late October that it had dismantled a separatist group linked to the Israeli regime that was planning to infiltrate the country from Iraqi Kurdistan in order to incite street riots and carry out assassinations. One of the group's key members was killed, while two others were arrested, and their weapons were confiscated during the operation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2343442	2025-02-19T05:12:55-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00858110017399707694.jpg

Many Israeli Fathers and Mothers Will Cry Because of Five Posts i...	It is surely needless to recall that the Zionist entity has always evaded commitment to the resolutions of the legitimacy institutions in the world and the international laws since its very existence is illegitimate. The wicked essence of Zionism makes power the only way for the states and people affected by the Israeli barbarism to regain their rights. The resistance groups in Lebanon and Palestine have been a conspicuous instance. In the same context, the ceasefire agreement in South Lebanon, concluded on November 27, 2024, stipulates the full Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon. However, the Zionist enemy decided to keep five occupations posts within the Lebanese territories in South Lebanon after the extended withdrawal deadline on February 18. The Israeli occupation army alleged that the five posts will remain temporarily in an attempt to reduce the effects of the major breach of the agreement on Tel Aviv diplomatically. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun held an emergency meeting at the Baabda Presidential Palace with Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam to address the latest developments along Lebanon’s southern border and the escalating Israeli violations. The leaders reaffirmed Lebanon’s unified national stance, emphasizing the urgent need for Israeli occupation forces’ full withdrawal from occupied Lebanese territories in accordance with international treaties and UN resolutions, particularly Resolution 1701. They also reiterated Lebanon’s full commitment to the resolution in its entirety while condemning Israel’s repeated breaches of its provisions. Despite the five occupation posts, the residents of the southern towns of Yaroun, Maroun al-Ras, Blida, Mays al-Jabal, Houla, Markaba, Adaisseh, Kfar Kila, and al-Wazzani entered their villages and towns after the Israeli enemy had been defeated. Al-Manar reporter Ali Shoeib highlighted the grandiosity of the scene of the Zionist withdrawal and the residents' return to the border villages, stressing that the five occupation posts do not have any military significance. Shoeib added that the Israeli enemy wants the five posts to reassure the Zionist settlers before their scheduled return to the border settlements on March 1. However, Metula mayor told the settlements' displaced residents to avoid returning due to the security threats in the region. Israeli media outlets indicated that the settlers may not be reassured by the five occupation posts in South Lebanon, adding that they will likely see Hezbollah convoys near the borders soon. Maariv newspaper described the step of maintaining posts in South Lebanon as a strategic Israeli mistake, adding that many fathers and mothers will cry because of this move. It is worth noting that around 100 thousand settlers left northern Palestine because of Hezbollah attacks on Zionist targets in support of Gaza against the Israeli genocidal war. The Israeli media reports massive destruction of houses and infrastructure in the northern settlements because of Hezbollah fire.

‘Foolish’ American Plan for Gaza Will Lead Nowhere: Imam Khamenei	Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei says the United States’ 'foolish American plan' for Gaza will lead nowhere. Ayatollah Khamenei received the secretary-general of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement, Ziyad al-Nakhaleh, and his accompanying delegation in Tehran on Tuesday. The Leader congratulated the Palestinian resistance on their victory against Israel in Gaza, where the occupying regime has been forced to enter into a ceasefire agreement with Hamas after failing to dismantle the resistance groups, a chief objective of its genocidal war in the enclave. 'The great work of the leaders and fighters of the Palestinian resistance in creating unity and cohesion and steadfastness against the enemy, and moving the complex negotiations forward, along with the patience and perseverance of the (Palestinian) people, has brought honor to the resistance in the region,' Ayatollah Khamenei said. Ayatollah Khamenei noted that this victory has set 'a new benchmark' in resistance against the occupying regime. The Leader pointed out that the Israeli regime is now negotiating the release of its prisoners held in Gaza in exchange for a substantially larger number of Palestinian prisoners and with the same resistance groups that it had vowed to destroy going into the war. 'Currently, global public opinion is in favor of Palestine, and under these circumstances, no plan will succeed without the consent of the resistance and the people of Gaza,' he said. Ayatollah Khamenei was referring to a proposed plan by U.S. President Donald Trump to 'take over' Gaza after the enclave has been forcibly cleared of its more than two million residents. The plan has been widely rejected by both the Palestinians and the broader Arab world. During the meeting, Nakhalah congratulated Ayatollah Khamenei on the Palestinian victory and expressed gratitude for the Islamic Republic's continuous support of the resistance. 'The Palestinian resistance has, in fact, been at war with the United States and the West for the past year and a half,' he said. 'Despite the unequal balance of (military) power, the Palestinian resistance has been able to achieve great victories.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2342859	2025-02-18T07:40:41-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-06876130017398932317.jpg

Israeli occupation forces have intensified their military operations in the northern West Bank, inflicting casualties and detaining locals in the cities of Tulkarm and Nablus. According to eyewitness accounts, Israeli troops have tightened their siege on Tulkarm's eastern neighborhood, forcing residents to remain in their homes while raiding businesses and damaging infrastructure. Several Palestinians have also been detained at newly installed checkpoints on the roads connecting Tulkarm to nearby refugee camps.

This escalation is part of a broader Israeli occupation military campaign dubbed 'Operation Iron Wall' that was launched in January, targeting the Jenin area. The offensive has already displaced over 40,000 refugees from the Jenin, Nur Shams, and Al-Faraa camps, according to UNRWA. More than half of the 13,000 residents of the Nur Shams refugee camp have fled since the start of the Israeli operation on Saturday. UNRWA's Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini has warned that this displacement is the largest in the West Bank since 1967.

They also reiterated Lebanon’s full commitment to the resolution in its entirety while condemning Israel’s repeated breaches of its provisions. Lebanese Army’s Role in Defending Sovereignty The participants highlighted the essential role of the Lebanese Army, affirming its complete readiness to assume full responsibilities along the internationally recognized borders. This step is crucial to safeguarding national sovereignty, protecting the residents of southern Lebanon, and ensuring their security and stability. Citing International Commitments The meeting also recalled the joint statement issued by the Presidents of the United States and France on November 26, 2024, which reaffirmed commitments to security arrangements and the implementation of Resolution 1701. The leaders specifically noted the statement’s declaration: 'The United States and France will work with the Israeli enemy and Lebanon to ensure the full implementation of this arrangement.' Additionally, they referenced Clause 12 of the same statement, which explicitly outlined 'the implementation of a detailed plan for the phased withdrawal and redeployment between Israeli Occupation Forces and the Lebanese Armed Forces within a maximum of 60 days.' Clause 13 further emphasized that 'the United States and France understand that the Israeli enemy and Lebanon will accept the above commitments in parallel with this declaration.' Video shows Israeli enemy carries out a massive explosion in the southern town of Kfar Shouba on Feb. 18, 2025 Lebanon’s Next Steps in Response to Israeli Violations In light of the Israeli enemy's continued evasion of its commitments and persistent violations of international agreements, the Lebanese leadership announced the following measures: Appealing to the UN Security Council—Lebanon will formally request the Council, which endorsed Resolution 1701, to take necessary actions against Israeli violations and enforce an immediate Israeli withdrawal to the internationally recognized borders in line with the resolution and related declarations. Reaffirming Israel’s Presence as an Occupation: The continued Israeli presence on any part of Lebanese territory is deemed an occupation, carrying all legal consequences under international law. Pursuing Full Implementation of the November 27 Declaration: Lebanon will persist in its efforts through the Military Technical Committee and the Tripartite Mechanism to ensure the complete application of the declaration. Negotiating for the Release of Lebanese Prisoners: Lebanon will engage in discussions with the International Monitoring Committee and the International Red Cross to secure the release of Lebanese detainees held by the Israeli enemy. Finally, the Lebanese leadership reaffirmed the state’s unwavering commitment to its full national rights and sovereignty over all its territories, asserting Lebanon’s right to employ all necessary means to ensure the complete withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2342650	2025-02-18T03:59:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-06512810017398796766.jpg

Israeli Enemy Says Will Keep Five Occupation Posts in South Leban...	The Israeli enemy will complete early Tuesday its withdrawal from all South Lebanon towns and villages, yet it will keep five occupation positions within the Lebanese territories. The Israeli media outlets mentioned that the occupation army would finish its pull-out from Lebanon on Tuesday in the morning, adding that five Zionist posts would be kept within Lebanese territory under the pretext of protecting the border settlements from Hezbollah. Al-Manar reporter Ali Shoeib mentioned that the situation in the border area on Monday indicates that the enemy will complete its withdrawal by the end of the extended deadline, clarifying that the Zionist enemy did not carry out movements inside the villages. International Red Cross and the Lebanese Army managed to pull out the body of the martyr Khadija Atwi from inside the town of Houla still occupied by the Israeli enemy, knowing that the martyr died after she was left bleeding due to a Zionist gunshot inside her town on Sunday. Houla residents challenged the Israeli occupation and entered their hometown even before the Lebanese army. Meanwhile, the occupation forces have escalated their aggression on Lebanon hours before their withdrawal stipulated by the ceasefire, which took effect on November 27, 2024. Tuesday's violations were started by a vehicular incursion into KfarShouba town in the eastern sector of South Lebanon. Massive explosions were executed by the Israeli enemy in several towns, including Mays Al-Jabal, Yaroun, Teir Harfa, and Adaisseh. The Israeli enemy also carried out some construction works in Kfarkila, placing barbed wires along the border fence and a near gate and paving a road with base course materials. On the other hand, the Israeli warplanes and drones flew over several Lebanese towns, raiding Litani River course and Teir Harfa. Earlier, Israeli drones assassinated Hamas leader Mohammad Shaheen in the southern Lebanese city of Sidon. The strike hit his vehicle near the coastal corniche, just meters from a Lebanese Army checkpoint.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2342232	2025-02-17T11:44:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01611620017398214507.png

Lebanese nationals held a sit-in on Monday in the Iranian city of Qom protesting being stranded and unable to return home over Israeli threats after an Iranian plane was denied permission to land in Lebanon’s capital last week. The Lebanese nationals expressed their dissatisfaction with the government's decision that prevented them from returning to their homeland. Lebanese actor Mahdi Fakhreddin who is stranded in Iran demanded the provision of alternative options for the nationals, noting that many of those stranded have commitments in their homeland. For his part, Spokesman of the stranded Lebanese Sheikh Abbas Zgheib stressed that the Lebanese nationals’ right to return to their homeland and to freely move in their country, is preserved by the Lebanese constitution, urging the Lebanese President Joseph Aoun to act in a bid to get the stranded national back home. Thousands of Lebanese national head for Iran or reside in the Islamic Republic for pilgrimage, education or work there, with the Lebanese government hindering their return as it subduing to the US and Israeli dictations. Meanwhile, Lebanese Ambassador to Tehran Hasan Abbas said that communication is still ongoing between the Lebanese and Iranian authorities to secure the return of the Lebanese stranded in Iran since Thursday, following the Lebanese decision to prevent Iranian air carriers from landing at Beirut airport due to Israeli threats. In an interview with Al-Manar, the Lebanese ambassador said that the 'atmosphere is generally positive,' and that the foreign ministers of the Islamic Republic and Lebanon discussed the matter 'to ultimately find a way out of the crisis.' In this context, Abbas said that he is contacting the stranded citizens through the Lebanese Committee in Iran to secure their residence in the Islamic Republic and their return home soon. He explained that a number of travelers and families returned Lebanon via other countries, and that the remaining number is estimated at about two hundred people, most of whom were visiting the holy shrines. ⚡️⭕️ #Lebanon: Al-Mayadeen correspondent in Beirut: Protesters continue to block the airport road in protest against preventing an #Iranian plane from heading from Tehran to Beirut Under the orders of CENCTOM , Lebanese citizens are stranded in Iran as the Lebanese state… pic.twitter.com/0TB7YYwarB — Middle East Observer (@ME_Observer_) February 13, 2025	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2342023	2025-02-17T06:44:28-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-06865200017398030472.jpg
Israeli Occupation Used Palestinian Elderly as Gaza Human Shield:...	The Israeli occupation military forced an 80-year-old Palestinian man to act as a human shield in Gaza by tying an explosive cord around his neck and threatening to have his head blown off, an investigation has found. A senior officer from the occupation army’s Nahal Brigade tied the explosive cord around the man’s neck before he was ordered to scout houses the Israeli outlet The Hottest Place in Hell found in an investigation. After eight hours, soldiers ordered the man to flee with his wife from their home in Gaza City’s Zeitoun neighborhood in May, said +972 magazine, which reported the piece in partnership with The Hottest Place in Hell. But when another Israeli battalion spotted the elderly couple on the street, they were shot dead on the spot, according to Israeli occupation soldiers present at the scene. The Israeli soldiers had initially encountered the couple in their home. They told Arabic-speaking soldiers that they were unable to flee to southern Gaza due to mobility difficulties. But even in his condition, the soldiers forced the unnamed 80-year-old to walk ahead of them with his cane, while his wife was detained in their house. Additional details of the methods of warfare used in Gaza by the Israeli military and the deployment of civilians as human shields, then executed. The amount of evidence on the use of the practice in Gaza is unprecedented. It is clearly a military policy. pic.twitter.com/GbTagI6Wjy — Nicola Perugini (@PeruginiNic) February 16, 2025 A soldier told the investigation that the Israeli commander had decided to use the Palestinian couple as 'mosquitoes', referring to a procedure where the Israeli army forces Palestinian civilians to serve as human shields to protect the Israeli forces from being shot or blown up. 'He entered each house before us so that if there were [explosives] or a militant inside, he would [take the hit] instead of us,' one soldier said. 'He was told that if he did anything wrong or didn’t follow orders, the soldier behind him would pull the cord, and his head would be torn from his body.' The man was forced to act as a human shield for eight hours, before he was ordered, along with his wife, to walk towards the so-called 'humanitarian zone' in southern Gaza. But the soldiers did not care to tell nearby Israeli divisions that the couple was going to pass through the area, according to the testimonies. 'After 100 meters, the other battalion saw them and immediately shot them,' a soldier said. 'They died like that, in the street.' More reports emerge on the Israeli occupation army’s war crimes committed against the Palestinian people throughout 16 months of genocidal war in Gaza, with the atrocities of the so-called 'most moral army in the world' are being exposed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2341968	2025-02-17T05:16:33-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/12/manar-09560120017027419721.jpg
Video | Israeli Drone Strike Targets Hamas’ Mahmoud Shaheen in Le...	In a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement, an Israeli airstrike targeted a civilian vehicle on Monday morning in Sidon’s coastal corniche, just meters from a Lebanese Army checkpoint. Lebanese Army forces immediately cordoned off the area, later granting journalists access to document the targeted vehicle. The attack also triggered severe traffic congestion, as security measures led to road closures around the site. The Lebanese Health Ministry later confirmed that the strike claimed the life of one civilian, while emergency responders, including ambulances and fire brigades, rushed to the scene. This marks the first Israeli attack on Sidon since the ceasefire took effect on November 23 and the second strike within 24 hours, following the targeting of another civilian vehicle on Jarjouh Road in the Iqlim Al-Tuffah region. Later on Monday, Lebanon’s Al-Jamaa Al-Islamiya (Islamic Group) announced the martyrdom of Hamas military official Mahmoud Shaheen, who was killed in the Sidon airstrike.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2341814	2025-02-17T03:07:00-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00287420017397903525.jpg
Lebanese Residents Fearlessly Enter Houla Southern Town as Israel...	In a bold move, residents of the southern Lebanese town of Houla entered their hometown on Sunday without waiting for official authorization or directives. Pushing past Lebanese Army checkpoints and maneuvering through dirt mounds and trenches left by Israeli bulldozers, they made their way from the western entrance into the heart of the town. Al-Manar’s correspondent entered Houla, located along Lebanon’s southern border with occupied Palestine, to document the destruction left behind by Israeli forces before their withdrawal. As residents moved through most of the town’s neighborhoods, reaching roads leading to Mays Al-Jabal and Markaba, Israeli occupation forces launched a new assault. Residents enter the southern town of Houla (Feb. 16, 2025) IOF Block Lebanese Army, Red Cross from Evacuating Martyr’s Body Israeli occupation forces have denied entry to the Lebanese Army and the Red Cross into the center of Houla to retrieve the body of Khadija Atwi, who was killed earlier today by Israeli gunfire. The forces also prevented the evacuation of several trapped civilians, including the martyr’s sister. The Municipality of Houla has urgently called on the Lebanese Army, UNIFIL, and the International Red Cross to intervene swiftly and facilitate an immediate evacuation, warning that civilians may be forced to spend the night exposed to the elements. 🚨13-year-old Khadija Atwi, the daughter of Hezbollah martyr on the road to Al-Quds Hussein Mohamad Atwi, is the martyr who ascended in the town of Houla in southern Lebanon after the IOF opened fire on civilians, injuring several and kidnapping 5 people.

According to the statement, responders faced significant field challenges as Israeli forces barred ambulances from entering, forcing them to reach the wounded on foot. The Zionist forces opened fire directly on civilians in Houla, resulting in one fatality and the detention of five residents. Some of the captives were later released. Later on Sunday, Al-Manar’s correspondent reported that Israeli artillery targeted the southwestern outskirts of Houla with 120mm shells. Health Ministry Condemns Abduction of Paramedics The Lebanese Ministry of Public Health strongly condemned the abduction of paramedics affiliated with Islamic Scout Rescue by Israeli occupation forces. The paramedics were taken to an unknown location while carrying out their humanitarian duty of evacuating the wounded from the town of Houla. The ministry denounced the act as a 'blatant violation of international and humanitarian laws, which protect medical and emergency teams in the line of duty.' It called for the immediate release of the abducted paramedics and urged for the necessary protection of medical and emergency personnel while they perform their duties. Israeli Breaches Continue in Border Villages While resilient southerners reclaimed Houla, other border villages in the central sector—including Maroun Al-Ras, Yaroun, and the outskirts of Aytaroun—witnessed further Israeli violations throughout the day. Israeli occupation forces were spotted near the western outskirts of Maroun Al-Ras, specifically around the Hussainiyah Square area. The dirt road leading into the village had previously halted Israeli advances when residents mobilized in early protests. However, Israeli troops have now resumed fortification efforts, reinforcing dirt barriers south of the village. In recent days, Zionist forces have advanced toward Maroun al-Ras' northern outskirts, conducting excavation work along the main road. Since Saturday, occupation forces have returned to the village’s western periphery, intensifying earthworks and trench reinforcements. Israeli activity has been concentrated in the village’s western and southwestern outskirts, with troops advancing toward the border with occupied Palestine. Escalation Near Aitaroun and Eastern Border Movements At the border of Aitaroun, Israeli occupation forces have been constructing new dirt barriers on the high ground known as 'Jal Al-Deir.' Two Merkava tanks have been stationed atop these fortifications, and in recent days, Israeli troops have transported concrete blocks and installed surveillance and monitoring poles in the area. Meanwhile, in Yaroun, Israeli occupation forces have been absent for most of the day following two explosions that occurred in the village last night. Further east, Israeli tanks were seen maneuvering around Kfar Jouba, north of Kfar Shouba, near a local water reservoir. An Israeli bulldozer was also spotted carrying out excavation operations in the Al-Sadana area. Two Israeli Merkava tanks and a military bulldozer advanced into the vicinity of the water reservoir north of Kfar Shouba, carrying out excavation work in the Al-Sadana area (Feb. 16, 2025) Also on Sunday, the Israeli occupation army carried out a large explosion in the Al-Sadana area on the outskirts of Kfar Shouba	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2340978	2025-02-16T12:33:11-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01004240017397371018.jpg
Hezbollah’s Sheikh Qassem Warns Against Palestinian Displacement,...	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem reaffirmed on the anniversary of the group's martyred senior leaders that the Islamic Resistance will unwaveringly continue its journey, drawing strength from the legacy of its martyrs who paved the way for resilience and honor through their ultimate sacrifices. Opening his address on Sunday, Sheikh Qassem extended congratulations to the Muslim nation on the birth anniversary of the 12th Shiite Imam, the awaited Imam Mahdi (AS), reaffirming Hezbollah’s unwavering commitment to his banner—symbolizing truth and humanity. He also reflected on the 20th anniversary of the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, calling for the preservation of national unity in the face of adversity. Hezbollah Martyred Leaders: Icons of Resistance Sheikh Qassem honored the legacy of Hezbollah’s senior martyred leaders, beginning with martyr Sheikh Ragheb Harb, a beloved figure who stood with courage against the Israeli occupation in the early years of the Zionist invasion of Lebanon. His eminence emphasized that the Israeli invasion of 1982 aimed not only to uproot Palestinian resistance but was part of a broader effort to eliminate resistance in Lebanon and the region. However, the outcomes of this invasion were far from what the enemy had anticipated. Sheikh Qassem also paid tribute to martyr Sayyed Abbas Al-Mousawi, describing him as the very embodiment of a true resistance leader—always on the front lines, instilling an unwavering spirit of victory among the fighters. His eminence quoted martyr Sayyed Abbas’ iconic words: 'Kill us, and we will grow stronger.' Turning to the legendary martyr Hajj Imad Moghniyeh, Sheikh Qassem lauded his spiritual devotion, which guided Hezbollah's fighters. He highlighted Moghniyeh’s innovative strategies and expertise in both security and military fields. 'These martyred leaders shared a common ideology and mission, grounded in authentic Islamic values and an unyielding commitment to jihad in the face of injustice, with the Israeli enemy always their primary target,' Sheikh Qassem concluded. Stance on Palestinian Displacement On the political front, Sheikh Qassem deemed US President Donald Trump’s stance on the Palestinian issue as highly dangerous, aiming to eradicate Palestine and its people. He characterized these positions as a form of 'political genocide,' following the failure of the US-Israeli plans during Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. Hezbollah's Sheikh Qassem condemned any attempt to forcibly displace Palestinians from their land, firmly rejecting their relocation to Jordan, Egypt, or Saudi Arabia. Additionally, Sheikh Qassem warned that every action carried out by the Israeli enemy is under direct US management. His eminence called on Arab and Islamic nations to take a clear and decisive stance against this scheme, stressing the grave impact of the US plan on the entire region. Furthermore, he affirmed that Hezbollah is prepared to contribute to any Arab or Islamic initiative aimed at resisting the displacement of Palestinians. Lebanese Government and Sovereignty Affairs Regarding Lebanese internal issues, Sheikh Qassem expressed satisfaction with the formation of the Lebanese government, considering it a vital constitutional achievement. He emphasized the need for the proper functioning of constitutional institutions and highlighted the key role played by the national duo in ensuring the election of the President of the Republic. 'The Lebanese PM decided to prevent the Iranian plane from landing under the pretext of aviation and civilian safety, yet this was in execution of the Israeli decision,' Sheikh Qassem stated. Regarding the anticipated Israeli withdrawal on February 18, Sheikh Qassem firmly stated that there is no justification for the continued Israeli occupation of any part of Lebanese territory. His eminence called on the Lebanese state to adopt a firm and resolute stance, rejecting any potential compromises, including the so-called 'five positions.' Sheikh Qassem also highlighted Lebanon’s responsibility to rebuild what was destroyed by Israeli aggression. He reassured the people, stating that Hezbollah would not abandon them in efforts related to housing, restoration, or reconstruction. His eminence assured that homes would be rebuilt to even higher standards than before. Furthermore, Sheikh Qassem proposed that the government implement a system of administrative appointments based on competitive exams, selecting the most qualified individuals free from political quotas, to improve the efficiency of Lebanon’s administration. Iranian Aircraft and UNIFIL Discussing the Lebanese government's decision to prevent the landing of an Iranian plane in Beirut's Rafic Hariri Airport, Sheikh Qassem stated that this decision was in direct response to an Israeli directive, disguised under the pretext of 'aviation and civilian safety.' Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem statement on Feb. 16, 2025 His eminence called on the Lebanese government to reconsider this decision and adopt a more assertive, sovereign stance. Sheikh Qassem also reiterated Hezbollah's firm opposition to any attack on UNIFIL forces, emphasizing the importance of maintaining their safety and the peacekeeping mission. Additionally, he reaffirmed Hezbollah's full preparation for Sayyed Nasrallah’s funeral on February 23, with diverse participation, urging supporters for wide attendance and discipline.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2341451	2025-02-16T11:34:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-06446200017397342586.png

Hezbollah: The Army’s Use of Tear Gas Against Protesters Is a Rep...	In a statement, Hezbollah confirmed that the 'popular sit-in organized by the group yesterday to condemn Israeli interference in Lebanese affairs and the violation of national sovereignty was a peaceful movement and a civilized expression of a popular position rejecting unjustified submission to external dictates.' However, Hezbollah indicated that 'the protesters were surprised by some members of the Lebanese army firing tear gas bombs at them, in a reprehensible act that constitutes an unjustified attack on peaceful citizens. It is a suspicious attempt to drag the army into a confrontation with its people.' Expressing concern, Hezbollah called on the army leadership to urgently investigate this 'reprehensible attack' and take appropriate measures to preserve the military's role in protecting stability and civil peace. Hezbollah also called on the Lebanese government to fulfill its responsibilities in protecting peaceful protesters and their right to express their positions and demands. The group demanded the government reverse its decision to prevent an Iranian aircraft from landing at Beirut airport and take serious measures to prevent Israeli encroachment on national sovereignty. Condemning an incident that targeted the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) the previous day near Rafik Hariri International Airport, Hezbollah stressed its 'absolute rejection of any targeting' of UNIFIL or harm to public and private property. Thousands of Lebanese citizens participated in the Hezbollah-called sit-in on the old road leading to Beirut's airport, protesting Israeli violations of Lebanese sovereignty and refusing to submit to Israeli threats. The protesters also demanded the government facilitate the return of Lebanese citizens stranded in Tehran after authorities prevented an Iranian aircraft from landing in Beirut.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2340725	2025-02-16T04:47:49-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-001802500173971005910.jpg
Europe Will Not Be Part of Ukraine Peace Talks, US Envoy Says	The United States has indicated that Europe will not have a seat at the table for the upcoming Ukraine peace talks, according to Donald Trump's Ukraine envoy. Speaking at a global security conference in Munich, the envoy, Jim Kellogg, bluntly stated: 'I'm (from) a school of realism. I think that's not gonna happen' when asked about European participation. The news has sparked concerns among European leaders, who have insisted they must be involved in any negotiations that impact their own security. 'There's no way in which we can have discussions or negotiations about Ukraine, Ukraine's future or European security structure, without Europeans,' Finland's President Alexander Stubb told reporters. The US has taken an increasingly unilateral approach to the Ukraine conflict, with Trump shocking allies by calling Russian President Vladimir Putin without consulting European partners or the Ukrainian government. Trump administration officials have also made clear that they expect European NATO allies to take primary responsibility for the region, as the US shifts focus to issues like border security and countering China. This has fueled fears that Europe may be cut out of a peace deal that could significantly impact their interests, particularly if it is seen as too favorable to Russia. In a sign of the growing tensions, the US has sent a questionnaire to European capitals asking what they could contribute to security guarantees for Ukraine. 'The Americans are approaching European capitals and asking how many soldiers they are ready to deploy,' one European diplomat revealed. French President Emmanuel Macron is now discussing the possibility of an informal meeting among European leaders to coordinate their response. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte also urged Europeans to 'get into the debate' and come up with 'concrete proposals' rather than just complaining about being excluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2340670	2025-02-16T03:52:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-05140070017397067446.jpg

President of the Republic, General Joseph Aoun, received this afternoon Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, with whom he discussed several issues, including the Iranian flight crisis, Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon, and the ministerial statement. After the meeting, Salam addressed the reporters without giving clear answers about the ways to resolve the Iranian flight crisis. 'We will continue to mobilize all the diplomatic and political support that Lebanon can ensure to achieve this essential entitlement,' Salam said regarding the issue of the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon. He added, 'If anyone thinks that the attack on UNIFIL in the manner that occurred would help achieve the Israeli withdrawal on February 18, he is mistaken. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport on Saturday announced that intensive efforts were underway to facilitate the travel of Lebanese citizens to and from Tehran, as authorities work around the clock to resolve the situation. In a statement, the ministry said it was coordinating with relevant authorities to ensure the necessary arrangements for flights, particularly for those seeking to travel to or return from the Iranian capital. 'The Lebanese Civil Aviation Authority is currently awaiting clearance from Tehran’s airport authorities to allow Middle East Airlines (MEA) flights to land. The carrier is scheduled to operate three flights to Tehran later today,' the statement read. The ministry also noted that MEA flights scheduled for yesterday were postponed after failing to secure landing permits at Tehran International Airport. Reaffirming its commitment to ensuring the safe and swift return of Lebanese citizens, the ministry stressed that it remained in close coordination with the relevant authorities to expedite the process. 'All necessary measures are being taken to address the matter with the utmost urgency,' the statement concluded.

Hezbollah Concludes Beirut Airport Sit-in: Message Delivered	Upon Hezbollah call, huge crowds gathered Saturday on Old Beirut Airport road to protest against the the aviation authorities’ decision to prevent the Iranian plane Mahan, carrying Lebanese passengers, from landing at Rafik Hariri Airport after a threat issued by the Israeli enemy to target he flight. Holding a peaceful sit-in, the protesters chanted slogans which condemn the Israeli intervention and violation of the Lebanese sovereignty and urge teh authorities in Beirut to disobey the US-Zionist 'orders'. Deputy Head of Hezbollah politburo Mahmoud Komati hailed the crowds, stressing that 'our permanent slogan is 'Humiliation is far from us'.' Komati indicated that Hezbollah is patient, but that patience is limited. 'This state must never accept the Israeli and US dictates, recalling the martyrs who made heavy sacrifices for the sake of the national dignity and sovereignty.' It is humiliating for the Lebanese state to obey the Israeli dictates and prevent the Iranian plane's landing at Beirut airport, he added. Komati affirmed that the Resistance would never accept the Israeli humiliating interventions, highlighting the rejection of any Zionist occupation in South Lebanon. Later on, the Lebanese security forces fired tear bombs at the peaceful protest, suffocating a number of participants. It is worth noting that the peaceful protester opened the way for a number of UNIFIL vehicles to pass during the sit-in, which affirms their commitment to the main goal of the event exclusively.

Sixth Batch of Gaza Swap Deal: Prisoners Released as ‘Israel’ Tri...	Palestinian prisoners and Israeli captives were released on Saturday as part of the sixth batch of the sap deal between the Israeli occupation and Palestinian resistance, with the Zionist regime trying to emulate Hamas’ handover ceremonies by changing the release clothes of the Palestinian prisoners. Freed Israeli captives crossed back into the occupied territories on Saturday morning after being paraded on a stage in southern Gaza in a handover ceremony by the Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad resistance groups. One of the captives, who was held by the Islamic Jihad, was the first to emerge from a vehicle and be led onto the stage. The two others being held by Hamas were then brought up.

Hariri Says Al-Mustaqbal Movement Will Return to Political Life: ...	Former Prime Minister Saad Hariri underlined support for the Lebanese Army in order to achieve the Israeli enemy's withdrawal from all the villages in South Lebanon, stressing that the Southerners as well as Bekaa and Dahiyeh residents are part of the new national opportunity. Marking the twentieth commemoration of his father's martyrdom, Hariri said: 'Today, after twenty years, we have returned to this square to say to Rafik Hariri - we have missed you!' He considered that Rafik Hariri and his supporters are still present in Beirut's Martyrs' Square and all arenas, and belong not only to the Future (Al-Mustaqbal) Movement but to all of Lebanon, asserting that the movement remains one of moderation, reconstruction, liberties, and building of the state and its institutions, and the movement of Arabism, modernity, openness, and coexistence among all the Lebanese. Addressing the gathering of supporters who came to pay tribute to the memory of the late Prime Minister, Hariri said, 'This is an occasion to announce our support for the stability of Syria and the best equal relations from one country to another, as announced by the new Syrian leadership. In these 20 years, our country has gone through many crises, and we have never denied that part of the responsibility lies with us. I submitted my resignation and made way for three years or more. We are responsible for ourselves before the people and before the Lord Almighty.' Hariri continued to pay respect to all the fallen martyrs in all Lebanese regions, hailing the solidarity demonstrated among the Lebanese in supporting each other in the hard times, and stressing that solving the economic crisis is everyone's responsibility. 'Today there is a golden opportunity; we have a new president and a new government,' he underlined. Addressing the people of the South, the Bekaa and Beirut's suburbs, he said: 'You are partners in this opportunity, and without you, it cannot be achieved. But you must break any previous impression that you are a force of obstruction and weapons&#8230;You are partners in opening bridges of relations with our Arab brothers and partners in reconstruction, and most importantly: you are strong partners in restoring the state's reputation, which alone, with its army, security forces, and institutions, protects the Lebanese, all the Lebanese.' Hariri recalled Martyr Rafik Hariri's project based on the Taif Constitution, building the state, developing its institutions, and preserving its sovereignty. 'We support the president, the government, and every effort to build a normal state to restore Lebanon's role in the world. We are with the army and the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation from all the villages in which it is present,' he underlined. Hariri considered that the problem with the Israeli enemy's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is 'escaping responsibility, escaping from peace to war, a problem of occupation, killing, and displacement of a people,' adding that this 'cannot be solved at the expense of Egypt, Jordan or the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.' 'We will remain with you in all national milestones, and everything will be good in its own time,' Hariri asserted.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2338932	2025-02-14T06:56:45-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00155430017395449974.jpeg
Allies Often Worse Than Enemies': Trump Announces Reciprocal Tar...	US President Donald Trump today announced sweeping 'reciprocal tariffs' hitting both allies and competitors, in a dramatic escalation of an international trade war that economists warn could fuel inflation at home. Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said he decided to impose reciprocal duties, telling reporters that US allies were often 'worse than our enemies' on trade issues. The levies would be tailored to each US trading partner and consider factors including value added tax (VAT). Trump has announced a broad range of tariffs targeting some of the biggest US trading partners since taking office, arguing that they would help tackle unfair practices — and in some cases using the threats to influence policy. The president has referred to tariffs as a way to raise revenue, remedy trade imbalances and pressure countries to act on US concerns. Trump's announcement came hours before he was due to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington. It remains unclear when exactly the tariffs would take effect, if imposed. Analysts have warned that reciprocal duties could bring a broad tariff hike to emerging market economies such as India and Thailand, which tend to have higher effective tariff rates on US products. Countries such as South Korea that have trade deals with Washington are less at risk from this move, analysts believe.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2338899	2025-02-14T06:30:38-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2020/11/manar-02037370016046496872.jpg
Architect of So-called Generals’ Plan: 'Israel Failed Miserably i...	The architect of the Israeli so-called Generals' Plan retired General Giora Eiland said the Zionist entity 'failed miserably in the Gaza war.' The Israeli newspaper Maariv has quoted the retired general and the former head of the so-called Israeli National Security Council as saying that ‘Israel’ failed in Gaza. Eiland, who masterminded the controversial plan for displacing Palestinians from northern Gaza, argued that the Israeli defeat can be assessed by examining which side achieved its objectives and imposed its will. He pointed to the recent developments in Gaza, stating, 'Look at the agreement—Israel opened the Rafah crossing and withdrew from the Netzarim axis, while thousands of Palestinians returned to the north.' Eiland noted that 'Hamas can dictate to us in phase two an agreement.' Although admitting the importance of recovering Israeli detainees currently held in Gaza, he said that Israel 'will also pay with the mass release of hundreds of prisoners.' In his remarks, Eiland advocated for the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, stating that 'if you occupy the Strip and the civilians remain, Hamas will remain too. Apart from receiving terrible attacks against the occupying force, you will not gain anything.' Israeli occupation army in Jabalia in northern Gaza Strip (November 5, 2024). Earlier in a comment piece for Ynet, described the Israeli war on Gaza as an 'absolute failure'. 'Israel has failed in three-and-a-half out of the four goals of the war: we have not demolished Hamas’ military power; we have not overthrown Hamas’ rule; we are not managing to return the residents&#8230; safely to their homes [in settlements], and as for the return of the abductees, the fourth goal – we have partially succeeded,' he wrote. He said Hamas had, conversely, 'achieved all of its goals, chief among them: continuing its rule in Gaza.'

At its simplest, this plan involves ethnically cleansing the northern Gaza Strip of people; and then besieging the region, including stopping the entry of humanitarian supplies, to starve out anyone left, including Palestinian fighters. The original plan, also known as the Eiland Plan after its creator, was seen by Palestinians and rights groups as part of a long-term project of ethnic cleansing that would result in the reestablishment of Zionist settlements in Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2338866	2025-02-14T06:06:06-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07800290017395417976.jpg

The senior Yemeni official also pointed to the recent collision of the US aircraft carrier USS Harry S.

Al-Houthi reiterated Yemeni people's unwavering support for the Palestinian nation, adding that their million-man marches over the past 15 months attest to such a stance. He stressed that all options are on the table, and Yemeni armed forces stand fully prepared for any possible scenario, especially after recent remarks by Ansarulalh leader Abul-Malik al-Houthi that Yemen will intervene, even militarily, if the US and Israel attempt to enforce the Gaza displacement plan by force or collude with Arab regimes to implement it.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2338756	2025-02-14T05:34:58-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00178670017395401224.jpg

Member of the Loyalty to Resistance parliamentary bloc, Dr. Ibrahim Al-Moussawi, called on all the Lebanese parties to condemn the Israeli violations of the national sovereignty and loudly hold the international competent institutions responsible for stopping the Zionist attacks against the Martyr President Rafik Hariri International Airport. In a statement issued to comment on on the crisis of Lebanese citizens stranded abroad as a result of the Israeli threat to target the Iranian plane that will transport them from Iran, MP Al-Moussawi said, 'the Lebanese who are optimistic about the reactivation of the work of constitutional institutions are holding the government responsible and demanding that it take the necessary measures to guarantee Lebanon’s sovereignty at all its public facilities, most importantly the airport, so that the enemy does not think that it is free to practice aggression and violate sovereignty as it pleases.' 'The Lebanese state, with all its apparatuses, must assume its responsibilities to end this matter and work to return its citizens to their country immediately and not comply with Israeli threats under any name or circumstance.' At the same time, Al-Moussawi called on the honorable citizens and all those who are keen on the interests of their country and families to be deeply aware and rational and to make room for solutions to this emerging crisis, stressing that the expression of rejection of these Israeli violations and infringements of our sovereignty to be peaceful and responsible.

Sayyed Houthi: We Will Militarily Confront Trump’s Gaza Displacem...	Head of Yemen’s Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi vowed a military action if 'Israel' or the US proceed with a plan to displace the Gaza Strip residents into other countries. 'Our position concerning support for the Palestinian nation and their fighters is firm and principled, and we will resolutely stand by their side,' he said in a televised speech from Yemeni capital Sanaa on Thursday. 'If the US manages to advance its plot against Gaza, we will take military action to prevent it, and act within the framework of our religious duties. We will not sit idly by.' He added that 'Israel' has not yet fulfilled its commitments under the Gaza ceasefire agreement by preventing the entry of aid, basic commodities and tents into the Strip. Houthi took a swipe at the Zionist regime for violating the terms of the ceasefire in Gaza due to the encouragement of the deceitful US administration, which denies all rights. The Ansarullah chief also rejected the US president’s call for the cancellation of the Gaza ceasefire unless the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas frees all remaining Israeli captives by Saturday, stating that 'Hell is for you (Donald Trump) and people of your kind like tyrants, criminals and oppressors.' Houthi emphasized that Trump’s Gaza displacement plan is more like a joke and naive talk from the president of a country that proclaims to be civilized. 'Trump's plan to displace the Palestinian people from their homeland is a confiscation of a right from which many other rights are derived. Trump is a criminal and accustomed to making careless and ridiculous remarks.' Houthi underlined that Trump's plan to displace Palestinians from Gaza reflects his insistence on the criminal plan to deny Palestinians’ rights and justice for them. A drone view captures Palestinians, forcibly displaced to southern Gaza by IOF, making their way back to their homes in the north after a ceasefire took effect in central Gaza (Reuters: Jan 27, 2025) 'Trump's plan for Gaza is evil and cruel. It appears that he is serious about implementing the scheme, and is putting pressure on some Arab countries to accept it. We are not surprised by the US president’s plot as it shows the tyranny and criminal record of his country. There are no boundaries to the ambitions of Trump, who believes in the aggressive and unjust Zionist plan and seeks to realize it,' he stated. The Ansarullah leader stated that Trump, who unveiled the so-called 'Deal of the Century' during his term in office, is now poised to perpetrate the 'Crime of the Century' during his second term. 'Through his plan, Trump seeks to obtain what the Israeli aggression on Gaza failed to achieve, namely, displacing the Palestinians from their land. When the Americans raise the issue of displacing the Palestinian people from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, they seek to completely liquidate the Palestinian cause,' Houthi said. He warned that the plan to forcibly relocate Palestinians is part of the Zionist project that seeks to expand the occupying entity’s influence and is aimed at holy sites, especially the al-Aqsa Mosque. 'Trump’s Gaza plan cannot succeed as long as Arabs, especially the Arab countries neighboring Palestine, do not accept it. A great responsibility lies with Arab and Muslim countries to clearly reject it, and more importantly express their vehement opposition. 'The US seeks to entrap Arab regimes in a major scandal and act against the interests of their countries and peoples,' Houthi noted. He warned that approving the American plan would have very serious consequences for the national security of Arab countries, and the entire West Asia region.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2338382	2025-02-13T11:54:43-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01327440017394764775.jpg

Video Shows Martyr Sayyed Nasrallah Anticipating Displacement Per...	The US President Donald Trump did not disclose a secret scheme when he raised the issue of forcibly displacing Gaza residents in order to turn it into an American real-estate project. The dark scenario, which completely eradicates the Palestinian cause and threatens all the Arab countries, was anticipated by the former Secretary General of Hezbollah Martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah. In a speech on the anniversary of Hezbollah's martyred commanders, Sayyed Nasrallah warned that the enemy was planning to displace the residents of Gaza, West Bank, and the Palestinian territories occupied in 1948. Hezbollah decided since the start of the Zionist genocidal war on Gaza to support the Palestinian resistance militarily in order to frustrate such schemes despite the heavy sacrifices made for this sake. Palestinians displaced from Gaza to neighboring countries under a 'U.S. proposal' would not have the right to return to the enclave, US President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox News about his proposal to 'own' the Gaza Strip and develop real estate there. After visiting Washington and meeting Trump, the Jordanian King Abdullah II held a phone call with the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to discuss the latest issued related to the Palestinian cause. The two leaders reaffirmed the unified positions of Egypt and Jordan, including the crucial necessity to fully implement the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, continue the release of hostages and detainees, and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid in order to alleviate the severe humanitarian suffering in the Strip. President El-Sisi and King Abdullah II also reiterated the imperative to immediately start the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip without displacing the Palestinian people from their land. Furthermore, they stressed the necessity to stop the practices carried out by Israeli occupation forces against the Palestinians in the West Bank. 'The Arab world has fought [this idea] for 100 years. After resisting this for 100 years, we Arabs are not about to capitulate now.' Arab League secretary-general Ahmed Aboul Gheit stated that any forced displacement of Palestinians is 'unacceptable' for the Arab World pic.twitter.com/KBXTx1nPps — Middle East Eye (@MiddleEastEye) February 13, 2025	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2338294	2025-02-13T09:23:04-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-04200550017394673661.jpeg
