Hezbollah’s Sheikh Qassem: ‘Israel’ Will Scream, We Bet on Battle...	Hezbollah Secretary Sheikh Naim Qassem warned that the Israeli enemy will scream due to the Lebanese resistance strikes, stressing that the battlefield, not political action, will end the war. In a televised speech via Al-Manar, the second since his election as a secretary general, Sheikh Qassem vowed that Hezbollah will emerge victorious in the end of the war, noting that there is no place across the Zionist entity that Hezbollah can’t reach. He affirmed that the basis of any negotiation is to stop the aggression and to fully protect the Lebanese sovereignty. Sheikh Qassem said that Lebanon face a brutal war for more than 40 days, noting that Hezbollah is now engaged in a defensive war. His eminence stated that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan was to end Hezbollah, invade Lebanon and change the Middle East, stressing that the resistance has foiled the Israeli premier’s schemes. Sayyed Nasrallah’s Arbaeen Sheikh Qassem started his speech by recalling former Hezbollah S.G. Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah who was martyred 40 days ago. 'Sayyed Nasrallah was unparalleled icon of resistance. He has established an organization of free people of resistance.' Sheikh Qassem described Hezbollah as 'a structure that has extension in all cultural, political, Jihadi, social, educational and health fields.' 'Sayyed Nasrallah has revived us, both in his life and martyrdom. He will remain with us, he will continue and the resistance with grow and thrive.' In this context, the Hezbollah new S.G. said that Lebanon is facing a hostile war that has started more than 40 days ago, as he hailed the fronts in support of Gaza in Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon as well as the Islamic Republic of Iran. 'Despite more than 43,000 martyrs and 100,000 injuries Gaza stands firm, steady and will triumph.'

Israeli PM Netanyahu Fires Defense Minister Gallant; Opposition, ...	Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he has fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who is set to be replaced by Israel Katz, Israel's foreign minister, Haaretz reported. In a statement, Netanyahu stated that while there had been productive cooperation in the early months of the war, significant differences in strategy had emerged between him and Gallant in recent months. 'At a time of war, full trust between the prime minister and the defense minister is critical,' Netanyahu said. 'Unfortunately, this trust has eroded, and attempts to bridge the gaps have failed.' He noted that the differences were not only made public in an 'unacceptable manner' but had also reached Israel's enemies, who had 'derived great benefit' from the situation. Netanyahu announced that Israel Katz, a veteran politician and former minister of foreign affairs, finance, and intelligence, would replace Gallant as defense minister. Describing Katz as a 'bulldozer' with a combination of 'responsibility and quiet determination,' Netanyahu praised his extensive experience and leadership, saying Katz was well-equipped to lead the defense effort during this critical period. Gideon Sa'ar, who was a minister without a portfolio, will assume the role of foreign minister, it added. The Israeli media mentioned that Netanyahu informed Gallant that he would sack him 10 minutes before issuing the decision, adding that the meeting between the two Zionist officials lasted only for three minutes. Israeli media mentioned that, following the dismissal of 'Defense Minister' [War Minister] Yoav Gallant, calls were made to take to the streets as of 9:00 pm. The headquarters of the families of 'Israeli' captives in the Gaza Strip considered that the dismissal of the 'Defense Minister' [War Minister] is a direct continuation of efforts to sabotage the captive exchange deal. Head of the Israeli opposition, Yair Lapid, said that Gallant dismissal endangers entire 'Israel' for the sake of shameful political leverage. Former 'Israeli' War Minister 'Avigdor Lieberman' said that, if the Defense Minister can be replaced in the midst of a war, then it is also possible to replace a Prime Minister who has failed in his duties and neglected 'the country’s' security, and certainly to establish a governmental investigative committee. Yair Golan, who heads Israel's new center-left party The Democrats, took to X to urge Israelis to take to the streets in protest. In late March, thousands protested spontaneously against Netanyahu's decision to fire Gallant, which was ultimately rescinded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2257147	2024-11-05T11:24:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-082230800173083465010.png

What to Know About US Knife-Edge Presidential Race: Harris or Tru...	Millions of voters across the United States gear up to cast their ballots on Tuesday as Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump go head-to-head in a race that remains too close to call. With the country stretching across six time zones, Election Day is a massive undertaking – and voting will begin as early as 5am EST (10:00 GMT) and go as late as 1am (06:00 GMT) on Wednesday. Polls show Harris, 60, who is the current vice-president and Trump, 78, who is a former president, running neck and neck nationally and in the battleground states or the 'swing states' (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin). More than 78 million voters have already cast ballots, according to Election Lab at the University of Florida. Voters will also elect 34 US senators (out of 100) and all 435 members for the US House of Representatives, among other posts that are up for grabs. Final Calls In the final days of their campaigns, both hopefuls were flooding social media sites, TV and radio stations with a last round of campaign ads, and racing to knock on doors and make calls. Harris ended her campaign in Philadelphia, where she doubled down on the economy, and outlined her plan to 'build an economy where we bring down the cost of living'. Harris speaks during a final rally in Pennsylvania (November 4, 2024). Among the measures she intends to implement, she listed a ban on corporate price gouging on groceries; cutting taxes for workers, middle-class families and small businesses; and lowering healthcare costs, including the cost of home care for seniors. Trump predicted the 'greatest victory' in his closing argument in Michigan. He linked immigration to a high crime rate, blending claims about voter fraud with warnings about migrants committing crimes and promises to revitalize the United States. 'Over the past four years, Americans have suffered one catastrophic failure, betrayal and humiliation after another,' Trump said. Trump speaks during his final campaign rally at Michigan (November 5, 2024). Positions on Foreign Policy The presidential candidates diverge on most of the policies related to key issues including economy, immigration, foreign policy, democracy, abortion and many others. Harris and Trump offer two starkly different visions for the US’ foreign policy. The Democratic candidate has fully aligned herself with the Biden administration’s response to the Russia-Ukraine war, while the republican candidate vowed to 'fundamentally re-evaluate' the country’s approach on the US aid to Ukraine and claimed that he will end the nearly three-year war on his first day in office On the situation in Palestine and Lebanon, or what the US calls the 'Middle East crisis', Harris vowed to back the Zionist entity’s so-called 'right to defend itself', and ensure ‘Israel’ has the ability to do so, rejecting the arms embargo. She also pledged to work to end the war in Gaza and to 'allow Palestinians to realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.'

Nothing. pic.twitter.com/kvnp6I4fEh — Globe Eye News (@GlobeEyeNews) November 1, 2024 When is Election Result Expected? In some presidential elections the victor has been named late on election night, or early the next morning. However, the Presidential hopefuls are running neck and neck in this year’s race, meaning that in many states media outlets may wait longer before projecting who has won. Narrow victories could also mean recounts. In the key swing state of Pennsylvania, for example, a state-wide recount would be required if there’s a half-percentage-point difference between the votes cast for the winner and loser. In 2020, the margin was just over 1.1 percentage points. Legal challenges are also possible. More than 100 pre-election lawsuits have already been filed, including challenges to voter eligibility and voter roll management, by Republicans.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2256685	2024-11-05T03:30:26-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-04635410017308061888.jpg

The Israeli Foreign Ministry has officially informed the UN that it is withdrawing from the 1967 agreement recognizing the Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. pic.twitter.com/TXgZiaUZFI — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) November 4, 2024 Last week, the Knesset passed a bill banning UNRWA from operating from the occupied territories and prohibiting Israeli government agencies from working with UNRWA. The bill takes effect in three months, according to Israeli media. Commenting on the Israeli move, the UN agency said on Monday that the Israeli ban on its operations would lead to the 'collapse' of humanitarian work in the war-torn Gaza Strip. 'If this law is implemented, it would be likely to cause the collapse of the international humanitarian operation in the Gaza Strip - an operation of which UNRWA is the backbone,' Jonathan Fowler, a UNRWA spokesman, told AFP. The Zionist entity has been for months launching a campaign aimed at defaming the UNRWA, by propagating allegations that the international body has links to October 7 attacks. Last January, Carrie Keller-Lynn, who served in the Israeli occupation army, wrote an article claiming alleged connections between UNRWA staff and fighters who took part in October 7 Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. The story prompted many countries to halt funding to the UN agency.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2255849	2024-11-04T04:24:19-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/03/manar-00602030017100139095.jpeg
Watch How Hezbollah Fighters Hunt Israeli Soldiers at Lebanon Bor...	Hezbollah published a new video showing how its fighters hunted Israeli enemy soldiers at a border area between Lebanon and the occupied Palestinian territories. The group's Military Media released the 3-minute video late on Sunday.

What’s New in the Ongoing Israeli 42-Day Offensive on Lebanon?	Following over a month of operations in southern Lebanon, Israel’s military offensive has shown limited success, as indicated by recent events in Khiyam, South of Lebanon. On Sunday, Al-Manar correspondent confirmed that the town was completely cleared of Israeli soldiers after a week of intense clashes with Lebanese resistance forces. Amid this military stalemate, Israeli forces have escalated attacks against civilian areas across Lebanon, spanning from southern villages to Baalbek and the Bekaa Valley, as well as the southern suburbs of Beirut. The aerial raids have left dozens dead, hundreds injured, and caused widespread destruction to homes and infrastructure. In the Bekaa region, the Israeli military threatened to strike five buildings within Baalbek and Douris. This threat materialized when Israeli forces launched air raids on Baalbek, hitting Douris near the old municipality building and the Al-Rida Restaurant near the governmental hospital. Additional raids were reported on the outskirts of Mashghara and Labaya in western Bekaa. Baalbek Governmental Hospital’s director, Dr. Abbas Shukr, assured the public that despite damage from nearby airstrikes, the hospital remains fully operational. 'We will replace the shattered glass within 24 hours, and our work continues without obstruction,' he stated. In southern Lebanon, Israeli warplanes carried out intensive airstrikes, targeting areas like Qaq’iyat al-Sanbar and al-Bissariyeh. According to the Ministry of Public Health’s Emergency Operations Center, a raid on Haret Saida resulted in three fatalities and nine injuries. Another airstrike on a house in Joaya killed two and wounded others, who were transferred to Tyre Hospital. Additional strikes hit the outskirts of Al-Bazouriya and Al-Burj Al-Shamali in Tyre District. Reports from local sources detail further casualties in Jabal Al-Batm, where two individuals lost their lives. Additional raids targeted homes in Arabsalim and Ghazieh, Sidon District, leaving one dead and others injured. In Tyre District, attacks continued, including raids on Tyre Park, Qana, and nearby towns, as well as the Burj al-Shamali-al-Bazourieh highway, though no injuries were reported. In al-Bazourieh, a center for the Islamic Health Authority was also struck, prompting a response from Islamic Message Scouts ambulances to assess the scene. In Khiyam, where resistance forces made advances, the International Red Cross and Lebanese Red Cross began evacuating two families, about 20 people, whose home was destroyed in an airstrike last week. At least 20 confirmed dead at the scene of a massacre in the southern Lebanese town of Khiam. Any prior attempt to rescue them was impossible until 3 Nov., as Israel 'refused to grant access.' — مهى 🍉 🇱🇧 🇵🇸🇾🇪 (@Taltool11) November 3, 2024 The Lebanese Red Cross has also started recovering bodies from the rubble in Wata al-Khiam, where 15 Lebanese and one Syrian victim remain.

Horrifying Situation in Northern Gaza on Day 394 of Brutal Israel...	The Israeli genocidal war on Gaza, today in its 394th day, hasn’t spared a polio vaccination center, as the occupation tightens the siege on the strip’s north. The UN announced on Sunday that polio vaccination center and the car of UN aid official involved in this weekend’s vaccination campaign came under Israeli fire despite a promised 'humanitarian pause' in bombardment. Catherine Russell, the executive director of the UN child support and protection agency UNICEF, said: 'At least three children were reportedly injured by another attack in the proximity of a vaccination clinic in Sheikh Radwan, while a polio vaccination campaign was under way.' This has already been a deadly weekend of attacks in North Gaza. Attacks on civilians, including humanitarian workers, and what remains of Gaza’s civilian facilities and infrastructure must stop. My statement👇 — Catherine Russell (@unicefchief) November 2, 2024 She added that the personal car of a UNICEF employee working on the polio vaccine campaign 'came under fire by what we believe to be a quadcopter'. Russel said that in the previous 48-hour period, more than 50 children had been martyred in the Jabalia refugee camp, a focus of Israeli military operations over the past month. 'The attacks on Jabalia, the vaccination clinic and the UNICEF staff member are yet further examples of the grave consequences of the indiscriminate strikes on civilians in the Gaza Strip,' Russell said. Meanwhile, media reports described the situation in northern Gaza Strip as horrifying, with people have been for at least three week left without food, medicine or even clean water, amid heavy bombardment of the area. Palestinian media reported that some people in Beit Lahia and Jabalia were still under rubble, as the Israeli occupation have been preventing health workers from reaching the scene of the attacks. Palestinian Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmoud Basal told Al Jazeera on Sunday that Israeli forces have been preventing medical supplies and their equipment from reaching northern Gaza. 'We call on the world to work to enable the civil defense to reach the northern Gaza Strip,' he said. Also on Sunday, medical sources said that Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed 23 people, 13 in the north and 9 in Khan Younis, since dawn.

In the central Gaza region, five Palestinians were martyred and many more were injured in the latest Israeli bombardment of several homes in the Nuseirat refugee camp. Palestinian media outlets reported the arrival of three martyrs and a number of wounded individuals at the al-Awda Hospital after the Israeli occupation forces shelled the Al-Assar family's residence in Nuseirat's Camp 5.

Simultaneously, Israeli airstrikes pounded the northwestern area of the camp. Further east, in the town of Deir al-Balah, an Israeli airstrike targeted the Wadi al-Salqa area. The onslaught also claimed the life of a woman in the al-Rahma neighborhood, to the west of the new camp in Nuseirat, as rescue teams were unable to reach her due to Israeli obstruction. lsraeli occupation forces force a Palestinian woman to evacuate her house in Northern Gaza Strip and then shoot her in the legs. pic.twitter.com/K5mPZV2GSB — TIMES OF GAZA (@Timesofgaza) November 2, 2024 The cruelty of the Israeli occupation forces knows no bounds, as they even deliberately targeted emergency medical crews who were in the process of recovering the bodies of those killed and treating the injured in the northern area of the Nuseirat camp.

The people of Beit Lahia and the Jabalia refugee camp are being suffocated, starved, and massacred by the Israeli forces. A recent large-scale attack on the Beit Lahia project claimed the lives of 117 Palestinians, the majority of whom were women and children. The few survivors of the Abu Nasr family confirmed that this attack was carried out without any prior warning, further underscoring the complete disregard for Palestinian lives by the Israeli occupation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2254122	2024-11-02T06:55:18-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-02281760017260600229.jpg

The Iraqi Resistance has once again demonstrated its unwavering commitment to the liberation of Palestine and support for the people of Lebanon through a series of drone attacks targeting vital Israeli infrastructure across the occupied territories. According to the Resistance's statements, this latest operation is a direct response to the ongoing Israeli aggression and massacres perpetrated against the civilian population, including vulnerable women, children, and the elderly. 🔻بيان هام #يعمم🔻 وما رَمَيتَ إذ رمَيتَ ولكن الله رمى هاجم مجاهدو #المقاومة_الإسلامية_في_العراق هدفاً حيوياً في شمال #فلسطين المحتلة بواسطة الطيران المسير 🔥🚀 ونؤكد استمرار العمليات في دك معاقل الأعداء بوتيرة متصاعدة 🔺هام #يعمم على اوسع نطاق 🔺#نعيم_قاسم #تل_أبيب pic.twitter.com/tijLS54QGn — حــركة النجباء (@NuiabaMovement) November 2, 2024 Employing advanced one-way attack drones, the Iraqi fighters carried out a total of seven long-range strikes, hitting a diverse array of strategic sites in the northern, central, and southern regions of the occupied lands. Two of these operations were focused on the occupied Syrian Golan, an area of critical importance to the Israeli regime. The remaining strikes were spread throughout the northern occupied territories, often referred to as al-Jalil, where two vital targets were successfully engaged. Further south, the Resistance also targeted sites in the occupied Umm al-Rashrash, or Eilat, region along the Red Sea coast. The final two operations struck at the heart of the central occupied territories, demonstrating the Resistance's ability to reach deep into the enemy's strongholds. In the face of the relentless Israeli onslaught against the people of Palestine and Lebanon, the Iraqi Resistance has vowed to continue escalating these operations, making it clear that their unwavering solidarity and support will not waver in the struggle for liberation and justice.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2253935	2024-11-02T04:28:39-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-06115340017305469062.jpg
Leader: US and ‘Israel’ Will Receive Jaw-Breaking Response	The Leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, has issued a stark warning to the United States and ‘Israel’, declaring that they will 'definitely receive a teeth-breaking response' for their atrocities. 'The enemies, both the US and the Zionist regime, should know that they will definitely receive a teeth-breaking response for what they are doing against Iran and the resistance front,' he said in a meeting with students on Saturday. 📸 Meeting with students Imam Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, met with a group of students of all ages including university students from across the country in the Imam Khomeini Hussainiyah on Nov. 2, 2024. 🔽 pic.twitter.com/40Ujedtz7t — Khamenei Media (@Khamenei_m) November 2, 2024 Iranian officials have pledged to avenge Israel’s act of aggression targeting two Iranian border cities, Ilam and Khuzestan, as well as central Tehran in the early hours of October 26. 'This is not merely a matter of revenge but a logical action—an approach aligned with religion, ethics, and the Sharia, in accordance with international regulations,' Ayatollah Khamenei said. The Leader made the statements during the occasion to mark the US embassy takeover by Iranian students on November 4, 1979, known as the National Day of the Fight against Global Arrogance. 'We are certainly doing everything necessary to prepare the Iranian nation to stand against arrogance, whether in terms of military readiness, armaments, or political actions, and thank God, our officials are currently engaged in this,' the Leader said. The overall movement of the Iranian people and the country’s officials, he said, is 'definitely and justly aimed at confronting global arrogance and the criminal apparatus that rules today’s world order. Rest assured, there will be no negligence in this regard.' 'The Iranian people and the country’s officials will not hesitate or neglect this course. Rest assured.' He also referenced the US embassy takeover, saying it was not merely a site for diplomatic and intelligence activity, but rather the headquarters of plotting to destroy the Islamic Revolution. Iranian students took over the embassy in Tehran, also known in Iran as the 'Den of Espionage,' less than a year after the Islamic Revolution toppled the US-backed Pahlavi dictatorship in 1979. Every year on the 13th day of the Iranian month of Aban, the Iranian nation, particularly the students, commemorate the event by staging rallies across the country, calling on all Muslims and freedom-seeking nations to resist against arrogant powers and not to succumb to their bullying. 'For the Iranian nation, inspired by Islamic teachings, standing up against oppression is a duty. Confronting arrogance is a duty. Arrogance means comprehensive economic, military, and cultural domination and the humiliation of nations,' Ayatollah Khamenei noted. He added that the Iranian people had been humiliated for years and, therefore, will certainly continue their struggle against global arrogance. Imam Khamenei emphasized that the Iranian nation's rational, wise, and logical movement, aligned with human, Islamic, and international principles in confronting arrogance, must continue. 'The continuation of the Iranian nation’s path in confronting arrogance requires knowledge, thought, technology, and a roadmap,' the Leader said. Imam Khamenei also touched on longstanding US enmities toward the Iranian nation, saying, 'The effort of historians who distort facts is to claim that the conflict between Iran and the United States began on November 4, 1979. This is a lie. The Americans clashed with the Iranian nation from the very start of the Revolution, even from years before, doing everything they could against Iranian nation.' 'American involvement and efforts in Iran were extensive, even before August 19, 1953,' he said, referring to a CIA-orchestrated coup in Iran that overthrew the democratically elected government of Dr. Mohammad Mosaddeq. 'However, the clearest evidence was on August 19. A national, popular government was in power in Iran, but the Americans entered the field, betraying the trust of a government that had naively trusted them. They overthrew that government and established the oppressive rule of the Shah. For many years, the Iranian nation directly experienced America’s enmity.' He said that the Americans staged a coup in Iran, set up SAVAK in the 1950s, and established a center of torture and pressure on fighters and freedom-seekers. So many young people, faithful individuals, and freedom-lovers were either killed, mutilated, or tortured by SAVAK’s criminal agents—the so-called Shah’s intelligence agency, he added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2253880	2024-11-02T04:08:02-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-01044380017305456783.jpg
New Scandal Engulfs Netanyahu after Close Aide Arrested for Alleg...	An aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is one of several suspects arrested for an alleged security breach that involved leaking top secret intelligence, Israeli officials said. The arrests are at the center of what is likely to be the biggest scandal inside the Israeli government since the beginning of the war in Gaza, Axios reported. Whether Netanyahu knew or was involved in the leaks, which appear to be intended to influence Israeli public opinion to support Netanyahu's hardline position about a deal to release hostages being held by Hamas and establish a ceasefire in Gaza. The episode was under a gag order for several days until a judge released some details on Friday. Israeli officials said that a few weeks ago the Israel Army asked the Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency, to open an investigation after a top secret raw intelligence report was leaked to the German tabloid, Bild. The Bild published a story in early September that referred to a document that was allegedly drafted by Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and contained Hamas' strategy about the hostage and ceasefire deal negotiations. A joint investigation by the Shin Bet, the Israeli police and the IOF has led to the arrest of several suspects. The investigation focused on a 'concern of a security breach due to the unlawful provision of classified information' that has put at risk 'sensitive information and intelligence sources, as well as harmed the efforts of achieving the goals of the war in the Gaza Strip,' according to information the judge released for publication on Friday. Netanyahu denied his office was involved. 'No one from the Prime Minister's Office was questioned or arrested,' he said in a statement. He added that there was no leak from the Prime Minister's Office and accused other government bodies, which he didn't name, of leaking classified information. 'Nobody else was questioned. I wonder why,' Netanyahu said. Israeli officials said one of the suspects is Netanyahu's closest aides. The Israeli public broadcaster Kan reported the aide, who worked closely with Netanyahu since the beginning of the war, participated in sensitive security meetings and was exposed to highly classified information even though he failed has security background check. As a result, he didn't have the security clearance needed to work at the Prime Minister's Office and wasn't officially hired by the office. At the same time, he actively advised Netanyahu. According to Axios, the scandal will likely deepen the mistrust and tension between Netanyahu and the IOF and intelligence services, which has been growing since the security failures around the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on 'Israel'. 'It also comes as Netanyahu battles Israel's legal system and the attorney general. In just a few weeks the prime minister is expected to take the stand for the first time in his corruption trial.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2253473	2024-11-01T14:52:13-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2016/09/manar-03504870014730944247.jpg
Iran Fully Capable of Building Nuclear Weapons: Official	Head of Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations Kamal Kharrazi says that the country is fully capable of building nuclear weapons and the only thing preventing this issue is the fatwa issued by the Leader. In an exclusive interview for Al Mayadeen, Kharrazi articulated Iran's stance on regional tensions, emphasizing the nation’s preparedness to respond to any escalation while expressing a desire to avoid further war. He highlighted Iran's military capabilities and the potential for changes in its nuclear policy in response to perceived 'existential threats,' framing the discussion within the broader context of Iran’s geopolitical stance and its commitment to national sovereignty. In this context, Kharrazi emphasized that Iran has showcased its deterrence capabilities through Operation True Promise II, during which it launched hundreds of ballistic missiles on Israel, noting that in the time being, it is up to the Zionists; if they choose to continue their hostile actions, Iran will respond accordingly. In response to questions about potential changes to Iran's nuclear doctrine, Kharrazi indicated that such changes are possible, especially if Iran encounters an 'existential threat'. He asserted that Iran has the technical capabilities to produce nuclear weapons and encounters no significant obstacles in this regard. However, he emphasized that the Fatwa issued by the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei serves as the sole constraint preventing Iran from pursuing nuclear armament. The Iranian official also mentioned that policy changes would apply to projectiles. Kharrazi noted that Iran's missile capabilities are well-known, having been demonstrated in various operations. He stated that the current focus is on the ranges of the missiles used thus far, in which they [the Iranians] have considered the concerns of Western countries. However, Kharrazi maintained that, if Western nations do not acknowledge Iran's concerns, particularly regarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity, Iran then will disregard the concerns of Western countries. Therefore, it is likely that Iran will develop and extend the range of its missiles. Kharrazi addressed the 'unequal' war in the region, telling Al Mayadeen that it is 'led by Israel, which perpetrates ethnic cleansing and the extermination of people,' and is fighting those who are defending their lives, existence, and land. He expressed hope that the war would come to a swift conclusion, asserting that Israel is engaging in 'horrific ethnic cleansing' while mistakenly believing it has achieved victory. Kharrazi emphasized that such actions cannot be perceived as a true victory but rather as a profound violation of human rights. He also highlighted Israel's recent actions in blocking the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) from delivering essential supplies, stating that the agency 'wants to provide water and food to the besieged people of Gaza, but they have been blocked from doing so.' He emphasized that this move represents 'the climax of anti-humanitarian values.' He called on the international community to 'wake up and exert pressure on Israel,' adding, 'Unfortunately, we still see the West, including European countries and the United States, continue to support such a brutal and criminal entity and defend its actions by funding it and sending weapons.' Kharrazi concluded that the implications of the situation and its eventual outcome are evident: the will of the people and their Resistance cannot be suppressed. He asserted that both the Palestinians and Lebanese are steadfast in their determination to resist, endure this oppression, and confront these atrocities until victory is achieved. Within the context of ceasefire negotiations, Kharrazi emphasized that Iran does not intervene, asserting that it is the Lebanese and Palestinians' right to negotiate and reach a ceasefire deal. Moreover, he affirmed his country's support for any decision the countries make. The Iranian official added that Iran remains committed to its previous agreements, provided that the other party also upholds its commitments. He expressed disappointment that the opposing side has not adhered to their obligations and, instead of engaging in negotiations, continues to impose sanctions on the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Iranian official also discussed Iranian-Russian relations and broader regional dynamics, telling Al Mayadeen that Russia and China are 'seeking to build a new international system to free themselves of Western dominance,' an objective Iran upholds. He emphasized that emerging powers, including Iran, should play a prominent role in shaping a new world order that promotes more democratic governance, away from Western colonialism. Kharrazi clarified that the steps taken so far within the frameworks of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BRICS, and the New Development Bank all align with this vision. He pointed out that Iran is a member of these organizations and is actively working toward establishing a new world order. He also highlighted that the agreement between Iran and the Russian Federation is ready and it encompasses all aspects of bilateral relations and cooperation. Kharrazi noted that the agreement was originally scheduled to be signed during the recent BRICS meeting in Kazan, Russia, but the Russians preferred to finalize it during a bilateral visit to emphasize its significance, which will occur soon. Kharrazi explained that all neighboring countries are aware of Iran's strategic policy and are currently moving in that direction. He acknowledged that those who may not be pleased with this approach may resort to disseminating biased media narratives that do not serve regional interests.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2253451	2024-11-01T12:21:00-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2018/01/manar-06632340015163625584.jpg
Speaker Berri: ‘Israel’ Rejected Lebanon’s Ceasefire Roadmap, Gaz...	The Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri indicated that the Israeli enemy's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the ceasefire roadmap adopted by the Lebanese government in agreement with the US presidential envoy Amos Hochstein. Netanyahu obliterated the latest ceasefire opportunity in Lebanon, Speaker Berri said in an interview with the Saudi newspaper, Asharq Al-Awsat. Speaker Berri noted that the political endeavor aimed at concluding a ceasefire in Lebanon had been postponed till after the US presidential elections, adding that the battlefield would have its say and voicing its concerns and fears of Gaza scenario recurrence in Lebanon. Hochstein promised to contact us in case of observing positive indications during his meetings in Tel Aviv, Speaker Berri said, adding that the US envoy left without telling us about the results of his visit to the occupation entity. Speaker Berri reiterated Lebanon's commitment to the implementation of the UN Resolution 1701 without any amendment. Meeting with Force Commander of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), Major General Aroldo Lazaro, Speaker Berri stressed that 'Israel' has wasted, at least since last September, more than one tangible opportunity to cease fire, implement Resolution 1701, restore calm and return the displaced persons on both sides of the border.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2253264	2024-11-01T10:45:59-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-00377440017304830087.jpg

Mikati: ‘Israel’ Rejects Ceasefire, Evacuation Warnings Additiona...	Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati accused the Zionist entity on Friday of rejecting any ceasefire with Lebanon or any commitment to the UN Resolution 1701. In a meeting with UNIFIL Head of Mission and Force Commander Lt. Gen. Aroldo Lázaro at the Grand Serail, the acting Lebanese premier condemned the expansion of Israeli attacks, saying they signaled a Tel Aviv’s refusal to engage in truce efforts. 'The Israeli enemy's renewed expansion&#8230; and its renewed targeting of Beirut’s Dahiyeh with destructive raids are all stark indicators that confirm the Israeli enemy's rejection of all efforts being made to secure a ceasefire,' he said. Lebanon PM Najib Mikati in a meeting with UNIFIL's Lt. Gen. Aroldo Lázaro at the Grand Serail (November 1, 2024) Mikati denounced the Israeli regime’s evacuation warnings for Baalbek and the southern city of Tyre as an additional war crime. Meanwhile, he condemned the Israeli assaults on UNIFIL and the threats directed at its personnel, commending 'the determination of many friendly nations to support the continuation of UNIFIL’s work in south Lebanon.' Mikati insisted on the need to preserve the tasks and operational protocols assigned to UNIFIL, which are executed in close cooperation with the Lebanese Army. The Lebanese PM further reaffirmed Lebanon's ongoing commitment to the United Nations resolution and its provisions, asserting that 'Israeli statements and the diplomatic signals received by Lebanon reflect the enemy's obstinacy in rejecting proposed solutions and its insistence on a path of killing and destruction. This places the entire international community before its historical and moral responsibilities to stop this aggression.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2252923	2024-11-01T04:58:37-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-07260790017286522724.jpg

Regarding that the ground confrontation, the statement indicated that the Israeli occupation forces tried to advance into several positions, yet faced a firm resistance. The Israeli military units attempted to advance into Shihin and Al-Jebbin villages as well as Wadi Hamoul area as the Resistance fighters repelled them and forced them to withdraw into Labbouneh area, according to the field summary. The statement added that the Resistance fighters bombed the IOF gatherings in Ramya-Aita Shaab-Aitaroun axis, amid Zionist attempts to advance towards central Aitaroun and Aita Al-Shaab. The Israeli enemy refrained from advancing in the area between Blida and Houla due to the heavy losses inflicted by the Resistance upon its occupation soldiers last week, according to the statement. The Islamic Resistance also confronted an Israeli attempt to advance troops from Kfar Kila towards Tal Al-Nahas, killing or injuring a number of Israeli officer and soldiers, the statement read. The statement pointed out that the resistance fighters confronted Zionist attempts to advance towards the outskirts of Kfarchouba area in order to control the heights, repelling an attempt to advance troops into the southeastern sides of Khiam town. The rocketry force of the Resistance continued bombarding the Israeli border sites and barracks as well as the bases in the northern cities of occupied Palestine with various types of missiles and ranges which reach Tel Aviv suburbs, carrying out 655 launch operations so far, including 63 during the past 3 days, according to the statement. The statement noted that the Islamic Resistance has launched more than 170 drones since September 17, 2024, hitting various targets, including the southern suburbs of Tel Aviv. According to the statement, the Islamic Resistance has fired 20 surface-to-air missiles at Zionist war jets and drones since September 17, 2024. The statement highlighted that, since the beginning of the 'ground maneuver', has lost 95 soldiers and officers, adding that more than 900 of others were injured. The Operations Room highlighted that the Islamic Resistance has so far destroyed 42 Merkava tanks, 4 military bulldozers, 2 Hummer vehicles, an armored vehicle, and an armored personnel carrier and downed 3 Hermes 450 and one Hermes 900 drones. The statement noted that the above-mentioned losses do not include those inflicted upon the Zionist settlements, bases, barracks, and sites within occupied Palestine. Finally, the statement noted that: The enemy forces avoid moving and positioning within the fields of vision of the Resistance fighters for fear of being targeted. They create invisible crossings and paths and rely on infiltrating at night into the border villages and withdrawing from them after destroying civilians' homes and sabotaging the infrastructure. The supply lines to the front and the axes of engagement have not been disrupted since the beginning of the aggression on Lebanon, and the fronts are still being supplied with weapons and the necessary equipment according to the plans prepared in advance. Despite the enemy's full intelligence control of the skies of the south, the resistance fighters are still able to position, arm and launch hundreds of rocket barrages towards enemy soldiers' positions deep inside the entity on a daily and continuous basis, round the clock. This is confirmed by the videos published by the war media. The enemy has not been able to thwart any launching operation from Lebanese territory. The Islamic Resistance continued on Thursday heroically fighting the elite units of the Israeli occupation army near Lebanon border, inflicting heavy losses upon the enemy troops.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2252527	2024-10-31T16:31:31-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-01168670017304174405.jpg
Sayyed Houthi: Hezbollah Resilience Shocked Israeli Enemy	Head of Yemen's Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Houthi stressed Thursday that over a month of ground aggression on southern Lebanon has revealed the tremendous resilience of the Lebanese Resistance, contrary to the enemy’s expectation of an easy conquest. In a televised speech, Sayyed Houthi maintained that the Israeli enemy is shocked by the resilience of Hezbollah fighters and has suffered significant losses and repeated defeats. 'The Israeli enemy, in its ground aggression on Lebanon, is defeated in every aspect, suffering around a thousand casualties, though they keep this concealed.' Houthi added that, despite heavy firepower, the Israeli enemy has clearly failed to achieve any field breakthroughs in its ground aggression on Lebanon, noting that the enemy finds itself in a genuine dilemma in its ground assault on Lebanon. The enemy attempted to modify its tactics f used in the July 2006 aggression by using infiltration forces and few armored vehicles, but failed, he stressed. Any tactic the Israeli enemy employs in the ground aggression on Lebanon results in significant losses and ends in failure, he added. 'The ground battle in southern Lebanon presents a true opportunity, as the enemy relied on air force to kill from a distance and then flee.' Houthi maintained that the operation targeting the criminal Netanyahu in his bedroom was impactful and effective, adding tha Hezbollah’s operations have forced millions of occupying Zionists to spend most of their time in shelters, living in fear and terror without enjoying a normal life. 'The Leader congratulated Sheikh Naim Qassem upon his appointment as Secretary-General of Hezbollah, describing him as a distinguished leader and one of the party's prominent founders. We in Yemen stand by Sheikh Naim Qassem, alongside our brothers in Hezbollah and the Lebanese people, with all that we can.' 'The increasing performance of our dear brothers, the fighters in Iraq, is noticeable, bringing pride and posing a significant threat to the Israeli enemy,' Houthi said. Yemen’s operations at sea to target ships linked to the 'Israeli,' American, and British enemies continue, with limited movement in the Red Sea, he added. In continuation of the support of the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and resistance against the Israeli oppression, and retaliation to the American-British aggression against Yemen, the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out three military operations as part of the continuation of imposing a naval blockade on the Israeli enemy. 'The targeting of four ships this week was highly significant, and we are working to increase pressure, tracking them to the far east of the Arabian Sea and into the Indian Ocean, God willing. For the first time, Israeli enemy interests have been targeted this way in the Red Sea and Bab El-Mandab over an extended period of more than a year.' Despite their frustration, the Americans are trying to stop the maritime operations through their continuous aggression, Houthi noted. 'The Americans carry out weekly airstrikes and maintain political and economic pressure on our country. The Americans consistently attempt to involve others, particularly the Saudi-Emirati coalition, in escalation to serve the Israeli enemy’s interests.' We continuously monitor American activity against our country and nation, and we are always preparing for any level of escalation, he stressed. The Saudis and others know that their involvement in Yemen and direct alliance with the Americans to support the 'Israeli' enemy would bring disgrace and shame, Houthi affirmed. No one will be able to halt our operations until the aggression is stopped, the siege on Gaza is lifted, and the assault on Lebanon ends, Houthi confirmed. 'The Security Council is a council for the security of the oppressors, not for the weak and oppressed. The so-called courts of justice and criminal courts have done nothing for our nation.' Organizations and institutions claimed to represent our nation have, in reality, caused more harm to our people and forces than they have to the enemy, Sayyed Houthi stressed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2252439	2024-10-31T13:16:32-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-00573720017304057817.jpg

Haredi Settlers Protest against Enlisting in Israeli Army: 'We Wo...	Declaring that they would rather die than enlist in the Israeli military, dozens of ultra-Orthodox demonstrators protest at a military induction center in an attempt to disrupt the drafting of a number of yeshiva students to the occupation army. Israeli occupation security forces work to remove members of the extremist Jerusalem Faction, some of whom tried to lie down in front of buses at the Tel Hashomer base, the Ynet news site reports. 🏴‍☠⚔🏴‍☠ Haredi settlers demonstrate in front of the recruitment headquarters in Tel Hashomer, rejecting their compulsory recruitment and saying: We will die rather than enlist pic.twitter.com/E3x1rUQ4BX — Military Observer (@MilitaryObs2222) October 31, 2024 The protest comes against the backdrop of bitter disagreements in the Knesset over the issue of Haredi enlistment to the Israeli army, after the High Court of Justice ruled in June that there was no longer any legal framework allowing the state to refrain from drafting ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students into compulsory service. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly reassured his ultra-Orthodox coalition partners that his government will advance a bill facilitating sweeping exemptions for Haredi men from mandatory military service. The dispute over the ultra-Orthodox community serving in the military is one of the most contentious in the Zionist entity, with decades of governmental and judicial attempts to settle the issue never achieving a stable resolution. The issue has grown in urgency as the occupation military suffers from a lack of troops and pressure on reservists increases over the past year of war. Ultra-Orthodox Jews protest against the draft (September 29, 2024). A group of Israeli army reservists recently sent on Wednesday a letter to Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi criticizing the continued failure to draft members of the ultra-Orthodox community, a move that they said would have helped reduce the large number of days they have been required to serve since the start of the war in Gaza over a year ago. The letter accused the Israeli military of having 'failed' its reserve soldiers who are frustrated and burnt-out after multiple stints in Gaza, on the northern border, and now in southern Lebanon amid the ongoing ground offensive there. Earlier on Saturday (October 28), Israeli army radio reported that less than four percent of the 3,000 Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) Israelis who received recruitment orders since July to join the military have done so.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2252065	2024-10-31T03:13:12-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-05825860017303694772.jpg

Iran Denies Report on Breach of Iran’s Airspace by Israeli Jets	Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Aziz Nasirzadeh has vehemently rejected media reports that Israeli warplanes violated Iran's airspace during a recent military attack. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, General Nasirzadeh dismissed the rumors, stating that no Israeli fighter jets had entered Iranian airspace on October 26. 'According to the United Nations Charter, whenever the airspace of a country is violated, that country will be entitled to respond to the violation and act of aggression,' the defense minister declared, warning that Iran would not hesitate to retaliate. Nasirzadeh also dismissed reports that a military site in Iran's northern city of Shahrud had been damaged in an alleged Israeli strike from the country's northern borders. He insisted that while the enemy had attempted to target Iran's defense systems, their efforts had failed as Iran had made the necessary civil defense arrangements in advance. Iran would respond to any Israeli aggression against its soil, even if the action is as tiny and ineffective as throwing an arrow toward one of the country's deserts, the Iranian defense chief says. — Mehr News Agency (@MehrnewsCom) October 30, 2024 The minister stressed that Iran's production of offensive capabilities, such as missiles, remained uninterrupted. He emphasized that Iran would respond even to a single bullet being fired at its territory, let alone the latest act of aggression by the Zionist regime. In a separate statement, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei, underscored the necessity of disrupting the 'flawed calculations' of the Zionist regime regarding Iran, warning that the enemy must 'realize who the Iranian people are and what the Iranian youth are like.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2250525	2024-10-30T06:09:33-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-05296280017302937676.jpg

Israeli occupation forces further escalated their operations by targeting the al-Fakhoura School run by UNRWA in Jabalia Camp, setting it ablaze.

Under the unyielding siege, northern Gaza is facing acute shortages in basic supplies, with the occupation restricting humanitarian aid and directly targeting health and civil defense teams. The Gaza Government Media Office has confirmed that Israeli occupation forces are engaged in a systematic campaign of genocide, with over 770 Palestinians killed and 1,000 injured in the past 20 days alone. The Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor said Israel’s military has attacked shelters hosting displaced people in Gaza 39 times so far in October.

Al-Hamas pointed out that there are about 110 thousand children in the north of Gaza who need the second dose of the polio vaccine, and that the spread of the disease in Gaza means its spread in the West Bank and 'Israel'. Al-Hams called on the countries of the world to take action and not be satisfied with watching the war of genocide in the Gaza Strip.

Islamic Resistance Operations Room: Israeli Enemy Has so far Fail...	The Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance issued a summary of the latest developments of the battle with the Israeli enemy, confirming that the Zionist troops have failed to control any of the Lebanese border towns. The Islamic Resistance fighters continued, based on accurate intelligence data, to confront the 'Israeli' aggression against Lebanon, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy army in terms of personnel and equipment across various confrontation fronts at the front lines, im addition to their positions in the depths of occupied Palestine, according to the statement. 'The past few days have witnessed a notable increase in the number of daily operations carried out by the Islamic Resistance, reaching a new record of 48 operations on Friday, October 25, 2024, since the beginning of Al-Aqsa Flood Battle.' The statement gave sufficient details about the ground confrontations, as follows. 1. Ground confrontations: The vicinity and some neighborhoods of the front-line villages in southern Lebanon along the Lebanese-Palestinian border have seen numerous attempts by the 'Israeli' enemy army to advance towards these villages with the aim of occupying and controlling them. The Islamic Resistance fighters have confronted these attempts across multiple fronts as follows: • First Front: Area of operations of the enemy's 146th Division, extending from Al-Naqoura in the west to Marwahin in the east. The enemy forces made several attempts to infiltrate towards the southern neighborhoods of the villages of Marwahin, Dhayra, Yarin, and Al-Matmura, aiming to rig houses with explosives and destroy them for fear they might be used by the fighters. They also set fire to the forests between the towns of Alma Al-Shaab and Dhayra. The Islamic Resistance fighters repelled these attempts and targeted the enemy's concentrations and advance routes on the outskirts of Marwahin and southern Dhayra with appropriate weapons, inflicting heavy losses on their personnel and vehicles, forcing the enemy's leadership to significantly reduce the number of troops in the 146th Division in this front. • Second Front: Area of operations of the enemy's 36th Division, extending from Ramya in the west to Rmeish in the east (including Aita Al-Shaab), and from Rmeish to Aitaroun in the east. Following precise intelligence surveillance of the movements of the 'Israeli' enemy around the town of Aita Al-Shaab and some of its neighborhoods, the Islamic Resistance fighters ambushed an 'Israeli' force that advanced towards the 'Abu Al-Laban' hill east of the town early on Thursday, October 24, 2024. Upon the arrival of the force at the ambush point, the fighters engaged in close combat with enemy officers and soldiers for hours. The fighters who participated in the ambush confirmed the death of more than 5 enemy soldiers and numerous wounded whose screams were heard at the scene. On the other side, when some enemy groups attempted to advance towards the center of Aitaroun from the eastern neighborhoods, the fighters of the Resistance targeted them with heavy rocket fire and artillery shells repeatedly, resulting in several deaths and injuries among them, which forced the enemy forces to retreat to less exposed areas. • Third Front: Area of operations of the enemy's 91st Division, extending from Blida in the south to Houla in the north. The Islamic Resistance fighters lured an 'Israeli' force, reinforced with a Merkava tank, towards the eastern neighborhoods of the town of Houla and targeted it with a guided missile, resulting in its destruction and burning, as well as killing and wounding its crew and the force stationed behind it. Additionally, the fire support unit of the Islamic Resistance targeted enemy concentrations and gatherings at the outskirts and in some neighborhoods of Houla. • Fourth Front: Area of operations of the enemy's 98th Division, extending from Markaba in the south to the occupied Lebanese village of Al-Ghajar in the northeast.  The Islamic Resistance fighters were able to destroy several enemy tanks that attempted to advance towards the town of Odaisseh in recent days and targeted enemy concentrations in and around several neighborhoods in the towns of Houla, Markaba, and Rab Thalathin. The Resistance intensified its fire over the past two days towards enemy concentrations in the vicinity of Fatima Gate at the Lebanese-Palestinian border opposite the town of Kfar Kila. • Fifth Front: Area of operations of the enemy's 210th Division, extending from the village of Al-Ghajar to the occupied Lebanese Shebaa Farms. The Islamic Resistance fighters repeatedly and intensively targeted numerous enemy attempts to advance in the outskirts of the towns of Kfar Shuba and Shebaa to seize the heights. The enemy intentionally set fire to the forests in the area for fear of any offensive operation by the Resistance. * The Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance confirms that as of the publication of this field summary, the enemy army has not been able to firmly control or occupy any village completely among the front-line villages in southern Lebanon. 2- Rocket Force: The Rocket Force of the Islamic Resistance continues to target enemy concentrations at military sites and barracks along the Lebanese-Palestinian border, reaching military, strategic, and security bases deep in occupied Palestine with various types of rockets, including precision-guided missiles that are being used for the first time. The number of launches executed by the Rocket Force over the past four days has reached 103 operations. 3- Air Force: The Air Force of the Islamic Resistance continues, with a progressively increasing pace day by day, to target enemy military bases from the Lebanese-Palestinian border to deep in occupied Palestine.

Qualitative Run-Over Operation Shakes Tel Aviv: Six Killed, 50 In...	Six Israelis were killed and dozens injured in a heroic vehicle-ramming incident at the Glilot junction on the outskirts of Tel Aviv on Sunday.

'Your settlements have become bases and staging grounds for enemy military forces attacking Lebanon. As a result, they have become legitimate military targets for the Islamic Resistance’s air and missile forces.'

Supreme Leader Issues Condolence Statement on Martyrdom of Hezbol...	The Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Imam Khamenei, issued a statement addressing the dear youth of the Resistance Front, praising the personality of His Eminence, the Head of the Executive Council of Hezbollah in Lebanon, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine (May Allah's blessings be upon him). His Eminence emphasized, 'Hezbollah today remains the strongest defender of Lebanon and the firmest shield against the ambitions of the Zionist entity, which has long sought to dismantle Lebanon.' 'The brave and sacrificing fighter, His Eminence Sayyed Hashem Safieddine (May Allah's blessings be upon him), has joined the ranks of the martyrs of the Resistance. The sky of fight in the path of Sacred Al-Quds is now adorned with a new shining star. His Eminence was one of the most prominent figures in Hezbollah, a steadfast supporter and constant companion of His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Thanks to the wisdom and courage of leaders like him, Hezbollah was able to protect Lebanon from the danger of division and collapse once again and thwart the threat posed by the usurping entity, whose cruel and unjust army sometimes trampled the ground all the way to Beirut. His Eminence's chivalry and sacrifice, alongside the other leaders and fighters in the Axis of Nasrallah, eliminated the danger of the occupation of southern Litani, Tyre, and other cities in that region, and their annexation to the usurped and occupied Palestine. They made the souls, properties, and valuable reputation of Hezbollah enter the battlefield to preserve the sovereignty of Lebanon's territories, foiling the plans of the aggressive and criminal Zionist entity.' While it may appear today that leaders like Nasrallah and Safieddine are absent in this life, their souls and leadership remain present in the field, defending Lebanon and its defenseless people, Imam Khamenei underlined. 'Hezbollah today remains the strongest defender of Lebanon and the firmest shield against the ambitions of the Zionist entity, which has long sought to divide Lebanon. The enemy tries to deny Hezbollah's sacrificial role for Lebanon, but those who care must not allow these false claims shouted by their voices to reach people's ears.' 'Hezbollah is alive and growing stronger, fulfilling its historic role. The Islamic Republic, as always, will continue to support the fighters for Al-Quds and the resistors against the occupation by the criminal and usurping gang of Palestine, by Allah's permission.' I offer my congratulations and condolences on the martyrdom of our dear Sayyed Safieddine to his honorable family, his relatives, and his fellow fighters across all Resistance fronts, Imam Khamenei concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2243551	2024-10-24T13:37:06-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/06/manar-089647100168752915110.jpg

Sayyed Houthi: Resistance in Lebanon, Palestine Surprised Enemies	Head of Yemen's Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Al-Houthi tackled in a televised speech on Thursday the latest developments of the Israeli aggression on Gaza and Lebanon, offering Hezbollah condolences on the martyrdom of Sayyed Hashem Safieddine. Sayyed Houthi underlined the great faith and jihadi contributions of the martyred leader Sayyed Safieddine, pointing that the enemy aims at striking the Umma morale by targeting its leaders. Sayyed Houthi indicated that what the Israeli enemy is doing, including committing crimes of genocide and targeting children and women, is not a military achievement. 'From a military perspective, the Israeli enemy has failed, and its failure is evident in Gaza and on the northern front against Lebanon, as well as in all other fronts.' Arabs are targeted by the Israeli enemy more than anyone else, regardless of how some may ignore or turn a blind eye to these established truths, Sayyed Houthi said. The enemy has encountered the solid front of Hezbollah after expecting that by targeting leaders, it would have the opportunity to control Lebanon, he stressed. According to Sayyed Houthi, the Israeli enemy has resorted to criminal behavior by comprehensively targeting civilians in Lebanon and destroying residential neighborhoods and villages. The Israeli enemy, along with the Americans, is attempting to pressure for a change in the political situation and stance of the Lebanese government and its components, Houthi added. 'The enemy is trying to incite everyone against Hezbollah, portraying it as the problem in Lebanon,' he said, 'The real threat to Lebanon's security, safety, independence, and the freedom of the Lebanese people is the Israeli enemy.' 'The enemy aims, at the very least, for part of Lebanon to be under its control, framed as a security belt, like in the past, and to control the sources of rivers. The experience of the Lebanese people rallying around the Islamic Resistance to achieve victory and repel the Israeli enemy is the available and correct solution.' Sayyed Houthi also noted that the enemy seeks to impose options that serve its interests under the guise of 'the second day in Gaza,' with support from some Arab regimes. 'The Palestinian factions and the Palestinian people will not accept options that serve the Israeli enemy and are aware of the American deception since Al-Aqsa Flood operation.' 'The Americans, in collaboration with the Israelis, are preparing for an aggressive operation against the Islamic Republic of Iran, while sending their Secretary of State to speak about peace and stop escalation.' The American approach is part of a tactic to serve the Israeli position, and our Ummah should not be deceived by the American stance, he warned. Al-Qassam Brigades are inflicting heavy losses on the Israeli enemy, and the martyrdom of Sheikh Sinwar has only increased their determination, inspiration, and steadfastness, Houthi emphasized. 'The impact of the martyrdom of Sheikh Sinwar, may Allah have mercy on him, on both the Palestinian and global levels cannot be erased by the Israeli enemy's attempts to distort the heroic and inspiring stance surrounding his sacrifice.' Al-Quds Brigades and other Palestinian factions stand bravely alongside Al-Qassam Brigades, carrying out daily heroic operations, he added. 'The Lebanese front has established the equation of Yafa (Tel Aviv) and turned Haifa into an abandoned city, with the occupiers spending most of their time in shelters.' The significant jihad operation by Hezbollah, which breached the enemy's defense systems and reached the bedroom of the criminal Netanyahu, has instilled fear in the hearts of all Israeli leaders, Houthi stressed. Meanwhile, the support front in Iraq continues to escalate steadily, unconcerned by media attacks, political pressure from the U.S., and its allies, Houthi noted. 'Our front in Yemen, the land of faith and wisdom, remains steadfast and resilient in the battle of the promised opening and the sacred jihad.' Operations at sea and the bombardment of the Israeli enemy with rockets and drones targeting occupied Palestine continue, Sayyed Houthi confirmed. 'The intense popular activities in Yemen are unparalleled anywhere in the world. We are in a practical path, preparing for any level of escalation the Americans and Israelis may resort to.' The banner of jihad in the way of Allah, carried by our Yemeni people, is high, steadfast, and firmly rooted, he stresed. There is no weakness, fatigue, or defeat, only steadfastness and resilience expressed by the Yemeni people through their positions and sacrifices, demonstrated in their weekly million-strong marches, Sayyed Houthi concluded. In continuation of the support of the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and resistance against the Israeli oppression,and retaliation to the American-British aggression against Yemen, the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out a specific military operation targeting a military base belonging to the Israeli occupation east of the occupied Yaffa area with a hypersonic ballistic missile Palestine 2.

Hezbollah Fighters Kill Over 70 Israeli Soldiers, Injure 600 Othe...	The Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance presented a summary for all the military confrontation with the Zionist occupation army, detailing the achievements of all Hezbollah military units. The Islamic Resistance continued to confront the Israeli aggression against Lebanon, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy’s army in terms of personnel and equipment across the fronts, in addition to its positions deep within occupied Palestine, according to the summary which gave the sufficient details, as follows. 1- Ground confrontations: In recent days, the surrounding areas and some neighborhoods of the front-line villages in southern Lebanon along the Lebanese-Palestinian border have witnessed numerous attempts by the 'Israeli' enemy army to advance toward these villages with the aim of occupying and controlling them. The fighters of the Islamic Resistance are resisting these attempts across multiple fronts as follows: - First Front: The area of operations of the enemy's 146th division, extending from Naqoura in the west to Marwahin in the east. Operations in this sector have been limited to infiltration attempts toward the southern neighborhoods of Marwahin, Al-Dhayra, Yarin, and Alma Al-Shaab, with the intention of rigging houses and blowing them up to prevent their use by the fighters. The fighters of the Islamic Resistance have confronted these attempts, targeting the enemy’s gatherings and lines of advance in Ras Naqoura, Hanita, and the vicinity of Al-Dhayra village. - Second Front: The area of operations of the enemy's 36th division, extending from Ramya in the west to Rmeish in the east (including Aita Al-Shaab), and from Rmeish to Aitaroun in the east. Following the heroic confrontations in the triangle of Aita Al-Shaab - Al-Qawzah - Ramya last week, where the enemy suffered heavy losses at the hands of the Resistance fighters, the enemy attempted in recent days to advance toward the 'Abu Al-Laban' height east of Aita Al-Shaab to occupy it and establish control over the town. The fighters of the Islamic Resistance confronted the enemy’s forces, targeting its gatherings and lines of advance in Khallet Wardeh and the vicinity of Aita Al-Shaab, as well as targeting many troops that infiltrated the area around the municipality building, resulting in casualties, including deaths and injuries. The evacuation operations continued for hours due to repeated resistance attacks. Enemy formations are attempting to advance toward the center of Aitaroun from the eastern and western neighborhoods to occupy it and isolate it from its surroundings. Simultaneously, attempts to advance toward the centers of Maroun Al-Ras and Yaroun are being made from the southern neighborhoods of the two towns. The fighters of the Islamic Resistance are targeting the enemy's gatherings and lines of advance with intense and repeated barrages, inflicting significant losses and hindering their movement, forcing them to retreat to less exposed areas. - Third Front: The area of operations of the enemy's 91st division, extending from Blida in the south to Houla in the north. The enemy’s forces advanced in this sector through concealed paths toward some eastern neighborhoods of Mays Al-Jabal, Mhaibib, and Blida, where they rigged and detonated some houses. The enemy is attempting to advance toward the eastern neighborhoods of Hula amid fierce confrontations with the fighters of the Islamic Resistance. It should be noted that the enemy's actions in rigging and exploding houses in Mhaibib come after its failure to establish control over the town and secure its forces out of fear of resistance attacks. - Fourth Front: The area of operations of the enemy's 98th division, extending from Markaba in the south to the occupied Lebanese village of Al-Ghajar in the east. The enemy attempted to infiltrate into the town of Al-Taybeh from the southern and eastern sides, and the fighters of the Islamic Resistance responded with small arms and rockets, resulting in many fatalities and injuries among the infiltrating force. 2- Rocket Force: The Rocket Force of the Islamic Resistance continues to target enemy concentrations in military sites and barracks along the Lebanese-Palestinian border and in the occupied northern cities and settlements. This targeting is progressively escalating day by day, reaching the enemy's military, strategic, and security bases deep within occupied Palestine using various types of missiles, including precision missiles that are being used for the first time. 3- Air Force: The Air Force of the Islamic Resistance is persistently monitoring and targeting enemy military bases from the Lebanese-Palestinian border to the depths of occupied Palestine using various types of drones, including advanced types that are being used for the first time. 4- Air Defense Unit: The fighters of the Islamic Resistance in the air defense units are responding to 'Israeli' aircraft, both reconnaissance and combat, that are violating Lebanese airspace. They have managed to shoot down four drones. According to the summary, the total losses inflicted on the enemy, as recorded by the fighters of the Islamic Resistance, exceed 70 killed and more than 600 wounded among the officers and soldiers of the 'Israeli' enemy army. 'This includes the destruction of 28 Merkava tanks, four military bulldozers, and several armored vehicles and personnel carriers. Additionally, three drones of the 'Hermes 450' model and one of the 'Hermes 900' model have been shot down.' This tally does not include the losses incurred by the Israeli enemy in the military bases and sites in northern and deep occupied Palestine, the summary concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2241912	2024-10-23T12:29:04-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-08559660017297117333.jpg
In-Depth | The Hidden Motives Behind Hochstein’s Visit and the St...	Zoulfikar Daher The first visit of US envoy Amos Hochstein to Beirut since the outbreak of Israel’s large-scale aggression against Lebanon came approximately three weeks after the Israeli enemy expanded its operations across southern Lebanon, the Bekaa, and even the southern suburbs of Beirut and the capital itself. US special envoy Amos Hochstein speaks to reporters after a meeting with Lebanon's Parliament Speaker in Beirut on October 21, 2024. US special envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut on October 21 to meet Lebanon's PM and Speaker of the House Nabih Berri (Photo by AFP) Prior to his visit, speculation arose about its true purpose: Was Hochstein bringing concrete solutions, or was he simply testing the waters and assessing the political landscape? Some questioned whether he was delivering Israeli demands aimed at pressuring Lebanon into submission. Did this move stem from American initiative alone, or was it coordinated with 'Israel' as part of its efforts to impose terms? Alternatively, could it signal Israel’s realization that the conflict with the resistance is proving more difficult than anticipated, given the losses it has suffered along the Lebanese-Palestinian border? There is a view that the Israeli enemy, recognizing the challenge posed by the resistance, is attempting to de-escalate while still hoping to extract some benefit from its tactical strikes. However, these strikes have done little to alter the situation. The resistance remains steadfast, its retaliation capabilities growing and reaching deeper into Israeli territory, while its capacity to manage the conflict remains strong. Fearing that Israel’s 'achievements' on the ground might slip away, the US administration appears to have dispatched Hochstein to reopen negotiations. The strategy follows a familiar pattern: escalate demands to the maximum in hopes of gaining concessions, all while threatening continued aggression. Simultaneously, Israeli attacks intensified in various areas, particularly in the southern suburbs of Beirut (Dahiyeh). The timing of these escalations, paired with Hochstein’s visit, was no coincidence. 'Israel' aimed to showcase its destructive capabilities, resorting to psychological warfare by targeting buildings associated with the Al-Qard Al-Hassan Association, although these were largely unoccupied. This was intended to send a message to the Lebanese leadership receiving the American envoy. The strikes continued the following night, extending to Al-Awzai and areas near Beirut’s governmental hospital. But the question remains: Can these aggressive moves impose Israel’s conditions on Lebanon? Hochstein reportedly presented amendments to UN Resolution 1701, which included: • Expanding the role of international forces and allowing them to operate without restrictions. • Pushing the resistance several kilometers north of the Litani River, with some reports suggesting as far as the Owali River near Sidon. • Assigning oversight of the resolution’s implementation to US, British, or German forces. • Granting 'Israel' unrestricted access to Lebanese airspace for supervision. These terms essentially aim to hand 'Israel' significant control, leaving Lebanon, its army, people, and resistance with little ability to defend national sovereignty. Some media and political voices have described this proposal as nothing less than a 'surrender document.' However, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri reaffirmed Lebanon’s commitment to Resolution 1701, with no amendments. He emphasized that this is the final opportunity for the US to intervene diplomatically and halt the war. Berri made clear that Lebanon stands united on Resolution 1701, and that 'Israel' must respect it. He anticipated that Hochstein would push Israel’s maximum demands but remained confident that nothing could be imposed on Lebanon. 'Israel' has failed to achieve its objectives on the battlefield, and it will not succeed through diplomacy either. Hochstein’s visit, it seems, was primarily a test of Lebanon’s resolve—an attempt to gauge whether the country, particularly the resistance, might offer concessions under pressure. But Lebanon’s leadership, backed by its steadfast resistance, will not yield. Neither the US, nor the Zionist entity, nor their allies can force Lebanon into submission. Contrary to some perceptions, 'Israel' is not in a position of strength. Those following the situation behind the scenes of Hochstein’s visit might believe 'Israel' can impose its will, but the facts tell a different story. For over three weeks, it has faced setbacks along the border with Lebanon, failing to make significant gains or take control of any Lebanese towns. These developments underscore that the US-Israeli pressure campaign is shallow and ineffective against the united front of Lebanon, its resistance, and its people. Ultimately, the outcome of this conflict will be decided on the battlefield, where the resistance, as emphasized by its leader, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah (may he rest in peace), continues to hold the upper hand. The realities on the ground, both day and night, will shape the political and diplomatic consequences, not the other way around. The battlefield will determine the fate of this war, and indeed, the future of the entire region.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2241791	2024-10-23T11:58:49-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-036995100172970991310.png
Sayyed Nasrallah, Sinwar’s Struggle Altered Fate of Region: Supre...	Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has said the struggle and resilience of resistance figures, such as Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Yahya Sinwar, have fundamentally altered the fate of the region. Ayatollah Khamenei made the remarks in a meeting with organizers of the Congress of 15,000 Martyrs of Fars Province on Wednesday. 'If figures like martyr Sinwar had not emerged to fight until the last moment, or if great leaders like martyr Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah had not combined jihad with wisdom, courage, and sacrifice, the fate of the region would have been different,' he stated. Nasrallah, the longtime leader of Hezbollah, was assassinated in a massive Israeli airstrike in southern Beirut on September 27, while Hamas leader Sinwar was martyred by Israeli occupying forces in Gaza on October 16. Ayatollah Khamenei noted that the Israeli regime’s failure to destroy the resistance despite massacring of 50,000 innocent people with Western-provided weapons is a big defeat for the Zionist regime. In the confrontation between the resistance front and the forces of evil, 'victory belongs to the resistance' he said. The Supreme Leader also condemned the Western politicians who remain indifferent to the suffering inflicted upon civilians, stating that their silence in the face of atrocities reveals their hypocrisy and undermines their claims of upholding human rights.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2241736	2024-10-23T10:41:47-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04562420017297050544.jpg
