The director of Kamal Adwan Hospital stated that most of the wounded face slim chances of survival due to severe shortages in medical resources, as Israeli bombardments have also impacted the hospital's surroundings while the ongoing siege restricts the flow of essential goods. Israeli occupation forces further escalated their operations by targeting the al-Fakhoura School run by UNRWA in Jabalia Camp, setting it ablaze. Concurrently, heavy artillery shelling has devastated the Jabalia and Safatwi areas, compounding the dire situation for civilians.

Under the unyielding siege, northern Gaza is facing acute shortages in basic supplies, with the occupation restricting humanitarian aid and directly targeting health and civil defense teams. The Gaza Government Media Office has confirmed that Israeli occupation forces are engaged in a systematic campaign of genocide, with over 770 Palestinians killed and 1,000 injured in the past 20 days alone. The Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor said Israel’s military has attacked shelters hosting displaced people in Gaza 39 times so far in October. These attacks aim to 'forcefully displace the Palestinian population from the area, and have killed 188 people and injured hundreds more.'… pic.twitter.com/oXku0eF5Np — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) October 29, 2024 Regarding the health disaster resulting from the ongoing aggression on the Strip, the Director General of Field Hospitals in the Ministry of Health in Gaza, Marwan Al-Hams, confirmed that the occupation is preventing the continuation of the second phase of vaccination against the 'polio' virus in the north of Gaza City and the north of the Strip. Al-Hamas pointed out that there are about 110 thousand children in the north of Gaza who need the second dose of the polio vaccine, and that the spread of the disease in Gaza means its spread in the West Bank and 'Israel'. Al-Hams called on the countries of the world to take action and not be satisfied with watching the war of genocide in the Gaza Strip. The ongoing aggression, launched on October 7, 2023, has so far claimed 43,020 lives and left 101,110 injured, with most casualties being children and women.

Qualitative Run-Over Operation Shakes Tel Aviv: Six Killed, 50 In...	Six Israelis were killed and dozens injured in a heroic vehicle-ramming incident at the Glilot junction on the outskirts of Tel Aviv on Sunday.

Hezbollah Requests Immediate Evacuation of 25 Israeli Settlements...	Hezbollah Military Media released a video which warns the Zionist settlers remaining in 25 settlements and cities in the north of occupied Palestine to evacuate them immediately. The settlements included, Kiryat Shmona, Nahariya, Rosh Pina, Katzrin, and 21 of others. 'You are requested to evacuate immediately,' Hezbollah warning read. 'Your settlements have become bases and staging grounds for enemy military forces attacking Lebanon. As a result, they have become legitimate military targets for the Islamic Resistance's air and missile forces.' The northern settlements municipal councils categorically rejected the decision of the 'home' front command which decided reopening schools in the North. The councils affirmed that the educational process will be continued online. Hezbollah’s Islamic Resistance continued its steadfast efforts to defend Lebanese territories, counter the Israeli occupation’s intense and brutal aggression, and support the Gaza Strip.

Hezbollah Commends Iranian Armed Forces for Successfully Repellin...	Hezbollah strongly condemned the treacherous Zionist aggression against the Islamic Republic of Iran, considering it a dangerous escalation across the entire region. This act reflects the aggressive nature of the occupying entity, which commits massacres and causes suffering and destruction with explicit and full support from the United States, which shares full responsibility for these atrocities and tragedies, Hezbollah affirmed in a statement issued late Friday. We believe that this blatant assault on Iran’s national sovereignty and on the beloved Islamic Republic will never affect its steadfast and clear stance, nor its full support at all levels for the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples, the statement added. 'We commend the Iranian armed forces, across their various specializations and units, for successfully repelling this treacherous attack. We extend our condolences to the leadership and honorable people of Iran for the martyrs on the path to Al-Quds, and we ask Allah to grant a swift recovery to the wounded and to bestow victory and resilience upon the Islamic Republic,' Hezbollah statement concluded.

Wissam Qassem, Al-Manar cameraman who was martyred in an Israeli aggression on journalists in Hasbaya (October 25, 2024). Al-Manar’s Qassem, along with his martyred colleagues have been in the latest month playing an essential role in covering the war, bearing witness to Israeli atrocities, revealing truths, and offering a voice to the oppressed people of Lebanon and Palestine. Ali Shoeib, Al-Manar’s well-known correspondent in south Lebanon, appeared in a video message filming himself with a cellphone and expressing his grief over the loss of his camera operator Wissam Qassem. Shoeib said the Israeli military knew that the area that was struck housed journalists of different media organizations. 'We were reporting the news and showing the suffering of the victims and now we are the news and the victims of Israel’s crimes,' Shoeib added in the video.

Makary (@ZiadMakary) October 25, 2024 'We heard the airplane flying very low – that’s what woke us up – and then we heard the two missiles,' Mohammad Farhat, a reporter with the Lebanese outlet Al-Jadeed, told Reuters. 'We had been reporting from there for about a month without anything happening. I don’t even know how I climbed out from under the rubble,' Farhat said. For his part, Ghassan bin Jiddo, the director of Al-Mayadeen, said on the channel’s X account that the attack was 'deliberate'. 'We hold the occupation (Israel) fully responsible for this war crime, in which journalist crews including the Al-Mayadeen team were targeted,' bin Jiddo said.

Supreme Leader Issues Condolence Statement on Martyrdom of Hezbol...	The Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Imam Khamenei, issued a statement addressing the dear youth of the Resistance Front, praising the personality of His Eminence, the Head of the Executive Council of Hezbollah in Lebanon, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine (May Allah's blessings be upon him). His Eminence emphasized, 'Hezbollah today remains the strongest defender of Lebanon and the firmest shield against the ambitions of the Zionist entity, which has long sought to dismantle Lebanon.' 'The brave and sacrificing fighter, His Eminence Sayyed Hashem Safieddine (May Allah's blessings be upon him), has joined the ranks of the martyrs of the Resistance. The sky of fight in the path of Sacred Al-Quds is now adorned with a new shining star. His Eminence was one of the most prominent figures in Hezbollah, a steadfast supporter and constant companion of His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Thanks to the wisdom and courage of leaders like him, Hezbollah was able to protect Lebanon from the danger of division and collapse once again and thwart the threat posed by the usurping entity, whose cruel and unjust army sometimes trampled the ground all the way to Beirut. His Eminence's chivalry and sacrifice, alongside the other leaders and fighters in the Axis of Nasrallah, eliminated the danger of the occupation of southern Litani, Tyre, and other cities in that region, and their annexation to the usurped and occupied Palestine. They made the souls, properties, and valuable reputation of Hezbollah enter the battlefield to preserve the sovereignty of Lebanon's territories, foiling the plans of the aggressive and criminal Zionist entity.' While it may appear today that leaders like Nasrallah and Safieddine are absent in this life, their souls and leadership remain present in the field, defending Lebanon and its defenseless people, Imam Khamenei underlined. 'Hezbollah today remains the strongest defender of Lebanon and the firmest shield against the ambitions of the Zionist entity, which has long sought to divide Lebanon. The enemy tries to deny Hezbollah's sacrificial role for Lebanon, but those who care must not allow these false claims shouted by their voices to reach people's ears.' 'Hezbollah is alive and growing stronger, fulfilling its historic role. The Islamic Republic, as always, will continue to support the fighters for Al-Quds and the resistors against the occupation by the criminal and usurping gang of Palestine, by Allah's permission.' I offer my congratulations and condolences on the martyrdom of our dear Sayyed Safieddine to his honorable family, his relatives, and his fellow fighters across all Resistance fronts, Imam Khamenei concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2243551	2024-10-24T13:37:06-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/06/manar-089647100168752915110.jpg

Sayyed Houthi: Resistance in Lebanon, Palestine Surprised Enemies	Head of Yemen's Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Al-Houthi tackled in a televised speech on Thursday the latest developments of the Israeli aggression on Gaza and Lebanon, offering Hezbollah condolences on the martyrdom of Sayyed Hashem Safieddine. Sayyed Houthi underlined the great faith and jihadi contributions of the martyred leader Sayyed Safieddine, pointing that the enemy aims at striking the Umma morale by targeting its leaders. Sayyed Houthi indicated that what the Israeli enemy is doing, including committing crimes of genocide and targeting children and women, is not a military achievement. 'From a military perspective, the Israeli enemy has failed, and its failure is evident in Gaza and on the northern front against Lebanon, as well as in all other fronts.' Arabs are targeted by the Israeli enemy more than anyone else, regardless of how some may ignore or turn a blind eye to these established truths, Sayyed Houthi said. The enemy has encountered the solid front of Hezbollah after expecting that by targeting leaders, it would have the opportunity to control Lebanon, he stressed. According to Sayyed Houthi, the Israeli enemy has resorted to criminal behavior by comprehensively targeting civilians in Lebanon and destroying residential neighborhoods and villages. The Israeli enemy, along with the Americans, is attempting to pressure for a change in the political situation and stance of the Lebanese government and its components, Houthi added. 'The enemy is trying to incite everyone against Hezbollah, portraying it as the problem in Lebanon,' he said, 'The real threat to Lebanon's security, safety, independence, and the freedom of the Lebanese people is the Israeli enemy.' 'The enemy aims, at the very least, for part of Lebanon to be under its control, framed as a security belt, like in the past, and to control the sources of rivers. The experience of the Lebanese people rallying around the Islamic Resistance to achieve victory and repel the Israeli enemy is the available and correct solution.' Sayyed Houthi also noted that the enemy seeks to impose options that serve its interests under the guise of 'the second day in Gaza,' with support from some Arab regimes. 'The Palestinian factions and the Palestinian people will not accept options that serve the Israeli enemy and are aware of the American deception since Al-Aqsa Flood operation.' 'The Americans, in collaboration with the Israelis, are preparing for an aggressive operation against the Islamic Republic of Iran, while sending their Secretary of State to speak about peace and stop escalation.' The American approach is part of a tactic to serve the Israeli position, and our Ummah should not be deceived by the American stance, he warned. Al-Qassam Brigades are inflicting heavy losses on the Israeli enemy, and the martyrdom of Sheikh Sinwar has only increased their determination, inspiration, and steadfastness, Houthi emphasized. 'The impact of the martyrdom of Sheikh Sinwar, may Allah have mercy on him, on both the Palestinian and global levels cannot be erased by the Israeli enemy's attempts to distort the heroic and inspiring stance surrounding his sacrifice.' Al-Quds Brigades and other Palestinian factions stand bravely alongside Al-Qassam Brigades, carrying out daily heroic operations, he added. 'The Lebanese front has established the equation of Yafa (Tel Aviv) and turned Haifa into an abandoned city, with the occupiers spending most of their time in shelters.' The significant jihad operation by Hezbollah, which breached the enemy's defense systems and reached the bedroom of the criminal Netanyahu, has instilled fear in the hearts of all Israeli leaders, Houthi stressed. Meanwhile, the support front in Iraq continues to escalate steadily, unconcerned by media attacks, political pressure from the U.S., and its allies, Houthi noted. 'Our front in Yemen, the land of faith and wisdom, remains steadfast and resilient in the battle of the promised opening and the sacred jihad.' Operations at sea and the bombardment of the Israeli enemy with rockets and drones targeting occupied Palestine continue, Sayyed Houthi confirmed. 'The intense popular activities in Yemen are unparalleled anywhere in the world. We are in a practical path, preparing for any level of escalation the Americans and Israelis may resort to.' The banner of jihad in the way of Allah, carried by our Yemeni people, is high, steadfast, and firmly rooted, he stresed. There is no weakness, fatigue, or defeat, only steadfastness and resilience expressed by the Yemeni people through their positions and sacrifices, demonstrated in their weekly million-strong marches, Sayyed Houthi concluded. In continuation of the support of the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and resistance against the Israeli oppression,and retaliation to the American-British aggression against Yemen, the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out a specific military operation targeting a military base belonging to the Israeli occupation east of the occupied Yaffa area with a hypersonic ballistic missile Palestine 2.

Hezbollah Fighters Kill Over 70 Israeli Soldiers, Injure 600 Othe...	The Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance presented a summary for all the military confrontation with the Zionist occupation army, detailing the achievements of all Hezbollah military units. The Islamic Resistance continued to confront the Israeli aggression against Lebanon, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy’s army in terms of personnel and equipment across the fronts, in addition to its positions deep within occupied Palestine, according to the summary which gave the sufficient details, as follows. 1- Ground confrontations: In recent days, the surrounding areas and some neighborhoods of the front-line villages in southern Lebanon along the Lebanese-Palestinian border have witnessed numerous attempts by the 'Israeli' enemy army to advance toward these villages with the aim of occupying and controlling them. The fighters of the Islamic Resistance are resisting these attempts across multiple fronts as follows: - First Front: The area of operations of the enemy's 146th division, extending from Naqoura in the west to Marwahin in the east. Operations in this sector have been limited to infiltration attempts toward the southern neighborhoods of Marwahin, Al-Dhayra, Yarin, and Alma Al-Shaab, with the intention of rigging houses and blowing them up to prevent their use by the fighters. The fighters of the Islamic Resistance have confronted these attempts, targeting the enemy’s gatherings and lines of advance in Ras Naqoura, Hanita, and the vicinity of Al-Dhayra village. - Second Front: The area of operations of the enemy's 36th division, extending from Ramya in the west to Rmeish in the east (including Aita Al-Shaab), and from Rmeish to Aitaroun in the east. Following the heroic confrontations in the triangle of Aita Al-Shaab - Al-Qawzah - Ramya last week, where the enemy suffered heavy losses at the hands of the Resistance fighters, the enemy attempted in recent days to advance toward the 'Abu Al-Laban' height east of Aita Al-Shaab to occupy it and establish control over the town. The fighters of the Islamic Resistance confronted the enemy’s forces, targeting its gatherings and lines of advance in Khallet Wardeh and the vicinity of Aita Al-Shaab, as well as targeting many troops that infiltrated the area around the municipality building, resulting in casualties, including deaths and injuries. The evacuation operations continued for hours due to repeated resistance attacks. Enemy formations are attempting to advance toward the center of Aitaroun from the eastern and western neighborhoods to occupy it and isolate it from its surroundings. Simultaneously, attempts to advance toward the centers of Maroun Al-Ras and Yaroun are being made from the southern neighborhoods of the two towns. The fighters of the Islamic Resistance are targeting the enemy's gatherings and lines of advance with intense and repeated barrages, inflicting significant losses and hindering their movement, forcing them to retreat to less exposed areas. - Third Front: The area of operations of the enemy's 91st division, extending from Blida in the south to Houla in the north. The enemy’s forces advanced in this sector through concealed paths toward some eastern neighborhoods of Mays Al-Jabal, Mhaibib, and Blida, where they rigged and detonated some houses. The enemy is attempting to advance toward the eastern neighborhoods of Hula amid fierce confrontations with the fighters of the Islamic Resistance. It should be noted that the enemy's actions in rigging and exploding houses in Mhaibib come after its failure to establish control over the town and secure its forces out of fear of resistance attacks. - Fourth Front: The area of operations of the enemy's 98th division, extending from Markaba in the south to the occupied Lebanese village of Al-Ghajar in the east. The enemy attempted to infiltrate into the town of Al-Taybeh from the southern and eastern sides, and the fighters of the Islamic Resistance responded with small arms and rockets, resulting in many fatalities and injuries among the infiltrating force. 2- Rocket Force: The Rocket Force of the Islamic Resistance continues to target enemy concentrations in military sites and barracks along the Lebanese-Palestinian border and in the occupied northern cities and settlements. This targeting is progressively escalating day by day, reaching the enemy's military, strategic, and security bases deep within occupied Palestine using various types of missiles, including precision missiles that are being used for the first time. 3- Air Force: The Air Force of the Islamic Resistance is persistently monitoring and targeting enemy military bases from the Lebanese-Palestinian border to the depths of occupied Palestine using various types of drones, including advanced types that are being used for the first time. 4- Air Defense Unit: The fighters of the Islamic Resistance in the air defense units are responding to 'Israeli' aircraft, both reconnaissance and combat, that are violating Lebanese airspace. They have managed to shoot down four drones. According to the summary, the total losses inflicted on the enemy, as recorded by the fighters of the Islamic Resistance, exceed 70 killed and more than 600 wounded among the officers and soldiers of the 'Israeli' enemy army. 'This includes the destruction of 28 Merkava tanks, four military bulldozers, and several armored vehicles and personnel carriers. Additionally, three drones of the 'Hermes 450' model and one of the 'Hermes 900' model have been shot down.' This tally does not include the losses incurred by the Israeli enemy in the military bases and sites in northern and deep occupied Palestine, the summary concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2241912	2024-10-23T12:29:04-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-08559660017297117333.jpg
In-Depth | The Hidden Motives Behind Hochstein’s Visit and the St...	Zoulfikar Daher The first visit of US envoy Amos Hochstein to Beirut since the outbreak of Israel’s large-scale aggression against Lebanon came approximately three weeks after the Israeli enemy expanded its operations across southern Lebanon, the Bekaa, and even the southern suburbs of Beirut and the capital itself. US special envoy Amos Hochstein speaks to reporters after a meeting with Lebanon's Parliament Speaker in Beirut on October 21, 2024. US special envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut on October 21 to meet Lebanon's PM and Speaker of the House Nabih Berri (Photo by AFP) Prior to his visit, speculation arose about its true purpose: Was Hochstein bringing concrete solutions, or was he simply testing the waters and assessing the political landscape? Some questioned whether he was delivering Israeli demands aimed at pressuring Lebanon into submission. Did this move stem from American initiative alone, or was it coordinated with 'Israel' as part of its efforts to impose terms? Alternatively, could it signal Israel’s realization that the conflict with the resistance is proving more difficult than anticipated, given the losses it has suffered along the Lebanese-Palestinian border? There is a view that the Israeli enemy, recognizing the challenge posed by the resistance, is attempting to de-escalate while still hoping to extract some benefit from its tactical strikes. However, these strikes have done little to alter the situation. The resistance remains steadfast, its retaliation capabilities growing and reaching deeper into Israeli territory, while its capacity to manage the conflict remains strong. Fearing that Israel’s 'achievements' on the ground might slip away, the US administration appears to have dispatched Hochstein to reopen negotiations. The strategy follows a familiar pattern: escalate demands to the maximum in hopes of gaining concessions, all while threatening continued aggression. Simultaneously, Israeli attacks intensified in various areas, particularly in the southern suburbs of Beirut (Dahiyeh). The timing of these escalations, paired with Hochstein’s visit, was no coincidence. 'Israel' aimed to showcase its destructive capabilities, resorting to psychological warfare by targeting buildings associated with the Al-Qard Al-Hassan Association, although these were largely unoccupied. This was intended to send a message to the Lebanese leadership receiving the American envoy. The strikes continued the following night, extending to Al-Awzai and areas near Beirut’s governmental hospital. But the question remains: Can these aggressive moves impose Israel’s conditions on Lebanon? Hochstein reportedly presented amendments to UN Resolution 1701, which included: • Expanding the role of international forces and allowing them to operate without restrictions. • Pushing the resistance several kilometers north of the Litani River, with some reports suggesting as far as the Owali River near Sidon. • Assigning oversight of the resolution’s implementation to US, British, or German forces. • Granting 'Israel' unrestricted access to Lebanese airspace for supervision. These terms essentially aim to hand 'Israel' significant control, leaving Lebanon, its army, people, and resistance with little ability to defend national sovereignty. Some media and political voices have described this proposal as nothing less than a 'surrender document.' However, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri reaffirmed Lebanon’s commitment to Resolution 1701, with no amendments. He emphasized that this is the final opportunity for the US to intervene diplomatically and halt the war. Berri made clear that Lebanon stands united on Resolution 1701, and that 'Israel' must respect it. He anticipated that Hochstein would push Israel’s maximum demands but remained confident that nothing could be imposed on Lebanon. 'Israel' has failed to achieve its objectives on the battlefield, and it will not succeed through diplomacy either. Hochstein’s visit, it seems, was primarily a test of Lebanon’s resolve—an attempt to gauge whether the country, particularly the resistance, might offer concessions under pressure. But Lebanon’s leadership, backed by its steadfast resistance, will not yield. Neither the US, nor the Zionist entity, nor their allies can force Lebanon into submission. Contrary to some perceptions, 'Israel' is not in a position of strength. Those following the situation behind the scenes of Hochstein’s visit might believe 'Israel' can impose its will, but the facts tell a different story. For over three weeks, it has faced setbacks along the border with Lebanon, failing to make significant gains or take control of any Lebanese towns. These developments underscore that the US-Israeli pressure campaign is shallow and ineffective against the united front of Lebanon, its resistance, and its people. Ultimately, the outcome of this conflict will be decided on the battlefield, where the resistance, as emphasized by its leader, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah (may he rest in peace), continues to hold the upper hand. The realities on the ground, both day and night, will shape the political and diplomatic consequences, not the other way around. The battlefield will determine the fate of this war, and indeed, the future of the entire region.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2241791	2024-10-23T11:58:49-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-036995100172970991310.png
Sayyed Nasrallah, Sinwar’s Struggle Altered Fate of Region: Supre...	Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has said the struggle and resilience of resistance figures, such as Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Yahya Sinwar, have fundamentally altered the fate of the region. Ayatollah Khamenei made the remarks in a meeting with organizers of the Congress of 15,000 Martyrs of Fars Province on Wednesday. 'If figures like martyr Sinwar had not emerged to fight until the last moment, or if great leaders like martyr Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah had not combined jihad with wisdom, courage, and sacrifice, the fate of the region would have been different,' he stated. Nasrallah, the longtime leader of Hezbollah, was assassinated in a massive Israeli airstrike in southern Beirut on September 27, while Hamas leader Sinwar was martyred by Israeli occupying forces in Gaza on October 16. Ayatollah Khamenei noted that the Israeli regime’s failure to destroy the resistance despite massacring of 50,000 innocent people with Western-provided weapons is a big defeat for the Zionist regime. In the confrontation between the resistance front and the forces of evil, 'victory belongs to the resistance' he said. The Supreme Leader also condemned the Western politicians who remain indifferent to the suffering inflicted upon civilians, stating that their silence in the face of atrocities reveals their hypocrisy and undermines their claims of upholding human rights.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2241736	2024-10-23T10:41:47-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04562420017297050544.jpg

Hezbollah Mourns Head of Executive Council Sayyed Hashem Safieddi...	Hezbollah Military Media issued a statement to mourn the great leader and martyr, Head of Executive Council Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, all the way to Al-Quds. The statement indicated that the martyred leader passed a way with a number of his brethren in a criminal Zionist airstrike, noting that he accompanied the noblest and most precious martyr, Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah as Abu Fadl Al-Abbas joined Imam Hussein (A.S.) till martyrdom. 'The martyrdom of the great Islamic fighting leader, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, represents the pinnacle of sacrifice and a beacon for generations to continue on the path of resistance, the path walked by the great martyr leader His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, martyr leader Ismail Haniyeh, great leader Yahya Sinwar, and leaders Fouad Shukr, Ali Karaki, Ibrahim Aqil, Saleh Al-Arouri, Raafat Abu Hilal (Abu al-Abed), and thousands of martyrs who preceded him. It is a confirmation that the criminal Zionist enemy understands nothing but the language of resistance and confrontation. The path of compromise has only led to increased aggression, arrogance, and terrorism by the enemy, spilling the blood of the Lebanese and Palestinian people in the most brutal and heinous war of extermination in the full view of the world.' The statement affirmed that Sayyed Safieddine devoted most of his life to serve Hezbollah and the Islamic Resistance as well as its society, administering through long years of his noble life the Party's institutions and maintaining strong ties with the mujahidin (fighters) till Holy God blessed him with martyrdom. Hezbollah offered deep condolences to Imam Mahdi (A.S.), Imam Khamenei, blessed seminaries, as well as the martyr's resistance brethren and noble family, asking Holy God to grant them patience as well as the bless of this life and the hereafter. Finally, Hezbollah promised the great martyr and his martyred brethren to continue the path of resistance and jihad until achieving its goals of freedom and victory.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2241538	2024-10-23T09:06:28-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-09155640017296995768.jpeg

Hezbollah Strikes Tel Aviv Anew, Targets Israelis in Northern and...	Hezbollah on Wednesday kept up its attacks against Israeli sites and gatherings across the Zionist entity, with Tel Aviv being a routine and daily target to the Lebanese resistance group. Hezbollah Military Media announced the strikes, stressing that the operations are 'in support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and backing their courageous and honorable Resistance, and in defense of Lebanon and its people.' The resistance group declared a qualitative missile strike targeting the Glilot Base of the 8200 Israeli military intelligence unit in Tel Aviv, according to the first statement. 'With the call ‘Labbayk Ya Nasrallah’ and as part of Khaybar operations, the Islamic Resistance fighters bombarded at 08:00 AM on Wednesday, 23-10-2024, the Glilot Base, affiliated with Unit 8200 of the military intelligence, in the outskirts of Tel Aviv with a precision rocket barrage,' the statement read. At 9:20 and 9:30 AM, Hezbollah fighters targeted Israeli gatherings at Adaisseh and the area between Adaisseh and Rub Al-Thalatheen with salvos of rockets, the second and third statements read. Later at 11:00 AM, the Islamic Resistance fighters fired a barrage of rockets targeting an Israeli gathering in the area between Misgav Am, Rub Al-Thalatheen and Markaba, according to the fourth statement. The fifth and sixth statements mentioned that Hezbollah fighters targeted Israeli gatherings at Adaisseh anew and at the area between Adaisseh-Rub AL-Thalatheen and Markaba at 11:30 AM and 12:00 PM, employing rockets.

With unwavering resolute, and despite bullets raining on him and flying close to his head, Haidar did not falter, until he met his end by an Israeli airstrike. The footage exposes the Israeli cowardice, as the Zionist invaders are incapable of facing men of God directly, so they call in airstrikes to get them. The video echoes senior Hezbollah commander Hajj Imad Mughniyeh, who once said about the resistance fighters: 'Our soul which fights.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2241021	2024-10-23T03:24:21-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04865890017296789499.jpg
Islamic Resistance in Iraq Strikes Israeli Targets in Dawn Assaul...	The Islamic Resistance in Iraq reported the execution of three drone strikes targeting key locations in Israeli-occupied territories during the early hours of Wednesday. The Resistant group confirmed that one of the strikes was directed at a crucial site in the Golan Heights, while two additional drone attacks were launched against targets in Eilat, referred to as Umm al-Rashrash in Palestinian discourse. Subsequently, the Resistance announced further drone operations aimed at a vital target in central occupied Palestine, alongside another strike in the Golan Heights. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq announced that these operations come in the context of the ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip and amid the ongoing war against Lebanon. The Resistance reaffirmed its stance against the Israeli occupation and in solidarity with the people of Palestine and Lebanon, stressing that these strikes were also a response to the massacres committed by 'Israel' against civilians, including children, women, and the elderly. The Iraqi Resistance said its fighters launched at dawn Tuesday a drone attack at a vital target in occupied Tabarayya. Its Military Media unit then published footage of the operation.

Sheikh Al-Khatib to Al-Manar: Resistance Defending Entire Lebanon...	Diaa Abu Taam Deputy Head of the Higher Islamic Shia Council in Lebanon, Sheikh Ali Al-Khatib, stressed that the Resistance is assuming its responsibilities and defending the entire country against the Zionist aggression amid the reluctance of the Lebanese government in this regard since 1947. In an interview with Al-Manar Channel held at the historical headquarters of the Shia Council in Hazmieh, Sheikh Al-Khatib affirmed that some Lebanese parties blame the Resistance, despite all its sacrifices for the sake of Lebanon, and provide the Zionist war with a political coverage whether intentionally or unintentionally. Those parties always reflect defeat and weakness because they know the Israeli ambitions in Lebanon, yet ignore them, his eminence said, advising them to support the Resistance which would emerge from the battlefield victorious. The interview, conducted by the Director of Al-Manar Website Diaa Abu Taam, also tackled the spiritual summit that was held at the headquarters of the Maronite Patriarchate in Bkirki as Sheikh Khatib indicated that the summit reflected the national solidarity and support for the resistance. Sheikh Khatib emphasized that holding the presidential elections amid the Zionist war in Lebanon would debilitate the legitimacy of the new president and expose him to future suspicions. The resistance movements in Lebanon and Palestine managed to expose the failures of the international regime, underlining the inability of the international organizations amid the US support for the Zionist entity, according to Sheikh Khatib. Sheikh Khatib hailed the unprecedented steadfastness of the people displaced from their homes due to the Zionist aggression, appreciating the role of the Lebanese community which hosted them. On the 30th day of its relentless assault on Lebanon, the Israeli enemy escalated its brutal aggression with a series of intense airstrikes targeting multiple regions, including southern towns, the Bekaa Valley, and Beirut’s southern suburbs (Dahiyeh).	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2240394	2024-10-22T12:27:10-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-02375120017296252198.jpg

The missile has successfully achieved its objectives, and bypassing the American and Israeli interception systems, the Yemeni military spokesman General Yahya Sarea said in a statement. This operation comes within the fifth round of the escalation stages in the battle of the Promised conquest and the Holy jihad in support of the Al-Aqsa Flood, he added. 'The Yemeni Armed Forces confirm their continuation in carrying out their military operations against the Israeli enemy until the aggression stops and the siege on the Gaza Strip is lifted, as well as the aggression on Lebanon stops.' بيان القوات المسلحة اليمنية بشأن تنفيذ عملية عسكرية استهدفت منطقة يافا المحتلة بصاروخ فرط صوتي 'فلسطين2'. pic.twitter.com/AqqX8rCyLT — العميد يحيى سريع (@army21ye) October 22, 2024	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2240273	2024-10-22T09:50:02-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2016/08/manar-08251680014726505203.jpg
Hezbollah Claims Drone Attack on Netanyahu Residence: Resistance ...	Hezbollah Media Relations Officer Mohammad Afif confirmed the Islamic Resistance full and exclusive responsibility for the drone attack on the residence of the war criminal and the head of the fascist Zionism, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Caesarea. In a press conference held at Al-Hawraa Zainab (A.S.) in Ghobeiry, Beirut's Dahiyeh, Afif stressed that the Islamic Resistance fighters are chasing Netanyahu, and that days, nights and the battlefield will tell. Afif indicated that the supply lines of the Resistance have returned to their normal case, adding that the command and control systems are operating with the best performance. The human and military capabilities of the Islamic Resistance are more than sufficient for the battle requirements, according to Afif who added that the number of Hezbollah attacks is increasing steadily. Afif indicated that the enemy losses, pertaining to the soldiers and tanks are enormous, especially in Aita Al-Shaab confrontations. Afif noted that Hezbollah is still bombing the Israeli barracks, camps and gatherings, while the enemy responds by targeting civilians. Hezbollah official denounced the bias of MBC and all the similar platforms, stressing that the Israeli Channel 12 could have broadcast a juster report about the martyr Yahya Sinwar. Afif hailed the Iraqi public move against MBC office, calling for taking measures against the Channel's office in Lebanon. Afif stressed that freedom of media does not give the media platforms to provoke the enemy against the civilians and their institutions, like Al-Qard Al-Hasan Association. In this regard, Afif emphasized that Al-Qard Al-Hasan Association is a civil institution that will will do everything necessary and required to fulfill its obligations towards depositors and beneficiaries. Hezbollah official affirmed that the bright reality of the Resistance and its field achievements will not be concealed by the pro-enemy media coverage. The United States is a full partner in the Zionist aggression against Lebanon, supplies the Israeli enemy with weapons, and bears primary responsibility for the horrific massacre, according to Hezbollah official. Afif responded to the Zionist defense minister who threatened that the negotiations would be held under fire, vowing 'fire for fire, blood for blood, and iron for iron.' Hezbollah official held the Israeli enemy accountable for the safety of the Islamic Resistance prisoners, calling on the International Red Cross to check the Zionists observe this criterion. Hezbollah fighters were about to kidnap Israeli soldiers few days ago, according to Afif who affirmed that the Islamic Resistance would capture Zionist troops in order to hold an indirect swap deal after the war. Finally, Afif stressed that the Zionist massacres only reflect the enemy's lust for murder and destruction, condemning the remarks of the German FM which justified the enemy's crimes against the civilians.

Blinken Visits Occupied Palestinian Territories, Seeking Ceasefir...	US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in the occupied Palestinian territories on Tuesday as part of efforts to broker a ceasefire and recover prisoners in the Gaza Strip. Blinken's regional tour comes just two weeks before the US presidential elections. During his visit, Blinken is set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials. This follows the recent assassination of Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas' political bureau, which 'Israel' claimed would weaken the group's negotiating position. Since October 7, 2023, the Israeli occupation army, supported by Washington, has continued its aggression on the Gaza Strip, as its aircraft bomb the vicinity of hospitals, buildings, towers and homes of Palestinian civilians and destroy them over the heads of their residents. The Israeli enemy is also launching a brutal aggression on Lebanon, targeting civilians and their homes on a daily basis across Lebanese territory, causing a large number of martyrs. It has also been trying for more than two weeks inside the border villages in southern Lebanon, which constitutes a blatant violation of Lebanese sovereignty in full view of the world. New Proposal The Israeli Broadcasting Authority reported that the so-called head of the General Security Service (Shabak) Ronen Bar presented to the cabinet (the inner cabinet) the day before yesterday, Sunday, a proposal for a deal 'that includes a limited ceasefire in exchange for the release of detainees without the withdrawal of the army from the Gaza Strip,' which is completely rejected by the Palestinian resistance factions, most notably the Hamas movement, which the enemy has not succeeded in undermining after a year of unprecedented barbaric aggression, and which continues to inflict losses in lives and equipment on it in the Strip to this day. It continued by saying that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent the head of the Shabak to Cairo on Sunday to discuss the proposal with the Egyptian side. In turn, the Hebrew website 'Walla' reported that 'the head of the Shabak presented a proposal he received from the head of Egyptian intelligence, Hassan Rashad, to reactivate negotiations regarding the kidnapped deal.' According to 'Walla,' the head of Egyptian intelligence presented Bar with 'the broad outlines of a small deal with Hamas, which would reactivate negotiations towards a larger deal.' For its part, the newspaper 'Israel Today' said that 'the cabinet decided to assign Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer to formulate a more detailed and in-depth strategy on this issue	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2239888	2024-10-22T05:55:13-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-05276450017296016359.jpg
Israeli Aggression on Lebanon Enters Day 30: Intense Bombardments...	On the 30th day of its relentless assault on Lebanon, the Israeli enemy escalated its brutal aggression with a series of intense airstrikes targeting multiple regions, including southern towns, the Bekaa Valley, and Beirut’s southern suburbs (Dahiyeh). South Lebanon Israeli warplanes launched airstrikes on the southern towns of Khiyam and Yuhmur Al-Shkif early this morning. Additionally, the Israeli occupation forces conducted extensive sweeping operations using machine guns directed toward the town of Kfar Kila. The outskirts of the towns of Aita Al-Shaab and Al-Qouzah were subjected to fire from the enemy's machine guns, which also targeted nearby forests along the international border. An Israeli drone struck the area between Saksakiya and Sarafand while warplanes targeted a house in the town of Al-Shaaitiyeh, reportedly resulting in casualties. Moreover, IOF warplanes carried out an airstrike between the towns of Yater and Kfarra, following earlier strikes on the towns of Tayr Harfa and Al-Jebbain. The aerial assault on the Kfarjouz area in Nabatiyeh resulted in the complete destruction of three residential buildings and the Badreddine villa, reducing a residential block to rubble and causing extensive material damage in the vicinity. The Israeli occupation intensified artillery shelling at dawn on the towns of Aita Al-Shaab, Ramiyeh, Naqoura, Alma Al-Shaab, Tayr Harfa, Al-Dhahira, and Al-Bustan. In the southern town of Ansar, Israeli airstrikes overnight resulted in two martyrs and one wounded after a home in the town's southern district was destroyed. Just before midnight, Israeli warplanes launched airstrikes on several villages in the Tyre and Bint Jbeil districts, including Ain Baal, Maarakeh, Jannata, Ain Al-Mazrab, Safad Al-Batikh, Hanin, Aita Al-Shaab, Al-Hosh, and Siddiqine, as well as the orchards surrounding Al-Burj Al-Shamali in Tyre. The strikes also targeted Yuhmor Al-Shakif and Arnoun. After midnight, Israeli warplanes bombed a building on the Arab Salim-Jarjouh road, destroying it, with reports of casualties.

Siege and Burning of Hospital as Israeli Occupation Escalates Att...	The Israeli occupation continues its genocidal war on the Gaza Strip, especially in the northern areas that have witnessed Israeli massacres since the beginning of the war a year ago. The occupation renews its brutal aggression in the northern Gaza Strip as part of a systematic plan to displace its residents and destroy all aspects of life and infrastructure, which has led to the deaths of hundreds of martyrs in recent days. Burning the 'Indonesian' Hospital The Israeli occupation forces burned the Indonesian Hospital, and the Palestinian Ministry of Health directly condemned the targeting of the hospital. The Palestinian ministry reiterated its demand that the United Nations and international institutions and all concerned parties protect health facilities and staff from the brutality and crimes of the occupation, especially in the northern besieged Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to genocide for the seventeenth consecutive day. Media reports also confirmed the death of 10 martyrs and the injury of 30 others in an Israeli artillery shelling that targeted a shelter center affiliated with 'UNRWA' in Jabalia camp, and 3 martyrs were also killed and others were injured as a result of an Israeli shelling that targeted Al-Shawa School, which shelters the displaced in the town of Beit Hanoun. 🧵This is not military base! This is the Indonesian Hospital- the only functioning hospital in North #Gaza. Burnt & bombed live by Israeli Occupation Forces. History books will write w/ disgrace on all medical & public health org that remained silent in the midst of Genocide! pic.twitter.com/qRzf81wjrh — Ahmed Teebi, MD MPH🗝️ (@Teebi_MD) October 21, 2024 The systematic aggression on Beit Lahia led to the death of the young man Yousef Saqr Abu Rabie, who is the owner of an agricultural initiative to confront the famine perpetrated by the Israeli occupation in its siege of the northern areas of the Gaza Strip. A number of people were killed and others were injured as a result of Israeli bombing that targeted a house in Jabalia Al-Balad, in an Israeli bombing that targeted a house near Abu Sharar roundabout in Jabalia camp. Israeli Occupation Besieges Northern Gaza In addition to targeting hospitals and shelters, the occupation continues its war of starvation against the northern areas of the Gaza Strip, where it prevents the entry of humanitarian aid. In this context, the Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, said that 'Israel' is preventing humanitarian missions carrying vital supplies, including medicine and food, from reaching the north and the people under siege. Lazzarini considered the occupation's refusal to allow aid in and its use as a weapon a sign of the decline of the moral compass, demanding that humanitarian agencies, including 'UNRWA', be granted access to northern Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2239426	2024-10-22T00:40:43-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-01592310017295825714.png
Israeli Air Raid Targets Beirut Hospital Vicinity after Enemy Iss...	In an attempt to intimidate the Lebanese by recalling the targeting of Gaza hospitals, the Israeli enemy concentrated its grudge on the medical sector in Lebanon. The Israeli military spokesman introduced the new aggression round by claiming that, under one of Haret Hreik hospitals, there is tunnel. The Zionist enemy, then, issued evacuation warnings which identify a number of buildings to be targeted. In a deceptive manner, the Zionist war jets targeted late Monday the vicinity of Rafik Hariri Hospital in Beirut, damaging buildings and leaving casualties. The targeted was a residential area whose inhabitants did not evacuate it for thinking it is safe. Moreover, over seven air raids targeted Haret Hreik, Bourj Al-Barajneh and Al-Hadath areas in Beirut's Dahiyeh and cause a massive damage.

MP Moussawi: ‘Israel’ Cannot Dictate Terms on Hezbollah, Speaker ...	Member of Loyalty to Resistance parliamentary bloc, MP Ibrahim Al-Moussawi, indicated that the US presidential envoy Amos Hochstein talked baldly about the amendment of the UN Resolution 1701. In a TV interview, MP Moussawi stressed that Hezbollah is concerned only with the battle field and has commissioned House Speaker to handle the negotiations file. Speaker Berri sent the correct message to Hoschstein, Moussawi said. 'What Speaker said about the priority of the ceasefire is a basic principle.'

Berri to Hochstein: No Changes to 1701, No Presidential Elections...	US special envoy Amos Hochstein stated on Monday that 'the situation in Lebanon has spiraled out of control, and linking the country's future to regional conflicts is not in the best interest of the Lebanese people.' After meeting with Speaker Nabih Berri in Ain Al-Tineh, Hochstein emphasized that 'the failure to implement Resolution 1701 is the main reason for the escalation and continuation of this conflict.' 'We are committed to resolving the conflict in Lebanon based on Resolution 1701, but the commitment of both sides alone is not enough. The Lebanese government needs support, and Washington is committed to providing the necessary assistance,' the US special envoy added. Hochstein also highlighted that 'the international community is dedicated to reconstruction efforts and supporting the Lebanese Army.' 'I will not engage in discussions about amending Resolution 1701 but will instead focus on its implementation. President Joe Biden's administration is determined to ensure that this is Lebanon's last conflict for generations to come,' Hochstein clarified. During his visit to Beirut, Hochstein is meeting with various Lebanese officials. At the same time, Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit also arrived in Beirut. His brief visit includes meetings with Speaker Nabih Berri, Prime Minister Najib Mikati, and Army Commander General Joseph Aoun. Subtext of Hochstein's Visit: Pressure and Promises Earlier today, Al-Akhbar Lebanese daily reported that US envoy Amos Hochstein is returning to Beirut, carrying what he claims is a 'final offer' ahead of the U.S. elections on November 5 to establish a political-security framework to end the war. However, according to MP Jamil Al-Sayyed, Hochstein’s real goal is to see if Israeli aggression has pressured Lebanon into accepting US and Israeli occupation demands to amend Resolution 1701, putting Lebanon under military, security, and political control. The paper highlighted that the Israeli enemy prepared for Hochstein’s visit with a night of intense bombing on Dahiyeh. Al-Akhbar also noted that in a recent interview with Al-Jadeed TV, Hochstein said his plan centers on reinforcing UN Resolution 1701 as the basis for a permanent ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel but stressed that 'modifications and additions' are necessary for its full implementation. In response, Speaker Nabih Berri firmly rejected any changes to Resolution 1701, emphasizing Lebanon's united stance on maintaining it without amendments. Speaker Berri also told Al-Arabiya TV that Hochstein's visit is the US's 'last chance' to secure a solution, reaffirming that Hezbollah has supported 1701 since 2006. He outlined his plan to save Lebanon and said the U.S. is keen on achieving a ceasefire before its elections, dismissing claims that Iran is blocking his efforts. In essence, Al-Akhbar reported that Speaker Berri made Lebanon’s position clear: no amendments to Resolution 1701 and no presidential election while the country is at war. Al-Akhbar reported that Prime Minister Najib Mikati confirmed Hezbollah's support for Resolution 1701 and emphasized Lebanon's commitment to it for stability. He reiterated that 'a diplomatic solution is still possible' and called for deploying the Lebanese Army south of the Litani River to fully implement the resolution and avoid further violence. Al-Akhbar added that Hochstein’s visit, his first since the Israeli aggression began in September, and possibly his last due to career changes, has caused concern among political circles. His visits often coincide with major regional developments, raising fears that his arrival signals new Israeli actions, given the link between US diplomacy and Israeli escalation. The newspaper suggested that Hochstein’s main goal is to assess whether Israeli attacks have pressured Lebanon into compliance and to push for concessions benefiting US and Israeli interests in southern Lebanon and other internal issues. 'Western sources suggest that Hochstein may ask Lebanon to declare a unilateral ceasefire to end the aggression, while French sources revealed that Paris has revised its initiative on Resolution 1701, with Lebanon’s Foreign Ministry receiving the updated proposal for discussion,' Al-Akhbar added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2238832	2024-10-21T06:04:03-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-03110550017295157225.jpg

Israeli Forces Shut Down Indonesian Hospital in Northern Gaza	The Israeli occupation forces (IOF) besieged the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, early Saturday morning, preventing anyone from entering or exiting the facility. Marwan Sultan, the hospital's director, confirmed that the hospital is currently non-operational, with all individuals inside surrounded by IOF. According to the Gaza Ministry of Health, the Israeli artillery also bombed the upper floors of the hospital, which houses over 40 patients along with medical staff. The ministry reported a complete power outage at the hospital. Eyewitnesses stated that a group of displaced people was targeted in front of the hospital's entrance, with heavy gunfire directed at the building and its grounds, causing widespread fear among patients and staff. The occupation forces have intensified their targeting of the health system in northern Gaza, also besieging and attacking the Kamal Adwan and Al Awda hospitals. Local media reported that Israeli tanks have even demolished part of the wall surrounding the Indonesian Hospital, while the hospital's generator has stopped working due to the ongoing assault. With the Indonesian Hospital now non-operational, the Kamal Adwan Hospital has become the only functional facility in northern Gaza, even as the area faces a worsening humanitarian crisis due to the siege and systematic destruction of the healthcare infrastructure. ❌💣🇵🇸🏥INDONESIAN HOSPITAL UNDER SEIGE🏥🇵🇸💣❌ ⭕A distress call from the crews inside the Indonesian hospital after the vehicles arrived at the hospital gate Heavy gunfire inside the hospital and the power was cut off and the crews were unable to operate the generator,… pic.twitter.com/LfQUFaEWn7 — Dr. Renee Levant (@ReneeLevant) October 19, 2024 The occupation also continues to commit massacres against civilians.

For the fifteenth consecutive day, the occupation forces continue their air, land and sea bombardment of the northern Gaza Strip, preventing food, water, medicine and fuel supplies, destroying homes and blowing up entire residential blocks. On October 6, the occupation forces began imposing a tight siege on the northern Gaza Strip, which exacerbated the already dire humanitarian conditions, in light of the ongoing aggression since October 7, 2023. The Indonesian hospital was subjected to a similar siege in November 2023, when the occupation forces targeted it with direct shelling, stormed it, killed and arrested a number of the wounded. This comes as the occupation forces continue their aggression on the Gaza Strip, since October 7, 2023, which resulted in the martyrdom of 42,500 citizens, and the injury of 99,546 others, the majority of whom are children and women, in an incomplete toll, as thousands of people are still missing under the rubble.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2237171	2024-10-19T05:49:27-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/06/manar-06957650017175767626.jpg
Hurting Enemy' in the Making: Drone Targets Netanyahu House, Roc...	For the first time since the start of the war, a drone launched from Lebanon on Saturday targeted the house of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Meanwhile, some 100 rockets were fired at areas in Haifa Bay, Acre and Western Galilee, killing or injuring a number of Israeli settlers. Israeli media reported that a drone was fired from Lebanon and exploded in the central seaside town of Caesarea. Netanyahu’s office said the drone targeted the Israeli premier’s private home, claiming that Netanyahu and his wife 'were not present and no injuries were reported.' The short statement from Netanyahu’s office came after the Israeli occupation military said that 'a building had been hit' in Caesarea. Footage posted to social media appeared to show Israeli attack helicopters in the air that were apparently hunting the drone further to the north. Israeli media reported large explosion heard in the Zionist entity’s center, but added that no warning sirens were sounded in Caesarea ahead of the drone impact and explosion. Meanwhile, however, sirens sounded in Glilot north of Tel Aviv, which houses a major IDF intelligence base and the Mossad headquarters. Israeli Channel 12 quoted an Israeli settler who resides in Caesarea as saying: 'We heard helicopters above us and there was a feeling that there was some sort of incident but there were no sirens so we were not too worried.' 'But then suddenly a large explosion was heard and it was not clear to us if it was from an interception or a drone impact — but it was clear that it was a real incident with no prior warning,' the settler added as he described the attack as 'very worrying.' The drone attack on Caesarea comes a day after Hezbollah’s Islamic Resistance Operations Room announced it was entering a new phase in the fight against the Israeli enemy, adding that it had introduced time, over the past few days, new types of precision-guided missiles and explosive drones for the first time. Earlier on Tuesday (October 15), Hezbollah Deputy Secretary Sheikh Naim Qassem said the Lebanese resistance group has imposed a new equation on the Zionist entity. 'We impose on Israel a new equation of ‘harming the enemy’ as rockets reached Haifa, Tel Aviv last few days', Sheikh Qassem said in a televised speech via Al-Manar. Rocket Impacts Kill, Injure Israelis Meanwhile on Saturday, an Israeli settler has been pronounced dead from critical injuries sustained in a rocket attack near Acre, The Times of Israeli quoted Israeli medics as saying. Earlier, Israeli media quoted Megan David Adom as saying that at least Israeli were hurt as dozens of rockets targeted the Haifa area and Western Galilee this morning. The occupation army claimed that some 60 rockets were fired from Lebanon on Saturday. However, Israeli media reported that the number of rockets surpassed 100. The video below shows rocket impacts in Krayot, north of Haifa.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2237039	2024-10-19T04:30:59-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-06973410017293373735.jpg

Hamas Mourns Martyred Leader Yahya Al-Sinwar	Hamas Resistance Movement issued on Friday a statement to mourn its politburo chief and commander of Al-Aqsa Flood, Yahya Al-Sinwar. Addressing the Palestinian people, Arab and Islamic nations, as well as all the free nations and citizens, Hamas mourned 'one of the noblest and bravest men, a man who dedicated his life for Palestine, and gave his soul for the sake of Allah on the path to its liberation'. He ascended as a heroic martyr, advancing and not retreating, brandishing his weapon, engaging and confronting the occupation army at the forefront of the ranks, moving between all the combat positions, steadfast and firm on the land of proud Gaza, defending the land of Palestine and its sanctities, and inspiring in kindling the spirit of steadfastness, patience, and resistance, the statement added. The statement also drew some of the aspects of Sinwar biography: The martyr leader Yahya Al-Sinwar lived as a fighter for the sake of Allah, and made his way in the Hamas movement since he was a young man involved in its jihadi activities; then during the 23 years of captivity, he defeated the Zionist jailer, and after he was released from prison in the Wafaa’ al-Ahrar deal, he continued his dedication, planning, and jihad until his eyes were filled with joy on October 7, 2023; the day of the great flood that shook the depths of the Zionist entity and exposed the fragility of its alleged security. This was followed by epics of legendary steadfastness of our people and the valor of our victorious resistance, until he attained the most honorable position and the highest medal and ascended to be beside his Lord as a martyred witness satisfied with what he had offered in jihad and activities on the ground. The martyred leader Yahya Al-Sinwar was a continuation of the caravan of great martyr leaders following the footsteps of the martyr founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, Dr. Abdul Aziz Al-Rantisi, Al-Muqaadmah, Abu Shanab, Jamal Mansour, Jamal Saleem, the martyr leader Ismail Haniyeh and his deputy Sheikh Saleh Al-Arouri, in addition to the caravan of martyrs from all the leaders and sons of our people and nation. We affirm that this blood will continue to enlighten our way and constitute an incentive for more steadfastness and perseverance, and that the Hamas movement is continuing with the covenant of the founding leaders and martyrs until the aspirations of our people are achieved for comprehensive liberation, return, and the establishment of the Palestinian state on the entire Palestinian national soil with Jerusalem as its capital, God willing, and it will turn into a curse on the invading occupiers who have invaded this land.' Hama reiterated that the prisoners of the occupation held by the resistance will not return except by stopping the aggression on Gaza, withdrawing from it, and releasing the heroic prisoners from the prisons of the occupation. Hamas concluded it would continue to move forward, and the spirit of the Al-Aqsa Flood would remain shining brightly, pulsating with life in the souls of our people. 'We are committed to your covenant, Abu Ibrahim, and your banner will not fall, but will remain fluttering high.' Hezbollah Statement Hezbollah Command released a statement in which it offered deep condolences to Palestinian people, Hamas Movement, Arab and Islamic Ummas, all the liberals in the world, and the family of the leader Yahya Al-Sinwar on his martyrdom. The statement indicated that the martyr was entrusted to be the heir of the martyred Ismail Haniyeh in order to follow the path of confronting the US schemes and the Israeli occupation till gaining martyrdom. Hezbollah Command reiterated standing by the Palestinian people, voicing trust in the divine promise of support for the believers.

Hezbollah Military Command Announces Moving to an Escalated Phase...	The Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance issued early Friday a statement to announce the escalation of the military confrontation with the Zionist enemy. The statement indicated that the Islamic Resistance has continued to confront the Israeli aggression against Lebanon, inflicting heavy losses on the Israeli enemy army in terms of personnel and equipment, along the front lines in southern Lebanon, extending to their positions deep within occupied Palestine. Since the beginning of ground operations near the Lebanese-Palestinian border, the Israeli enemy has deployed five military divisions comprising over 70,000 officers and soldiers, along with hundreds of tanks and military vehicles. In contrast, hundreds of fighters from the Islamic Resistance have been fully prepared to counter any Israeli ground incursion into southern Lebanese villages. The statement explained the feats of the each unit of the Islamic Resistance: 1. Ground Engagements: The beginning of this week witnessed an escalation in the heroic confrontations between the fighters of the Islamic Resistance and the 'Israeli' enemy's officers and soldiers advancing through several routes in the eastern and western sectors towards the villages of Al-Odaisseh, Rab El Thalathin, Blida, Markaba, Al-Qawzah, Aita al-Shaab, and Ramya, under heavy artillery and air cover targeting the mentioned villages and their surroundings. According to pre-prepared field plans, the fighters of the Islamic Resistance engaged the enemy forces in and around some villages by targeting their advance routes and luring them into ambushes within some border villages. Violent clashes took place with the enemy at close range, especially in the towns of Al-Qawzah and Rab El Thalathin, resulting in 10 enemy fatalities and over 150 injuries, as well as the destruction of 9 'Merkava' tanks and 4 military bulldozers. 2. Rocket Force: The rocket force of the Islamic Resistance continues to escalate day by day, targeting 'Israeli' enemy concentrations in military sites and barracks along the Lebanese-Palestinian border, as well as settlements and cities in the north, reaching their military bases deep within occupied Palestine, using various types of missiles, including precision-guided ones that are being deployed for the first time. 3. Air Force: The air force of the Islamic Resistance continues to escalate day by day, targeting enemy military bases from the Lebanese-Palestinian border to deep within occupied Palestine, utilizing various types of attack drones, including advanced ones being used for the first time, in addition to reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering missions. 4.

'According to observations from the fighters of the Islamic Resistance, the enemy's losses have reached approximately 55 deaths and over 500 injuries among Israeli officers and soldiers, in addition to the destruction of 20 Merkava tanks, 4 military bulldozers, an armored vehicle, and a troop carrier, along with the downing of two 'Hermes 450&#8243; drones.' This tally does not include the losses of the Israeli enemy in military bases and barracks along the Lebanese-Palestinian border extending into occupied Palestine, according to the statement. Based on the directives of the Resistance Command, the Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance announces a transition to a new and escalatory phase in the confrontation with the Israeli enemy, which will be reflected in the developments and events of the coming days.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2235642	2024-10-17T14:54:45-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-02707250017292020287.png
Israeli Enemy Commits Massacre in Jabalia, Continues Besieging No...	The Zionist occupation forces continued, for the 13th consecutive day, the bloody aggression on northern Gaza, amidst an escalation of bombardment, killing, destruction, and attempts to displace residents and empty the governorate of its inhabitants. The occupation forces committed on Thursday a massacre in Jabalia, north of the Gaza Strip, where they targeted a school housing displaced people, which led to the martyrdom of at least 25 of them, and the injury of at least 150 of others, most of whom were women and children. The occupation aircraft bombed the 'Abu Hussein Elementary School' affiliated with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), and fires broke out in the tents of the displaced within the school campus as a result of the occupation bombing. Some of the martyrs and wounded were transferred to Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda hospitals in the northern Gaza Strip, as the ambulance crews were unable to reach the rest in the targeted school, and the hospitals in the northern Gaza Strip were unable to provide services to the wounded in light of the strict siege imposed by the occupation. The occupation forces have continued their ground, maritime and aerial aggression on the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, which has resulted in the martyrdom of 42,438 citizens and the injury of 99,246 others, the majority of whom are children and women according to an incomplete toll, as thousands of missing people are still under the rubble.

Houthi: None Excluded from US-Israeli 'New Middle East' Scheme	Head of Yemen’s Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Al-Houthi stressed on Thursday that the Israeli enemy is committing crimes against Lebanon similar to those it has been committing Gaza for more than one year. In a televised speech, Sayyed Houthi indicated that Muslims, in particular, and humanity in general, need to reach a high level of awareness about the reality of what is happening and what the enemies are aiming for. 'Arabs, as the primary targets, must be especially aware of the enemies' intentions.' Houthi added that the horrific crimes committed by the 'Israeli' enemy, along with the accompanying international and regional positions, should create a heightened level of awareness and insight. The U.S. is a partner in every sense of the word in the crimes and tyranny of the 'Israeli' enemy, he noted. 'Without American support and partnership, the Israeli enemy would not have been able to sustain its aggression for this long and at this intensity. Both the American and Israeli agendas aim to achieve a common goal, with similar backgrounds and beliefs, and a unified vision regarding the Arabs.' The American goal is to empower the 'Israeli' enemy to control the region directly or politically and economically, fully dominating it, Houthi said, adding that the objective is to keep the peoples of our nation without freedom, independence, or dignity, denying them the right to an independent civilization based on their religion and Islamic identity. 'It has become clear to all that neither the United Nations nor the Security Council nor international organizations or courts can counter the threat of the enemy except through the awakening of the nation itself.' Houthi underlined the 'fruits of steadfastness among the fighters in Gaza and Lebanon, who continue to inflict damage on the enemy despite the immense betrayal and complicity of some in the Arab and Islamic circles'. According to the Yemeni leader, the Israeli enemy resorts to mass killings and assassinations when it fails in the battlefield. 'The Israeli enemy poses a real threat to Lebanon since the establishment of the occupation entity. The brave fighters of Hezbollah and their supporters played a pivotal role in expelling the Israeli enemy from Lebanon.' Houthi addressed those who think they are safe from the enemy: 'No one in this entire region is safe from Israeli conspiracies.' 'The ambitions and goals of the Israelis are clear, and when the criminal Netanyahu speaks of changing the Middle East, he is targeting you as well.' Houthi underscored that the Yemeni fight would continue, and the number of targeted Israeli-US-UK ships has reached 196. 'Support continues with rockets and drones to occupied Palestine, and operations this week were carried out using 25 ballistic and cruise missiles as well as drones.' Houthi called upon the Yemenis to participate tomorrow in a million-man march in honor of fight for the sake of Allah and in support of the Palestinian and Lebanese people in the capital, Sanaa, and other governorates.

Hezbollah Fighters Turned the Tables on Netanyahu: MP	Member of the Loyalty to the Resistance parliamentary bloc, Hasan Fadlallah, asserted that the Israeli enemy has failed to achieve its objectives of repopulating the north with settlers and displacing resistance fighters, as the Islamic Resistance fighters on the ground have turned the tables on Netanyahu. In a press conference held at the Lebanese parliament on Thursday, MP Fadlallah addressed the ongoing Israeli aggression on the country, noting that despite the extensive airstrikes, the occupation has not been able to capture any villages. He underscored that 'the resistance on the ground knows how to confront the enemy effectively,' stating that 'the matter of a ceasefire is in the hands of Speaker of the House Nabih Berri, in collaboration with caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati.' Speaking of Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's foolish idea of the so-called 'new Middle East,' Hezbollah MP said that 'the image that Netanyahu painted for his project is changing; what he thought would be a swift victory to eliminate Hezbollah and restructure Lebanon and the region has turned out to be the rashness of an arrogant leader.' 'Netanyahu believed that by assassinating our leader and his fellow martyrs and committing horrific massacres against our people, he could fully achieve his objectives. However, the brave resistance fighters along the border reversed the narrative and entered a new phase dedicated to confronting the aggression against Lebanon and defending the nation,' Fadlallah added. Hezbollah's Fadlallah stated that 'the Israeli occupation has adopted a scorched-earth policy, systematically destroying villages and towns, particularly in the south along the border, to implement its long-standing project of establishing what it calls a 'buffer zone'. 'This plan began in 1978 and culminated in the 2006 war, aiming to make the area south of the Litani River part of its entity, as openly stated by some of its officials. However, the strength of the resistance fighters and the resilience of our people will undoubtedly thwart it,' Fadlallah affirmed. Hezbollah MP Hasan Fadlallah stated that efforts are being extended on three main fronts: 'First, on the battlefield, where brave fighters have successfully maintained control and are determined to prevent the Israeli enemy from achieving its declared objectives, such as repopulating the north and occupying southern Lebanon.' 'Despite heavy Israeli strikes and the deployment of elite troops, resistance fighters—many of whom are from local villages—defend their land with remarkable courage. Thousands of fighters stand ready to join the front lines, eager to fulfill the late leader’s wish to destroy the enemy forces in the south,' Fadlallah said. Regarding the political front, MP Fadlallah mentioned that Speaker Nabih Berri and the Lebanese government have been negotiating with international envoys since the establishment of the support front a year ago to reach a ceasefire. They are currently focused on achieving a ceasefire, with close coordination between Hezbollah leadership and Speaker Berri’s office. However, Fadlallah declared that 'details of these negotiations remain confidential.' Concerning displacement, Fadlallah stated that 'Hezbollah and the Amal Movement are maximizing their efforts to alleviate the suffering of displaced people while appreciating the national unity and various initiatives aimed at managing the crisis.' 'Both groups emphasize the need for humanitarian cooperation and assert that the reconstruction efforts are in trustworthy hands. The return of displaced individuals to their homes, from the southern border to the Bekaa Valley and the Dahiyeh, remains a solemn promise from the resistance to their steadfast people,' Fadlallah stressed. MP Hasan Fadlallah concluded by addressing the steadfast Lebanese families, saying: 'You pay a heavy price in blood to defend our land, dignity, and sovereignty. To the families of martyrs and the wounded, your sacrifices purify our homeland and pave the way for a future of freedom. To the brave men along the borders, you protect our people's dignity against enemy fire.' 'This is your destined day to honor Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah’s legacy by defending Lebanon’s honor and safeguarding its land,' Fadlallah said.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2235136	2024-10-17T06:36:53-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-06043330017291721311.jpg
Day 25 of Israeli Aggression on Lebanon: Zionist Enemy Intensifie...	The Israeli occupation's assault on Lebanon entered its 25th day, following a bloody night for Israeli forces at the Aita Al-Shaab-Al-Qouzah-Ramiyeh triangle. Resistance fighters fiercely repelled the occupation’s attempt to capture Al-Karmel Hill in Al-Qouzah. The Israeli military, still withholding details about the 'severe incident' in the north, responded with heavy air and artillery strikes to cover up its substantial losses. These same brutal tactics are repeatedly used against Lebanese civilians, destroying homes and livelihoods under the guise of targeting resistance positions, underscoring the cowardly and imbalanced nature of the conflict. Amid this ongoing aggression, Lebanon’s Ministry of Health announced on Wednesday that 17 people had been martyred and 182 wounded in the last 24 hours alone, raising the total toll since the start of the conflict on October 8, 2023, to 2,367 martyrs and 11,106 injured. Late Wednesday night and into Thursday, Israeli occupation forces escalated their attacks with more airstrikes and artillery bombardment, particularly on border villages, where fierce clashes continue as Islamic resistance forces fend off Israeli enemy infiltration attempts across multiple fronts. South Lebanon In this context, within a span of less than ten minutes, seven Israeli airstrikes hit the city of Khiyam in the Marjeyoun district of southern Lebanon.

The strikes extended to the northern neighborhoods of Houla, Adaisseh, and Rab Thalathine. In the Hasbaya district, three Israeli airstrikes hit the town of Kfarhamam. Meanwhile, in the Bint Jbeil district, a series of Israeli air raids targeted the towns of Aita Al-Shaab and Hanin. Israeli artillery shelled the outskirts of Ramiyeh and Beit Lif with phosphorus shells, while illuminating bombs were dropped in the area. The warplanes also bombed areas between Ramiyeh, Al-Qouzah, Baraachit, and Shaqra, as well as the outskirts of Hanin. In Nabatieh, Israeli enemy warplanes launched strikes on Wednesday evening targeting the towns of Al-Ghandourieh and Froun. Another strike hit the Nabatieh Al-Fawqa-Zawtar junction, while a separate raid targeted Arabsalim. This morning, Zionist airstrikes also hit the outskirts of Rayhan, Aychieh, and Zeita near Ghaziyeh. An airstrike on a house in Habboush killed four people and completely destroyed the house. The Public Health Emergency Operations Center confirmed in a statement that the strike on Nabatieh’s municipality resulted in 16 deaths and 52 injuries.

Day 24 of Israeli Aggression in Lebanon: Relentless Bloodshed, De...	The Israeli brutal aggression against Lebanon persists for the 24th consecutive day, relentlessly targeting civilians and infrastructure while perpetrating further atrocities. This escalation has claimed the lives of over 2,000 martyrs and left more than 10,000 injured. Israeli occupation aircraft launched on Wednesday morning an assault on Al-Shoura Street in the Hara Hreik area of the southern suburbs of Beirut (Dahiyeh). This attack starkly illustrates the brutality of the occupation forces, who have demonstrated a complete disregard for civilians, their homes, and commercial centers. Israeli occupation army spokesperson Avichay Adraee announced that occupation warplanes from the Air Force carried out strikes based on 'precise intelligence from military intelligence,' targeting what they alleged were 'strategic weapon storage facilities belonging to Hezbollah located in an underground warehouse in the southern suburbs.' In retaliation, Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance continues to strike key Israeli sites, responding to the Israeli aggression on Lebanon and defending its people. Nabatieh Massacre Speaking of Israeli atrocities in south Lebanon, the occupation warplanes unleashed a relentless barrage on the city of Nabatieh today, conducting over 10 airstrikes across various neighborhoods, particularly targeting the neighborhoods of Al-Rahbat, the Al-Maslakh, the city's market, and the municipality building. The Public Health Emergency Operations Center (PHEOC), part of the Ministry of Public Health, issued a statement confirming that 'the Israeli strike on the municipality and its federation resulted, in initial reports, in the martyrdom of five individuals.' 'Rescue teams are still working to clear the rubble at the site, attempting to locate survivors or additional victims,' the statement noted.

He commended the sacrifices made by Civil Defense personnel during these tragic times, reaffirming their commitment to their humanitarian mission. The Lebanese Ministry of Health reported that six people were martyred and 43 others were injured in the Israeli airstrike on the municipality building in Nabatieh. PM Mikati Condemns Israeli Aggression on Nabatieh Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the new Israeli aggression against civilians in Nabatieh, which deliberately targeted a municipal council meeting intended to discuss the city's service and humanitarian conditions. PM Mikati stated, 'This new aggression, in addition to the ongoing crimes against civilians, occurs amid a deliberate global silence regarding the atrocities committed by the occupier, which encourages the Israeli enemy to persist in its actions.' 'If all the countries of the world are unable to deter this blatant aggression against the Lebanese people, how effective will it be to turn to the Security Council for a ceasefire? What can restrain the enemy from its crimes, especially after targeting peacekeeping forces in the south? And what solutions can be hoped for in this reality?' Mikati further added. Israeli Airstrikes on Qana: One Martyr and 30 Injured Earlier on Tuesday evening, the Ministry of Public Health's PHEOC announced in a statement that 'the continuous Israeli airstrikes on the town of Qana have resulted in the martyrdom of one person and injuries to thirty others, with debris removal operations still ongoing.' The intense Israeli bombardment on Qana in southern Lebanon has caused significant destruction to residential buildings, with many reduced to rubble, as search operations for missing persons continue for the second consecutive day. Reports indicate that Civil Defense teams from the Islamic Al-Risala Scouts are still searching through the rubble in Qana and the nearby town of Al-Majadel for individuals who remain unaccounted for following last night’s and this morning’s repeated airstrikes.
