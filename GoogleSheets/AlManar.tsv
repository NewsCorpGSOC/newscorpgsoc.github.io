Siege and Burning of Hospital as Israeli Occupation Escalates Att...	The Israeli occupation continues its genocidal war on the Gaza Strip, especially in the northern areas that have witnessed Israeli massacres since the beginning of the war a year ago. The occupation renews its brutal aggression in the northern Gaza Strip as part of a systematic plan to displace its residents and destroy all aspects of life and infrastructure, which has led to the deaths of hundreds of martyrs in recent days. Burning the 'Indonesian' Hospital The Israeli occupation forces burned the Indonesian Hospital, and the Palestinian Ministry of Health directly condemned the targeting of the hospital. The Palestinian ministry reiterated its demand that the United Nations and international institutions and all concerned parties protect health facilities and staff from the brutality and crimes of the occupation, especially in the northern besieged Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to genocide for the seventeenth consecutive day. Media reports also confirmed the death of 10 martyrs and the injury of 30 others in an Israeli artillery shelling that targeted a shelter center affiliated with 'UNRWA' in Jabalia camp, and 3 martyrs were also killed and others were injured as a result of an Israeli shelling that targeted Al-Shawa School, which shelters the displaced in the town of Beit Hanoun. üßµThis is not military base!

A number of people were killed and others were injured as a result of Israeli bombing that targeted a house in Jabalia Al-Balad, in an Israeli bombing that targeted a house near Abu Sharar roundabout in Jabalia camp. Israeli Occupation Besieges Northern Gaza In addition to targeting hospitals and shelters, the occupation continues its war of starvation against the northern areas of the Gaza Strip, where it prevents the entry of humanitarian aid. In this context, the Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, said that 'Israel' is preventing humanitarian missions carrying vital supplies, including medicine and food, from reaching the north and the people under siege. Lazzarini considered the occupation's refusal to allow aid in and its use as a weapon a sign of the decline of the moral compass, demanding that humanitarian agencies, including 'UNRWA', be granted access to northern Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2239426	2024-10-22T00:40:43-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-01592310017295825714.png
Israeli Air Raid Targets Beirut Hospital Vicinity after Enemy Iss...	In an attempt to intimidate the Lebanese by recalling the targeting of Gaza hospitals, the Israeli enemy concentrated its grudge on the medical sector in Lebanon. The Israeli military spokesman introduced the new aggression round by claiming that, under one of Haret Hreik hospitals, there is tunnel. The Zionist enemy, then, issued evacuation warnings which identify a number of buildings to be targeted. In a deceptive manner, the Zionist war jets targeted late Monday the vicinity of Rafik Hariri Hospital in Beirut, damaging buildings and leaving casualties. The targeted was a residential area whose inhabitants did not evacuate it for thinking it is safe. Moreover, over seven air raids targeted Haret Hreik, Bourj Al-Barajneh and Al-Hadath areas in Beirut's Dahiyeh and cause a massive damage. The Israeli enemy stepped up its aggression on Lebanon with violent raids targeting several areas across the country including branches belonging to the financial network of Al-Qard Al-Hasan.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2239338	2024-10-21T13:47:23-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-01641350017295435515.png

MP Moussawi: ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô Cannot Dictate Terms on Hezbollah, Speaker ...	Member of Loyalty to Resistance parliamentary bloc, MP Ibrahim Al-Moussawi, indicated that the US presidential envoy Amos Hochstein talked baldly about the amendment of the UN Resolution 1701. In a TV interview, MP Moussawi stressed that Hezbollah is concerned only with the battle field and has commissioned House Speaker to handle the negotiations file. Speaker Berri sent the correct message to Hoschstein, Moussawi said. 'What Speaker said about the priority of the ceasefire is a basic principle.' MP Moussawi affirmed that the Israeli enemy cannot dictate its terms on Hezbollah, adding that the leaked conditions give a false impression that the Zionists have emerged victorious. The battle is still in its early stages, MP Moussawi added, noting that Hezbollah fighters and missile will have their say. MP Moussawi emphasized that the Israeli enemy would be surprised by Hezbollah military capabilities. Those who are betting on Hezbollah defeat will realize that the Resistance Party is firmer than their plans, MP Moussawi concluded. The Islamic Resistance has continued confronting the Zionist war on Lebanon, inflicting more losses on the enemy troops.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2239217	2024-10-21T11:19:15-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/12/manar-00559380016384313172.png

Berri to Hochstein: No Changes to 1701, No Presidential Elections...	US special envoy Amos Hochstein stated on Monday that 'the situation in Lebanon has spiraled out of control, and linking the country's future to regional conflicts is not in the best interest of the Lebanese people.' After meeting with Speaker Nabih Berri in Ain Al-Tineh, Hochstein emphasized that 'the failure to implement Resolution 1701 is the main reason for the escalation and continuation of this conflict.' 'We are committed to resolving the conflict in Lebanon based on Resolution 1701, but the commitment of both sides alone is not enough. The Lebanese government needs support, and Washington is committed to providing the necessary assistance,' the US special envoy added. Hochstein also highlighted that 'the international community is dedicated to reconstruction efforts and supporting the Lebanese Army.' 'I will not engage in discussions about amending Resolution 1701 but will instead focus on its implementation. President Joe Biden's administration is determined to ensure that this is Lebanon's last conflict for generations to come,' Hochstein clarified. During his visit to Beirut, Hochstein is meeting with various Lebanese officials. At the same time, Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit also arrived in Beirut. His brief visit includes meetings with Speaker Nabih Berri, Prime Minister Najib Mikati, and Army Commander General Joseph Aoun. Subtext of Hochstein's Visit: Pressure and Promises Earlier today, Al-Akhbar Lebanese daily reported that US envoy Amos Hochstein is returning to Beirut, carrying what he claims is a 'final offer' ahead of the U.S. elections on November 5 to establish a political-security framework to end the war. However, according to MP Jamil Al-Sayyed, Hochstein‚Äôs real goal is to see if Israeli aggression has pressured Lebanon into accepting US and Israeli occupation demands to amend Resolution 1701, putting Lebanon under military, security, and political control. The paper highlighted that the Israeli enemy prepared for Hochstein‚Äôs visit with a night of intense bombing on Dahiyeh. Al-Akhbar also noted that in a recent interview with Al-Jadeed TV, Hochstein said his plan centers on reinforcing UN Resolution 1701 as the basis for a permanent ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel but stressed that 'modifications and additions' are necessary for its full implementation. In response, Speaker Nabih Berri firmly rejected any changes to Resolution 1701, emphasizing Lebanon's united stance on maintaining it without amendments. Speaker Berri also told Al-Arabiya TV that Hochstein's visit is the US's 'last chance' to secure a solution, reaffirming that Hezbollah has supported 1701 since 2006. He outlined his plan to save Lebanon and said the U.S. is keen on achieving a ceasefire before its elections, dismissing claims that Iran is blocking his efforts. In essence, Al-Akhbar reported that Speaker Berri made Lebanon‚Äôs position clear: no amendments to Resolution 1701 and no presidential election while the country is at war. Al-Akhbar reported that Prime Minister Najib Mikati confirmed Hezbollah's support for Resolution 1701 and emphasized Lebanon's commitment to it for stability. He reiterated that 'a diplomatic solution is still possible' and called for deploying the Lebanese Army south of the Litani River to fully implement the resolution and avoid further violence. Al-Akhbar added that Hochstein‚Äôs visit, his first since the Israeli aggression began in September, and possibly his last due to career changes, has caused concern among political circles. His visits often coincide with major regional developments, raising fears that his arrival signals new Israeli actions, given the link between US diplomacy and Israeli escalation. The newspaper suggested that Hochstein‚Äôs main goal is to assess whether Israeli attacks have pressured Lebanon into compliance and to push for concessions benefiting US and Israeli interests in southern Lebanon and other internal issues. 'Western sources suggest that Hochstein may ask Lebanon to declare a unilateral ceasefire to end the aggression, while French sources revealed that Paris has revised its initiative on Resolution 1701, with Lebanon‚Äôs Foreign Ministry receiving the updated proposal for discussion,' Al-Akhbar added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2238832	2024-10-21T06:04:03-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-03110550017295157225.jpg

Few hours after it was announced that the US presidential envoy Amos Hochstein would visit Beirut on Monday to meet Lebanon's senior officials, House Speaker Nabih Berri reiterated rejection of amending any of the items of the UN Resolution 1701.

Israeli Forces Shut Down Indonesian Hospital in Northern Gaza	The Israeli occupation forces (IOF) besieged the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, early Saturday morning, preventing anyone from entering or exiting the facility. Marwan Sultan, the hospital's director, confirmed that the hospital is currently non-operational, with all individuals inside surrounded by IOF. According to the Gaza Ministry of Health, the Israeli artillery also bombed the upper floors of the hospital, which houses over 40 patients along with medical staff. The ministry reported a complete power outage at the hospital. Eyewitnesses stated that a group of displaced people was targeted in front of the hospital's entrance, with heavy gunfire directed at the building and its grounds, causing widespread fear among patients and staff. The occupation forces have intensified their targeting of the health system in northern Gaza, also besieging and attacking the Kamal Adwan and Al Awda hospitals. Local media reported that Israeli tanks have even demolished part of the wall surrounding the Indonesian Hospital, while the hospital's generator has stopped working due to the ongoing assault. With the Indonesian Hospital now non-operational, the Kamal Adwan Hospital has become the only functional facility in northern Gaza, even as the area faces a worsening humanitarian crisis due to the siege and systematic destruction of the healthcare infrastructure. ‚ùåüí£üáµüá∏üè•INDONESIAN HOSPITAL UNDER SEIGEüè•üáµüá∏üí£‚ùå ‚≠ïA distress call from the crews inside the Indonesian hospital after the vehicles arrived at the hospital gate Heavy gunfire inside the hospital and the power was cut off and the crews were unable to operate the generator,‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/LfQUFaEWn7 ‚Äî Dr. Renee Levant (@ReneeLevant) October 19, 2024 The occupation also continues to commit massacres against civilians.

For the fifteenth consecutive day, the occupation forces continue their air, land and sea bombardment of the northern Gaza Strip, preventing food, water, medicine and fuel supplies, destroying homes and blowing up entire residential blocks. On October 6, the occupation forces began imposing a tight siege on the northern Gaza Strip, which exacerbated the already dire humanitarian conditions, in light of the ongoing aggression since October 7, 2023. The Indonesian hospital was subjected to a similar siege in November 2023, when the occupation forces targeted it with direct shelling, stormed it, killed and arrested a number of the wounded. This comes as the occupation forces continue their aggression on the Gaza Strip, since October 7, 2023, which resulted in the martyrdom of 42,500 citizens, and the injury of 99,546 others, the majority of whom are children and women, in an incomplete toll, as thousands of people are still missing under the rubble.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2237171	2024-10-19T05:49:27-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/06/manar-06957650017175767626.jpg
Hurting Enemy' in the Making: Drone Targets Netanyahu House, Roc...	For the first time since the start of the war, a drone launched from Lebanon on Saturday targeted the house of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Meanwhile, some 100 rockets were fired at areas in Haifa Bay, Acre and Western Galilee, killing or injuring a number of Israeli settlers. Israeli media reported that a drone was fired from Lebanon and exploded in the central seaside town of Caesarea. Netanyahu‚Äôs office said the drone targeted the Israeli premier‚Äôs private home, claiming that Netanyahu and his wife 'were not present and no injuries were reported.' The short statement from Netanyahu‚Äôs office came after the Israeli occupation military said that 'a building had been hit' in Caesarea. Footage posted to social media appeared to show Israeli attack helicopters in the air that were apparently hunting the drone further to the north. Israeli media reported large explosion heard in the Zionist entity‚Äôs center, but added that no warning sirens were sounded in Caesarea ahead of the drone impact and explosion. Meanwhile, however, sirens sounded in Glilot north of Tel Aviv, which houses a major IDF intelligence base and the Mossad headquarters. Israeli Channel 12 quoted an Israeli settler who resides in Caesarea as saying: 'We heard helicopters above us and there was a feeling that there was some sort of incident but there were no sirens so we were not too worried.' 'But then suddenly a large explosion was heard and it was not clear to us if it was from an interception or a drone impact ‚Äî but it was clear that it was a real incident with no prior warning,' the settler added as he described the attack as 'very worrying.' The drone attack on Caesarea comes a day after Hezbollah‚Äôs Islamic Resistance Operations Room announced it was entering a new phase in the fight against the Israeli enemy, adding that it had introduced time, over the past few days, new types of precision-guided missiles and explosive drones for the first time. Earlier on Tuesday (October 15), Hezbollah Deputy Secretary Sheikh Naim Qassem said the Lebanese resistance group has imposed a new equation on the Zionist entity. 'We impose on Israel a new equation of ‚Äòharming the enemy‚Äô as rockets reached Haifa, Tel Aviv last few days', Sheikh Qassem said in a televised speech via Al-Manar. Rocket Impacts Kill, Injure Israelis Meanwhile on Saturday, an Israeli settler has been pronounced dead from critical injuries sustained in a rocket attack near Acre, The Times of Israeli quoted Israeli medics as saying. Earlier, Israeli media quoted Megan David Adom as saying that at least Israeli were hurt as dozens of rockets targeted the Haifa area and Western Galilee this morning. The occupation army claimed that some 60 rockets were fired from Lebanon on Saturday. However, Israeli media reported that the number of rockets surpassed 100. The video below shows rocket impacts in Krayot, north of Haifa.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2237039	2024-10-19T04:30:59-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-06973410017293373735.jpg

Hamas Mourns Martyred Leader Yahya Al-Sinwar	Hamas Resistance Movement issued on Friday a statement to mourn its politburo chief and commander of Al-Aqsa Flood, Yahya Al-Sinwar. Addressing the Palestinian people, Arab and Islamic nations, as well as all the free nations and citizens, Hamas mourned 'one of the noblest and bravest men, a man who dedicated his life for Palestine, and gave his soul for the sake of Allah on the path to its liberation'. He ascended as a heroic martyr, advancing and not retreating, brandishing his weapon, engaging and confronting the occupation army at the forefront of the ranks, moving between all the combat positions, steadfast and firm on the land of proud Gaza, defending the land of Palestine and its sanctities, and inspiring in kindling the spirit of steadfastness, patience, and resistance, the statement added. The statement also drew some of the aspects of Sinwar biography: The martyr leader Yahya Al-Sinwar lived as a fighter for the sake of Allah, and made his way in the Hamas movement since he was a young man involved in its jihadi activities; then during the 23 years of captivity, he defeated the Zionist jailer, and after he was released from prison in the Wafaa‚Äô al-Ahrar deal, he continued his dedication, planning, and jihad until his eyes were filled with joy on October 7, 2023; the day of the great flood that shook the depths of the Zionist entity and exposed the fragility of its alleged security. This was followed by epics of legendary steadfastness of our people and the valor of our victorious resistance, until he attained the most honorable position and the highest medal and ascended to be beside his Lord as a martyred witness satisfied with what he had offered in jihad and activities on the ground. The martyred leader Yahya Al-Sinwar was a continuation of the caravan of great martyr leaders following the footsteps of the martyr founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, Dr. Abdul Aziz Al-Rantisi, Al-Muqaadmah, Abu Shanab, Jamal Mansour, Jamal Saleem, the martyr leader Ismail Haniyeh and his deputy Sheikh Saleh Al-Arouri, in addition to the caravan of martyrs from all the leaders and sons of our people and nation. We affirm that this blood will continue to enlighten our way and constitute an incentive for more steadfastness and perseverance, and that the Hamas movement is continuing with the covenant of the founding leaders and martyrs until the aspirations of our people are achieved for comprehensive liberation, return, and the establishment of the Palestinian state on the entire Palestinian national soil with Jerusalem as its capital, God willing, and it will turn into a curse on the invading occupiers who have invaded this land.' Hama reiterated that the prisoners of the occupation held by the resistance will not return except by stopping the aggression on Gaza, withdrawing from it, and releasing the heroic prisoners from the prisons of the occupation. Hamas concluded it would continue to move forward, and the spirit of the Al-Aqsa Flood would remain shining brightly, pulsating with life in the souls of our people. 'We are committed to your covenant, Abu Ibrahim, and your banner will not fall, but will remain fluttering high.' Hezbollah Statement Hezbollah Command released a statement in which it offered deep condolences to Palestinian people, Hamas Movement, Arab and Islamic Ummas, all the liberals in the world, and the family of the leader Yahya Al-Sinwar on his martyrdom. The statement indicated that the martyr was entrusted to be the heir of the martyred Ismail Haniyeh in order to follow the path of confronting the US schemes and the Israeli occupation till gaining martyrdom. Hezbollah Command reiterated standing by the Palestinian people, voicing trust in the divine promise of support for the believers.

Violent clashes took place with the enemy at close range, especially in the towns of Al-Qawzah and Rab El Thalathin, resulting in 10 enemy fatalities and over 150 injuries, as well as the destruction of 9 'Merkava' tanks and 4 military bulldozers. 2. Rocket Force: The rocket force of the Islamic Resistance continues to escalate day by day, targeting 'Israeli' enemy concentrations in military sites and barracks along the Lebanese-Palestinian border, as well as settlements and cities in the north, reaching their military bases deep within occupied Palestine, using various types of missiles, including precision-guided ones that are being deployed for the first time. 3. Air Force: The air force of the Islamic Resistance continues to escalate day by day, targeting enemy military bases from the Lebanese-Palestinian border to deep within occupied Palestine, utilizing various types of attack drones, including advanced ones being used for the first time, in addition to reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering missions. 4.

'Arabs, as the primary targets, must be especially aware of the enemies' intentions.' Houthi added that the horrific crimes committed by the 'Israeli' enemy, along with the accompanying international and regional positions, should create a heightened level of awareness and insight. The U.S. is a partner in every sense of the word in the crimes and tyranny of the 'Israeli' enemy, he noted. 'Without American support and partnership, the Israeli enemy would not have been able to sustain its aggression for this long and at this intensity. Both the American and Israeli agendas aim to achieve a common goal, with similar backgrounds and beliefs, and a unified vision regarding the Arabs.' The American goal is to empower the 'Israeli' enemy to control the region directly or politically and economically, fully dominating it, Houthi said, adding that the objective is to keep the peoples of our nation without freedom, independence, or dignity, denying them the right to an independent civilization based on their religion and Islamic identity. 'It has become clear to all that neither the United Nations nor the Security Council nor international organizations or courts can counter the threat of the enemy except through the awakening of the nation itself.' Houthi underlined the 'fruits of steadfastness among the fighters in Gaza and Lebanon, who continue to inflict damage on the enemy despite the immense betrayal and complicity of some in the Arab and Islamic circles'. According to the Yemeni leader, the Israeli enemy resorts to mass killings and assassinations when it fails in the battlefield. 'The Israeli enemy poses a real threat to Lebanon since the establishment of the occupation entity. The brave fighters of Hezbollah and their supporters played a pivotal role in expelling the Israeli enemy from Lebanon.' Houthi addressed those who think they are safe from the enemy: 'No one in this entire region is safe from Israeli conspiracies.' 'The ambitions and goals of the Israelis are clear, and when the criminal Netanyahu speaks of changing the Middle East, he is targeting you as well.' Houthi underscored that the Yemeni fight would continue, and the number of targeted Israeli-US-UK ships has reached 196. 'Support continues with rockets and drones to occupied Palestine, and operations this week were carried out using 25 ballistic and cruise missiles as well as drones.' Houthi called upon the Yemenis to participate tomorrow in a million-man march in honor of fight for the sake of Allah and in support of the Palestinian and Lebanese people in the capital, Sanaa, and other governorates. The US and the UK carried out a series of air strikes on Yemen late on Wednesday, in a new aggression on the Arab impoverished country over its stance in support of the oppressed people of Gaza.

Hezbollah Fighters Turned the Tables on Netanyahu: MP	Member of the Loyalty to the Resistance parliamentary bloc, Hasan Fadlallah, asserted that the Israeli enemy has failed to achieve its objectives of repopulating the north with settlers and displacing resistance fighters, as the Islamic Resistance fighters on the ground have turned the tables on Netanyahu. In a press conference held at the Lebanese parliament on Thursday, MP Fadlallah addressed the ongoing Israeli aggression on the country, noting that despite the extensive airstrikes, the occupation has not been able to capture any villages. He underscored that 'the resistance on the ground knows how to confront the enemy effectively,' stating that 'the matter of a ceasefire is in the hands of Speaker of the House Nabih Berri, in collaboration with caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati.' Speaking of Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's foolish idea of the so-called 'new Middle East,' Hezbollah MP said that 'the image that Netanyahu painted for his project is changing; what he thought would be a swift victory to eliminate Hezbollah and restructure Lebanon and the region has turned out to be the rashness of an arrogant leader.' 'Netanyahu believed that by assassinating our leader and his fellow martyrs and committing horrific massacres against our people, he could fully achieve his objectives. However, the brave resistance fighters along the border reversed the narrative and entered a new phase dedicated to confronting the aggression against Lebanon and defending the nation,' Fadlallah added. Hezbollah's Fadlallah stated that 'the Israeli occupation has adopted a scorched-earth policy, systematically destroying villages and towns, particularly in the south along the border, to implement its long-standing project of establishing what it calls a 'buffer zone'. 'This plan began in 1978 and culminated in the 2006 war, aiming to make the area south of the Litani River part of its entity, as openly stated by some of its officials. However, the strength of the resistance fighters and the resilience of our people will undoubtedly thwart it,' Fadlallah affirmed. Hezbollah MP Hasan Fadlallah stated that efforts are being extended on three main fronts: 'First, on the battlefield, where brave fighters have successfully maintained control and are determined to prevent the Israeli enemy from achieving its declared objectives, such as repopulating the north and occupying southern Lebanon.' 'Despite heavy Israeli strikes and the deployment of elite troops, resistance fighters‚Äîmany of whom are from local villages‚Äîdefend their land with remarkable courage. Thousands of fighters stand ready to join the front lines, eager to fulfill the late leader‚Äôs wish to destroy the enemy forces in the south,' Fadlallah said. Regarding the political front, MP Fadlallah mentioned that Speaker Nabih Berri and the Lebanese government have been negotiating with international envoys since the establishment of the support front a year ago to reach a ceasefire. They are currently focused on achieving a ceasefire, with close coordination between Hezbollah leadership and Speaker Berri‚Äôs office. However, Fadlallah declared that 'details of these negotiations remain confidential.' Concerning displacement, Fadlallah stated that 'Hezbollah and the Amal Movement are maximizing their efforts to alleviate the suffering of displaced people while appreciating the national unity and various initiatives aimed at managing the crisis.' 'Both groups emphasize the need for humanitarian cooperation and assert that the reconstruction efforts are in trustworthy hands. The return of displaced individuals to their homes, from the southern border to the Bekaa Valley and the Dahiyeh, remains a solemn promise from the resistance to their steadfast people,' Fadlallah stressed. MP Hasan Fadlallah concluded by addressing the steadfast Lebanese families, saying: 'You pay a heavy price in blood to defend our land, dignity, and sovereignty. To the families of martyrs and the wounded, your sacrifices purify our homeland and pave the way for a future of freedom. To the brave men along the borders, you protect our people's dignity against enemy fire.' 'This is your destined day to honor Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah‚Äôs legacy by defending Lebanon‚Äôs honor and safeguarding its land,' Fadlallah said.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2235136	2024-10-17T06:36:53-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-06043330017291721311.jpg
Day 25 of Israeli Aggression on Lebanon: Zionist Enemy Intensifie...	The Israeli occupation's assault on Lebanon entered its 25th day, following a bloody night for Israeli forces at the Aita Al-Shaab-Al-Qouzah-Ramiyeh triangle. Resistance fighters fiercely repelled the occupation‚Äôs attempt to capture Al-Karmel Hill in Al-Qouzah. The Israeli military, still withholding details about the 'severe incident' in the north, responded with heavy air and artillery strikes to cover up its substantial losses. These same brutal tactics are repeatedly used against Lebanese civilians, destroying homes and livelihoods under the guise of targeting resistance positions, underscoring the cowardly and imbalanced nature of the conflict. Amid this ongoing aggression, Lebanon‚Äôs Ministry of Health announced on Wednesday that 17 people had been martyred and 182 wounded in the last 24 hours alone, raising the total toll since the start of the conflict on October 8, 2023, to 2,367 martyrs and 11,106 injured. Late Wednesday night and into Thursday, Israeli occupation forces escalated their attacks with more airstrikes and artillery bombardment, particularly on border villages, where fierce clashes continue as Islamic resistance forces fend off Israeli enemy infiltration attempts across multiple fronts. South Lebanon In this context, within a span of less than ten minutes, seven Israeli airstrikes hit the city of Khiyam in the Marjeyoun district of southern Lebanon. Additionally, the town of Qabrikha was targeted by an Israeli air raid, while enemy warplanes also struck Tall Al-Nahhas, north of Kfar Kila, in the same district. The strikes extended to the northern neighborhoods of Houla, Adaisseh, and Rab Thalathine. In the Hasbaya district, three Israeli airstrikes hit the town of Kfarhamam. Meanwhile, in the Bint Jbeil district, a series of Israeli air raids targeted the towns of Aita Al-Shaab and Hanin. Israeli artillery shelled the outskirts of Ramiyeh and Beit Lif with phosphorus shells, while illuminating bombs were dropped in the area. The warplanes also bombed areas between Ramiyeh, Al-Qouzah, Baraachit, and Shaqra, as well as the outskirts of Hanin. In Nabatieh, Israeli enemy warplanes launched strikes on Wednesday evening targeting the towns of Al-Ghandourieh and Froun. Another strike hit the Nabatieh Al-Fawqa-Zawtar junction, while a separate raid targeted Arabsalim. This morning, Zionist airstrikes also hit the outskirts of Rayhan, Aychieh, and Zeita near Ghaziyeh. An airstrike on a house in Habboush killed four people and completely destroyed the house. The Public Health Emergency Operations Center confirmed in a statement that the strike on Nabatieh‚Äôs municipality resulted in 16 deaths and 52 injuries. In Tyre District, the Ministry of Public Health reported that an Israeli airstrike on the town of Tair Debba resulted in the martyrdom of three people. Another airstrike targeted the town of Majdal Zoun, while additional strikes hit the Al-Housh area and villages east of Tyre.

Day 24 of Israeli Aggression in Lebanon: Relentless Bloodshed, De...	The Israeli brutal aggression against Lebanon persists for the 24th consecutive day, relentlessly targeting civilians and infrastructure while perpetrating further atrocities. This escalation has claimed the lives of over 2,000 martyrs and left more than 10,000 injured. Israeli occupation aircraft launched on Wednesday morning an assault on Al-Shoura Street in the Hara Hreik area of the southern suburbs of Beirut (Dahiyeh). This attack starkly illustrates the brutality of the occupation forces, who have demonstrated a complete disregard for civilians, their homes, and commercial centers. Israeli occupation army spokesperson Avichay Adraee announced that occupation warplanes from the Air Force carried out strikes based on 'precise intelligence from military intelligence,' targeting what they alleged were 'strategic weapon storage facilities belonging to Hezbollah located in an underground warehouse in the southern suburbs.' In retaliation, Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance continues to strike key Israeli sites, responding to the Israeli aggression on Lebanon and defending its people. Nabatieh Massacre Speaking of Israeli atrocities in south Lebanon, the occupation warplanes unleashed a relentless barrage on the city of Nabatieh today, conducting over 10 airstrikes across various neighborhoods, particularly targeting the neighborhoods of Al-Rahbat, the Al-Maslakh, the city's market, and the municipality building. The Public Health Emergency Operations Center (PHEOC), part of the Ministry of Public Health, issued a statement confirming that 'the Israeli strike on the municipality and its federation resulted, in initial reports, in the martyrdom of five individuals.' 'Rescue teams are still working to clear the rubble at the site, attempting to locate survivors or additional victims,' the statement noted. The Israeli airstrikes targeted the municipality building while the mayor, Ahmad Kahil, and several members were present, resulting in the martyrdom of Mayor Kahil. ‚ö°Ô∏è The mayor of Nabatieh, Dr. Ahmad Kahil, was martyred in the enemy strike on the municipality building pic.twitter.com/owGHOm1qQU ‚Äî War Monitor (@WarMonitors) October 16, 2024 According to media sources, Israeli aircraft carried out a fierce aerial assault on the town of Nabatieh Al-Tahta, launching more than 7 strikes aimed at the crisis cell within the municipality, where Kahil and dozens of staff members were located.

He commended the sacrifices made by Civil Defense personnel during these tragic times, reaffirming their commitment to their humanitarian mission. The Lebanese Ministry of Health reported that six people were martyred and 43 others were injured in the Israeli airstrike on the municipality building in Nabatieh. PM Mikati Condemns Israeli Aggression on Nabatieh Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the new Israeli aggression against civilians in Nabatieh, which deliberately targeted a municipal council meeting intended to discuss the city's service and humanitarian conditions. PM Mikati stated, 'This new aggression, in addition to the ongoing crimes against civilians, occurs amid a deliberate global silence regarding the atrocities committed by the occupier, which encourages the Israeli enemy to persist in its actions.' 'If all the countries of the world are unable to deter this blatant aggression against the Lebanese people, how effective will it be to turn to the Security Council for a ceasefire? What can restrain the enemy from its crimes, especially after targeting peacekeeping forces in the south? And what solutions can be hoped for in this reality?' Mikati further added. Israeli Airstrikes on Qana: One Martyr and 30 Injured Earlier on Tuesday evening, the Ministry of Public Health's PHEOC announced in a statement that 'the continuous Israeli airstrikes on the town of Qana have resulted in the martyrdom of one person and injuries to thirty others, with debris removal operations still ongoing.' The intense Israeli bombardment on Qana in southern Lebanon has caused significant destruction to residential buildings, with many reduced to rubble, as search operations for missing persons continue for the second consecutive day. Reports indicate that Civil Defense teams from the Islamic Al-Risala Scouts are still searching through the rubble in Qana and the nearby town of Al-Majadel for individuals who remain unaccounted for following last night‚Äôs and this morning‚Äôs repeated airstrikes.

Fierce Clashes in Jenin: Palestinian Fighters Ambush and Kill Isr...	Palestinian resistance fighters in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin engaged Israeli occupation forces, killing and injuring several Israeli troops, according to reports. The confrontation began after Israeli occupation forces invaded Jenin and several other towns in the region, including Nablus and Ramallah. In Jenin, the Israeli occupation troops were ambushed by fighters from the Al-Quds Brigades - Jenin Brigade, who detonated improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and opened fire on the invading forces. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades also participated in the clashes, targeting an undercover Israeli unit that had entered the Jenin refugee camp. The fierce fighting resulted in the deaths and injuries of multiple Israeli soldiers. Following the confrontation, the Israeli occupation forces withdrew from Jenin late on Tuesday. However, they did manage to abduct the body of 20-year-old Karim Samer Jabarin, whom they had allegedly assassinated in the Jenin refugee camp. The clashes in Jenin were part of a larger Israeli military operation across the occupied West Bank, with forces also invading the towns of Kfar Jammal in Tulkarm, Dura in Hebron, Al-Mazraa Al-Qibilya in Ramallah, and the Aaskar refugee camp in Nablus. In Nablus, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades engaged the Israeli occupation troops in fierce confrontations, using automatic weapons and explosives.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2233013	2024-10-16T01:09:47-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-08975160017047103214.jpg
Iraqi Resistance Strikes Vital Target in Occupied Palestine	The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has announced that its fighters launched an attack on Tuesday evening against a vital target in central occupied Palestine. The attack was carried out using an advanced-capability aircraft. In a statement, the Islamic Resistance emphasized that these operations are part of its 'steadfast approach in resisting the occupation, in support of our people in Palestine and Lebanon, and in response to the massacres committed by the usurping entity against civilians, including children, women, and the elderly.' The group also affirmed the continuation of its operations 'to strike enemy strongholds with increasing intensity.' This comes after the Iraqi Resistance said on October 15 that it had targeted a vital location in the northern part of Israeli-occupied territories using drones. Footage was also published showing the fighters launching drones towards a vital target in occupied Tabaraya. The head of the Iraqi Hezbollah Brigades' Security Bureau, Abu Ali al-Askari, warned that the Iraqi Resistance's response to any targeting of the country or use of its territory or airspace to strike Iran will not be limited to 'Israel' but will extend to US bases and interests in Iraq and the region. Al-Askari also indicated that if an 'energy war' were to break out, the world would lose 12 million barrels per day, which the Iraqi Resistance will ensure. This development comes as the Israeli occupation regime has threatened to respond to Iran's Operation True Promise II, which saw the Islamic Republic launching at least 200 ballistic missiles against Israeli military and intelligence facilities across the occupied Palestinian territories. The operation was in retaliation for the Israeli assassination of Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, and Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and IRGC General Abbas Nilforoushan in the Southern Suburb of Beirut.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2232991	2024-10-16T00:06:30-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/04/manar-01043040017122111854.jpg

Hezbollah called on relevant parties in Lebanon and international human rights and humanitarian organizations to condemn this heinous crime by all standards, particularly due to its long-term negative impacts on civilians.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2232782	2024-10-15T09:44:04-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-04165050017056142612.png
Sheikh Qassem: Hezbollah Will Hold Reins of Israeli Beast and Ret...	Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem addressed the nation on Tuesday, vowing victory over the US-backed Israeli war and schemes. Sheikh Qassem started his address by reiterating that the martyred leader, Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, has always guided the resistance. 'Your positions are our constitution, your words are the light of our path, and your discourse is the foundation of our journey.' 'Your enemies fear your presence and see you in every fighter and supporter,' Sheikh Qassem addressed Martyr Sayyed Nasrallah. Tackling the latest developments, Sheikh Qassem stressed that 'Israel' is an occupation entity that poses a real threat to the region and the world. ''Israel' is an expansionist occupation that does not confine itself to Palestine.' 'Israel' bets on the crimes that intimidate others and enjoys absolute support from America, his eminence added. Sheikh Qassem maintained that Lebanon, or even the region, cannot be separated from Palestine, adding that Al-Aqsa Flood Operation came after 75 years of occupation. Sheikh Qassem underlined that Lebanon is part of the Israeli expansionist project. 'Our support for the Palestinians is support for justice, as the Palestinians are rightful owners.' Sheikh Qassem warned that America seeks a new Middle East. 'If it weren't for America, the Great Satan, 'Israel' would not have been able to maintain its current control.' Foreign ambassadors were communicating with Hezbollah's leadership to urge it to stop supporting Gaza, Sheikh Qassem said. We are facing the threat of a new Middle East in the Israeli-American style, his eminence noted. 'We are not facing an Iranian project; rather, we are witnessing a Palestinian project supported by Iranians and the free people of this region.' Supporting Palestine is a source of pride for Iran, which is exerting all efforts to strengthen and empower the Palestinians, his eminence added. If we do not confront 'Israel', it will achieve its goals, Sheikh Qassem warned. Those who harm Lebanon are not those who defend the people, but those who kill them, Sheikh Qassem maintained. 'We fight as a resistance with conditions and target the occupation army while it kills brutally and cowardly, targeting children, women, and the elderly.' When we bear sacrifices and cause pain to 'Israel', we protect generations for decades and centuries to come, his eminence pointed out. Hezbollah Deputy Chief warned that the 'Israeli' project is destructive and aims to eliminate the resistance and its people. 'It is true that the strike on leadership, especially the Secretary-General, is significant and harsh; they attempted to undermine our capabilities, but, thank God, they could not surpass the first step.' The path to restore the land requires the steadfastness of the resistance and the support of its people, his eminence affirmed. 'We are facing a raging beast that cannot tolerate being hindered by the resistance from achieving its goals, and I assure you that we will hold its reins and return it to the pen.' Since September 17, we are in a new phase called confronting the 'Israeli' aggression and war on Lebanon, and we are no longer in a phase of mere support, his eminence clarified. 'Honestly, what the brothers have accomplished in the field over the past two weeks has been greater and better than they expected. The mission of the resistance is to pursue the army and conduct operations against it wherever it advances. The youth (fighters) are waiting to engage more and more; note that in the first week on the front line, there were 25 dead and 150 injured.' 'Since last week, we have established a new equation called the equation of inflicting pain on the enemy, and missiles will reach Haifa and beyond as desired by the leader.' Since the enemy has targeted all of Lebanon, we have the right, from a defensive position, to target any point within the enemy entity, Sheikh Qassem underscored. 'We can target any point in the Israeli entity, and we will choose the appropriate point.' Hezbollah Deputy S.G. addressed the Zionist 'home' front: 'The solution is a ceasefire, and after the ceasefire, according to the indirect agreement, the settlers will return to the north.' As the war continues, more Zionist settlements will be evacuated, and hundreds of thousands, even more than two million settlers, will be in danger, Sheikh Qassem threatened. 'The resistance will not be defeated because it is the rightful owner of the land, and its fighters are martyrs who accept nothing less than a life of dignity; your army is now defeated and will be defeated further.' Hezbollah is strong despite the harsh blows after the communication devices attack and the aftermath, Sheikh Qasssem confirmed. 'The party is strong with its fighters, its capabilities, and the solidarity of Hezbollah and Amal Movement, with a community that works together with strength and determination.' Sheikh Qassem emphasized that 'Israel' is the one disrupting all the lives of the Lebanese, and national unity today enhances their cohesion. 'Together, we will stand strong, and no one should bet on investing outside this framework.' Sheikh Qassem concluded his televised speech by addressing the Lebanese people who were displaced due to the Zionist war, 'Your are the noblest of people, and we are all in the same boat.' 'Victory comes with patience, but I recall our Secretary General's promise: you will return to your homes, which we will rebuild to be more beautiful than they were, and we have already begun preparations for this.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2232639	2024-10-15T07:57:53-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-01460760017290041622.png

Hezbollah on Monday lashed out at the BBC, saying the British media outlet had breached the Lebanese sovereignty and press ethics as one of its teams accompanied Israeli occupation forces as they entered a Lebanese village at the border with occupied Palestine. 'It was not enough for the BBC, in all platforms and languages, to blindly side with murderers and criminals and justify the Zionist barbarism against the Palestinian ‚Äì Lebanese peoples.

Hezbollah on Monday lashed out at the BBC, saying the British media outlet had breached the Lebanese sovereignty and press ethics as one of its teams accompanied Israeli occupation forces as they entered a Lebanese village at the border with occupied Palestine. 'It was not enough for the BBC, in all platforms and languages, to blindly side with murderers and criminals and justify the Zionist barbarism against the Palestinian - Lebanese peoples.

Speaker Berri renewed his gratitude to France and its President for 'the exerted efforts at various levels to support Lebanon and its people in this ordeal.'

Nicaragua Severs Ties with Genocidal ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô over Its War on Gaz...	Nicaragua has severed diplomatic relations with 'Israel' in response to the ongoing military assault on Gaza, denouncing the Israeli government as fascist and genocidal. In a televised announcement on Friday, Vice President Rosario Murillo, who also serves as First Lady, confirmed that leftist President Daniel Ortega ordered the move in protest against 'Israel's' actions in the Palestinian territories. 'Our president has instructed the republic's Foreign Ministry to comply with the request of the national parliament and begin to sever diplomatic ties with the Nazi and genocidal government of Israel,' Murillo said on state television. The decision came after the National Assembly convened a regular session on Friday, during which lawmakers condemned the Israeli government's military offensive and urged the Nicaraguan government to formally cut ties with the 'occupation regime.' This marks the third time Nicaragua has severed relations with 'Israel,' with previous instances occurring in 2010 and 1982 under different administrations. Nicaragua has also called out the governments of the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, and Canada for their alleged accountability under international law regarding the Israeli aggression against Palestinians, most notably in Gaza. The Central American country had even filed a case against Germany before the International Court of Justice, requesting that the court impose urgent measures to prevent Berlin from supplying weapons and other forms of support to 'Israel.' However, the ICJ said that 'the circumstances were not such' to accuse Germany of violating a genocide convention. The move by Nicaragua comes as the Israeli occupation military continues its offensive across the Gaza Strip, killing more than 42,000 Palestinians and targeting and destroying civilian infrastructure since the war began on October 7, 2023.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2229218	2024-10-12T02:42:51-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04081840017287261964.jpg
Resistance Strikes Back: Iraqi Drones 2 sites in occupied Golan	The Islamic Resistance in Iraq launched a series of drone strikes against vital targets in the occupied Golan Heights and a US-controlled gas facility in Syria, according to a statement released on Saturday, October 12, 2024. The group confirmed its continued support for the Palestinian and Lebanese people, stating that the operations were carried out in response to the 'massacres committed by the occupying entity against civilians, including children, women, and the elderly.' In the Golan Heights, the Resistance conducted two separate drone strikes on key positions, underscoring their commitment to targeting the strongholds of the Israeli occupation. In response, US occupation forces stationed at the occupied Syrian gas facility launched missiles toward the Saker Island area, also located in northern Deir Ezzor. Reports indicate that the US aggression that followed did not cause any damage. This marks the fourth consecutive day of US occupation strikes on the northern outskirts of Deir Ezzor in Syria.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2229174	2024-10-12T01:46:01-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/04/manar-01043040017122111854.jpg
Hezbollah Military Command Warns Israeli Settlers to Keep Away fr...	The Operations Chamber of the Islamic Resistance issued on Friday a statement which highlighted the Israeli failure to achieve any progress in the ground offensive it has launched against Lebanon, warning the Israeli to stay away from the army bases in order to keep safe. 'In light of the resounding failure and heroic resistance that the Israeli enemy army has been facing in its attempts to advance towards the eastern sector of the southern villages bordering occupied Palestine, it tried in the past two days to create new axes of advance in the western sector from the direction of the Ras al-Naqoura and Jal al-Alam sites towards Al-Mushayrifah and Al-Labouneh, trying to take advantage of the terrain that it believes will help it. Before attempting to advance on the new axes, the Israeli Air Force launched dozens of raids in conjunction with violent artillery shelling from the land and sea on the towns of Al-Dhahirah, Alma Al-Shaab and Al-Naqoura.' The statement detailed how the Resistance fighters four Israeli attempts to advance: - On Tuesday at dawn, an Israeli military force tried to advance from Ras Al-Naqoura towards the border area of Al-Labouneh with the aim of reaching the UNIFIL forces site in Al-Labouneh and positioning themselves there, but the Islamic Resistance fighters confronted them with appropriate weapons and forced them to retreat. - On Wednesday, the Israeli enemy's army attempted thrice to advance towards Labouneh, but the Mujahideen confronted it in each attempt with rocket weapons, artillery shells and guided missiles, forcing it to retreat and inflicting heavy losses upon its soldiers. - On Wednesday, the Resistance fighters monitored an infiltration attempt by an Israeli enemy force from Ras Al-Naqoura towards the Al-Mushairfeh area, so they targeted it with an assault glider that exploded among the infiltrating force, killing and wounding most of its members. - On Thursday, a group of Israeli enemy soldiers, accompanied and protected by a Merkava tank, attempted to advance towards the Labouneh area from Ras al-Naqoura, and as soon as the tank was within range of fire, the Resistance fighters targeted it with a guided missile that hit it directly, resulting in its destruction, incineration, the killing of its crew and the injury of the soldiers taking cover behind it. The enemy failed in four attempts, over a period of hours, to advance to withdraw the casualties, as the Mujahideen confronted it each time with appropriate weapons and forced it to withdraw, the statement affirmed. 'In conjunction with the heroic confrontations that the Islamic Resistance fighters are engaging in with the officers and soldiers of the Israeli enemy, the fire support groups continue to target the gatherings, positions and support lines of the Israeli enemy army in the military sites and barracks along the frontline and inside the border settlements in the occupied territories and achieve confirmed hits.' The missile force and air force of the Islamic Resistance also continue to target military bases and settlements deep in the north of occupied Palestine, in a way that is gradually increasing day after day, according to the statement. Yhe statement underlined all the above-mentioned military operations of the Islamic Resistance were carried out with high, complete and instant coordination between the leadership of the Islamic Resistance and the operations chamber, reaching the brothers stationed on the front lines of confrontation. 'It is worth noting that the Israeli enemy army, days after announcing the start of what it called the ground maneuver in southern Lebanon, does not dare to show its tanks and military vehicles to the Lebanese side for fear of being targeted, rather it hides them in places where they are, nevertheless, targeted with missiles and artillery shells and suffer heavy losses.' The statement added that the Israeli enemy has failed, until the time of preparing this statement, to control any of the overlooking hills it is trying to advance to, and is content with reaching some houses on the outskirts of some border villages with the aim of taking pictures and organizing media visits. 'The Israeli enemy army uses the homes of settlers in some settlements in north of occupied Palestine as gathering positions for its officers and soldiers, and its military bases that manage the aggression against Lebanon are also located inside settlement neighborhoods in major occupied cities such as Haifa, Tiberias, Acre, and others.' These homes and military bases are targets for the missile and air force of the Islamic Resistance, and accordingly we warn the settlers against being present near those military gatherings in order to preserve their lives until further notice. The Islamic Resistance is committed to its covenant and promise to its supreme and most holy martyr, His Eminence the Secretary-General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah (may his holy secret be sanctified), that the settlements in northern occupied Palestine will remain free of settlers until the war on Gaza and Lebanon stops. Sirens across the north of occupied Palestine were continuously heard on Friday. Hezbollah attacks on the Zionist military sites, settlements and cities did not stop throughout the day. Border confrontations also manifested the Resistance power in face of the monstrous enemy.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2228932	2024-10-11T14:53:22-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-027725400166239486010.jpg

Hezbollah: This is Not Karbala, It is Battle of Removing Gate of ...	Hezbollah Media Relations Official warned on Friday that the Lebanese media space is open to the toxic Israeli air without restrictions and amid absence of law enforcement. Hajj Mohammad Afif hailed the steadfast Lebanese journalists in the South, especially those who convey the reality of the field situation to the people and the world. He also praised a number of free Arab and foreign journalists who share the pain and hope, and story of resistance and steadfastness. Afif indicated that some Lebanese media outlets adopt the Israeli narrative without any scrutiny and incite against the Resistance and its supporters without any governmental measures. Hezbollah official regretted the fact that some Lebanese media outlets convey the Zionist story about any bombardment in Lebanon and display the enemy leaders threat in the context of the hostile propaganda targeting the Resistance and its incubation. Neither the ministry of information nor the competent authorities move against those outlets under the pretext of 'media freedom', he wondered. Afif asked: ' How can freedom of media be free of law enforcement? In it logical that those who are falsely called 'activists' post names of villages and towns and claim that Resistance commanders and munitions are present there? Does freedom of media cover inciting against hospitals in order to provoke a new Zionist massacre just as that which targeted Baptist Hospital in Gaza?' Hezbollah official warned that the Israeli enemy used timed missiles which explode after the raid in order to delude the public opinion that that attack targeted a weaponry cache and prevent the medics from evacuating the injured, stressing that this flimsy pretext can no longer be accepted. Afif affirmed that the US embassy in Lebanon is complicit and involved in the Israeli crimes against the civilians and the medics, asking about the UN and international community attitude towards the Israeli aggression on UNIFIL troops in South Lebanon. This aggression underlines the Zionist entity disregards the UN Resolutions, Afif affirmed, recalling the Zionist massacre against the civilians who resorted to the UNIFIL site in Qana in 1996. Hezbollah official stressed that the Israeli enemy has seen only a little bit of the Resistance military power, adding that the Resistance fire at Haifa, Safed and Acre is just the beginning. Afif underscored the flexibility of the Resistance military operations which are not geographically restricted, explaining that any slight Israeli field progress must not affect the morale of the Lebanese people. Hezbollah official warned some Lebanese parties against the political exploitation of the military battle, adding that it is still too early, and it is not 1982, the year the Israeli tanks reached Beirut. Afif hailed the sacrifices made by the resistance supporters who were displaced from their homes, reiterating that reconstruction is inevitable. Finally, Hezbollah official emphasized that this battle is not that of Karbala; it is the battle of removing the Gate of Khaybar.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2228701	2024-10-11T11:13:10-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-09127630017286708504.jpeg

Hezbollah: Reuters Report on New Resistance Command 'Pure Fiction...	Hezbollah on Friday dismissed as a 'pure fiction' a report published by Reuters news agency which claimed that the Lebanese resistance group has allegedly 'forged' a new command for the ground battles in south Lebanon after the assassination of its top leaders. 'Reuters news agency has published a report on what it called a new military command directing the Israeli ground offensive in south Lebanon and on some details related to this war, its nature, plans and weapons,' Hezbollah Media Relations announced in a statement. 'This report is not but a pure fiction imagined by Reuters‚Äô writers, journalists and security advisers,' the statement read. 'What the agency has attributed to a so-called field commander is totally false, and our policy, as it has become well known, though it‚Äôs necessary to reiterate: There is nothing called Hezbollah sources,' it added. 'Moreover, there is nothing in Hezbollah, called field commander who offers such dangerous information, allegedly attributed to him,' Hezbollah‚Äôs Media Relations Office concluded.

The blockade has been characterized as an act of 'genocide and mass punishment' against the camp's residents, who have refused to evacuate despite the intense shelling. Alongside the artillery attacks, the occupation forces have also been demolishing residential buildings to the west of the camp. Red Crescent paramedics have transported several wounded individuals to the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabalia following airstrikes that targeted a house near the al-Ihsan Mosque.

Inadequate and Misleading Evacuation Warnings by ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô, Says A...	Evacuation warnings issued by the Israeli military to residents of southern Beirut and south Lebanon were inadequate and, , misleading, according to Amnesty International. The human rights organization said these warnings do not absolve ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô of its obligations under international law to avoid targeting civilians and take all possible measures to minimize harm. Amnesty's Secretary General Agn√®s Callamard stated that the warnings to residents of the densely populated Dahieh suburb of Beirut were insufficient. The warnings, issued via social media less than 30 minutes before strikes, included misleading maps and failed to provide clear timelines or safe evacuation routes. AMNESTY INVESTIGATES: Evacuation warnings issued by the Israeli military to residents of the southern suburbs of Beirut and south Lebanon were inadequate, and in some cases also misleading. Read more: ‚Äî Amnesty International (@amnesty) October 10, 2024 Similarly, the blanket warnings for entire towns and villages in southern Lebanon raised concerns that they were intended to trigger mass displacement rather than protect civilians. Callamard emphasized that people who choose to stay or are unable to leave must still be protected under international humanitarian law. Amnesty's analysis of over a dozen evacuation warnings found that the designated 'danger zones' on the maps were much smaller than the 500-meter radius advised by the Israeli occupation military. Residents reported chaotic evacuations, with some unable to leave due to mobility issues of elderly or disabled family members. The human rights group stressed that effective warnings must provide timely, clear instructions to allow civilians to safely move away from targeted military objectives. Broad orders to evacuate entire areas do not meet this standard under international law. It also noted that 'the heavy loss of life in Lebanon in recent days raises concerns that Israeli occupation forces are violating their obligation to take all feasible precautions to minimize harm to civilians wherever they may be, including by issuing effective warnings.' After spending the past 12 months investigating war crimes committed by 'Israel' in the Gaza Strip, Amnesty International 'is deeply concerned that Israel may seek to repeat the approach it took in Gaza, which resulted in unprecedented harm to civilians.' This comes as the Israeli occupation has been waging a large-scale aggression on Lebanon for 18 consecutive days, attacking cities and residential suburbs in Beirut, the south, the Bekaa and the mountains, committing bloody massacres, most of the time without any warnings or warnings. What Amnesty International has said confirms that the warnings issued by the occupation 'army' are nothing but misleading warnings, as the occupation, which is based on brutality and destruction, does not care about the warnings and does not adhere to the scope it has set, but rather publishes the warnings as part of a media campaign to justify its crimes.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2227854	2024-10-11T01:56:17-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-03829790017282136541.jpg
Islamic Resistance in Iraq Stages More Anti-Israel Strikes in Sup...	The Islamic Resistance in Iraq announced in the latest hours more strikes in support of Gaza and Lebanon against the Zionist aggression. The Iraqi resistance group declared on Friday morning a drone strike hitting a vital target in Umm Al-Rashrash (Eilat). The strike was 'in support of our people in Palestine and Lebanon, and in response to the massacres committed by the occupying entity against civilians, including children, women, and the elderly,' the statement read.

Hezbollah: Islamic Resistance Fire at ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô Won‚Äôt Be Limited t...	The Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance issued a key statement late Tuesday to warn the Zionist enemy that the Resistance leadership's command and control system has returned stronger and more resilient than ever. The Islamic Resistance confirmed the remarks made by Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General, Sheikh Naim Qassem, regarding the readiness of the rocket force to target any location in occupied Palestine as determined by the Resistance leadership through a command and control system that has returned stronger and more resilient than ever. 'The continued aggression of the 'Israeli' enemy against our honorable people in all parts of steadfast Lebanon will make Haifa and elsewhere, for the rockets of the Resistance, akin to Kiryat Shmona, Metula, and other border settlements with Lebanon.' Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem stressed on Tuesday that the Lebanese resistance group‚Äôs chain of command is fine and that its military capabilities are solid, as he vowed that the resistance will emerge victorious against the Israeli enemy. Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem in a televised speech via Al-Manar (October 8, 2024). This was evidenced by what the enemy and its settlers witnessed in Haifa and its surroundings today, Tuesday, the statement added. 'The Islamic Resistance sees and hears where this enemy least expects it, and its hand is capable of reaching wherever it desires in occupied Palestine. Its fire directed at the Zionist depth will not be limited to rockets or suicide drones.' Our valiant fighters continue to confront every attempt by the elite Zionist soldiers to advance and occupy some southern villages at the front line with occupied Palestine, in a heroic battle unprecedented in this enemy's wars, the statement confirmed. 'They have even resorted to hiding behind UNIFIL positions and in paths not visible to the Lebanese side, and thus far, they have failed to penetrate our steadfast villages, suffering heavy losses exceeding 35 killed and 200 injured among their elite officers and soldiers.' 'We reiterate what we stated in the early days of this heroic battle: what this enemy witnesses from our fighters is just a glimpse of the firm strength awaiting it wherever it treads in southern Lebanon.' The statement also addressed the resistance supporters with sincere words, underlining the role in emerging victorious from this battle. 'To our honorable people, you are in the hearts of every fighter among us. You are our stronghold that humiliates this enemy, you are the cries of Takbeer in the field, and you are the prayer for victory that we draw closer to Allah with. O our people, you are the secret of our resilience and dignity, and all victories. We know that you are people of patience, sacrifice, and loyalty. From you, we draw all our determination and strength, and with your prayers, we rally our spirits and fight with pride.' Beloved Gaza was further addressed by the Islamic Resistance command which reiterated commitment to the support of the steadfast Palestinian people in Gaza and their valiant and honorable resistance. 'This is the legacy of the Master of Martyrs all the way to Al-Quds (may he be sanctified), and it is a trust upon our shoulders. We are worthy of this trust, with God's permission, until our last breath.' Hezbollah Military Media released a video to mark the first anniversary of the Islamic Resistance battle in support of Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2224917	2024-10-08T13:30:59-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-02313730017284200797.png

Sheikh Qassem: Hezbollah‚Äôs Military Capabilities Solid, Will Emer...	Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem stressed on Tuesday that the Lebanese resistance group‚Äôs chain of command is fine and that its military capabilities are solid, as he vowed that the resistance will emerge victorious against the Israeli enemy. In a televised speech via Al-Manar on the first anniversary of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, Sheikh Qassem affirmed that Hezbollah is not frightened by the alliance of the Israeli enemy with the United States and some European countries. He addressed Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu who vowed to bring the Zionist settlers back to northern occupied Palestine by saying: 'Many more (settlers) will be displaced.' Sheikh Qassem lashed out at the US for being key partner in the war which is aimed at eliminating the Axis of Resistance and exterminating the Palestinian people. He said that the Operation Al-Aqsa Flood is an exceptional event and the beginning of change in the Middle East. The Hezbollah deputy chief hailed the resistance in Gaza as 'legendary and capable of withstanding more and more'. 'We Are Not Scared' Sheikh Qassem said that the alliance of the Israeli enemy along with the US and some European countries doesn‚Äôt frighten the Lebanese resistance. He said that the Zionist entity and the Western countries have been trying to 'put fear' into the Lebanese resistance group after the assassination of Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, 'but it‚Äôs not working.' 'We are the sons of Axis of Resistance‚Äôs Master of Martyrs Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah,' the Hezbollah deputy chief said, as he praised the martyred S.G. for putting 'fear in the hearts of the Zionists and fighting the criminals of the occupation'. He hailed Operation Al-Aqsa Flood as 'an extraordinary and exceptional event which represents the beginning of change in the Middle East‚Ä¶ and the first step for change' towards freedom for the Palestinians.' Sheikh Qassem noted that the Israeli enemy‚Äôs goal 'was to completely eliminate the Axis of Resistance and exterminate the Palestinian people,' stressing that the Israeli crimes against Palestinian women, children and elderly are unparalleled in the history. In this regard, he hailed the Palestinian resistance in Gaza as legendary, noting that and 'it‚Äôs capable of withstanding more and more.' Sheikh Qassem stressed that the US is a key partner in this aggression, as well as some European countries. He said Lebanon has been under aggression, noting that Netanyahu has repeatedly declared that he wants a 'new Middle East.' Resistance‚Äôs Determination Firm Sheikh Qassem said that the Lebanese front 'has exhausted the enemy throughout 11 months and has displaced tens of thousands of Israeli settlers.' 'This war has never and will never affect our determination to confront the Israeli aggression.' He stressed that Hezbollah fighters in the battlefield are solid, and that the command is coherent. Hezbollah fighters carrying out pro-Gaza operations in south Lebanon (April 2024 / image released by Hezbollah Military Media). 'Netanyahu says that the settlers will return to the north and we tell him that many more will be displaced.' Sheikh Qassem warned the Israeli enemy that 'the longer the war continues; the more difficult impasse Israel will face.' 'We are striking the enemy and expanding the range of fire, we will reach any place at the time we decide according to our plan. We are steadfast and we will emerge victorious.' Meanwhile, Sheikh Qassem praised Lebanese Speaker Nabih Berri, stressing that Hezbollah and Amal Movement are 'one heart in good times and bad.' 'We fully trust our 'big brother' Speaker Nabih Berri,' his eminence said. He stressed: 'We are the people of the battlefield and we will never beg for a solution.' 'This war is a war of who screams first and we will not scream, we will continue and we will offer sacrifices, you will hear the enemy screaming, God willing.' Hezbollah Chain of Command Fine On the other hand, Sheikh Qassem reassured that the resistance‚Äôs chain of command is fine, noting that there is no vacant position in Hezbollah. 'I tell you that the chain of command is operating strictly regular and we have overcome the painful blows that have been inflicted on us.' 'We don‚Äôt have a vacant position, all positions are filled and Hezbollah is working with full readiness and regularity,' he added. He affirmed, meanwhile, that the resistance group 'will elect a new secretary-general and will announce it once it has been done.' 'Everything that the martyred leaders had, their assistants and replacements have copies of,' his eminence reassured. Solid Military Capabilities Sheikh Qassem affirmed that Hezbollah‚Äôs ability to resist Israel‚Äôs military is intact. 'Our military capabilities are fine. What our enemies say about our fighting capabilities is an illusion. They are lying.' 'Our fighters on the front line are solid. The Israeli plan is to kill Lebanese civilians and empty villages to cause chaos. But I tell them, your efforts are a failure.' He noted that the Israeli ground incursion in southern Lebanon began a week ago, stressing that the Israeli army has yet to advance. The Hezbollah deputy chief stressed that the resistance fighters are fully ready to engage in face-to-face battles with the Israeli enemy forces. 'We will neither abandon our positions, nor hand over our weapons,' stated Sheikh Qassem. Sheikh Qassem's speech is the second since martyrdom of S.G. Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah in a flagrant Israeli strike on Beirut's southern suburb, Dagiyeh, on September 27. On September 30, Sheikh Qassem said that Hezbollah was using the minimum of its capabilities, voicing full readiness for all scenarios.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2224389	2024-10-08T04:44:31-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-01467880017283873124.jpg
