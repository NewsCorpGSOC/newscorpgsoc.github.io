Russia Studying Ukraine Ceasefire Proposal, Awaits Details: Kreml...	The Kremlin said on Wednesday it was studying a proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, after American and Ukrainian officials said the ball was in Moscow’s court. The United States agreed on Tuesday to resume weapons supplies and intelligence sharing after Kyiv said at talks in Saudi Arabia that it was ready to support a ceasefire proposal. The Kremlin said it was carefully studying the results of the meeting and would await details from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. 'We are carefully studying the statements,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding that officials in Moscow were familiarizing themselves with the joint statement issued after breakthrough talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials. Peskov did not rule out a conversation between Trump and Putin later, which the US president said Tuesday was in the cards. The Kremlin does not exclude that the issue of a telephone conversation between Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump may come up in the wake of the US-Ukrainian negotiations and could be organized quickly, Dmitry Peskov said: pic.twitter.com/AUXy9kst1s — TASS (@tassagency_en) March 12, 2025 The Russian spokesman suggested a reporter was getting 'a little ahead' of himself by asking if Russia intended to tie a ceasefire proposal to the lifting of international sanctions imposed over the war in Ukraine. 'Rubio and Waltz said that they would pass on detailed information to us through various channels about the essence of the conversation that took place in Jeddah. First, we must receive this information,' Peskov said. Ukraine demonstrated that their government is ready to take steps toward restoring durable peace and expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate 30-day ceasefire. As a result, we will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security… pic.twitter.com/Eom2zhtkqI — Secretary Marco Rubio (@SecRubio) March 12, 2025 Meanwhile, Reuters news agency reported that senior Moscow sources said a deal would have to take account of Russia's advances and address its concerns. After Russian forces made gains in 2024, US President Donald Trump reversed US policy on the war, launching bilateral talks with Moscow and suspending military assistance to Ukraine, demanding that it take steps to end the conflict, according to Reuters.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2359084	2025-03-12T07:01:53-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/03/manar-096515200164699718110-e1687692834431.jpg
Israeli Premier Shouts as He Takes Stand for 17th Time in His Cor...	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shouted during his corruption trial in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, local media said. Netanyahu appeared in the Tel Aviv District Court to defend himself against corruption charges for the 17th time since the resumption of his trial on Dec. 10, 2024. According to the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, Netanyahu shouted during the session but was warned by the judge to lower his voice. 'They (judges) put me and my family through the gates of hell. I want to spend a few more minutes to show that this (allegation) is absurd. I have the right to defend myself,' Netanyahu shouted and banged on the table. The Israeli premier appears twice before the court to defend himself against the charges and he is scheduled to appear in seven more sessions. Netanyahu faces three separate cases of corruption filed in 2019 against him: Case 1,000, Case 2,000, and Case 4,000, which include accusations of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust. He denies any wrongdoing, calling the accusations 'fake.' Netanyahu, whose trial began on May 24, 2020, is the first sitting Israeli leader to take the stand as a criminal defendant in the country’s history. Under Israeli law, he is not required to resign unless convicted by the Supreme Court, a process that could take several months. Netanyahu also faces charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, with the International Criminal Court issuing arrest warrants for him and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in November 2024 over atrocities in Gaza, where more than 48,500 people, mostly women and children, have been killed since Oct. 7, 2023.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2358974	2025-03-12T05:54:46-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-01718750017417840759.jpg
Tehran to Receive Trump’s Message via Arab Country, Eyes Nuclear ...	Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi announced on Wednesday that US President Donald Trump has sent a message, but Tehran has yet to receive it. He stated that it is expected to reach them through an Arab country. Commenting on a closed-door UN Security Council session on Iran’s nuclear program, Araghchi described the meeting as 'an unusual and surprising move,' questioning the intentions of the countries that called for it. 'We hope the Security Council fulfills its duty properly and does not get influenced by the political maneuvers of certain states,' he added. Nuclear Negotiations Continue Regarding nuclear talks, Araghchi reaffirmed Iran's readiness for negotiations based on mutual respect. 'We have always been open to talks and engaged in negotiations under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). These discussions are ongoing.' He noted that while the US withdrew from the JCPOA long ago, Iran continues negotiations with European countries, with a new round scheduled soon. 'We are also engaged in talks with China and Russia, and a trilateral meeting is set to take place in the coming days,' he stated. Iran’s Foreign Ministry had earlier confirmed a meeting between Iran, China, and Russia in Beijing on Friday at the deputy foreign minister level, focusing on nuclear developments and sanctions relief. Iran’s Nuclear Program Within NPT Framework Araghchi stressed that Iran remains committed to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), stating, 'Our nuclear program operates within the NPT framework. It is dynamic, growing, and evolving, but always in line with our commitments.' Regarding EU policies, he criticized European inaction following the US withdrawal from the JCPOA. 'They made commitments they failed to fulfill. Now, they must take responsibility, and this will be addressed in our negotiations.' Dismissing claims of Iran’s isolation, Araghchi asserted, 'The Islamic Republic enjoys extensive diplomatic ties, and consultations with various nations are ongoing.' Judiciary Spokesman: 'Iran Will Not Negotiate with Bullies' Judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir dismissed Trump’s call for talks, stating that the US president disregards international principles, driven by a materialistic Western mindset to achieve illegitimate goals. 'Iran does not negotiate with bullies,' he declared. Jahangir criticized Washington’s 'maximum pressure' policy, accusing the US of using negotiations as a pretext for domination, plotting, and imposing sanctions. 'Iran will not engage with aggressors seeking to impose their will,' he said. He also condemned the US for its long history of hostility toward Iran, citing its support for coups, separatists, and terrorists; backing Saddam Hussein in the Iran-Iraq war; imposing harsh sanctions since the Carter administration; downing an Iranian passenger plane; exerting diplomatic and media pressure; assassinating nuclear scientists and Iranian generals; violating the JCPOA; and making baseless human rights accusations. 'This is just a fraction of the US's crimes against the Iranian people,' he concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2358864	2025-03-12T05:29:42-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-02593680017417825601.jpg
More Martyrs by Israeli Attacks in Gaza as Truce Talks Continue A...	Israeli attacks killed at least eight more Palestinians on Wednesday as truce talks continue in Qatar amid tightened blockade on the coastal enclave. The Israeli occupation stepped up attacks on Gaza, killing at least eight people, including a child, who was shot and martyred near Deir Al-Balah, Palestinian media reported. The attacks took place in Gaza’s Rafah and Khan Younis, according to Palestinian media. The city of Rafah, located in the far south of the Gaza Strip, is experiencing a daily tragedy. Since the ceasefire agreement came into effect on January 19, the hope of returning to their homes seems to have evaporated for many residents of the city. — Palestine Info Center (@palinfoen) March 12, 2025 Government Media Office in Gaza announced on Wednesday that 137 Palestinians have been martyred since the ceasefire took effect in the besieged enclave on January 19. Health Ministry in Gaza announced, also on Wednesday, that the death toll of Israeli aggression rose to 48,515 as number of injured reached 111,941 since the start of the Israeli aggression on October 7, 2023.

'We emphasize the need for a continuous supply of water and electricity, especially after the central desalination plant was shut down, the union said in a statement. Power shortage has also affected water desalination plants, forcing civilians to rely on alternative sources, which are becoming increasingly unsustainable amid the ongoing blockade and humanitarian crisis. Ceasefire Talks On the other hand, a new round of ceasefire negotiations has continued in Qatar with US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and delegates from the Zionist entity also in the country. Media reports said that the talks 'are behind closed doors,' and that there is absolutely zero information coming out. Hamas announced the start of a new round of ceasefire negotiations on Tuesday evening. The Israeli occupation wants Hamas to release half of the remaining captives in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas instead wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire’s second phase, in which the remaining captives would be released and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2358908	2025-03-12T04:42:34-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-09064390017417796723.jpg
Israeli Occupation Forces Intensify Raids and Home Demolitions in...	Israeli occupation forces launched a widespread campaign of raids and arrests across various cities and towns in the West Bank and occupied Jerusalem early Wednesday morning. This aggressive operation resulted in dozens of arrests, primarily in Jenin, and included the demolition of a home in Qalqilya, as well as extensive infrastructure destruction in Qabatiya. Mass Arrest Operations Sweep Across Regions The raids targeted multiple areas, with Tulkarm witnessing the arrest of Ahmed Zayit, the brother of martyr Nour Zayit, along with Abdul Rahman Odeh and Maham al-Attar. In Nablus, Yassin Amireh and Abdul Nasser Dhuqan were taken into custody from Balata refugee camp, while other arrests occurred in Hebron and Ramallah, including Ahmed al-Khatib from Beitunia.

The operation was met with resistance, resulting in violent clashes as forces deployed tear gas against local residents. This operation marks the 51st consecutive day of aggression in Jenin, contributing to the rising toll of casualties, which has included 34 Palestinian deaths and numerous injuries. The Israeli occupation forces and settlers continued to carry out attacks in various regions, including the village of Burqa, where military presence increased without any reported arrests. In Beit Furik, live ammunition was fired at homes, resulting in damaged property and escalating tensions within the community. In Kafr Aqab, a special undercover unit abducted a civilian from a medical facility, while multiple citizens were detained in Bethlehem, highlighting the pervasive nature of the Israeli military operations throughout the West Bank.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2358875	2025-03-12T04:42:13-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-05161350017416004571.jpg
Yemen Resumes Strikes on Israeli Ships as Gaza Crossing Deadline ...	Yemen has announced the resumption of strikes against Israeli vessels in critical maritime regions off its coast, following the expiration of a deadline for ‘Israel’ to reopen the Gaza Strip’s crossings. The Yemeni Armed Forces confirmed the decision on Wednesday, citing a directive from Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, leader of the Ansarullah resistance movement. Al-Houthi had previously granted ‘Israel’ a four-day ultimatum to reopen the crossings that have been shut down in an attempt to pressure Hamas into releasing Israeli captives held in Gaza. This blockade has exacerbated the already dire humanitarian situation in the region, where Palestinians have endured over 15 months of Israeli aggression. #معركة_الفتح_الموعود_والجهاد_المقدس pic.twitter.com/ydBfL1lB7V — أمين حيان Ameen Hayyan (@AmeenHa2024yan) March 11, 2025 With mediators unable to achieve a resolution, Yemen has taken a firmer stance in support of the Palestinian cause. 'Effective immediately, all Israeli ships are banned from navigating designated operational zones, including the Red Sea, Arabian Sea, Bab al-Mandab Strait, and Gulf of Aden,' the Armed Forces stated. They warned that any Israeli vessels attempting to breach this prohibition would face targeted strikes. This ban will remain in effect until crossings into Gaza are reopened and humanitarian aid, including food and medical supplies, is allowed entry. The Yemeni forces reiterated their solidarity with the Palestinian people, highlighting their unwavering support for resistance efforts in both Gaza and the occupied West Bank, which has also faced intensified Israeli aggression. Yemeni officials, including al-Houthi, had made clear their readiness to resume military operations should humanitarian relief not reach Gaza. The initial strikes against Israeli shipping began after the outbreak of war on October 7, 2023, severely impacting Israel’s economy and contributing to rising commodity prices for settlers in the occupied territories.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2358688	2025-03-12T01:05:29-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2018/07/manar-08269560015324214764.jpeg
Do Whatever You Wish: Pezeshkian to Trump	When you threaten me, I don't want to negotiate with you. Do whatever damn thing you can,' according to the Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in response to US President Donald Trump's bullying call for direct talks. 'You should be ashamed of yourself after what you did to [Ukrainian President] Zelensky recently,' Pezeshkian said in a speech on Tuesday in an apparent reference to recent unprecedented live televised quarrel between visiting the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky with President Donald Trump and his Vice President JD Vance in the White House. The Iranian president pointed to the reiteration of threats against Iran by the US president and said that 'When you threaten me, I don't want to negotiate with you. Do whatever damn thing you can.' The Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei recently rejected the US bullying call for talks with Tehran as dishonorable and senseless. More recently, Ayatollah Khamenei said that calls for negotiations by 'bully states' are aimed at dominating others, not resolving issues. Donald Trump pulled out his country out of the Iranian nuclear deal unilaterally in May 2018 and reasserted his futile Maximum Pressure Campaign against Tehran when he returned to the White House earlier this year. Iran has said it will not negotiate under pressure.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2358611	2025-03-11T11:14:00-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-03057120017417168215.jpg
Six Civilians Killed in Israeli Airstrike on Central Gaza City	Six civilians were killed when the Israeli occupation bombed a group of citizens in the center of Gaza City. Moreover, the occupation military tanks targeted gathering of civilians near the Netzarim checkpoint in central Gaza. A female citizen was killed by Israeli drone attck in the town of Al-Shawka, east of Rafah city, south of the Gaza Strip. The occupation forces also opened fire on citizens' homes east of the town of Khuza'a, east of Khan Yunis city, south of the Gaza Strip, and a shell was fired from an Israeli tank at the eastern area of the town of Abasan Al-Jadida, east of Khan Yunis city. The death toll in the Gaza Strip has risen to 48,503 since the start of the aggression on October 7, 2023, and the number of injuries has risen to 111,927. Despite the ceasefire agreement coming into effect on January 19, the occupation continues its aggression on the Gaza Strip, where dozens of citizens have been killed and injured in recent weeks, in addition to the continued incursion of its tanks and the demolition of more citizens' homes. The occupation’s closure of the crossings & blocking of aid entry for the 10th consecutive day foreshadow a risk of famine in Gaza: Hamas The Zionist occupation continues to close all crossings with the Gaza Strip, blocking the entry of humanitarian aid and basic needs, aggravating the suffering of more than two million Palestinians in Gaza, according to a statement issued by Hamas Resistance Movement. Closing Gaza’s crossings constitutes a breach of the ceasefire deal, which stipulates facilitating the aid entry into Gaza without any restrictions, Hamas affirmed. Hamas maintained that such closure represents a blatant violation of international humanitarian law, the Geneva Conventions, and amounts to a war crime and collective punishment threatening the lives of innocent civilians. 'Denying the flow of food, medicine, fuel, and basic relief means has led to a spike in food prices and a severe shortage in medical supplies, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Closing the crossings and blocking the entry of heavy machinery disrupts the efforts to recover the bodies buried under rubble, as well as the rehabilitation and reconstruction works in Gaza, which double the suffering of the people who already live in harsh conditions.' Hamas called on the mediators to pressure the occupation into adhering to its commitments under the ceasefire agreement and open Gaza’s crossings to ensure the flow of humanitarian aid, and end the collective punishment policy that the occupation authorities has adopted against our people. Hamas condemned using aid as a political blackmail card, confirming that such aggressive policies will neither break the will of our people, nor will they achieve the occupation’s objectives. 'Our Palestinian people will remain steadfast and continue their struggle until regaining their legitimate rights.' It is worth noting that a new round of talks are expected to start late Tuesday in Doha to address the main obstacles hindering the implementation of the ceasefire agreement amid Israeli insistence of breaching and disrespecting the deal.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2358534	2025-03-11T10:44:51-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-00850200017417150783.jpg

'The meeting was an important opportunity to address upcoming challenges and the government's next steps, as outlined in the inaugural speech and ministerial statement,' Moussa said. The Egyptian diplomat added that Berri stressed the broader impact of events in the south on Lebanon as a whole, while also noting a shared regional interest in Syrian stability, which could positively affect neighboring countries and help ease regional tensions.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2358479	2025-03-11T08:39:56-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-01996170017417075873.png
Israeli Drone Attacks on South Lebanon Leave One Martyr	One Lebanese citizen embraced martyrdom when an Israeli drone raid targeted Deir Al-Zahrani - Houmin Al-Fawqa main road in a new Zionist violation of the ceasefire agreement. Al-Manar correspondent indicated that the Lebanese security forces and ambulances arrived at the scene as the firefighters extinguished the fire caused by the raid which took place at 01:15 p.m. The Zionist drones also targeted twice a valley which lies in between the three towns of Froun, Srifa and Kfarsir, knowing that the enemy's UAVs roamed intensively South Lebanon skies on Tuesday. The Zionist escalation comes just before the meeting of the ceasefire monitor committee which is not expected to deter the enemy.

3 Palestinians Martyred in Jenin Amid Violent Clashes and Settler...	Three Palestinians were martyred at dawn today, Tuesday, by the Israeli occupation army in the city of Jenin, while the occupation continued its campaign of raids on several areas in the occupied West Bank, in light of its military operation in Jenin and Tulkarm. Meanwhile, the occupation army launched a campaign of raids on homes and large-scale arrests in the town of Azzun, east of the city of Qalqilya, and arrested about 200 young men. The Palestinian Ministry of Health confirmed that two young men were shot dead by Israeli fire, while a 58-year-old woman, Faiza Abu Ghali, succumbed to gunshot wounds sustained at the Jalameh military checkpoint. Eyewitness reports indicated that Israeli occupation forces had opened fire on ambulances, deliberately preventing medical assistance from reaching the injured in Jenin's eastern neighborhood. As military operations expanded, Israeli occupation forces focused their efforts on Azzun, deploying armored vehicles and conducting house-to-house searches. Numerous young men were subjected to field investigations during these raids, adding to the mounting tensions that have persisted for over 50 consecutive days in Jenin. The occupation forces also stormed several areas in the city of Jenin and its camp, especially in the eastern neighborhood of the city, while they besieged the town of Qabatiya and shelled a house with shells, while medical sources confirmed that the occupation forces injured a young man in Jenin, and the Red Crescent confirmed that the occupation forces prevented its crews in Jenin from reaching an injury in the eastern neighborhood. In addition, the occupation forces stormed the city of Nablus and the old Askar camp and arrested a number of young men, while the forces stormed the town of Birzeit, north of Ramallah, amidst the outbreak of clashes and the firing of live ammunition by the forces, before withdrawing, leaving a young man injured by live ammunition in the foot, and 3 detainees after severely beating them. The occupation launched an arrest campaign in the city of Hebron and its suburbs for the third consecutive day, while the Red Crescent confirmed that its crews dealt with 4 live ammunition injuries in the town of Beit Fajjar in the Bethlehem Governorate, who were transferred to the hospital. This comes at a time when settler attacks on Palestinians and their property continued, and the head of the Umm Safa village council, northwest of Ramallah, Marwan Sabah, confirmed that settlers burned a garage and a number of cars after an attack they carried out on the village.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2358270	2025-03-11T04:57:31-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-06422250017416942387.jpg
Mass Executions, Sectarian Killings Reported in Syria’s Coastal R...	Armed groups loyal to Syria’s interim government have carried out mass executions as part of a campaign described as 'cleansing,' according to CNN, citing eyewitnesses and video footage. The violence has escalated into large-scale killings in coastal regions under the control of the Syrian military administration. Wave of Sectarian Killings Syria is witnessing its worst violence since the fall of the Al-Assad regime late last year. The Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) reported that at least hundreds have been killed, including dozens of civilians who fell victim to widespread executions by Syrian Defense Ministry forces. Many of the killings were reportedly carried out on sectarian grounds. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the massacres—39 documented since March 6—have primarily taken place in the coastal regions of Latakia and Tartous. The violence erupted following attacks by fighters claiming affiliation with 'Coastal Shield' against forces loyal to Syria’s new ruling authority. In response, government forces launched retaliatory operations, executing civilians and engaging in ethnic cleansing, which continues to this day. Eyewitness Accounts Residents have described scenes of horror. One survivor from Latakia recounted, 'Armed men moved from house to house, killing people for sport. Bodies were scattered in the streets.' Bashir, another witness, said his 70-year-old uncle and 60-year-old aunt were brutally killed in Banias, a coastal city in Tartous. 'They were Alawites with no political ties,' he said, expressing fears for his own safety and that of his children. A woman from Homs, Rasha Sadiq, said her family members were executed by fighters supporting Syria’s new ruling authority. 'They heard gunfire and sectarian chants before being killed,' she said. Video Evidence of Atrocities Social media footage shows convoys of armed men heading toward Latakia and Tartous before the violence erupted. Some videos depict fighters chanting sectarian slogans, while others show victims being taunted before execution. As violence intensifies, efforts are underway to evacuate students from Suwayda and Jaramana studying in Latakia, amid worsening security conditions.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2358259	2025-03-11T04:50:00-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-04557200017416945465.jpg
Iran Slams US Decision to Cut Iraq’s Electricity Waiver	Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi condemned the Biden administration's decision to revoke Iraq’s waiver for importing electricity from Iran. Labeling the move as 'extremely deplorable,' Araghchi criticized the US for targeting the Iraqi population by blocking access to essential services like electricity, particularly as the nation braces for the sweltering summer months. This announcement follows the US suspension of a waiver that allowed Iraq to import Iranian electricity, heightening concerns about the stability of Iraq's power grid. The chairman of Iraq's parliament finance committee warned that such restrictions could lead to a catastrophic collapse of the country’s electrical infrastructure. The US National Security Council defended the decision, stating it aligns with the National Security Presidential Memorandum 2, which aims to reduce Iran’s crude oil exports to zero. Spokesman James Hewitt emphasized that Washington remains steadfast in its 'maximum pressure campaign' to ‘’curb Iran’s nuclear program’’, ballistic missile development, and support for anti-Israel groups. Hewitt further urged the Iraqi government to swiftly reduce its dependence on Iranian energy sources. Currently, about 80% of Iraq’s electricity is generated using natural gas, which heavily relies on imports from Iran. In recent years, Iraq has entered agreements with Iran to import significant amounts of electricity and gas, highlighting the deep economic ties between the neighboring countries. As diplomatic tensions rise, Araghchi reaffirmed Iran's commitment to supporting the Iraqi people and standing firm against what unlawful US actions. The fallout from this US decision continues to loom large over Iraq’s energy landscape and regional relations.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2358138	2025-03-11T02:28:14-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-06199350017416852519.jpg

The Lebanese Army Command - Orientation Directorate - issued on Monday a statement to detail the circumstances of the Zionist attack on a soldier in the outskirts of Kfarchouba town. 'On March 9, 2025, after contact was lost with one of the Lebanese army soldiers, and as a result of follow-up and investigation, it became clear that members of the Israeli enemy forces had opened fire at the soldier while he was wearing civilian clothes in the outskirts of the southern Lebanese border town of Kfarshouba, which resulted in his injury, and then he was transferred into the occupied Palestinian territories.' The statement added 'This attack comes as part of a series of repeated and increasing attacks by the Israeli enemy on citizens, the latest of which was the shooting at a soldier on March 9, 2025 in the town of Kfar Kila - Marjeyoun, which led to his martyrdom, coinciding with the enemy’s continued violations of Lebanon’s sovereignty and security.' The Israeli enemy also opened fire at a school hosting an Iftar meal in Ramya town, South Lebanon.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2357973	2025-03-10T10:58:01-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-07313510017416294775.png
Hamas Denounces Israeli Enemy’s Failure to Withdraw from Philadel...	Hamas Resistance Movement issued on Monday a statement to condemn and reject the occupation's violation of the ceasefire agreement and its failure to withdraw from the Salah al-Din (Philadelphi) Corridor area. The Zionist occupation failed to comply with the gradual pull-out of its troops from the Salah al-Din (Philadelphi) Corridor during the first phase, and also did not begin its withdrawal on the 42nd day, as stipulated in the agreement, Hamas statement added. 'Yesterday marked the 50th day of the agreement, by which the withdrawal was set to be completed, but so far that has not happened.' Hamas stressed that 'this blatant violation is a clear breach of the agreement and an apparent attempt to sabotage it and render it meaningless'. The continued violations confirm the occupation’s disregard for agreements and its manipulation of international commitments. These violations place responsibility on the mediators to pressure the occupation into fulfilling its commitments and immediately ending its presence in the Salah al-Din (Philadelphi) Corridor, the statement underscored. Hamas called on the mediators and the international community to intervene immediately to ensure the occupation’s withdrawal, and resume negotiations for the second phase without further delay. Adhering to the agreement and completing the negotiations is the only way to secure the release of the prisoners, and any procrastination means tampering their fate and the fealings of their families, Hamas statement concluded. The Israeli negotiating team left for Qatar Monday for talks aimed at extending the fragile Gaza ceasefire, after 'Israel' cut the Palestinian territory’s electricity supply to ramp up pressure on Hamas. Ahead of the negotiations, 'Israel' disconnected the only power line to a water desalination plant in Gaza, a move Hamas denounced as 'cheap and unacceptable blackmail'.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2357951	2025-03-10T10:15:56-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2016/09/manar-07632360014745454023-e1698484116887.jpeg

Groups of militants affiliated with the Ministry of Defense stormed Harison town in Baniyas countryside, where they looted and burned houses and civilian properties. This followed the announcement by Damascus government about the accomplishment of the 'security campaign' in the Syrian coastline. More than 1,300 people were killed by the militants in the three days to late Sunday, with civilians comprising 973 of the dead, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said in a statement. It is worth noting that Harison town has come under attack with different weapons, although inhabitants had escaped to farmlands. Meanwhile, the town’s residents have appealed to urgent intervention and called upon the UN delegation, which arrived at Baniyas yesterday and has toured areas in the Syrian coastline, to visit their town. The living situation in the Syrian coastline has deteriorated dramatically with the suspension of delivering foodstuffs and basic products for days in light of the ongoing 'security campaign'.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2357852	2025-03-10T07:56:54-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-07238160017416186033.png
Russia’s Coexistence with West to Depend on Its Readiness to Reco...	Russia's coexistence with the countries of the collective West will depend on their behavior and their willingness to acknowledge and rectify past mistakes, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated in an interview with the New Regions of Russia magazine. 'I believe the main lesson is clear: in matters crucial to our country's survival, we must rely solely on ourselves and on the trusted friends who stood by us in our time of need,' he remarked. 'Regarding our coexistence with our Western neighbors, much will hinge on their actions and their readiness to recognize and amend the errors they have made, including their persistent desire to achieve a strategic defeat for our nation.' Lavrov emphasized that the past three years have marked a 'moment of truth.' Following the initiation of the special military operation to protect the people of Donbass and Novorossiya, the collective West revealed its true nature. He remarked, 'The ostensible rule of law and basic standards of decency have been cast aside. The so-called European values - such as the inviolability of property, the presumption of innocence, freedom of speech and movement, and access to information - have dissipated like smoke.' He continued, 'Those who once lectured everyone on how to live, who proclaimed themselves champions of democracy and human rights, hastily rallied behind the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev without a moment's hesitation.' According to the Russian foreign minister, the world has witnessed the hegemonic instincts driving the ultra-liberal ruling elites of the West. 'The predatory, colonial habits of the former colonial powers of the EU and Britain, along with their inherent vices - arrogance, deceitfulness, and a lack of order in business conduct - persist. De facto, a new global 'divide' has emerged: on one side is the Western minority, while on the other is the global majority,' he stated. 'This majority includes all those countries, as well as individuals of good will within the West itself, who advocate for the establishment of a multipolar world based on a balance of interests.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2357808	2025-03-10T06:26:43-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/09/manar-09607150016947106646.jpg
Tehran Reiterates: No Letter Received from U.S. President	Tehran has once again said that it has not received a letter from U.S. President Donald Trump, days after he claimed to have sent such a letter to Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baqaei said during a press conference on Monday that Iran has not received any letter from the US president. In an interview on Friday, Trump claimed that he had sent a letter to Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, and proposed to negotiate with Iran on a new deal. Iran says it has not received any such letter, reiterating its position of not negotiating with Washington under pressure. 'Some foreign governments and domineering figures insist on negotiations, while their goal is not to resolve issues but to exert control and impose their own agendas,' Ayatollah Khamenei said on Saturday, dismissing the idea of negotiation with the U.S. Baqaei also said during his presser that the most significant event in the past week was the extraordinary meeting of the foreign ministers of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Jeddah, which was held at the proposal of the Islamic Republic of Iran to address developments in the occupied Palestinian territories. He said the meeting specifically aimed to make a decision regarding the plot to forcibly displace the people of Gaza to neighboring countries. 'On the sidelines of the meeting, the foreign minister also held good discussions with his counterparts from several Islamic countries,' he added. ‘We are witnessing widespread violations of international humanitarian law’ In response to a question about the adoption of a resolution by the United Nations General Assembly and Switzerland’s responsibility regarding international documents, Baqaei said the resolution, adopted in September 2014, called on Switzerland, as the custodian and initiator of international humanitarian law instruments, particularly the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, to ensure the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure during armed conflicts. He explained that the resolution called for holding a meeting to approve the provisions of international humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territories and Gaza. 'We were very saddened and surprised that Switzerland ultimately decided not to hold this conference, and this issue was one of the matters discussed in the recent [OIC] meeting,' he said. 'The foreign ministers of the OIC also expressed regret over the cancellation of this conference. We do not pass judgment, but the reality is that over the past two years, there have been widespread violations of international humanitarian law, yet no response has been observed from those who consider themselves the custodians of this matter.' Recent events in Syria ‘a crucial test’ for the new rulers Addressing the situation in Syria, Baqaei expressed deep concerns about distressing and tragic incidents as well as reports of insecurity, violence, and hostage-taking in various parts of the Arab country. 'Any act of violence, killing, and attacks on military personnel is condemned and cannot be justified in any way. The targeting of segments of the Alawite, Christian, Druze, and other minorities has truly wounded human emotions and conscience both in the region and internationally,' he said. He described the tragic events as a very serious and real test for Syria’s rulers to fulfill their responsibilities in safeguarding the lives and property of all Syrians, adding that this responsibility also extends to all parties that consider themselves influential in Syria’s developments. 'We have conveyed our concerns through appropriate channels to the countries that have a presence and influence in Syria, and we sincerely hope that the killings and violence against different segments of the Syrian people will come to an end,' the spokesman said. Israel's brutalities against Palestinians Referring to the Israeli regime's ongoing genocidal atrocities against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip that have claimed the lives of at least 48,450 people, mostly women and children, he pointed to the Islamic Republic’s call on various countries to impose sanctions on the regime as a means of punishing it for the atrocities. 'The demand for an end to any form of support for this regime has been put forward. If we acknowledge that genocide has occurred in Gaza, including the cutting off of water and electricity, which is beyond doubt, then, under the Genocide Convention, countries have obligations to use all means available to stop the genocide,' Baqayi said. The spokesperson said that the first step towards enacting the sanctions was to halt the supply of weapons to the regime. 'This is a demand of Islamic countries and was explicitly stated in the Jeddah summit resolution,' Baqayi said while referring to the resolution that was passed at the end of an Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) summit in the Saudi city of Jeddah earlier this month. 'Countries must cease all trade relations with the regime. This is not limited to Islamic countries. Just two weeks ago, the African Union also addressed this issue in its resolutions,' the spokesperson said.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2357775	2025-03-10T05:25:06-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-07402710017416094986.jpg
Israeli Occupation Forces Arrest Palestinians Across West Bank; 1...	Israeli occupation forces launched a raid early Monday morning in several cities across the occupied West Bank, detaining a number of Palestinians, including released prisoners and the wife of a detainee. Local sources reported that Israeli occupation forces arrested the wife of prisoner Ahmed Salmi after storming her home in the Kafr Saba neighborhood of Qalqilya, located in the northern West Bank. Additionally, Mahmoud Abu Hamid, a young man from Qalqilya, was arrested at the Deir Sharaf checkpoint west of Nablus. Arrests and Clashes The occupation forces also raided the city of Nablus in the northern West Bank, arresting citizen Amer Snoubar from his home in the western part of the city. During the raid, clashes and armed confrontations erupted between Israeli occupation forces and local resistance fighters in the Old City of Nablus. In Hebron, Israeli occupation forces carried out a series of arrests, targeting several released prisoners. Local sources also reported that Israeli forces raided the city of Bethlehem in the southern West Bank, arresting four young men after storming their homes. As the Israeli assault on Jenin enters its second month, occupation forces arrested Omar Al-Wahsh and released prisoner Ali Al-Samar during a raid in the town of Yamoun, west of Jenin in the northern West Bank. Enemy Plans to Build Over 1,000 New Settler Units In a separate development, the Israeli occupation government plans to approve the construction of 1,030 new settlement units in the towns of Sur Baher and Jabal Mukaber in occupied Jerusalem. According to a plan published by Hebrew media, 380 housing units are expected to be built in the 'Nof Tzion' settlement near Jabal Mukaber, along with a school, two synagogues, and commercial areas. In addition, 650 more housing units are planned near the Sur Baher neighborhood, between the Ramat Rahel settlement and the Har Homa neighborhood, along with commercial areas, a primary school, a synagogue, a community center, and kindergartens. This settlement expansion continues to encircle the city of Jerusalem, threatening its Arab neighborhoods and placing them in greater danger of displacement and demographic manipulation. The Israeli occupation aims to create what it refers to as 'Greater Jerusalem' by legally annexing settlements on Palestinian land, altering the city's character, and erasing its identity. Strategic Plan for Greater Jerusalem The Zionist government also plans to annex settlements such as Maale Adumim, Beitar Illit, Givat Ze'ev, Efrat, and Maaleh Mikhmas, as well as others to the north, east, and south of Jerusalem. This would not only surround the city but also penetrate its core, cutting off vital geographic links between Bethlehem, Hebron, Ramallah, and Nablus. The annexation of these settlements would effectively isolate occupied Jerusalem from the West Bank, severing essential communication and transportation links, and threatening further displacement of Palestinian residents. This move is part of a broader Israeli strategy to impose a Jewish majority in Jerusalem, using settler demographics to solidify control over the city and alter its Arab identity.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2357588	2025-03-10T02:55:48-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-05161350017416004571.jpg
Iranian Foreign Ministry Affirms No Room for Negotiation Under Th...	Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ismail Baghaei affirmed that negotiations under pressure and threats hold no meaning, emphasizing that Iran will never accept talks conducted under coercion. OIC Meeting on Gaza Displacement Speaking at his weekly press conference, Baghaei highlighted the most significant diplomatic event of the past week—the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) meeting in Jeddah. Convened at Iran’s initiative, the meeting aimed to address the Israeli enemy's plans to forcibly displace Gaza’s residents. He noted that the late Iranian Foreign Minister Hussein Amir-Abdollahian held productive discussions with his counterparts on the sidelines of the gathering. Denial of US Message and Condemnation of Threats Responding to former US President Donald Trump’s claim of having sent a message to Iran, Baghaei categorically denied the assertion, stating, 'We have received no such message.' Regarding US officials’ threats against Iran, Baghaei condemned them as violations of international law and acts of aggression. 'The threat of force is prohibited under international regulations and constitutes a criminal act,' he stressed. Referring to bullying of the US government, Iran’s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson said the Islamic Republic of Iran will never accept negotiations under pressure. pic.twitter.com/8w1w3sFDfO — Mehr News Agency (@MehrnewsCom) March 10, 2025 Baghaei added that while such threats have persisted in various forms over the years, they have only been met with steadfast resistance from the Iranian people. Baghaei criticized Washington’s approach of presenting Iran with a false choice between 'war or negotiation,' describing it as unserious and unacceptable. He reiterated that Iran views diplomacy as a process based on mutual respect and has consistently adhered to this principle. However, he made it clear: 'Negotiation under pressure and threats is meaningless, and Iran will never accept such terms.' Concerns Over Escalating Violence in Syria Baghaei also addressed recent developments in Syria, revealing that Iran has been actively engaged in consultations regarding the situation. He expressed deep concern over reports of escalating violence and insecurity in parts of the country. 'Iran strongly condemns all acts of violence, killings, and attacks targeting civilians—such actions are unacceptable under any circumstances,' he stated. Referring specifically to the recent attacks on members of Syria’s Alawite community, Baghaei described them as a 'deep wound to the human conscience.' He emphasized that the incident serves as a critical test for the Syrian government and other stakeholders to uphold their responsibilities in protecting Syrian lives. Iran, he noted, has conveyed its concerns through the appropriate diplomatic channels to influential parties involved in the Syrian conflict. Baghaei concluded, warning that such incidents only serve to further complicate Syria’s already fragile political landscape.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2357544	2025-03-10T02:05:00-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-08000540017328864512.jpg
Sheikh Qassem: Hezbollah’s Strength Unbroken, Resistance Determin...	Hezbollah's Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem addressed a broad range of issues, emphasizing the resilience of Hezbollah, its commitment to confronting occupation, and the unwavering spirit of its people. In an exclusive interview with Al Manar on Sunday, His Eminence stated, 'The people of the resistance are the noblest and most honorable. Now, I understand even more the relationship between Sayyed Nasrallah and the people—it is beyond words.' A Divine Funeral Procession Sheikh Qassem noted that the decision to delay the funeral due to security concerns was ultimately shaped by unfolding circumstances. 'After Sayyed Nasrallah’s martyrdom, there was coordination with Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, and we agreed to postpone the funeral to safeguard the people. As time passed, the situation necessitated further delays. The turnout was unparalleled. I felt that the people were declaring, ‘We remain loyal to you, Sayyed Nasrallah.’ Resistance is not merely a phase—it is a deeply rooted belief embraced by men and women, young and old,' His Eminence affirmed. Sheikh Qassem described the funeral as more than a farewell—it was a pledge of loyalty to the resistance. 'This procession bridged the past and future. The people weren’t just mourning; they were renewing their commitment.' He praised Hezbollah’s steadfast supporters, recalling families who had lost loved ones yet remained resolute. 'One woman gave three martyrs, two sons-in-law, and two grandchildren—ready to sacrifice more. Another offered her only son and stood prepared to give again. Who can defeat such a people? They stand firm, always ahead of their enemies, defying every conspiracy.' Unwavering Support Sheikh Qassem highlighted the massive turnout, with 20,000 organizers managing the funeral. He thanked Iraq, Iran, Palestine, Yemen, Tunisia, and all who stood in solidarity, noting that 'even when flight paths were blocked, Iranian delegations still found a way to attend.' Sheikh Qassem rejected claims that the resistance had been weakened. 'Beirut's Camille Chamoun Sports City was packed by 6 a.m. This funeral was a defining moment. People can say what they want about victory or defeat—every major event holds meaning, from resisting aggression to the Battle of the Mighty Warriors and our strategic patience against Israeli attacks.' Sayyed Nasrallah and Leadership Transition He recalled his last meeting with Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on September 18, 2024, and their final phone call on September 21, 2024. 'After Sayyed Nasrallah’s assassination, I spoke with Sayyed Hashem Safieddine about the burial and leadership transition. I proposed that he take on the role of secretary general. But before any formal announcement, Sayyed Hashem was also martyred. When I heard of his assassination, it felt like an earthquake—my life turned upside down. Yet, I felt no fear or hesitation, only divine guidance,' Sheikh Qassem asserted. Resistance Capabilities and Readiness Sheikh Qassem reaffirmed Hezbollah’s military strength. 'After Sayyed Hashem’s martyrdom, I contacted our military leadership and asked to be briefed on what remains—not what we lost. Hezbollah’s structure is vast, and our capabilities are immense. Despite security challenges, we quickly regained control, conducted internal investigations, and held accountable those responsible for lapses.' His Eminence revealed that Hezbollah had adjusted its battlefield strategies, reaching an agreement with its military leadership on targeting enemy positions, including strikes on the occupied city of Tel Aviv. 'Had the enemy been able to advance on the ground, they would have done so—not just towards southern Lebanon but beyond, as they did in 1982 when they invaded Beirut.' Israeli Enemy's Defeat and the Power of Resistance Sheikh Qassem highlighted the direct hits on Israeli targets, including the occupied city of Tel Aviv and Zionist Prime Minister Netanyahu’s residence, as a turning point. 'The Israeli enemy sought negotiations after realizing our capabilities. We did not enter these talks from a position of weakness. We never wanted this war, but when the enemy asked for a ceasefire, we negotiated while fully capable of continuing the fight.' His Eminence emphasized Hezbollah’s precision in targeting military sites, avoiding non-military targets despite having the ability to strike them. 'We chose to focus on military objectives to deny the Israeli enemy any excuse to escalate its crimes further.' Resistance: A Path of Sacrifice and Victory Addressing concerns about the resistance’s future, Sheikh Qassem affirmed, 'The resistance is strong and ongoing, though it has endured sacrifices. Could anyone expect it to continue without them? Yes, we have made great sacrifices, but we understand that facing Israel, the US, and their allies requires paying a price. We are up against a massive force that has used every means of brutality against the resistance in Palestine and Lebanon.' His Eminence emphasized the heavy toll on the Israeli enemy, both militarily and economically. 'Their casualties are mounting, their economy is strained, and their forces are suffering significant losses. This confirms that the resistance remains steadfast.' No Secret Agreements in the Ceasefire Deal Hezbollah's Sheikh Qassem rejected claims of secret clauses in the ceasefire agreement. 'The deal explicitly mentions 'south of the Litani River’ five times. This is the framework we adhere to.' He dismissed speculation about US-Israeli side agreements, affirming that the ceasefire falls under UN Resolution 1701. 'During the 60-day period, Israel committed multiple violations. The Lebanese army has repeatedly expressed readiness to deploy, but Israel has blocked it.' His Eminence warned of the broader Zionist project, citing Israeli violations, including the presence of rabbis at contested sites. 'This is not just about aggression; it’s part of a larger expansionist agenda.' Resistance Will Not Back Down Sheikh Qassem reaffirmed Hezbollah’s commitment to resisting occupation. 'If the Israeli enemy continues its occupation, it will face resistance from the army, the people, and the resistance. Some believe diplomacy alone can achieve liberation—but history proves otherwise. Resistance is what forced Israel out of southern Lebanon in 2000.' 'We live in this land together, and we will continue to defend it together. Has Israel’s brutality silenced some voices? No matter—the resistance will never stop, and we will never surrender,' Sheikh Qassem emphasized. His Eminence pointed out that the Lebanese foreign minister provides the Israeli enemy with excuses to continue its aggression and should demand an end to the occupation. He also condemned Israeli attacks on civilians, affirming that the resistance will never stop and will continue to defend the homeland.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2357236	2025-03-09T15:08:03-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-00033290017415551359.jpg
Syria Patriarchs Reject Massacres Endangering Innocent Citizens, ...	A statement issued by Syria patriarchs denounced on Sunday the massacres against the innocent citizens, stressing that those horrific acts must be sopped. Syria patriarchs urged an imminent national reconciliation, underlining the importance of establishing a state that respects all the citizens and protects the nation's territorial integrity. A UK-based war monitor said more than 1,000 people have been killed in two days of revenge killings in the country’s western region. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on Sunday that the death toll from the ongoing violence has risen to over 1,000 people, including 745 civilians, who were killed mostly execution-style, 125 HTS militants and 148 members of opposition groups. Fox News reported that the total number of victims of the sectarian killings in western Syria is around 4000 as the HTS militants escalate their crimes.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2356730	2025-03-09T08:33:30-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-09888290017415344039.png
Kfarkila Border Town Bids Farewell to 50 Martyrs as Close Israeli...	Hezbollah and the Resistance supporters held on Sunday a massive funeral to mourn 50 martyrs in Kfarkila border town which has been confronting the Israeli barbarism since October 7, 2023. The mourners bade farewell to the martyrs who have been claimed by the Zionist aggression and confirmed commitment to the resistance path, disregarding the Zionist drones and occupation troops deployed near the town. Member of 'Loyalty to Resistance' bloc, MP Ali Fayyad, wondered how would the Lebanese government confront the Israeli violations amid the failure of the complaints to the ceasefire monitor committee. The Lebanese people have the right to be updated by the government on its plans to face this danger, MP Fayyad affirmed. Near Fatima Gate in Kfarkila town as well, the Zionist occupation forces opened fire, killing a Lebanese Army soldier and injuring a female citizen. Israeli occupation forces launched a mortar shell at the vicinity of Bastra Farm, South Lebanon, Al-Manar reporter said.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2356675	2025-03-09T08:14:26-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-07046300017415332495.png
Former Mayor Injured in Tel Aviv Car Explosion	Former Bat Yam Mayor Shlomo Lahiani was injured Sunday afternoon when his car burst into flames following a powerful explosion on Ayalon Highway near the La Guardia Interchange. Another man, approximately 35 years old, was moderately wounded in the blast. The explosions occurred on the southbound lanes of the Ayalon Highway near the La Guardia interchange, according to the Zionist police, who say they are probing what was behind the blast. Emergency responders received the report at 3:27 pm, and Magen David Adom (MDA) paramedics treated both men at the scene before transporting them to Wolfson Medical Center in Holon. Lahiani sustained minor injuries, while the second victim suffered moderate blast-related wounds. 'We saw two vehicles in the middle of the road and two injured men nearby, both suffering from blast injuries and limb wounds,' said MDA medics Neriah Ben Moshe and Shai Bechar. 'We provided initial treatment and evacuated them in stable condition.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2356620	2025-03-09T07:45:47-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-04559230017415314991.png
Gaza Ceasefire Talks to Be Resumed in Doha amid Ongoing Israeli A...	The Israeli enemy said it would send a delegation to Doha on Monday to resume ceasefire and prisoner exchange talks with Hamas to enter the next phase of the truce. Hamas cited 'positive indicators' for the resumption of talks on the ceasefire but denied reports suggesting any temporary ceasefire agreement during Ramadan. Hamas spokesperson Mahmoud Mardawi reiterated commitment to the agreed-upon terms of the truce while pushing for the next stage of negotiations. Gaza continues to face mounting hardships this Ramadan. In Khan Younis, six bakeries have been forced to close due to severe fuel shortages as a result of Israel's ongoing blockade on aid into the Strip. The shortage is adding to the already dire humanitarian crisis that continues to unfold. Meanwhile, Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on Sunday that US President Donald Trump's widely condemned plan to relocate millions of Gazans to other countries was 'taking shape', but acknowledged it would be a massive logistical undertaking. 'This plan is taking shape, with ongoing actions in coordination with the administration&#8230; It involves identifying key countries, understanding their interests — both with the US and with us — and fostering cooperation,' Smotrich said at an event in parliament, adding that preparations were underway to establish a large-scale body to oversee the displacement. Bezalel Smotrich, Israeli Finance Minister (photo from archive). A Palestinian citizen was killed and several others were injured in the early hours of Sunday by Israeli occupation forces' gunfire in the Shujaiya neighborhood, east of Gaza City. According to medical sources, a Palestinian from Ebeid family was killed and others were wounded when Israeli occupation forces opened fire in the Shujaiya area. The victims were targeted while in the vicinity, resulting in casualties. At least 48,458 Palestinians have been killed and over 11.897 have been injured since October 2023 - the Gaza Health Ministry revealed. Five civilians were brought to hospitals across the Gaza Strip overnight in the past 24 hours. The toll adds to thousands trapped under the rubble that the ministry has presumed dead - making the toll over 61,000.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2356532	2025-03-09T06:30:46-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-04560780017415270405.jpg
Israeli Enemy Continues Its Wide-scale Aggression on Tulkarm	The Israeli aggression on the northern West Bank province of Tulkarm has entered its 42nd consecutive day, resulting so far in massive house demolitions, widespread destruction, and mass displacement of Palestinians. Israeli occupation forces have deployed additional military reinforcements towards the city and its refugee camps on Sunday, setting up checkpoints across the area and hindering the movement of local residents. In the Tulkarm refugee camp, Israeli occupation forces have maintained their presence in the area, blocking anyone from entering the camp and targeting anyone trying to approach. Almost the entire population of the camp have been displaced since the beginning of the assault. According to witnesses, the camp has been turned into an almost deserted zone, with only a few families remaining in certain alleys near the entrances. The destruction of infrastructure, homes, and businesses has been extensive, with many buildings demolished, damaged, or set on fire, while some of the remaining houses have been converted into military outposts. In Nour Shams refugee camp, eyewitnesses reported that Israeli soldiers have installed surveillance cameras on the rooftops of homes they have seized and converted into military barracks. Meanwhile, the camp is witnessing widespread destruction of infrastructure, with many homes either completely demolished or severely damaged. Remaining structures have been repurposed as military outposts, with explosions frequently heard throughout the area. According to latest estimates, more than 9,000 residents have been forcibly displaced from the Nour Shams refugee camp, while 12,000 have been displaced from the Tulkarm refugee camp. Earlier this week, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) declared that the Jenin, Tulkarm, and Nour Shams camps in the northern West Bank are now uninhabitable due to the extensive damage caused by the ongoing military operations. UNRWA described this assault as the longest and most destructive since the Second Intifada in 2000. The scale of displacement has been the largest in the West Bank since 1967, with approximately 40,000 people forced to leave their homes. The agency also warned that entire communities have been nearly emptied, with severe damage to civilian infrastructure, including homes, making it uncertain whether the displaced will have a place to return to. Clashes, meanwhile, erupted between Palestinian youths and IOF after the enemy troops stormed Qasra town in southern Nablus. Palestinian sources mentioned that 171 settlers stormed Al-Aqsa Mosque in the early morning.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2356499	2025-03-09T06:06:53-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-04123940017415256099.jpg
Iran Rejects Calls for Negotiations by ‘Bullying’ Powers: Leader	Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei says that calls for negotiations by 'bullying' powers are not aimed at resolving issues; rather, they are an attempt to impose their demands on the Islamic Republic. 'The Islamic Republic of Iran will certainly not accept their expectations,' Ayatollah Khamenei said during a meeting with heads of the three branches of government and other senior civil and military officials in Tehran on Saturday. U.S. President Donald Trump claimed on Friday that he had sent a letter to Ayatollah Khamenei, asking that negotiations be reopened. Trump has been signaling a willingness to negotiate with Iran to 'make a deal' since he took office for a second term in January. However, on February 5, he signed a presidential memorandum to restore a campaign of 'maximum pressure' on Iran that he had launched in his first term. During his first term, Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from a multilateral nuclear deal with Iran, signed by his predecessor, Barack Obama, in 2015, and re-imposed tough economic sanctions on the country, which the accord had lifted. Ayatollah Khamenei emphasized that the bullying powers do not seek to negotiate solely on the nuclear issue. He said that, for them, negotiations serve as a pathway to impose new expectations, particularly regarding Iran’s defense capabilities and international standing. 'They aim to create doubt in the public’s mind about why, despite their expressed readiness for talks, we are unwilling to negotiate,' he said. 'However, their true goal is not negotiation but rather dominance and imposition.' Ayatollah Khamenei also criticized the European parties to the nuclear deal for accusing Iran of not living up to its commitments under the agreement, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). 'You say Iran has not fulfilled its nuclear commitments. Well, did you fulfill yours?' the Leader said. Following the U.S.’s exit from the JPCOA in 2018, the European signatories-Britain, France, and Germany— urged Tehran to stick to its contractual obligations, promising to compensate for any economic harm incurred. Iran waited for an entire year before it began rolling back its nuclear commitments after the Europeans failed to deliver on that promise. On Saturday, Ayatollah Khamenei opened his remarks by paying tribute to former President Ebrahim Raisi, who lost his life in a tragic helicopter accident on May 19, 2024. The Leader then thanked President Pezeshkian for his 'motivation' to get things done. 'It is very valuable, this motivation and this feeling that, ‘We can, and we will definitely do it.’' Before Ayatollah Khamenei delivered his remarks, President Masoud Pezeshkian addressed the attendees.

The new authorities in Syria have bolstered the presence of military security forces in the coastal region of the country, specifically in the western areas, as part of efforts to assert control over territories that have witnessed violent clashes. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, over 500 Alawite civilians have been killed by security forces and allied militia groups over the past two days. Violent Clashes Leave Hundreds Dead Local residents in Syria's coastal region reported widespread killings during ongoing military operations and clashes between the new authorities' forces and opposition fighters. The violence, which began two days ago, has been described as the fiercest since the fall of the previous regime on December 8. The Syrian Observatory confirmed the deaths of 532 Alawite civilians in Syria’s coastal areas and the Latakia mountains, allegedly at the hands of security forces and affiliated groups. The deaths are said to have been part of targeted sectarian and regional executions, accompanied by 'field executions' and widespread looting of homes and property. The total death toll from the ongoing violence has now reached 745, including 213 fighters from both sides. The Observatory reported 93 casualties among the military forces loyal to the new authorities and 120 among opposition fighters. Several mass graves are being prepared in Tartous to bury the dozens of Alawites who were massacred by HTS forces.

These acts are feared to escalate tensions further, potentially igniting new cycles of revenge-driven violence. Syria-based sources reported indiscriminate attacks on civilians along sectarian and regional lines, while calls for an independent investigation into these atrocities have grown louder. Many have demanded accountability to prevent further escalation and to avoid plunging the country into deeper sectarian strife. Testimonies of Violations from the Ground Local testimonies from Syria’s coastal region confirm the involvement of armed groups aligned with the new Syrian government. These groups have been accused of carrying out abductions and forced disappearances in areas like the village of al-Sunubar in the Jableh countryside. Reports also indicate that armed groups executed entire families after forcibly entering their homes, despite these families having no direct involvement in the fighting elsewhere. Additional reports from Baniyas and Jableh indicated civilian deaths, including several academics, doctors, and intellectuals. In Baniyas, an eyewitness, Samir Haidar (67), recounted how 'armed groups,' including 'foreign elements,' killed civilians by shooting them. #اللاذقية فيديو من قوات القتال الليلي يظهر عناصر الميليشيات الإرهابية المسلحة أثناء محاصرتها عقب الهجوم الغادر على المشفى الوطني في مدينة اللاذقية. كيف وصل هؤلاء المسلحين إلى داخل المنازل المحيطة بالمشفى ونفذوا هجومهم؟؟ هل المهاجمين هم أصحاب المنازل أم متعاونين مع المسلحين أم… pic.twitter.com/Jn0L2z5Cdw — المرصد السوري_Syrian Observatory (@AlmarsadSyria) March 8, 2025 Security Forces Reinforced Although clashes subsided on Saturday, Syrian state news reported that security forces had reinforced their presence, especially in Banias, Latakia, and Jableh, aiming to 'maintain security.' Syria's interim government spokesperson, Hassan Abdul Ghani, urged all field units to strictly follow military and security instructions, prohibiting any interference with civilians or homes unless authorized by defense officers. The International Committee of the Red Cross called for respect for civilian lives and safe access for humanitarian workers to provide medical assistance and evacuate the wounded and deceased. Tensions began Thursday in rural Latakia after security forces arrested a wanted individual, leading to clashes when fighters opened fire on government troops, according to the Syrian Observatory. Social media posts, particularly on Facebook, shared accounts of civilians from the Alawite community being killed, with one activist reporting that her mother and siblings were 'slaughtered' in their home. Residents of Banias called for intervention to protect them, with several distress posts on Facebook. Videos shared by activists and the Observatory on Friday showed dozens of civilian bodies piled together in front of a house, with blood stains nearby, as women wept in the background. Other footage showed soldiers forcing individuals to crawl before shooting them at close range. Since the regime's fall, reports of retaliatory acts, including home confiscations, field executions, and abductions, have surfaced intermittently, though authorities dismiss them as 'isolated incidents' and pledge to hold those responsible accountable.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2356235	2025-03-08T13:07:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-06246270017413462617.jpg
Imam Khamenei: Western Negotiations Aim to Impose Their Demands, ...	Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei affirmed that certain arrogant governments insist on negotiations not to resolve issues but to impose their expectations through deception and coercion. He made it clear that the Islamic Republic of Iran will never yield to such demands. Honoring Martyr President Ebrahim Raisi Speaking on Saturday evening during a meeting with the heads of Iran’s three branches of power and senior state officials, Imam Khamenei honored the memory of Martyr President Ebrahim Raisi. Referencing Raisi’s speech at the gathering, he stated, 'The president delivered a comprehensive, well-structured, and insightful address. What stood out to me, as I have told him many times, is his strong drive and determination—an invaluable quality.' Western Civilization: A Contradiction to Islamic Values Addressing broader ideological concerns, he emphasized that the principles of Western civilization fundamentally contradict Islamic values, making them incompatible. While Iran should benefit from global advancements, he stressed that it must not depend on Western ideological foundations. Iran's Supreme Leader pointed to Western double standards as evidence of the flawed nature of their civilization, particularly regarding freedom of information. 'Can you freely mention the names of Hajj Qassem Soleimani, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, or Martyr Haniyeh on Western-controlled digital platforms? Can you question the officially accepted narrative of Nazi Germany’s actions against the Jews?' he asked. Three European countries claim that #Iran hasn’t fulfilled its nuclear commitments, have you fulfilled yours?! pic.twitter.com/xKhJ4OCAhL — Khamenei Media (@Khamenei_m) March 8, 2025 Dismissing European claims that Iran has failed to meet its commitments, Imam Khamenei described such accusations as political bullying and arrogant falsehoods. 'Even ingratitude has its limits,' he remarked. Economic Reforms and National Stability Imam Khamenei also underscored the importance of internal cohesion among state institutions as a crucial factor in addressing national challenges. Among the most pressing priorities, he highlighted the need to reform the foreign currency system and strengthen the national currency, urging experts to devise effective policies. He also stressed the necessity of swift and decisive action across all sectors, particularly in enhancing citizens' living standards. He warned that Iran’s adversaries seek to undermine the Islamic Republic’s ability to manage economic affairs, a strategy that could lead to serious consequences. Sanctions Are Not the Only Challenge While acknowledging the impact of sanctions on Iran’s economic difficulties, Imam Khamenei clarified that they are not the sole cause, as internal structural issues also play a significant role.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2356191	2025-03-08T11:33:31-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-00298250017414622368.jpg

Israeli occupation forces have been staging repeated violations to the Lebanese territories since the ceasefire with the Zionist enemy took effect on November 27, following 66-day brutal war on Lebanon. The deadline for Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon following the two-month ceasefire was illegally renewed from January 26 until February 18, when the occupation forces withdrew, but kept in several areas in the Lebanese territories.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2355949	2025-03-08T07:26:31-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-04303180017414475143.jpg

In a blatant disregard for the ceasefire agreement, ‘Israel’ continues to violate the ceasefire declaration with Lebanon and the annexation of international resolution No. 1701. In this context, the Israeli enemy's air force carried out a series of raids on a number of areas in southern Lebanon. Al-Manar correspondent reported that 'nearly 20 airstrikes were carried out by enemy warplanes targeting several valleys and forested areas on the outskirts of Zebqin, Beit Yahoun, Aishiyeh, Rayhan and Al-Bissariyeh in southern Lebanon.'

Head of Yemen’s Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Al-Houthi noted that the Israeli enemy has been procrastinating fulfilling its obligations pertaining to the humanitarian items of the ceasefire agreement. In a televised speech, Sayyed Houthi added that, however, Hamas Resistance Movement has shown full commitment to the truce deal. Sayyed Houthi underlined the the Israeli enemy has diminished or blocked the humanitarian aid flow to Gaza, committed killings and closed the Strip's border crossings. The Yemeni leader affirmed that the Zionist escalation which also included the assaults on the Palestinian people and sanctities in the occupied Al-Quds and Bank and the persecution against the Palestinian prisoners, which martyred a number of them. The Israeli enemy is seeking the judaization of the West Bank and displace its residents, Sayyed Houthi said. Trump’s administration officials are among the most prominent Zionists and adopt displacement and judaization, according to the Yemeni leader. Sayyed Houthi stressed that the entire Arab Umma must take a clear stance that supports Gaza, adding that the statement of the Arab Summits do not grant the Palestinians any benefits. In light of the Zionist return to the starvation policy against the Palestinian people, the Yemeni Armed Forces will resume their naval war against the Israeli enemy in a four-day deadline, Sayyed Houthi threatened.

Israeli Occupation Authorities Deny Unrestricted Muslim Access to...	The Palestinian Ministry of Awqaf and Religious Affairs has announced that Israeli occupation authorities have refused to hand over all sections of the Ibrahimi Mosque in the Old City of Hebron to the Ministry, as is customary on Fridays during the holy month of Ramadan. In a statement released today, the Ministry called the move a dangerous and unprecedented step, particularly given its timing during the holy month of Ramadan. The Ministry said this was part of a systematic plan to obstruct the full opening of the mosque's halls and courtyards to Muslim worshippers. According to the Ministry, the traditional procedure for the first Friday of Ramadan involves the Ministry's Director and custodians receiving full responsibility for the mosque, preparing to open it entirely to Muslim worshippers. However, this year, officials were shocked when the Israeli occupation authorities prevented access to the Eastern Gate area, which is designated for female worshippers during Friday prayers. This development marks a significant deviation from past practices, where the mosque would be fully accessible to all Muslims on the Fridays of Ramadan. The Ministry expressed concern that, if approved, this move would lead to a permanent shift in control over the mosque, with new restrictions being imposed gradually, furthering efforts by Israeli authorities to take full control over the site. The Ministry further stressed that this action appeared to be aimed at appeasing settler groups who oppose the full opening of the mosque to Muslim worshippers. There are growing fears that these efforts are part of a broader strategy to convert the entire mosque into a synagogue for Jewish worship. Since the beginning of Ramadan, Israeli occupation forces have also restricted access to the mosque for Palestinians under the age of 25. Hamas Statement Hamas issued a statement that the Zionist occupation's attacks against the mosques in the occupied West Bank during the blessed month of Ramadan are a clear escalation of religious warfare. 'Our people will not remain silent in the face of the desecration of their sacred sites.' 'Since the start of the holy month of Ramadan, the Zionist occupation has been intensifying its criminal actions, assaults and desecration against the mosques across the occupied West Bank, including the incursions into Al-Aqsa Mosque and their attempts to judaise it, as well as the ongoing attempts to fully seize the Ibrahimi Mosque,' he added. 'Furthermore, the desecration and burning of several mosques in Nablus city early today reflect the occupation’s relentless religious war, which comes as part of the broader aggression against our people and land.' Our Palestinian people and their resistance will remain steadfast, serving as a strong shield to protect their mosques and holy sites, which endure attacks and desecration by the occupation and its terrorist settlers, Hamas said.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2355487	2025-03-07T07:40:14-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-03853440017413620096.jpg
Israeli Military Spokesman Retires in Move Widely Seen as Dismiss...	The Israeli occupation military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, is to end his role in the coming weeks and retire from the army, in a move widely seen as dismissal by the new Israeli Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir. The occupation military announced the move by Hagari, the Israeli popular wartime spokesman, adding that it was 'agreed upon' with Zamir. Though, it has been seen as a de facto dismissal, as Hagari was not given a promotion for his work as a spokesman during the war. 'The chief of staff wished to express his great appreciation to Rear Adm. Hagari for his years of significant combat service for the State of Israel. Rear Adm. Hagari performed his role as IDF spokesman during one of the most complex wars in the country’s history, in a professional and dedicated manner,' the military said, according to the Times of Israel. Despite being a popular spokesman among the public, the political echelon, especially Defense Minister Israel Katz, clashed with Hagari. It is thought that Katz would not sign off on promoting Hagari, the Israeli media outlet reported. It added that Zamir was expected to promote a senior officer from the Ground Forces as the next Israeli military spokesman. Hagari has been widely seen as the propaganda mouthpiece of the occupation army. He was known for his alleged 'Hamas operatives list' during the raid of Rantisi Hoispital in Gaza in November 2023. Back then, it was clear that the alleged 'list' (written in Arabic) was a calendar of the week days rather than the names of Hamas operatives.

The SOHR reported on Friday that casualties were recorded on the Syrian coast after HTS militants were ambushed. The Mediterranean province of Latakia, which is populated by Alawites and Shia Muslims, is home to the Hmeimim air base – a strategic Syrian base that Russia operates. Clashes with the opposition groups, whom the new administration accuses of being affiliated with the former regime, came after strikes were reportedly launched by helicopters on the village of Beit Ana and the surrounding forests and artillery strikes on a neighboring village. Alawite leaders had called in a statement on Facebook for 'peaceful protests' in response to the helicopter strikes, which they said had targeted 'the homes of civilians.'

Hezbollah Secretary General Appears Sunday in an Interview with A...	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem is scheduled to appear in an interview with Al-Manar TV on Sunday at 20:30 (Beirut Time). The interview would be the first since Sheikh Qassem was elected as a Secretary General to tackle the battle of supporting the Palestinian people and their resistance, the main perils endangering the Islamic Resistance, and a number of issues pertaining to the situation in Lebanon and the region. In a moment of historic significance, Sheikh Qassem addressed on February 23 the massive crowds mourning the martyrdom of Sacred Martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and his companion, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine. Reaffirming Hezbollah’s unwavering stance on Palestine, Sheikh Qassem asserted that 'Palestine is our right and our compass. We support its liberation and will confront Trump’s displacement scheme. Lebanon is the final homeland for its people, and we are its people.' 'The sacrifices we have made are unparalleled, just as the level of Israeli criminality in Gaza and the region is unprecedented. The battle to support Gaza is part of our belief in liberating Palestine.' 'The Israeli enemy aimed to eliminate the resistance in both Gaza and Lebanon, but the scale of sacrifices was immense, and the resilience was unparalleled—this is a great achievement.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2355058	2025-03-06T11:58:11-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-05815110017289897581.jpg
Lebanese Army: Israeli Violations Threaten Lebanon’s Stability	The Lebanese Army said that the Israeli enemy has continued violations of Lebanon’s sovereignty by land, sea, and air, citing a series of recent attacks targeting civilians in South Lebanon and the Bekaa region. In a statement, the army highlighted the Israeli ongoing occupation of Lebanese territory and repeated border breaches, warning that these actions threaten Lebanon’s stability and could have broader regional repercussions. The army also stressed that such violations directly contradict the ceasefire agreement. Meanwhile, Lebanese military units are facilitating the return of displaced residents to the south by clearing unexploded ordnance, removing debris, and reopening roads, according to the statement. The army command confirmed it closely monitors the situation and coordinates necessary measures with the five-nation committee overseeing the ceasefire agreement and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Israeli Violations Al-Manar correspondent reported on Thursday that an Israeli drone targeted civilians with stun grenades while inspecting destroyed houses in the Tal Al-Nahas area. The correspondent added that a large number of Israeli enemy drones fly at very low altitudes over most areas of southern Lebanon. Al-Manar reporter noted that an Israeli glider threw stun grenades on citizens inspecting their destroyed houses in Tal Nhas town, South Lebanon, with no casualties recorded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2354937	2025-03-06T10:02:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-024325600174128411710.jpeg
Trump’s Threats Complicate Gaza Ceasefire Deal: Hamas	Hamas on Thursday condemned U.S. President Donald Trump's recent threats against the group, saying they complicate matters regarding the Gaza ceasefire agreement and encourage 'Israel' not to implement its terms. 'There is an agreement that was signed, and Washington was the mediator in it,' Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said in a statement, adding that the deal 'includes the release of all (hostages and) prisoners in three stages. Hamas has implemented what it was required to do in the first stage, while 'Israel' is evading the second stage.' The statement noted that the U.S. administration is required to pressure 'Israel' to enter negotiations on the second phase as stipulated in the ceasefire agreement. Trump issued what he called the 'last warning' to Hamas on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday, saying, 'Release all of the hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you.' 'I am sending 'Israel' everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don't do as I say,' he said in the post. Unlike his predecessor, Joe Biden, Trump conspicuously announces his administration’s support for the Israeli war schemes in Gaza. A Gaza ceasefire and hostage release agreement, brokered by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States, took effect on Jan. 19. During the initial 42-day phase of the deal, dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees were freed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2354827	2025-03-06T07:40:10-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2016/09/manar-07632360014745454023-e1698484116887.jpeg

PM Nawaf Salam announced after the session, chaired by President Joseph Aoun, that the 2025 state budget has been issued in a decree in order to avoid the bureaucratic procrastination. Salam added that the finance minister Yassin Jaber has been tasked with drafting a ministerial law that reconsiders the taxes which may affect the purchase power of the citizens in order to be included in 2026 state budget. The information minister Paul Morcos also said that the cabinet approved a draft law that exempts those affected by the Israeli aggression from paying certain taxes.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2354783	2025-03-06T06:44:46-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-01006320017412722714.jpeg
Israeli Occupation Forces Continue Aggression in West Bank’s Tulk...	For the 39th consecutive day, Israeli occupation forces continue their assault on the city of Tulkarm and for the 26th day on Nur Shams refugee camp, carrying out large-scale demolitions, infrastructure destruction, and military reinforcements. Israeli forces began on Thursday morning demolishing several residential buildings in the Al-Manshiya neighborhood of Nur Shams, following demolition orders issued a day earlier for 17 homes. The demolitions, under the pretext of constructing a new road to alter the camp’s geographic landscape, targeted properties belonging to several Palestinian families. 🎥 VIDEO: Israeli occupation forces demolish 17 homes in Nur Shams camp in Tulkarem, leaving widespread devastation. pic.twitter.com/naVPbssmQA — Palestine Info Center (@palinfoen) March 6, 2025 Residents were given just two hours to enter the camp and retrieve their belongings, yet occupation forces obstructed the evacuation process, firing live rounds to intimidate them. Since the onset of the assault, Nur Shams camp has faced relentless attacks, with Israeli forces repeatedly raiding homes, forcibly displacing residents, and turning houses into military outposts. The camp has suffered extensive infrastructure devastation, including the destruction of homes, shops, and vital facilities through demolitions, bombings, and arson. In recent days, Israeli bulldozers have razed more than 11 homes as part of a broader scheme to carve out a road from the camp’s main square to Al-Manshiya. Meanwhile, in Tulkarm refugee camp, Israeli forces maintain a strict siege, preventing entry and exit while conducting raids on abandoned homes, looting their contents, and forcibly evacuating residents, particularly in the Al-Matar neighborhood. Witnesses report that Israeli bulldozers continue to tear up roads, destroy property, and seal off streets with dirt barriers, including the camp’s main northern entrance, which has suffered unprecedented destruction. The occupation has also reinforced its military presence with fuel tankers and additional troops, positioning forces in front of residential buildings seized on Nablus Street, a key route connecting Tulkarm and Nur Shams. This has severely disrupted civilian movement. Additionally, Israeli occupation forces have seized multiple homes in the eastern Tulkarm neighborhoods of Dhanaba and Izbat Al-Jarad, expelling their residents and converting them into sniper posts and military bases. Armored reinforcements have also been deployed from checkpoints at Tulkarm’s southern and eastern entrances, leading to further incursions into the town of Anabta and the city's southern entrance before returning to their original positions.

The offensive has also displaced more than 9,000 people from Nur Shams and 12,000 from Tulkarm refugee camp.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2354585	2025-03-06T02:03:43-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-09015960017412553428.png

The Israeli enemy prepares such devices in the occupied Palestinian territories and get them to be planted in highly-camouflaged positions.

Panama President Says Trump Lied about Panama Canal’s ‘Reclaiming...	Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino has accused his US counterpart Donald Trump of 'lying' about Washington taking back the Panama canal. 'Once again, President Trump is lying. The Panama Canal is not in the process of recovery,' Mulino wrote on X. 'I reject, on behalf of Panama and all Panamanians, this new affront to the truth and to our dignity as a nation,' Mulino wrote on Wednesday, after Trump said that his administration had started to take back the vital waterway. 'To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama canal, and we’ve already started doing it,' Trump said in his speech to Congress on Tuesday. 'We’re taking it back.' Trump’s comments came hours after – under mounting pressure from Washington –the Hong Kong firm Hutchison said it had agreed to sell its lucrative Panama canal ports to a US-led consortium. Hutchison subsidiary PPC has for decades run ports at Balboa and Cristóbal on the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the interoceanic waterway. But since taking office in January, Trump has complained that China controls the canal – a vital strategic asset that the United States once ran. He has refused to rule out a military invasion of Panama to regain control, sparking angry protests and a complaint to the United Nations by the Central American country.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2354343	2025-03-05T10:29:43-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-07048050017411993748.png
Britain, France and Germany Urge ‘Israel’ to abide by Obligations...	Israel' must meet international obligations regarding the provision of humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza, the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany said in a joint statement on Wednesday. 'We call on the government of 'Israel' to abide by its international obligations to ensure full, rapid, safe and unhindered provision of humanitarian assistance to the population in Gaza,' the statement read. 'Humanitarian aid should never be contingent on a ceasefire or used as a political tool,' it added, calling on all parties to uphold the ceasefire. Zionist media revealed that the US administration backs Netanyahu’s steps to halt the humanitarian aid flow to Gaza, knowing that the Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has threatened to cut off the water and power supply to Gaza. The Zionist barbarism justifies such barbaric steps by pushing the Palestinian resistance to surrender and release the Zionist captives. Zionist analysts mentioned that the Palestinians are given the two choices of either death or surrender.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2354288	2025-03-05T08:45:14-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-01555490017411930553.png
US Rejects Arab Leaders Plan for Gaza, Insists on Trump’s Displac...	The Trump administration has rejected a long-awaited plan for the reconstruction of Gaza endorsed by Arab leaders, saying the president stands by his own vision which includes expelling the territory’s Palestinian residents and transforming it into a 'riviera' owned by the United States. 'The current proposal does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance,' US National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement Tuesday night. 'President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas. We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.' Speaking in Cairo, PA President Mahmoud Abbas pledged that general elections will be held in the West Bank, Gaza and 1948 lands for the first time in nearly two decades 'if circumstances are suitable.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu still refuses to say what he envisions for Gaza’s post-war future, except to say that he endorses Trump’s plan for 'a different Gaza.' And he thinks neither the PA nor Hamas should govern Gaza. The $53 billion proposal by Arab nations calls for rebuilding Gaza by 2030. The first phase calls for starting the removal of unexploded ordnance and clearing more than 50 million tons of rubble left by Israel’s bombardment and military offensives. Jordanian officials told CNN earlier that the plan will be presented to President Donald Trump in the coming weeks. Although Arab states endorsed Egypt’s plan, the extent of its regional support remains uncertain. Notably, the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – wealthy Gulf nations whose financial backing would be vital for any postwar strategy – were absent from the summit. Meanwhile, Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune boycotted the meeting, citing 'imbalances and shortcomings' and criticizing it as being 'monopolized by a limited and narrow group of Arab countries.' Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters on Tuesday that the group’s arms were non-negotiable. 'The weapon of the resistance is a red line, and it is not negotiable,' he said. 'We will not accept (any deal) to trade it for reconstruction or the entry of aid.' Osama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official, said last month that the group will not disarm and may even grow after the war in Gaza. The current ceasefire in Gaza, in place since January, remains in doubt after its first phase expired on Saturday. 'Israel' has blocked the entry of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza to pressure the resistance to make concessions and has warned of additional consequences, raising fears of a return to fighting. An emergency Arab summit in Cairo on Tuesday adopted Egypt’s reconstruction plan to rebuild the Gaza Strip, as it rejected the displacement of Palestinians.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2354079	2025-03-05T05:38:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-00292800017411819127.jpg
Israeli Occupation Forces Escalate Violations, Drone Strike Injur...	In yet another flagrant violation of Lebanon’s sovereignty, Israeli occupation forces launched a series of drone strikes on the southern town of Ras Naqoura this afternoon, wounding two civilians. According to Al-Akhbar newspaper, an Israeli drone targeted two vehicles belonging to brothers from the Jahir family while they were inspecting their land, leaving them injured. The National News Agency reported that multiple drone strikes hit a car near a waste dump south of a UNIFIL site in Ras Al-Naqoura. The two injured brothers, who had been collecting scrap metal, were rushed to the hospital for treatment. The agency further revealed that as Lebanese Army personnel and civilians attempted to reach the site, Israeli drones launched another strike to prevent access. This attack follows an Israeli drone strike in Rashkananiyeh, Tyre district, just a day earlier, which killed one person and wounded several others. Later, Al-Manar's correspondent reported that Israeli drones renewed their assault on the targeted vehicle in Ras Al-Naqoura, striking again as the Lebanese Army attempted to evacuate the wounded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2354068	2025-03-05T05:18:00-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-02208130017411802012.png
Shin Bet Acknowledges Historic Failure in Preventing Oct. 7 Attac...	The Zionist entity's domestic security agency Shin Bet acknowledged on Tuesday its failure in preventing Hamas's attack on Oct. 7, 2023, saying that if it had acted differently the deadliest day in 'Israel's' history could have been averted. The Internal Security Agency, as it is formally known, said that an internal probe 'reveals that if the Shin Bet had acted differently, both in the years leading up to the attack and on the night of the attack &#8230; the attack could have been prevented.' The acknowledgment comes days after an Israeli military investigation noted similar failings in protecting Israelis during the attack, which left hundreds dead and was followed by a devastating Israeli war on the Gaza Strip, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed. In the opening lines of the summary of findings from the Shin Bet investigation, the agency's chief Ronen Bar takes responsibility for failures, saying that 'as the head of the organization, I will bear this heavy burden on my shoulders for the rest of my life.' However, he added that in order to truly understand how the unprecedented attack was not stopped, there needed to be a broader probe into the role of the Israeli security and political elements and the cooperation between them. According to the summary, the investigation focused on two key areas – the direct reasons that led to the Shin Bet's failure to recognize the immediate threat from Hamas, and the developments preceding the attack. It noted that 'the investigation found no indication that the Shin Bet underestimated the enemy,' the Palestinian group Hamas. 'On the contrary, there was a deep understanding of the threat, initiatives, and a desire to neutralize the threat, particularly targeting Hamas leadership,' the summary said. The investigation found that prior knowledge of a Hamas attack plan was not treated as an 'actionable threat' and there was an overarching assessment that Hamas was more focused on 'inciting violence' in the occupied West Bank. Additionally, the investigation found that 'a policy of quiet had enabled Hamas to undergo massive military buildup,' with financial aid from Qatar going directly to Hamas's military wing. In conclusion, the agency said in its summary, 'the Shin Bet failed to provide a warning regarding the scope of the attack and the large-scale raid by Hamas'. 'The warning issued on the night of Oct. 7 was not translated into operational directives, and the response given by the Shin Bet &#8230; was insufficient to prevent or thwart the large-scale attack.' Israeli media outlets disclosed on Monday more details from the probe into the military and security failure in face of the Palestinian resistance attack on October 7, 2023.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2354002	2025-03-05T04:15:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-00034900017411769238.jpg
Amnesty International Calls for War Crimes Investigation into Isr...	Amnesty International has urged the international community to investigate war crimes committed by the Israeli occupation military during the Israeli aggression on Lebanon. On Wednesday, the organization raised alarms over repeated attacks targeting health facilities, ambulances, and paramedics in Lebanon, which they say violate international law. In a comprehensive report, Amnesty International emphasized the urgent need to probe the Israeli military's actions during the war, particularly noting that health facilities and personnel are afforded special protections under international humanitarian law. The organization revealed a shocking series of incidents, stating that between October 3 and 9, four Israeli attacks on healthcare sites in Beirut and southern Lebanon resulted in the deaths of 19 medical workers and injuries to 11 others, alongside significant damage to ambulances and medical facilities. .@amnesty : Israel’s unlawful attacks on medical facilities and personnel in #Lebanon are not only serious violations of international humanitarian law and likely #WarCrimes , but also have devastating consequences for civilians more broadly. — Avner Gidron (@AvnerGidron) March 5, 2025 'Given the scale of these attacks, it is imperative for the Lebanese government to involve the International Criminal Court,' the report urged, highlighting the need for accountability and justice for victims. Amnesty International called for Lebanon to grant jurisdiction to the ICC to investigate these crimes committed on its territory and to demand compensation for the violations incurred. Former Lebanese Health Minister Firas Abiad indicated a grim picture of the humanitarian crisis, reporting 67 attacks on hospitals, including 40 direct hits, which have collectively resulted in the deaths of 16 individuals and injuries to many more. The chaos has extended to rescue operations, with 238 attacks on emergency services accounting for 206 fatalities, as well as damage to 256 emergency vehicles, including ambulances and fire trucks. Amnesty's investigation concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that the health facilities or vehicles targeted were being used for military purposes at the time of the attacks. 'The Israeli occupation military has yet to provide adequate justification for its actions,' the report stated, reiterating that the attacks have severely compromised Lebanon's already fragile healthcare system. Despite reaching out to the Israeli occupation military for comments regarding their findings, Amnesty reported they have yet to receive a response. The ongoing Israeli aggression has had devastating consequences, with Lebanese authorities estimating over 4,000 lives lost and extensive destruction across southern and eastern Lebanon, including the southern suburbs of Beirut.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2353969	2025-03-05T03:51:01-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-05507020017411753983.jpg

Trump’s Historic Congressional Address: From Egg Prices to Flag o...	In a lengthy Congressional address, former President Donald Trump declared, 'America is back,' setting the tone for a speech that touched on a multitude of hot-button issues including soaring egg prices, the fight against 'wokeness,' and even aspirations for a flag on Mars. This unprecedented address drew significant attention not only for its length but also for the charged political atmosphere as Democrats disrupted proceedings, leading Speaker Mike Johnson to denounce the interruptions as a 'breach of decorum' and ultimately remove Congressman Al Green from Texas. 100 minutes of the world according to Trump — Axios (@axios) March 5, 2025 Trump outlined sweeping policy reversals, including a freeze on federal hiring, regulations, and foreign aid. He highlighted his decision to terminate what he called the 'ridiculous Green New Scam,' boasting of withdrawing from international agreements that he deemed detrimental to American interests, including the Paris Climate Accord and the World Health Organization. Turning to domestic economic issues, Trump placed the blame for skyrocketing egg prices squarely on President Biden, vowing to combat inflation as a key priority of his administration. He proclaimed, 'We’re working hard to get it back down,' while promising a national energy emergency to tap into America's vast energy resources. 'It’s called drill, baby, drill,' he enthused, pledging to enhance production of critical minerals and rare earths. The former president also outlined a bold trade policy, announcing a 25% tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber, and steel, stating that this would not only protect American jobs but also safeguard 'the soul of our country.' He expressed a commitment to reshaping U.S. foreign trade dynamics, pledging to address what he called long-standing injustices suffered at the hands of trade partners like Canada and Mexico. As the address wrapped up, Trump even touched on ambitions that reached beyond Earth, hinting at plans for a US flag on Mars—a symbolic nod to the nation’s goals in space exploration. As the speech unfolded, the partisan divide in Congress was palpable, yet Trump's message resonated with many supporters keen on his vision of a resurgent America, free from what he describes as the shackles of bureaucracy and social issues. The implications of this address will likely continue to dominate discussions throughout the political landscape as the nation moves forward.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2353738	2025-03-05T01:13:09-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-04049230017411659282.jpg
Trump’s Administration Blatantly Supports Netanyahu’s War Schemes...	Unlike his predecessor, Joe Biden, the US President Donald Trump conspicuously announces his administration's support for the Israeli war schemes in Gaza. In this regard, the Zionist media revealed that the US administration backs Netanyahu's steps to halt the humanitarian aid flow to Gaza, knowing that the Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has threatened to cut off the water and power supply to Gaza. The Zionist barbarism justifies such barbaric steps by pushing the Palestinian resistance to surrender and release the Zionist captives. Zionist analysts mentioned that the Palestinians are given the two choices of either death or surrender. Smotrich indicated that the decision to cut off the water and power supply is aimed at Hamas surrender, warning that the hell's gates will be opened with a military offensive that leads to the re-occupation of Gaza Strip. Similarly, the Israeli defense minister Israel Katz said that he discussed with his US counterpart Pete Hegseth the 'importance of teh release of teh Zionist captives in Gaza' in the context of the threats to resume the genocidal war on the strip. Those developments took place while the clash between the government and the opposition was intensified at the Knesset over the formation of panel tasked with the probe into October 7 failure.

Lebanon will never accept a new Zionist de facto occupation in the South, Berri confirmed. Speaker Berri called for a unified national stance that confronts the new Israeli de facto, urging the international community to put an end for the repeated Israeli violations of Lebanon's sovereignty. Speaker Berri also stressed that Lebanon would never accept any political terms, pertaining to the resistance weaponry, in return for the reconstruction and aid programs. 'Reconstruction must be a national priority without forfeiting the sovereign rights.' Zionist Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Thursday that Israeli occupation forces were 'staying indefinitely' in a buffer zone on the border with Lebanon, adding their deployment there was 'situation-dependent.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2353562	2025-03-04T09:44:59-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-01503220017411102895.jpg
President Aoun Addresses Emergency Arab Summit: There Can Be No P...	President of the Republic, General Joseph Aoun, addressed on Tuesday the emergency Arab summit in Cairo, stressing that there will be no peace without the liberation of the last inch of Lebanon's recognized territories, and there will be no peace without the State of Palestine. 'Lebanon has taught me that Palestine is a cause of right which requires might.' President Aoun reminded the conferees that 'Israel’ was still occupying Lebanese territories and holding Lebanese captives. For the Palestinian cause to be the epitome of a universal human right, we shall open our countries up to the entire world, rather than isolate them, he added. 'In my country, just as in Palestine, Israel continues to occupy lands, to launch daily aggressions, and to claim innocent lives every day, leaving people martyred or wounded, destroying properties, and causing rivers of blood and tears to flow. I bow before their suffering.' There can be no peace without the restoration of the legitimate and full rights of the Palestinians, President Aoun affirmed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2353507	2025-03-04T09:16:59-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-00633420017411086079.png

Concurrently, local Syrian sources revealed that Israeli occupation forces had infiltrated Quneitra, advancing to the town of Mashara and severing the road between Mashara and al-Tayha. This maneuver occurred amidst ongoing reconnaissance flights by Israeli aircraft. Additionally, Israeli Air Force jets targeted military sites in Qardaha, hitting equipment associated with the regime of former President Bashar al-Assad, including an air defense base. This follows last week’s aggressive actions in Tartous, western Syria, and a series of raids on military positions in southern Damascus and Daraa. At the same time, the Prime Minister of the occupation government, Benjamin Netanyahu, announced that 'Israel' will not 'allow the forces of Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham or the new Syrian army to enter the area south of Damascus,' and demanded 'the complete evacuation of southern Syria - in the provinces of Quneitra, Daraa and Sweida - from the forces of the new regime.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2353265	2025-03-04T04:53:54-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-06415860017410928237.jpg
Israeli Occupation Army Admits Failure to Defend 'Kfar Aza' as Se...	An internal investigation by the Israeli occupation military revealed a massive failure in defending the Kfar Aza settlement during the Palestinian resistance’s Operation Al-Aqsa Flood on October 7, 2023. The attack resulted in 62 deaths, 18 injuries, and the capture of 19 Zionist settlers. The report highlighted severe coordination and communication issues among Israeli occupation forces dispatched to the settlement, leading to hesitation in engaging the 250 Palestinian fighters involved in the assault. According to the findings, six members of Al-Qassam Brigades managed to infiltrate the center of Kfar Aza settlement using motorized paragliders without being detected. The Israeli occupation army only regained control of the settlement the following morning, after Palestinian fighters had already withdrawn to Gaza. Furthermore, Israeli airstrikes near Kfar Aza reportedly had no significant impact on the battle’s outcome. A Decade of Military Failure Israeli Channel 14 described the investigation’s findings as merely the 'tip of the iceberg' in what it called an overwhelming military failure. The channel reported that only 10% of the full list of failures had been disclosed to the public, with the rest being too shocking to reveal. The report further noted that this failure was not confined to the events of October 7 but was built over the past decade, becoming deeply entrenched within the Israeli military establishment. The occupation's Military Intelligence Directorate (Aman) admitted that even after extensive investigations, it still lacks full knowledge of armed factions in Gaza. Senior intelligence officials acknowledged that the army entered the war in the south without a comprehensive understanding of its adversary—an alarming reality that explains why Hamas remains operational. Total Breakdown in Security The Zionist military’s investigation concluded with a stark acknowledgment of its 'complete failure' to prevent the October 7 attack on settlements near Gaza. In an official summary shared with the media, the occupying army admitted to failing in its fundamental duty of protecting Israeli settlers. The report stated that the military’s Gaza Division was overwhelmed in the early hours of the attack, allowing Palestinian resistance factions to establish control on the ground. A senior Israeli military official conceded that the army had been 'overconfident' and severely underestimated Hamas’ capabilities before the attack. The investigation detailed that the assault was executed in three waves, involving approximately 5,000 fighters. The first wave consisted of over 1,000 elite Hamas commandos who infiltrated under heavy artillery cover. The second wave involved 2,000 fighters, followed by a third wave of hundreds of combatants accompanied by thousands of civilians. Settlers Reject the Investigation: 'They Left Us to Die' Zionist settlers, particularly those from Kfar Aza, have fiercely criticized the army’s report, arguing that it failed to address fundamental security flaws. 'How can we trust an investigation led by someone who was directly involved in the October 7 events?' they argued. The settlers expressed outrage at the findings, stating that the report merely detailed what happened on the morning of the attack but failed to explain how the situation deteriorated to such a catastrophic level. 'This investigation does not address the collapse of security; it only exposes the army’s arrogance and negligence,' they added. Their frustration boiled over as they recalled the events of that day. 'When you hear the details, you simply cannot believe that the Israeli army operates this way—without leadership, without control,' one settler said. 'When we heard this, we felt sick. They left us to die. They just left us to die.' The settlers are now calling for all military and political leaders in charge on that Black Saturday to take full responsibility and resign.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2353221	2025-03-04T04:14:11-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/04/manar-076749600171378292010.jpg
US President Trump Halts Military Aid to Ukraine Amid Escalating ...	In a move that further escalates tensions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, US President Donald Trump ordered the suspension of all military aid to Ukraine just days after their White House confrontation, Bloomberg reported. A senior US defense official confirmed to the agency that 'all current military assistance to Ukraine has been halted until President Trump determines that the country’s leaders are demonstrating a good-faith commitment to peace.' The official added that 'all US military equipment not yet in Ukraine will be temporarily withheld, including weapons being transported by air and sea, as well as those currently in transit hubs in Poland.' Meanwhile, The Washington Post also reported that the Trump administration is considering ending intelligence-sharing agreements and military training programs with Ukraine. #Trump, #Zelensky engage in a shouting match pic.twitter.com/UlJV6C4RkN — ManarWeb (@WebManar) February 28, 2025 US Vice President: Zelensky Will Eventually Join the Peace Process US Vice President J.D. Vance expressed confidence that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will 'eventually engage in the peace process' initiated by Trump, which Kyiv has rejected due to the lack of security guarantees. 'I don’t really care what President Zelensky says about me or anyone else, but he has clearly refused to engage in the peace process that President Trump has stated is the policy of the American people and their leader,' Vance told Fox News in an interview. 'I don’t think he’s there yet,' he added, 'but I believe he will get there eventually—he has to.' Hope is not a strategy to bring peace to Ukraine.

Trump. pic.twitter.com/Tuitz2ZJ8R — JD Vance (@JDVance) March 4, 2025 Vance’s remarks came after a White House official revealed Monday night that Trump had ordered the freezing of U.S. military aid to Ukraine following the highly publicized altercation between him and Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday, a confrontation that stunned the world. On Monday, Trump warned that the US would 'not tolerate Zelensky’s stance on ceasefire negotiations with Russia for much longer,' following strong European support for the Ukrainian leader. When asked on Fox News whether the White House was still open to Zelensky, Vance responded, 'President Trump has made it clear that the door remains open as long as Zelensky is serious about discussing peace.' 'But you can’t walk into the Oval Office—or anywhere else—and refuse to discuss the details of a peace agreement,' he added, stressing that 'both sides of the war—Russia and Ukraine—will have to make concessions in negotiations to reach a deal.' Vance reaffirmed that when this stance changes, 'as President Trump has said, when they are ready to talk peace, he will be the first to pick up the phone.' Speaking to Fox News, Vance also took another jab at European allies, urging them to be 'realistic' and emphasizing that 'this war cannot go on indefinitely.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2353111	2025-03-04T03:21:56-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-01291970017410868928.jpg
Occupation Forces Unleash Violent Crackdown Across West Bank	In a continued campaign of brutality, Israeli occupation forces have carried out a series of violent raids and attacks across the occupied West Bank, leaving several Palestinians wounded, including two children. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society reported that Israeli forces handed over the body of slain Palestinian Jihad al-Alouna to his family in Jenin. Meanwhile, occupation forces stormed the eastern neighborhood of Jenin, surrounding a house and threatening to bomb the family home if residents did not evacuate. Israeli armored vehicles were also deployed throughout Jenin, sealing off the city's entrances as the destruction of infrastructure in the eastern neighborhood continued, further exacerbating the dire conditions faced by local residents.

Confrontations also erupted in the town of Odla near Nablus, as well as the village of Shuqba near Ramallah. Several individuals, including a 13-year-old and a 15-year-old, were wounded by live ammunition fired by the occupation forces, according to the Red Crescent. The relentless Israeli aggression across the occupied West Bank has led to a rising frequency of injuries and assaults against Palestinians. The regime has continued to carry out extensive raids and mass arrests, targeting dozens, including women, and raiding numerous homes, subjecting residents to abuse, assault, and the destruction of their properties.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2353023	2025-03-04T01:34:03-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-08764070017361619573.jpg
Nahal Oz Base Represents Catastrophic and Painful Systemic Failur...	Israeli media outlets disclosed on Monday more details from the probe into the military and security failure in face of the Palestinian resistance attack on October 7, 2023. 'The organization of commanders and some operatives for the October 7 operation began on Friday at 18:30 and was not detected by any Israeli intelligence agency—not Unit 8200, the Shin Bet, nor the Gaza Division responsible for gathering information within one or two kilometers of the border,' the reports mentioned. 'The operation was swift and coordinated: dozens of armed fighters in the first wave were already in their vehicles, fully prepared near the border by around 6:00, waiting for the green light—a coordinated barrage of 960 rockets and mortar shells launched at 6:29 at Israeli army positions in the Gaza envelope, aiming to paralyze them.' The Israeli media pointed out that the rocket fire served as a signal for Hamas fighters to breach the security fence, which was penetrated in the area opposite Kibbutz Kfar Aza through three infiltration points at 6:35, 6:41, and 6:43. 'Simultaneously, Hamas deployed six elite unit members inside the kibbutz using gliders,' the reports added. 'Hamas gathered intelligence on the Nahal Oz base in the Gaza envelope through drones it regularly launched, in addition to utilizing videos uploaded by soldiers from inside the base on the internet.' The Israeli media added the Nahal Oz camp had been pre-divided, with each elite unit knowing exactly which area it was responsible for capturing. 'The first wave, between 6:30 and 7:00, included 65 of Hamas' top fighters. They were joined by around 50 more in the second wave by 9:00, followed by an additional 100 fighters by 10:00. At the peak of the attack, approximately 250 armed fighters were inside the Nahal Oz camp, which has a perimeter of just 1,200 meters.' Hamas forces that reached the Nahal Oz base were highly equipped, not only enjoying numerical superiority but also possessing more lethal combat capabilities, according to the Israeli reports which added that, while the Israeli army did not see the need to routinely equip its soldiers with grenades or shells, and machine guns were stored in warehouses, Hamas entered the battle with a large number of RPGs, various explosive devices, and significant quantities of Kalashnikov rifles and other weapons. According to the Israeli media reports, five officers from the Golani Brigade's command fled to the military operations room at the Nahal Oz base on October 7th and did not go out to fight. 'Along with them were 17 soldiers. A fire broke out inside the room, killing most of them, and a few managed to escape by breaking a window and fleeing.' Israeli media reports concluded that the battle at the Nahal Oz base represents a catastrophic and painful systemic failure that strikes at the core of the military values of the Israeli army. 'We have lost fundamental principles in defense. Despite the clashes inside the base, there were soldiers and commanders who did not seek to engage with the enemy.' The Israeli occupation army has acknowledged its 'complete failure' to prevent the October 7 attack by Hamas, admitting that it had, for years, underestimated the Palestinian group’s capabilities.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2352891	2025-03-03T10:34:55-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-07523550017410268886.jpg

Israel’s Reported Violations in Gaza Reach Alarming Levels	A comprehensive report by Al-Risala newspaper has revealed that the Israeli occupation has committed a staggering 962 violations of the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip over a 42-day period since its implementation began on January 19, 2025. The report details a disturbing series of incidents that have resulted in the deaths of 98 individuals and injuries to 490 others, calling into question the sustainability of the fragile truce. The documented violations include 77 incidents of gunfire, 45 vehicle incursions into restricted areas, 37 shelling and targeting operations, and numerous air flights by Israeli aircraft. Furthermore, there have been reports of at least five detentions of drivers and fishermen in direct contravention of the agreement’s stipulations. Israeli military vehicles open fire in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip. pic.twitter.com/v9F5yqJka0 — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) March 2, 2025 Despite the ceasefire agreement's intent to foster peace, the report indicates that ‘Israel’ has continually sought justifications to breach the terms, engaging in these actions from the moment the agreement took effect. Significant violations have included the ongoing advancement of military vehicles beyond agreed withdrawal lines, particularly along the Philadelphi axis, resulting in civilian casualties, home demolitions, and land bulldozing. Key areas impacted by these violations include Sultan Junction, Al-Awda neighborhood, and East Al-Maghazi, among others. Additionally, the report highlights a troubling pattern of enforcement against local fishermen, who have faced gunfire and detentions while attempting to work in designated fishing zones. Palestinian Prisoners and Humanitarian Aid Under Siege The report also reveals significant delays in the release of prisoners, a critical aspect of the ceasefire agreement. Palestinian prisoners have endured physical abuse, humiliation, and starvation leading up to their release. Among the many affected, 70-year-old Siham Musa Abu Salem remains imprisoned, highlighting the plight of vulnerable detainees. Families of West Bank prisoners have also faced restrictions, being denied travel to meet their sons deported abroad. The report further emphasizes critical humanitarian violations as the early recovery process remains stalled. The entry of essential fuel has been grossly inadequate, with only 978 trucks allowed into Gaza over 42 days—just 46.5% of the agreed daily amount of 50 trucks. Furthermore, the humanitarian agreement stipulated the entry of 200,000 tents, but only 132,000 have been allowed, with heavy equipment material needed for rubble clearance being severely restricted. Israel has been accused of using starvation as a weapon of war against Palestinian civilians in Gaza following its decision to block all humanitarian aid from entering the enclave. Here’re some reactions to Israel’s move. — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) March 3, 2025 Medical supplies and building materials necessary for the rehabilitation of Gaza’s infrastructure have also been denied entry, compounding the humanitarian crisis. Despite the dire needs, just five ambulances have made it into the region, and the ban on essential goods, including poultry and livestock, persists. Violations extend to the critical Rafah Crossing, where civilian movement has been further restricted. The agreement’s provisions for easing travel and trade have not been implemented, leaving many sick and wounded travelers stranded and without assistance. In the Philadelphi Corridor, promised reductions in Israeli occupation military presence have not materialized, with forces continuing to penetrate deeper into Palestinian territory rather than withdrawing as they committed to do. Politically, there has been a noticeable delay in beginning the second phase of negotiations, despite stipulations in the agreement requiring these discussions to commence 16 days post-signing. Netanyahu rejected the next phase of the ceasefire deal, blocked Gaza aid, and threatened severe consequences. With 962 violations recorded, 116 Gazans killed, and ongoing attacks.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2352440	2025-03-03T00:52:15-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-06424900017377208875.jpg

The Israeli occupation has been ditching ceasefire deal in Gaza as it blocked the entry of humanitarian aid into the besieged strip on Sunday. The occupation reneged on the truce after the first phase of the ceasefire deal ended without agreement on continuing into a second phase. The office of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Sunday it was imposing a blockade on Gaza because Hamas would not accept a plan which it claimed had been put forward by the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to extend phase one of the ceasefire, and postpone phase two, which envisaged an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. 'With the end of phase one of the hostage deal, and in light of Hamas’s refusal to accept the Witkoff outline for continuing talks – to which Israel agreed – Prime Minister Netanyahu has decided that, as of this morning, all entry of goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will cease. Israel will not allow a ceasefire without the release of our hostages,' it said in a statement. 'If Hamas continues its refusal, there will be further consequences.' Remember how many months Biden officials spent telling you Israel wasn’t deliberately blocking aid to Gaza? Yet, somehow, Israel can turn the switch on and off whenever they choose. This is an open, public declaration of the intent to commit a war crime. pic.twitter.com/QyR0aRYY4S — Assal Rad (@AssalRad) March 2, 2025 'Cheap Blackmail' Earlier, the Israeli occupation regime announced it would adopt a US-backed proposal for the extension of the ceasefire in Gaza throughout Ramadan and Passover, in exchange for the release of half of the remaining captives in the enclave. The existence and details of a Witkoff plan had not been confirmed by Washington by Sunday morning. Insisting to adhere to the agreement signed in January, Hamas responded with demands to implement phase two of the deal to reach a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. A statement from Hamas called the suspension of aid a 'war crime' and a violation of the ceasefire agreement. It said Netanyahu’s 'decision to suspend humanitarian aid is cheap blackmail, a war crime and a blatant coup against the [ceasefire] agreement'. 'Israel Bears Responsibility for Captives’ Fate' Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said 'bears responsibility' for the fate of Israeli captives held in Gaza. 'The occupation [Israel] bears responsibility for the consequences of its decision on the population of the Strip and for the fate of its prisoners,' Qassem said in a statement. ⚡️ Hamas official Hazem Qassem regarding ceasefire: •The remaining Israeli prisoners held by the resistance in Gaza will only be released through a prisoner exchange deal resulting from negotiations in the second phase of the ceasefire agreement. •There is an agreement… pic.twitter.com/m4GBUOUYd3 — Warfare Analysis (@warfareanalysis) March 2, 2025 Meanwhile on Sunday, at least four people were martyredby Israeli attacks.

Israeli 'Buffer Zone' in South Lebanon is Much More than Five Occ...	After the Israeli enemy completed its withdrawal from South Lebanon on February 18. 2025. in accordance with the ceasefire agreement in addition to the extended withdrawal timeline, it kept occupation forces in five locations in South Lebanon. The Israeli enemy claimed that the five positions are aimed at securing the Zionist settlements close to the borders with Lebanon. However, the Israeli circles considered that the five posts may be a source of fear for the Zionists because of the expected Hezbollah attacks. Zionist Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Thursday that Israeli occupation forces were 'staying indefinitely' in a buffer zone on the border with Lebanon, adding their deployment there was 'situation-dependent.' Katz use of 'buffer zone' does not match with mere five occupation posts. Thus, Al-Manar reporter Ali Shoeib inspected the border area in order to uncover the aspects of the Zionist remarks. Al-Manar reporter identified swathes of Lebanese territories off the Zionist settlements of Misgav Am, Margaliot and Al-Metula controlled by the enemy through placing earthen barriers and constructing or scraping roads. The reporter located Hounin valley, outskirts of Adaisseh and Kfarkila, and west of Hamames Hills in Khiam barrens. It is worth noting that there are residential buildings in some of the Israeli-held territories. Accordingly, Katz remarks about the 'buffer zone' is much more than mere five posts. It is a major aggression that requires a Lebanese official move to liberate the occupied territories.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2351934	2025-03-01T10:47:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-01793870017408548357.jpeg

Minister of Public Works and Transport, Fayez Rasamny, reflected in a post published via the ministry's X account on his Friday's inspection tour with Prime Minister Nawaf Salam in South Lebanon. 'We witnessed firsthand the immense destruction in the war-ravaged villages of southern Lebanon. The scale of devastation is staggering, yet equally powerful is the unwavering resilience of the people. Their dignified perseverance is the very foundation upon which we will rebuild and move forward.' 'The very air of the south carries the scent of history—one of resilience and pride,' he added, 'It stirs the soul and awakens within us a profound sense of belonging and responsibility.' In southern Lebanon, sacrifice and steadfastness are not just words but lived experiences, and patriotism is not an abstract notion but a tangible force that keeps this land standing tall despite its wounds, Rasamny said. 'We reaffirm our full commitment to standing by you, dedicating every available resource to support your recovery. You are the heartbeat of this land, and with your determination, it will rise again—stronger, more vibrant, and more beautiful than before. You will not face this journey alone; hope endures even in the face of adversity, and a brighter future awaits our beloved South and cherished Lebanon. Rasamny also called on all Lebanese to visit the south and witness its reality with their own eyes. 'A true understanding of the suffering and sacrifices of southerners comes only from standing among them. The south is more than just geography; it is a testament to resilience and dignity, a story that deserves to be seen, honored, and told.' #Minister_of_Public_Works_and_Transport, Fayez Rasamny: During today’s inspection tour with #Prime_Minister #Nawaf_Salam, alongside my esteemed colleagues, the Ministers of Environment and Energy, we witnessed firsthand the immense destruction in the #war-ravaged villages of… pic.twitter.com/lngSgHwMWV — Ministry of Public Works and Transport - Lebanon (@mopwleb) February 28, 2025 Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam toured southern Lebanon on Friday to assess the situation following the Israeli aggression against the country.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2351725	2025-03-01T06:17:09-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-03257080017408384607.png

In a personal and unprecedented interview, the family of martyred Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah shared memories of loss and pride in an exclusive episode aired by Al-Manar TV on Friday, hosted by Manar Sabbagh. Titled 'Sayyed,' the broadcast was more than a tribute—it was a testament to a leader whose presence shaped the very course of resistance. With raw emotion, Sayyed Jawad Nasrallah spoke of his father’s unwavering defiance against tyranny: 'Till his last breath, he fought for justice.' His voice carried both grief and pride, reflecting the sacrifice that defined Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah’s life. Through their words, his essence came alive—his strength, his tenderness, his unyielding resolve.

Hamas Calls on Palestinians to Defend Al-Aqsa Mosque During Holy ...	The Palestinian resistance group Hamas has called on all Palestinians to mount a 'large mobilization' and resist Israeli restrictions on the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem during the holy month of Ramadan. In a statement published on the Palestinian resistance group's Telegram channel on Saturday, senior Hamas member Abdul Rahman Shadid issued a call to action, urging Palestinians to converge on the courtyard of the sacred site throughout the Muslim fasting month. He emphasized that Palestinians 'must not surrender to the restrictions of the occupiers. We must confront them with all our strength and adhere to our historical and religious right to the blessed mosque.' Shadid called for 'roaring crowds' to protect the al-Aqsa Mosque compound all through Ramadan. Hamas condemned the Israeli police's decision to limit the number of worshippers allowed to attend Friday prayers at Al-Aqsa to just 10,000, describing it as 'a new escalation against the Palestinian people and their holy sites' and a 'blatant violation of all conventions and religious laws.' The Gaza-based movement warned the Israeli regime against 'proceeding with such measures,' holding it fully responsible for any escalation that may occur. Hamas also called on the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the international community to 'take serious action to stop the crimes and violations of the occupation against Al-Aqsa Mosque.' The movement called on the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the international community to 'take serious action to stop the crimes and violations of the occupation against al-Aqsa Mosque and to ensure that the Palestinian people can freely practice their religious rituals there.' Hamas finally urged Palestinians across the West Bank, al-Quds and elsewhere in the occupied territories to 'intensify their presence at al-Aqsa Mosque, engage in worship and seclusion there during Ramadan, and confront all attempts by the occupation and extremists to desecrate or impose control over the mosque.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2351670	2025-03-01T05:05:49-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/05/manar-006365600165174177010.jpg
Kurdistan Workers’ Party Declares Ceasefire with Turkey After 40-...	The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has announced an immediate ceasefire, marking a significant step towards ending its four-decade-long insurgency against the Turkish state. The announcement came on Saturday, following a call by the group's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, for disarmament. Ocalan's appeal, which was triggered by an unexpected proposal in October from an ultra-nationalist ally of President Tayyip Erdogan, has been welcomed by the United States, the European Union, and other Western allies, as well as by Turkiye's neighbors, Iraq and Iran. 'In order to pave the way for the implementation of leader Apo's call for peace and democratic society, we are declaring a ceasefire effective from today,' the PKK stated, according to the Firat news agency. The group affirmed that it 'fully agree[s] with the content of the call and state[s] that, from our front, we will heed the necessities of the call and implement it.' #عاجل | حزب العمال الكوردستاني PKK يعلن وقف إطلاق النار مع تركيا، ويؤكد التزامه الكامل بمضمون رسالة أوجلان الداعية لنزع السلاح وحل التنظيم. pic.twitter.com/qFzkS5UDD1 — الوضع الكوردي ‎Rewşa Kurda (@rewsakurda) March 1, 2025 Who is Abdullah Öcalan? Abdullah Öcalan, also known as 'Apo,' is the founder of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). In 1979, he went to Syria to prepare for the Kurdish independence war. He established the PKK’s headquarters in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley. After the military coup in Turkey in 1980, many activists followed him to the PKK camps there. In 1998, Öcalan was forced to leave Syria under pressure from Ankara. This was followed by a journey in which no country was willing to accept him. Finally, he was arrested by Turkish intelligence in 1999 in the Kenyan capital Nairobi. In Turkey, Öcalan was sentenced to death for high treason and founding a separatist terrorist organization. The sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. Since then, Öcalan has been held in solitary confinement in a prison on the island of Imrali in the Sea of Marmara near Istanbul. His family and lawyers were rarely allowed to visit him. After nearly ten years, Ocalan received a delegation from the pro-Kurdish opposition party in his prison at the end of last year 2024. Ocalan is now 76 years old, and despite not appearing in public since 1999, he still enjoys great confidence among his supporters. The move marks a significant development in the long-standing conflict, which has claimed more than 40,000 lives since the PKK launched its armed campaign in 1984. The group, now headquartered in the mountains of northern Iraq, has expressed hope that Ankara would release Ocalan, who has been held in near-total isolation since 1999, so he could oversee the disarmament process. However, the Turkish government has reiterated that it will not engage in negotiations with the PKK and has insisted that all Kurdish armed groups, including those operating in Iraq and Syria, must disarm. The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which Ankara considers an extension of the PKK, have clarified that Ocalan's call does not apply to them. The initiative's success will hinge on the establishment of the necessary political and democratic conditions, as emphasized by the PKK. The pro-Kurdish DEM party has urged the Turkish government to take concrete steps towards democratization, stating that its response will be decisive. If the ceasefire holds and the disarmament process is successfully implemented, the move could have far-reaching regional implications, potentially bringing an end to a conflict that has long been a source of instability in the region.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2351604	2025-03-01T04:06:09-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-08901450017408307629.jpg
US Green Lights $3 Billion Arms Deal with ‘Israel’ Amid Stalled C...	The United States has approved a massive $3 billion arms sale to Israel, even as ceasefire negotiations remain stalled between the two sides. The deal, authorized by US. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, includes a wide range of military equipment, from munitions and warheads to bulldozers and other hardware. The largest portion of the agreement, valued at $2.04 billion, comprises 35,529 MK 84 or BLU-117 general-purpose bomb bodies and 4,000 I-2000 penetrator warheads. An additional $675.7 million package includes MK 83 and BLU-110 bomb bodies, along with JDAM guidance kits, with deliveries expected to begin in 2028. The State Department just approved $3.01 billion in Arms sales to Israel. $2.04 Billion in bombs $675.7 Million in bombs and weapon guidance kits $295 Million in bulldozers Congressional review was waived as 'an emergency exists that requires the immediate sale.' pic.twitter.com/z9oG3yhV95 — Sulaiman Ahmed (@ShaykhSulaiman) February 28, 2025 ‘Israel’ will also receive D9R and D9T Caterpillar bulldozers under the $295 million agreement, with deliveries scheduled for 2027. Rubio claimed an 'emergency exists' that requires the 'immediate sale' of these defense articles to ‘Israel’, waiving the usual congressional approval process. The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) stated that the sale is 'vital to US national interests' and will 'assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability.' This latest arms deal follows the US approval earlier this month of more than $7.4 billion in bombs, missiles, and related equipment for Israel, which utilized American-made weaponry during its devastating war on the Gaza Strip. The announcement comes amid growing concerns over civilian casualties and as former President Donald Trump recently floated his controversial 'Gaza takeover' scheme, which includes displacing more than two million Palestinians and turning the enclave into the 'Riviera of the Middle East' under US control.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2351417	2025-03-01T01:02:35-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-06799360017408196984.jpg

Trump and Zelensky Meeting Devolves into Shouting Match over Ukra...	A remarkable shouting match broke out in the Oval Office on Friday between President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, who was hoping to appeal to the US for continued security assistance during his trip to Washington. Raising their voices, Trump and Zelensky — along with the Vice President JD Vance — engaged in a tense back-and-forth about the nature of US support, and whether Zelensky had demonstrated enough gratitude. 'You’re not really in good position right now,' Trump scolded Zelensky, raising his voice. 'You’re gambling with World War III,' the US president went on. Vance called Zelensky 'disrespectful' for trying to litigate the conflict in public. Trump and Zelensky are expected to sign an agreement granting Washington access to Ukraine’s natural resources. The idea of a deal involving Ukraine’s rare-earths was first floated by Zelensky last autumn, and the US president took him up on the offer earlier this month. There was some back-and-forth over the past few weeks, with the Ukrainian leader apparently attempting to secure more favorable terms. The minerals deal is expected to provide a general framework and confirm the two nations’ intent to create a special joint fund to be followed up by a series of separate documents, stipulating the details. #Trump, #Zelensky engage in a shouting match pic.twitter.com/UlJV6C4RkN — ManarWeb (@WebManar) February 28, 2025	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2351296	2025-02-28T10:32:34-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-04735970017407675364.png

Israeli Army Probe Reveals ‘Complete Failure’ in Preventing Octob...	The Israeli occupation army has acknowledged its 'complete failure' to prevent the October 7 attack by Hamas, admitting that it had, for years, underestimated the Palestinian group’s capabilities. The summary of an Israeli army investigation, published on Thursday, said it 'failed in its mission to protect Israeli civilians'. 'October 7 was a complete failure, the military failed in fulfilling its mission to protect Israeli 'civilians',' a senior Israeli army official told reporters following the publication of the investigation. 'Too many civilians died that day asking themselves in their hearts or out loud, where was the army?' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The probe said the perception that Hamas was not interested in a full-scale conflict and that 'Israel' would have ample warning in case of an attack went unchallenged for years, resulting in a lack of preparedness and ability to respond to an attack. It also found that 'Israel' had focused its intelligence and military efforts on other fronts, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, and relied too heavily 'on intelligence, barriers, and defensive measures alone', and was thus caught by surprise. There have been widespread calls for Benjamin Netanyahu to resign. The incident had already resulted in the resignation of Israeli spy chief Aharon Haliva in 2024. In January, Israeli top general Herzi Halevi also resigned, citing 'terrible' security and intelligence 'failures' that led to the attack. The Zionist army’s southern command Yaron Finkelman also resigned. 'I embrace it, the responsibility is mine, I was the commander of the army on October 7th, I bear my own responsibility, and I also bear the full responsibility for all of you. And I acknowledge in every subordinate of mine who made a mistake, as part of my own [mistake],' Halevi had said.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2351021	2025-02-28T03:54:12-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/10/manar-04948830016967569526.jpg

‘Israel’ Starts New Phase of Escalation in South Syria: Preparati...	The Israeli occupation has begun a new phase of escalation in Syria’s south, in preparation for indirectly annexing it, echoing the escalation taking place in the West Bank, Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar reported on Thursday. The paper said the escalation in south Syria has been through several paths, 'some under the pretext of 'protecting minorities,' and others through the de facto authority that it imposes by force.' The move comes after 'After destroying most of the Syrian Army’s capabilities following the collapse ex-president Bashar al-Assad’s regime on December 8, and after occupying the demilitarized zone in southern Syria, including its strategic heights and fresh water sources,' Al-Akhbar reported. If completed, this means that the Zionist entity will grab three governorates: Sweida, Daraa and Quneitra, according to the report. Meanwhile, the new Syrian administration, led by the transitional president Ahmad Al-Sharaa, keeps mum after the man repeatedly voiced unwillingness to engage in any confrontation with the Israeli occupation, the Lebanese daily added. The escalation comes as the Israeli occupation continues to carry out aerial attacks on Syria, with strikes being reported late Tuesday on Daraa, Sweida, and the outskirts of Damascus. On the other hand, the Israeli occupation has been building military outposts and bases in the so-called demilitarized buffer zone with Syria, amid several attempts of ground advance in the nearby area. In parallel with the direct and indirect military control over southern Syria, the Israeli occupation forces began expanding contact channels with the residents of those areas, offering financial incentives by securing job opportunities in the occupied territories, in an effort to link the economy of the south to the occupation authorities, and to strengthen the latter's control over this region, by all means, according to the paper. Meanwhile on Thursday, Zionist Defense Minister Israel Katz said that Israeli occupation forces were 'staying indefinitely' in the so-called buffer zones in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza. Earlier this week, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said that the Zionist entity will not allow Syria’s new army or the insurgent group that led the ouster of Al-Assad to 'enter the area south of Damascus.' Israeli Prime Minister #Satanyahu stated that Israeli forces will remain in Syria's buffer zone, specifically on Mount Hermon for ‘an unlimited period of time’ Israel will demand disarmament of Syrian army in southern Syria, will not 'tolerate any threat to Druze community' pic.twitter.com/Dq98MR4E4t — Owner Of Al-Quds (@_Alone_Warrior_) February 24, 2025	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2350449	2025-02-27T06:21:20-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-02684300017406657368.jpg
Israeli Troops Will Remain in Lebanon, Syria, Gaza 'Buffer Zones'...	Zionist Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Thursday that Israeli occupation forces were 'staying indefinitely' in a buffer zone on the border with Lebanon, adding their deployment there was 'situation-dependent.' 'There is a buffer zone (on the border with Lebanon), it wasn’t easy but I stood my ground, and we received a green light from the United States, we gave them a map, and we are staying indefinitely — this is situation-dependent, not time-dependent,' Katz said at a conference, according to a statement issued by his office. It is worth noting that the Zionist enemy completed its withdrawal from South Lebanon on February 18, 2025, keeping five occupation positions in Mount Jal Al-Deir (Aitaroun), Al-Hamames Hill (Al-Khiam), Mount Blat (between Ramyah and Marwaheen), Houla-Markaba Main Road, and Al-Labbouneh Hill (Outskirts of Naqoura and Alma Al-Shaab). Southern Syria Katz also pointed out that southern Syria must remain demilitarized at all costs — and that 'Israel' will ensure that it does. 'Joulani came to power in Syria, traded in his trousers for suits, and he speaks well. We don’t trust him. We trust only the IDF,' the minister stated. Gaza Israeli Defense Minister added that the Philadelphi Corridor on the border between Gaza and Egypt will remain a 'buffer zone.' 'The Philadelphi Corridor will remain a buffer zone just like the borders with Lebanon and Syria,' Katz said. 'Israel' is scheduled to start withdrawing from the 14-kilometer (8.69-mile) corridor on Saturday under a Gaza ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement with Hamas. An Israeli official, however, confirmed Thursday that Tel Aviv will not withdraw from the corridor on Saturday. 'We will not leave the Philadelphi Corridor,' the public broadcaster KAN quoted the official as saying. He said Israel will not allow Hamas 'to again roam our borders with pickup trucks and guns, and we will not allow them to rearm through smuggling.' The Israeli army captured the corridor during its genocidal war on Gaza, which has killed more than 48,300 people, mostly women and children, and left the enclave in ruins. The Israeli war was brought to a halt under the ceasefire agreement, which took hold in Gaza on Jan. 19. Last November, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. 'Israel' also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2350394	2025-02-27T05:32:48-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-05414040017322736387.jpg
Website Publishes List of Canadian Israelis who Served in the IOF	The non-profit news website The Maple published a list of 85 Canadians with Israeli citizenship who have served in the Israeli occupation army. The website announced that this is the initial list and that it intends to publish additional lists of additional Canadians that have joined the Israeli military. The article, entitled 'Meet 85 Canadians That Have Fought For Israel,' featured in online publication The Maple provides a link to the list. NEW: I created a database containing profiles of 85 Canadians that have fought in the Israeli military. This is the largest such collection of names and stories in Canada, by far. — Davide Mastracci (@DavideMastracci) February 24, 2025 According to the article, its purpose is to provide a database of 'mini-profiles for as many Canadians that have fought in the Israeli military at any point as I could find,' said its author, because 'there is little existing research in Canada beyond one-off news articles about who these soldiers are and how they came to make the life choices that they did.' The list has sparked anger by Israeli circles, with Israeli Channel 14 describing the move a 'scandal'. 'I don’t think it’s an acceptable thing to happen in Canada,' Rebecca Garner, who served in the IDF from 2011 to 2014, and whose name was enrolled in the list, told the National Post, a Canadian English-language broadsheet newspaper.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2350306	2025-02-27T02:08:57-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-09000340017314003295.jpg

The statement highlights that the enemy’s false excuses have been rendered invalid, and now they 'have no choice but to commence.'
