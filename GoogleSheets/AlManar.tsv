PA, Hamas Agree to Form Committee to Run Post-War Gaza: Report	The Palestinian Authority and Hamas have signed a document agreeing to form a joint committee that would run the post-war Gaza Strip, Al-Araby Al-Jadeed Arab news site reported on Tuesday. The report said it has a copy of the document that was signed to formulate the committee, to be made of 10-15 leading Palestinian figures. It comes a day after Egypt’s foreign minister said that rival Palestinian groups Fatah and Hamas were in Cairo for talks seeking to bring post-war Gaza. The talks are part of Egypt’s broader mediation efforts to broker a ceasefire between the Zionist entity and the Hamas resistance group and to expand humanitarian access to the enclave. Displaced Palestinians line up to receive food at a distribution center in Gaza's Deir Al-Balah (November 26, 2024). The document laid out six commitments largely designed to unite the West Bank and Gaza under one political entity. They would be responsible for overseeing health and economic services, agriculture and vital infrastructure. Meanwhile on Tuesday, Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar reported that an Israeli delegation is to visit Cairo in the coming days for talks on more details regarding a potential captive and ceasefire deal between Hamas and the Zionist entity.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2282953	2024-12-02T23:27:28-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-02514580017267356425.jpeg
US Says Ceasefire Holding: Washington 'Hasn’t Determined if Israe...	The US State Department said on Monday that the ceasefire between the Zionist entity and Hezbollah is thus far 'successful, broadly speaking,' adding that Washington has not 'determined' if Tel Aviv violated the ceasefire. 'The ceasefire is holding,' Matthew Miller, the department’s spokesman, told reporters at the daily press briefing, after the Israeli enemy staged airstrikes on several areas across south Lebanon earlier on Monday. The ceasefire, brokered by the United States and France, has 'been successful in stopping the fighting and getting us on a path where we are not seeing the daily loss of life that we had seen for two months prior,' the spokesman added. Miller said that violations were expected, especially in the opening weeks 'when things are very fragile.' The ceasefire agreement, which took effect on Wednesday (November 27), contains a mechanism for reporting potential violations and for the ways that Washington and Paris will respond to them, he said. That mechanism will become more formalized in the coming days, the spokesman noted. 'When we get reports of potential violations, we have a mechanism that we put in place with the government of France to look at those potential violations, determine if they are in fact, violations, and then engage with the parties to ensure that they aren't repeated,' Miller said. Later on Monday, Miller said that Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, and the two discussed developments in Gaza and Lebanon. Blinken pointed to the 'importance of bringing all of the hostages home and ending the war in Gaza,' while stressing the 'importance' of implementing the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon. .@SecBlinken spoke with Israeli Minister Dermer. He urged further actions to improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza and discussed the importance of bringing all the hostages home and ending the war in Gaza. — Matthew Miller (@StateDeptSpox) December 3, 2024	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2282898	2024-12-02T22:52:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-000527100173320868410.jpg
Our Commitment to UN Resolution 1701 is Conditioned by Israel’s C...	Hezbollah Political Council Deputy Chief Mahmoud Komati underlined the contradiction between the US-Israeli calls for separating Lebanon's and Gaza's dossiers and the current endeavor to link the hostage deal with the Lebanese front. In a TV interview, Komati indicated that Hezbollah's resistance and political activity are very powerful politically, adding that the Resistance is not in need of any military or security action in order to preserve the political participation. Komati mentioned that Hezbollah resorted to silence about the Zionist violations, yet the enemy escalated its attacks, which made the Resistance response very necessary. We clearly said that Hezbollah's commitment to the UN Resolution 1701 is conditioned by the Israeli commitment too, he reiterated. Komati stressed that the Lebanese Army possesses the patriotic will to fight the enemy, yet lacks the weaponry needed for that mission. The Islamic Resistance carried out on Monday its first attack on Zionist military sites since the ceasefire took into effect last Wednesday, November 27, 2024, targeting Ruwaisat Al-Alam occupation post in KfarShuba Hills area. In a blatant violation of the ceasefire and the Lebanese sovereignty, the Israeli enemy escalated Monday its attacks on South Lebanon and Bekaa, leaving ten martyr, five injuries, and materialistic losses.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2282821	2024-12-02T15:48:58-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-010160400173318333210.png

In a blatant violation of the ceasefire and the Lebanese sovereignty, the Israeli enemy escalated Monday its attacks on South Lebanon and Bekaa, leaving one martyr, two injuries, and materialistic losses. The Zionist escalation started in South Lebanon with machine gun bursts fired by the Israeli army towards safe houses in the town of Naqoura, in a scene that reflects the persistence in targeting civilians and infrastructure. This was followed by an airstrike on the town of Ainata near the municipality building, injuring a citizen in the Bint Jbeil-Maroun al-Ras triangle area. A Zionist drone bombed a motorcycle near the Marjeyoun power station, killing one person according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health. In a statement, the directorate called the attack 'a blatant violation of the cease-fire agreement,' and 'a dangerous escalation.'

Al-Manar correspondent reported that 'after the withdrawal of 6 Merkava tanks this morning from the eastern and southern neighborhoods of the city of Khiyam towards the Al-Wata area, the withdrawal of an additional number of vehicles, including tanks, was observed.' Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, for his part, asked the committee supervising the cease-fire with Israel to oblige Tel Aviv to stop its violations of the deal and withdraw from the Lebanese territories. Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported that the US administration warned 'Israel' against the cease-fire violations, adding that the presidential envoy Amos Hochstein notified Tel Aviv officials that the deal is being violated by the Zionist side. For his part, the French foreign minister Jean Noel Barrot told his Zionist counterpart Gideon Saar about the necessity of stopping the ceasefire violations. On Nov. 27, a cease-fire agreement between Lebanon and Israel took effect, ending over 14 months of fighting between the Israeli army and Hezbollah. Lebanese media reported around 73 Israeli violations of the cease-fire deal since it came into force last week, turning it to be a mere ease-fire.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2282623	2024-12-02T07:09:14-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-04391680017331520878.jpg
US-Israeli Captive Confirmed Dead, IOF Announces	The Israeli occupation military confirmed Monday that an Israeli American soldier, previously believed to have been captured alive by Hamas during its Oct. 7, 2023 attack against the Zionist entity, is now presumed dead. Capt. Omer Neutra, 21, a New York native who enlisted in the Israeli military, was captured when Hamas fighters attacked the occupation settlements in Gaza enclave. It was previously thought he was being held hostage since then, but officials have announced it is thought he was killed on the day of the Hamas attack and his body was then taken into the Gaza Strip. Believing their son to be alive, the soldier's parents, Ronen and Orna Neutra, led a public campaign for over a year, speaking at rallies in both 'Israel' and the U.S., addressing the Republican National Convention, and maintaining contact with the Biden administration in a bid to secure his release. Hamas is still holding approximately 100 hostages inside Gaza, with at least a third believed to be dead. The Biden administration is renewing its push for a ceasefire and the release of the remaining captives after nearly a year of stalled negotiations between 'Israel' and Hamas. The situation remains dire, but diplomats see a glimmer of hope following a recent ceasefire between 'Israel' and Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based resistance group allied with Hamas.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2282568	2024-12-02T06:38:47-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-04473770017331503025.png

Palestinian Resistance Drives Israeli Occupation Troops Out of Na...	In a major setback for the Israeli occupation, its forces were forced to withdraw from the eastern part of Nablus in the northern West Bank after confronting fierce resistance from Palestinian fighters. The al-Quds Brigades and al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, both based in Nablus, claimed responsibility for the clashes that erupted as Israeli occupation troops tried to storm the city. The Palestinian fighters engaged the Israeli forces with heavy gunfire and explosive devices, thwarting their incursion. According to local sources, over 20 Israeli military vehicles, accompanied by bulldozers, had entered Nablus on Sunday evening from the Awarta and Beit Furik checkpoints, apparently to secure access for Israeli settlers to the nearby Joseph's Tomb. However, the determined resistance from the Palestinian factions forced the Israelis to pull out after hours of intense confrontations.

Before departing Tehran, Araghchi expressed confidence in Syria’s ability to overcome these challenges, stating, 'The Syrian army will once again triumph over the terrorists.' He further criticized the roles of external actors, asserting, 'The United States, the Zionist entity, and Takfiri groups have shown they are aligned in their objectives, but their actions will ultimately fail, as they have before.' The discussions underscore the close coordination between Syria and Iran in addressing shared security concerns and maintaining regional stability. The Syrian President expressed gratitude for Iran's unwavering support, extending his greetings to Ayatollah Khamenei and Iranian President Pezeshkian, acknowledging the strong bonds between the two nations. President Assad lauded Iran’s steadfast commitment to regional stability and security, particularly in supporting Syria’s ongoing battle against terrorism. He emphasized the importance of collective regional efforts to eradicate the scourge of terrorism, noting that its persistence benefits only the enemies of Muslim nations, especially the Israeli regime.

He affirmed that the visit reflects Iran’s strong message of support for the countries in the resistance front as they confront the challenges posed by the Israeli regime.

With heads held high, the people of the resistance are triumphantly returning to their homes after the Islamic Resistance secured a significant victory against Israeli forces during 66 days of aggression on Lebanon. The assault left widespread destruction across southern villages, the Bekaa Valley, and Beirut’s southern suburbs (Dahiyeh). According to the latest statistics released by the Ministry of Health last Thursday, the Israeli aggression claimed the lives of 3,961 people and left 16,520 others injured. Life is gradually resuming in the areas affected by the Israeli occupation aggression as displaced families return after being forcibly uprooted by the brutal Israeli crimes and massacres against unarmed civilians. Businesses, pharmacies, bakeries, and cafés are reopening, while specialized teams and municipalities work tirelessly to clear debris and reopen roads. As they return, residents honor the memory of the martyrs, whether fallen in heroic battles or through Israeli occupation bombardments of homes. Many visited cemeteries to recite prayers for the souls of those who gave their lives during the conflict. Beirut's Dahiyeh Alive Again In Beirut’s southern suburbs (Dahiyeh), the resilience of the resistance community stands in sharp contrast to the disarray within Netanyahu's government, which struggles to encourage settlers to return to northern occupied territories.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has condemned the atrocities and disasters unfolding in the region, attributing them to the backing of the United States and certain European countries. He called on Islamic nations to prevent the US and Israeli occupation from exploiting the conflict in Syria. Speaking with optimism, President Pezeshkian expressed hope that Islamic countries would step in to resolve the Syrian crisis and not allow external powers to manipulate the situation again. He emphasized the need to address the nation's challenges through strength and expertise. In a separate address to the Iranian Islamic Consultative Assembly on Parliament Day, the president highlighted his administration's efforts to improve foreign relations, particularly with neighboring countries. 'In the short time since the formation of our government, we have engaged in dialogue with our neighbors, sharing our perspectives and policies,' he stated. President Pezeshkian also affirmed that the Islamic Republic has no intention of escalating wars or bloodshed. 'Those who perpetuate war and violence in this region and across the world are the very ones who claim to champion peace, human rights, and humanity,' he asserted. He criticized the hypocrisy of nations capable of leveraging science and technology to bomb children and women in hospitals and schools. 'In this war, over 10,000 innocent children have been martyred. The global community witnesses these atrocities in silence, and this silence is disgraceful,' he added. President Pezeshkian held the United States and European countries responsible for the catastrophes in the region, citing their support for Israel and extremist groups. He reaffirmed that Iran 'has never and will never covet the territory of any nation in the region.' He further noted a positive shift in regional dynamics, highlighting that for the first time, all nations in the region collectively condemned Israeli aggression against Iran. 'We express our gratitude to our neighboring countries for their unified stance,' Pezeshkian concluded.

Speaking at a Navy Day event, he announced his visit to Damascus to deliver a message of solidarity, emphasizing, 'We strongly back the Syrian government and military.' He equated the Zionist entity with Takfiri terrorists, stating, 'After Israel's failures, the enemy now seeks to destabilize the region through these terrorist groups.' Araghchi expressed confidence in Syria's victory over the militants, as in previous battles. Highlighting the synergy between diplomacy and defense, Araghchi stressed, 'Diplomacy without power is ineffective. As a diplomat, I rely on Iran's internal strengths, including its defensive capabilities.' He concluded, 'Diplomacy is a cost-effective path, but it depends on national power for success.' He also addressed the region's turmoil, accusing Takfiri forces of operating under U.S. leadership in a bid to advance its strategic goals.

Over 40 consecutive days, Civil Defense efforts in northern Gaza have been forcibly suspended due to continuous Israeli targeting, leaving thousands without vital humanitarian or medical assistance. Since October 7, 2023, the Israeli occupation army, with unwavering US support, has been carrying out a campaign of genocide in Gaza, resulting in over 145,000 Palestinian casualties, primarily women and children, and leaving more than 10,000 people missing. The destruction has led to widespread famine, claiming the lives of countless children and elderly, while the region endures a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2282018	2024-12-01T01:29:30-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-07394750017330449847.jpg

Sheikh Qassem: Hezbollah’s Victory Surpasses That in 2006, Resist...	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem addressed on Friday the nation two days after the ceasefire took into effect and ended a two-month Zionist war on Lebanon, stressing that we are witnessing a major victory. Sheikh Qassem stressed that Hezbollah achieved a victory that is greater than that reached in 2006 despite all the sacrifices made and the Western support to the Israeli enemy, adding that we emerged triumphant because we prevented the enemy from eradicating the Resistance. When we launched the support front, we reiterated that we do not seek war but are ready for it if imposed by the 'Israeli' enemy, Sheikh Qassem said. His eminence added that the occupation built its plans 64 days ago based on eradicating Hezbollah, letting the northern settlers to return home, and establishing a new Middle East, adding that 'Israel' anticipated achieving its objectives in a short time after targeting our leadership system and the capabilities we possessed. Sheikh Qassem indicated that Hezbollah managed to remain steadfast on the frontlines and began striking the enemy's internal front, placing 'Israel' in a significant defensive position, noting that, during this war, the number of displaced in 'Israel' has grown from 70,000 to hundreds of thousands. According to Hezbollah leader, the Resistance has proven its readiness, with the plans set by His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah being effective and accounting for all developments. 'The occupation bet on internal discord with the hosts, but this gamble failed due to cooperation among sects and factions. The legendary and sacrificial [Martyrdom-Seeking] steadfastness of the fighters astonished the world, terrified the Israeli army, and sowed despair among the enemy.' 'We declare that, as a result of the 'The Formidable in Might' battle, we are witnessing a great victory because we prevented the enemy from destroying Hezbollah, weakening the Resistance, and forced the enemy to justify itself to its public,' Sheikh Qassem said. 'The Resistance has endured and will continue; this victory belongs to everyone who contributed to it, whether through bullets, martyrdom, wounds, prayers, words, or support. This victory is for every honorable and free individual who supported the Resistance and condemned the Israeli aggression.' Hezbollah leader affirmed, 'Defeat surrounds the enemy from all sides. A ceasefire and cessation of aggression have been agreed upon. This agreement is not a treaty or a new accord requiring signatures from states; rather, it is a set of procedural implementations of Resolution 1701, focusing on the area south of the Litani River.' Sheikh Qassem stressed that the coordination between the Resistance and the Lebanese Army will be of the highest level to ensure the implementation of this agreement, adding that no one should bet on any disagreement between us and the army; this agreement falls under the framework of Lebanese sovereignty. 'We thank Allah for our victory, and we express gratitude and pride in the Resistance fighters on the ground who humiliated the enemy and confronted it with legendary resilience. We extend our thanks to our great martyrs who paved the way for strength and dignity—every one of our martyrs is great because they transcended this world and rejected humiliation.' Hezbollah leader underscored that the central focus of the agreement today is south of the Litani River, affirming the withdrawal of the 'Israeli army' from all areas it has occupied. His eminence voiced gratitude to the Master of the Nation’s Martyrs for being the spark of victory and paving this path, alongside your companion, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, saluting the wounded, civil defense teams, and heartfelt respect and thanks to our people—the most honorable and purest. We honor your sacrifices and the martyrdom of your loved ones in the field of honor, and we deeply appreciate the displaced and those whose homes were destroyed, his eminence said. Sheikh Qassem also thanked the steadfast and resistant political negotiator, Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, Prime Minister Najib Mikati for his efforts, the leadership of the army and security forces, and the honorable media. His eminence expressed gratitude to the Islamic Republic of Iran and its leader, Imam Khamenei, for his guidance, support, and adherence to the path of Imam Khomeini, as well as to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the martyr Hajj Qassem Soleimani, who laid the foundations and contributed significantly, and to the compassionate Iranian people. 'We will work with our people to rebuild and restore, focusing in this phase on dignified shelter. We will also cooperate with the state, all organizations, and countries willing to assist Lebanon in making it even more beautiful than before.' Our national efforts will involve collaboration and dialogue with political forces that believe the homeland belongs to everyone, according to Sheikh Qassem who added, 'We will prioritize completing constitutional institutions, particularly ensuring the timely election of a president.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2281336	2024-11-29T10:50:04-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-05116920017329061932.jpg
Israeli Enemy Violates Ceasefire, Opens Fire at Civilians in Sout...	Since the ceasefire took into effect early Wednesday, the Israeli enemy has been repeatedly violating its stipulations, opening fire at civilians and destroying properties. The Zionist violations have been accompanied by arrogant media publications which try to impose a new reality that contradicts with the Israeli military failure in face of Hezbollah fighters during the war. The Lebanese government that signed the agreement is requested today to put an end to these violations before the enemy goes too far, which entails the Lebanese people to move again in face of the Zionist aggression. In this regard, the Israeli occupation forces opened fire at a funeral in Khiam, pushing its tanks to the western side of the town.

For the 37th day, the occupation forces continue to forcibly disrupt the work of civil defense in the areas of northern Gaza Strip due to the ongoing Israeli targeting and aggression, where thousands of citizens there have become without humanitarian and medical care.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280346	2024-11-28T05:29:08-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-01811800017257986296.png
Israeli Enemy Breaches Ceasefire in South Lebanon, Attacks Citize...	The Israeli enemy violated the ceasefire on Thursday, shelling several towns across the border with occupied Palestine and inflicting casualties among the Lebanese citizens. Al-Manar correspondent reported that Israeli drone strike injured three citizens in the border town of Markaba.

Such remarks were echoed by the Israeli army radio, which said that the Israeli shelling of the Lebanese border towns aims at driving residents away from the so-called 'restricted area.' For its part, the Lebanese Army called on residents of Taybe to leave the town following the Israeli drone strike. In a statement, Lebanon’s national army announced it has started 'to assume missions in south Lebanon, Bekaa and Beirut’s Dahiyeh (southern suburb), in parallel with boosting deployment south of Litani River.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280313	2024-11-28T05:02:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-087013400173279888710.jpeg
Egyptian Team Visits ‘Israel’ to Present ‘Comprehensive Vision’ f...	An Egyptian security delegation is reportedly expected to arrive in Tel Aviv in the coming hours in an effort to reach a Gaza captive and ceasefire deal. According to Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar, the Cairo officials are expected to present a 'comprehensive vision' for an agreement, amid optimism that a deal can be reached in the wake of ceasefire with Lebanon. The report said the plan calls for a truce that will initially last a month or two and will see the gradual release of Israeli captives held in Gaza, with first priority given to older captives or those who are sick. Concurrently, 'broader and longer discussions will take place, without military pressure on the ground,' the report added. Egyptian officials will request that Hamas be given a period of several days after the truce begins in order to provide a list of the living hostages. The plan would also see the Rafah Border Crossing between Egypt and Gaza quickly returned to operation, under the supervision of the Palestinian Authority, with Egyptian oversight. ‘Israel’ would be given, according to the report, the right to veto those crossing to Egypt, with Cairo guaranteeing it will secure a Palestinian commitment that Hamas will not be allowed to control either the crossing or the Strip 'during the coming period.' The deal would also see an increase in humanitarian aid for Gaza, and medications would enter the Strip for the hostages that need, Al-Akhbar added. The report also said that ‘Israel’ will initially be permitted to maintain its military positions within Gaza, but without carrying out operations. Israeli media also reported the visit, with Israeli Channel 12 saying a team from the Egyptian intelligence will visit Tel Aviv on Thursday. The Times of Israel also cited Al-Akhbar report, adding that: 'While not mentioned in the report, the potential deal is also assumed to include the release of Palestinian prisoners.' Earlier on Wednesday families of Israeli captives held for over a year in the Gaza Strip temporarily blocked the entrance to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Knesset office, demanding that he meet with them and promote a hostage deal. Relatives of Israeli captives held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip block the entrance to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Knesset office, in occupied Al-Quds (November 27, 2024). The protesters were removed by Knesset security. They then went down one floor and blocked the stairs leading to the faction wing of the building, where the various political parties hold meetings and press conferences Israeli media reported.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280170	2024-11-28T03:27:49-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-07819070017319274025.jpg
Resistance Unbreakable: Imam Khamenei Declares Israel’s Doom, Al-...	The Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, has asserted that the Israeli regime is doomed to perish from the West Asia region. Imam Khamenei stated that the ongoing anti-Israeli operations by regional resistance movements cannot be quelled. 'Al-Aqsa Storm cannot be quenched, and the usurping Zionist regime is destined for departure,' Khamenei's official Persian-language account wrote in a post on Wednesday, accompanied by an illustration of an Israeli tank buried half in the ground with a white flag protruding from its cannon. Leader: Israel destined for departure; al-Aqsa Storm can’t be quenched — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) November 28, 2024 The resistance movements, including Hamas from the Gaza Strip, Islamic Jihad, Lebanon's Hezbollah, and their counterparts in Iraq and Yemen, launched the 'Al-Aqsa Storm' operation last October after the Israeli regime began a genocidal war against the coastal enclave. The operation has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israeli troops and officers, as well as the destruction of a considerable amount of their advanced Western-funded equipment. Hezbollah's successful performance in the operation also forced the regime into approving a ceasefire deal with the movement, ending Tel Aviv's 13-month deadly aggression against Lebanon. In a statement, Hezbollah hailed the operation's success, stating that their fighters 'were able to bring down its (the enemy's) goals and defeat its army.' Hamas also praised Hezbollah's prowess, saying the ceasefire deal had shattered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 'illusion' of reshaping West Asia by force. Khamenei's remarks come after he called for the prosecution of all Israeli political and military officials for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and demanded the death sentence for Netanyahu. Regarding the ceasefire agreement, Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Esmail Baghaei announced that Iran welcomed the cessation of Israeli aggression against Lebanon, reiterating its steadfast support for the Lebanese government, people, and Resistance. Baghaei emphasized Iran's commitment to peace in the region and highlighted its ongoing diplomatic efforts to halt hostilities in Gaza and Lebanon over the past 14 months, which have killed tens of thousands and caused widespread destruction of vital infrastructure. 'The result of the warmongering and crimes committed by the Zionist regime, fully supported by the United States and certain European governments, is the martyrdom of 60,000 innocent people, the wounding of 120,000 individuals, and the displacement of over 3.5 million oppressed people in Palestine and Lebanon,' Baghaei said.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280181	2024-11-28T03:25:49-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-081728400173279314410.jpg
Hochstein: Israeli Buffer Zone in Lebanon 'Fantasy that Won’t Eve...	US special envoy Amos Hochstein dismissed as 'fantasy' the notion that the Zionist entity could have secured a better deal in which it would have been able to maintain a buffer zone inside Lebanon. During a round of interviews hours after the ceasefire came into place, Hochstein was presented with criticism voiced by former prime minister Naftali Bennett, who said the agreement’s lack of planned buffer zone in Lebanon will allow Hezbollah to rebuild homes along the border that the resistance group can use as a staging point for a future invasion of the northern settlements and as launch pads for the many anti-tank missiles. 'Yes, there are fantasy deals that are utopia where you get a ceasefire agreement with a security zone, but those won’t ever happen,' Hochstein responded to Channel 12. The senior adviser to US President Joe Biden maintained that a buffer zone would require ‘Israel’ to remain in Lebanon as an occupying force — something that no sovereign country would accept, Israeli media reported. 'If you choose to have a dead zone or a demilitarized zone, then you are there as an occupier, and you are not there in agreement; which means that while you may have two, three, four or five kilometers inside Lebanon, there won’t be an agreement to stop [Hezbollah from] shooting at Israel from longer ranges,' Hochstein said. Thousands of displaced Lebanese are returning to their homes in the south of the country as the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire agreement takes effect. pic.twitter.com/1eqxWNdGPB — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) November 27, 2024 Asked whether ‘Israel’ should’ve continued in its efforts to degrade Hezbollah militarily following the massive blows, Hochstein told Channel 12, 'At some point, you have to get to a deal itself.' During a briefing with Jewish American community leaders earlier in the day, Hochstein pointed out that the Zionist entity had never established a war aim of fully dismantling Hezbollah. Tel Aviv’s stated goal for the northern front was to allow the tens of thousands of Israelis to return to northern settlements near the Blue Line, which wouldn’t have been possible without a deal, he said. Hochstein was pressed on reports that he had also given ‘Israel’ an 'It’s now or never' ultimatum that ultimately convinced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a deal.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280071	2024-11-28T02:18:05-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-08746960017327885342.jpg
IRGC Chief Hails Lebanon Ceasefire as Strategic, Humiliating Defe...	The chief commander of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) has celebrated the recent ceasefire between Lebanon and ‘Israel’ as a strategic and humiliating defeat for the occupying regime. Major General Hossein Salami, in a message to Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem, congratulated Lebanon and its Hezbollah resistance movement for successfully imposing the ceasefire on Israel. Salami described the truce as a major setback for the Zionist regime, which he said failed to achieve any of its 'evil goals and ambitions' in the conflict with Hezbollah. IRGC chief: Lebanon truce ‘strategic, humiliating defeat’ for Israel — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) November 28, 2024 The IRGC chief noted that Israel's acceptance of the ceasefire, while under a barrage of Hezbollah missiles targeting its bases and strategic sites, held important lessons for Tel Aviv and its supporters. He emphasized that the 'usurping entity is on the decline' and the crimes it has committed in Gaza and Lebanon will only serve to strengthen the resistance. Salami further stated that Hezbollah's victory, secured through the 'pure blood of martyrs, the patience and resilience of the Lebanese people, and the unwavering courage and sacrifices of the youth,' represents a significant development in the Islamic Ummah's struggle against Zionists in the region. 'Undoubtedly, this great victory, which was secured thanks to the pure blood of martyrs, the patience and resilience of the Lebanese people, and the unwavering courage and sacrifices of the youth and Hezbollah, is considered a major development in the history of the Islamic Ummah's struggle against Zionists in West Asia.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280049	2024-11-28T01:14:39-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/08/manar-05368670017225129456.jpg
Mikati: Return of Displaced Citizens to Southern Villages Demonst...	Caretaker Prime Minister, Najib Mikati, on Wednesday issued a statement following reports of displaced families returning to their homes in various regions of Lebanon, particularly in the south. Mikati emphasized that the sight of these returnees reaffirmed the Lebanese people's attachment to their land, values, and heritage. 'We have been closely monitoring the return of displaced citizens since early this morning, especially in the southern regions. This demonstrates the steadfastness of the Lebanese in holding onto their land and values,' Mikati said. Looking ahead, Mikati expressed confidence that the Lebanese Army's plan to strengthen its presence in the south would enable the gradual return of more displaced citizens to their homes and villages in the coming days. The Prime Minister also urged both returning citizens and those still remaining in their homes to exercise patience and wait for instructions from the Army's leadership to ensure their safety and security. 'We call on all returnees and those who are still steadfast in their homes to refrain from rushing and to follow the guidance of the Army Command for their own safety,' Mikati added. Shortly after the ceasefire with the Israeli enemy took effect in Lebanon on Wednesday, citizens started to return home in their towns and neighborhoods in Bekaa, south Lebanon and Dahiyeh (the southern suburb of Beirut), defying Israeli threats to return, especially to southern villages.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2279862	2024-11-27T14:57:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-04987210017327482264.png
Islamic Resistance Emerged Victorious over Delusional Enemy, Carr...	The Islamic Resistance Operations Room issued on Wednesday a statement which affirmed that, in support of the steadfast Palestinian people as well as their valiant and honorable resistance, and in defense of Lebanon and its resilient people, the Islamic Resistance continues its journey, answering the call of its Secretary-General and supreme martyr, His Eminence Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, may Allah sanctify his soul, and under the banner of his successor, His Eminence Sheikh Naim Qassem, may Allah preserve him. Over more than 13 months, the resistance has maintained its pledge and fight, achieving victory over the delusional enemy that has failed to break its resolve or will, according to the statement which added that it is the battlefield that has spoken, with steadfast fighters relying on Allah to thwart the enemy’s goals, defeat its army, and pen with their blood epics of resilience and defiance during the battles of Al-Aqsa Flood and The Formidable in Might. On this momentous occasion, the Resistance announced the following: - Since the launch of Al-Aqsa Flood operations on October 8, 2023, the Islamic Resistance has conducted more than 4,637 [announced] military operations over 417 days, averaging 11 operations daily. - Since the start of 'Israeli' enemy aggression on Lebanon and the launch of The Formidable in Might operations on September 17, 2024, the resistance has executed 1,666 diverse military operations, averaging 23 operations daily. These targeted 'Israeli' army sites, barracks, bases, cities, and settlements, ranging from the Lebanese-Palestinian border to beyond Tel Aviv. The operations also included heroic confrontations against ground incursions into Lebanese territories. - Within the framework of The Formidable in Might operations, the resistance conducted 105 military operations under the qualitative Khaibar series. These targeted dozens of strategic military and security bases, many for the first time in the enemy's history, employing qualitative ballistic and qualitative missiles and advanced drones, reaching depths of 150 km into occupied Palestinian territory, beyond Tel Aviv. - Cumulative losses inflicted on the 'Israeli' enemy army since its ground advance into Lebanese territories on October 1, 2024, until the issuance of this statement include: - Over 130 soldiers and officers were killed, with more than 1,250 wounded. - Destruction of 59 Merkava tanks, 11 military bulldozers, 2 Hummers, 2 armored vehicles, and 2 personnel carriers. - Downing of 6 Hermes 450 drones, 2 Hermes 900 drones, and one quadcopter glider. It should be noted that these figures do not include losses at military bases, sites, settlements, and occupied cities. The Islamic Resistance Operations Room emphasized the following: - During the 'Israeli' enemy ground operation into Lebanese territories since October 1, 2024, and due to the steadfastness of our fighters, the invading forces failed to occupy or secure any of the first-tier frontline towns—despite continuous aggression since the start of Al-Aqsa Flood. They also failed to establish a military-security buffer zone as they had hoped and were unable to prevent rocket and drone launches into occupied territory. Even on the last day of aggression, our fighters continued targeting the enemy's depth from within border towns. - The second phase of the ground operation was merely a political and media announcement. The enemy failed to advance into second-tier frontline towns, suffering heavy losses in Al-Khiam (which it withdrew from thrice), Ainatha, Tallousa, Bint Jbeil, and Al-Qawzah. The sole attempt to advance into Al-Bayyadah and Shamaa in the western sector turned into a graveyard for the tanks and elite troops of the 'Israeli' enemy army, who were forced to retreat under the resistance's blows. - The resistance's defensive strategy is based on area-specific defense. It has prepared over 300 defensive lines south of the Litani River, each fully equipped in terms of manpower, equipment, and readiness. The outcomes in Al-Bayyadah and Al-Khiam stand as clear proof. - The Islamic Resistance Operations Room reaffirms that its fighters across all military specializations remain fully prepared to confront 'Israeli' enemy ambitions and aggression. Their eyes remain fixed on the movements and withdrawals of enemy forces beyond the borders, with their hands ready on the trigger, in defense of Lebanon's sovereignty and for the honor and dignity of its people. The statement also addressed the Honorable People of the Resistance: O most noble, pure, and honorable of people, our dear and steadfast nation, free sons and daughters of our homeland, who, with your legendary resilience and limitless sacrifices, shattered the enemy’s illusions. Victory, by Allah’s grace, has been the ally of the righteous cause you have embraced and carried, returning to your villages and homes with pride and dignity. You roam the world with triumph, bearing the steadfast and elevated banner, rooted in the battlefield and conscience, a banner that will forever resist oppression and aggression. The Islamic Resistance, which has sacrificed its finest leaders and fighters in the path of Allah, in defense of its land and people, and in support of the oppressed in Palestine, addresses you today, as well as all the free people of the world and the fighters in the fields, with a salute of arms, fight, martyrdom, and victory. It pledges, in the name of its fighters and knights, to honor every drop of pure blood and every sacred soul by continuing the path of resistance with even greater determination. It vows to remain steadfast in standing by the oppressed, the vulnerable, and the fighters in Palestine, with its capital, the Sacred Al-Quds, which will remain a symbol and a path for generations yearning for freedom and liberation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2279829	2024-11-27T11:49:58-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-027725400166239486010.jpg
US Pressed Netanyahu to Accept Lebanon Ceasefire due to Israeli M...	Member of Hezbollah Central Council, Sheikh Hasan Al-Baghdadi, indicated that the experience with the Americans and the Israelis confirms that they are one party and have one project, which is to plunder wealth, dominate the region, and launch a new Middle East scheme. 'This was clear from the statements of Netanyahu and others, in addition to what America and some of the West did by bringing fleets to isolate Gaza and prevent aid, issuing threats, and inciting against the Islamic Resistance inside Lebanon through its ambassador. The experience of more than a year and two months of aggression against Gaza and Lebanon proves that the Americans were undoubtedly managing and financing the war and did not want to stop it.' His eminence added: 'What happened was due to the huge difference in capabilities between Hezbollah and the resistance in Palestine, which put the temporary entity in the circle of danger. Therefore, the Americans and others began to pressure Netanyahu’s government to stop the war out of fear for them and their certainty that the Israeli army is unable to win, not for the sake of Lebanon, as all the killing and destruction here were by American missiles.' Al-Baghdadi affirmed that the Israeli losses were beyond imagination in various security and economic fields, especially in the military establishment that is on the verge of collapse. 'This is understood from the position of the West, American pressure, the Israeli opposition, mayors and competent authorities in the Zionist settlements, and some hypocritical parties in Lebanon who, like their masters, thought that Hezbollah collapsed after the security strikes, and they do not understand that it is an ideological Party that is not linked to individuals, no matter how high their status is.' Shortly after the ceasefire with the Israeli enemy took effect in Lebanon on Wednesday, citizens started to return home in their towns and neighborhoods in Bekaa, south Lebanon and Dahiyeh (the southern suburb of Beirut), defying Israeli threats to return, especially to southern villages.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2279796	2024-11-27T10:56:05-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-02607140017327337595.jpeg

Lebanese parliament Speaker Nabih Berri called for all displaced people, including those abroad, to return home, few hours after the ceasefire between Lebanon and the Zionist entity took effect at dawn. In a televised speech, Speaker Berri saluted the nation’s martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, whom he said tasked him with the responsibility of the political resistance. 'I call you to come back to your country, come back to your towns and come back to the places where you were born, even if they were in rubble. You should protect the land that saw the blood of all the martyrs,' stated Speaker Berri, who was mandated by Hezbollah to lead negotiations on behalf of Hezbollah and along PM Najib Mikati on behalf of the Lebanese State. 'Come back to your land and bring back life to all the neighborhoods that the Israeli occupation and aggression tried to destroy. The victory of your land relies on you coming back,' he added. Speaker Berri said Lebanon needs 'to elect a president as soon as possible'. 'It should unify all of us. It is a test so that we can protect Lebanon from all the threats including Israeli threats,' the Lebanese Parliament speaker said. 'The only thing which would keep us all together is to protect Lebanon, so we can overcome this challenge and be stronger,' Berri added. 'And also to demonstrate and show to the world that it is a country that can coexist with its different spiritual components, in contradiction with the racism of Israel,' he noted.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2279620	2024-11-27T03:33:32-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-07687950017327071093.jpg
Gaza’s Islamic Jihad Vows Unity with Hezbollah Until Victory	The secretary-general of the Gaza-based Palestinian resistance movement Islamic Jihad has pledged continued unity with its Lebanese counterpart, Hezbollah, until victory is achieved. In a message to Hezbollah's deputy secretary-general, Sheikh Naim Qassem, Ziad Nakhala declared, 'We will stay united as one front and one Resistance, until victory.' The Palestinian official further commended regional resistance movements for their valiant and successful struggle in the face of the Israeli regime and its allies. 'From Palestine to Lebanon, from the courageous Gaza to the resilient suburbs of Beirut, and from the heroic Palestinian fighters to the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon, we commend your unwavering steadfastness and strength,' he wrote. 'Despite the wounds and the relentless onslaught of enemies, led by the US and its allies, you continue to uphold the banner of resistance with pride and dignity.' Nakhala recalled how the resistance groups had rushed to Palestinians’ defense and support, 'offering your valuable lives, while others were unable to provide even basic relief to the thirsty and hungry people of Palestine.' The comments concerned hundreds of successful retaliatory operations that the movements have been carrying out against the occupied Palestinian territories since last October, when the Israeli regime began bringing the Gaza Strip under a genocidal war. The remarks come after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a ceasefire deal, following a deadly Israeli aggression on Gaza and Lebanon that claimed over 3,700 lives. Hezbollah has responded with hundreds of successful retaliatory strikes, which observers believe forced Israel's hand in accepting the ceasefire. Nakhala praised the resistance movements for rushing to the defense of Palestinians, 'offering your valuable lives, while others were unable to provide even basic relief to the thirsty and hungry people of Palestine.' He expressed confidence that the united front of resistance will continue to 'uphold the banner of resistance with pride and dignity' until victory is achieved.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2279521	2024-11-27T02:26:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/11/manar-09077080017008254086.jpeg

Shortly after the ceasefire with the Israeli enemy took effect in Lebanon on Wednesday, citizens started to return home in their towns and neighborhoods in Bekaa, south Lebanon and Dahiyeh (the southern suburb of Beirut), defying Israeli threats to return, especially to southern villages. Israeli occupation army warned soon after the ceasefire began at 4:00 at dawn that residents of south Lebanon should not approach enemy army positions and villages its forces had ordered to be evacuated. 'With the entry into force of the ceasefire agreement and based on its provisions, the IDF remains deployed in its positions inside southern Lebanon,' enemy army spokesman Avichay Adraee said in a post on X, referring to the Israeli occupation forces. 'You are prohibited from heading towards the villages that the IDF has ordered to be evacuated or towards IDF forces in the area.' However, photos and videos circulated on social media showed streams of cars carrying displaced people heading for southern villages, as the citizens couldn’t wait more to go to their hometowns after 65 days of brutal Israeli aggression that started on September 23. توثيق لزحمة السير.. النازحون يعودون إلى قراهم في الجنوب.#وقائع pic.twitter.com/XqouGZS10C — وقائع (@waqa2e3) November 27, 2024 The hours before the truce took effect were some of the most violent in the war, with the Israeli enemy staging violent raids on the capital Beirut, Dahiyeh, Bekaa and southern Lebanon.

Netanyahu Indirectly Acknowledges Failure of War on Lebanon: We N...	After around two months of war on Lebanon, the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Tel Aviv would approve an indirect ceasefire deal with Lebanon mediated by the United States and France. In a press conference on Tuesday evening, Netanyau claimed that the Israeli approval of the ceasefire came in order to concentrate on the 'Iranian threat', reactivate the army, overcome the restrictions imposed on the arms supplies to 'Israel', and separating the Lebanese and Gaza fronts in order to isolate Hamas were behind the Zionist decision to accept the ceasefire. In an attempt to justify the decision before the Israelis, Netanyahu said that the occupation army would attack whenever it detects violation of the deal, alleging that 'Israel' would prevent Hezbollah from rearming. The Israeli Channel 13 conducted a poll which showed that 61% of the Zionists believe that 'Israel' did not win the war. Netanyahu also faces a harsh criticism from the residents of the northern settlements over the agreement, amid assertions that the displaced settlers would not return home in light of the outcome of the ongoing confrontation. In this regard, the former minister Avigdor Lieberman said that none can prevent Hezbollah from rearming, calling on the displaced settlers to avoid returning to the 'North'.

Imam Khamenei Calls for Netanyahu’s Execution	Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, the leader of Iran's Islamic Revolution, has demanded that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be sentenced to death, dismissing the International Criminal Court's (ICC) recently issued arrest warrant as an inadequate response to Netanyahu's war crimes in Gaza and Lebanon. Ayatollah Khamenei Urges Capital Punishment for Netanyahu pic.twitter.com/fWnXiKV3DC — Tasnim News Agency (@Tasnimnews_EN) November 25, 2024 'The (ICC) arrest warrant is not enough, Netanyahu's death sentence must be ordered,' Imam Khamenei said during a meeting with members of the Iranian Basij volunteer force on Monday, as part of Basij Week celebrations. The ICC has issued arrest warrants against Netanyahu and his former defense minister Yoav Gallant for their roles in the ongoing genocide in Gaza and atrocities committed in Lebanon. The warrants mean the two Israeli leaders risk arrest if they travel to any of the 124 countries that have signed the Rome Statute establishing the ICC. Condemning Israel's aggression in Gaza and Lebanon, Imam Khamenei dismissed the bombing of civilian homes as a crime rather than a victory. The Leader asserted that ‘Israel’ has failed to win its wars in these regions and will never succeed. The Leader noted that Imam Khomeini, founder of the Islamic Revolution, created Basij volunteer force as a 'bulwark' against threats. Basiji is not intimidated by the US and Israeli propaganda, he asserted, adding that some of the prominent Iranian scientists, who were assassinated by the enemy, were members of the volunteer force. Imam Khamenei further said that Basij will definitely destroy the Zionist regime. Basij, he emphasized, should strengthen, expand and maintain preparedness. The leader said the United States' ideal for the region is either submission or chaos, urging the force to counter US duality of dictator ship and anarchy. Additionally in his remarks, the Leader praised Basij’s successes in foiling enemies’ plots against the Islamic Revolution. Imam Khamenei touched on a deal around 15 years ago, when the US 'vowed' to deliver uranium with 20 percent purity to Iran to be used for radio pharmaceuticals in return for taking all of the country's 3.5 percent uranium. 'The Americans were cheating, we realized that they were cheating. It (the deal) was stopped,' the Leader said.'Those who disrupted the US's evil conspiracy in the case of 20 percent enriched uranium, which was needed by the country, were Basij members.' 'At the same time, Iran’s Basiji professors managed to produce the 20 percent enriched uranium inside the country. Americans could not believe this would happen,' the Leader added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2277596	2024-11-25T04:05:35-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-08656070017325363297.jpg

The military confrontation with the Zionist enemy is accompanied by a hostile propaganda aimed supporting the goals of Israeli war on Lebanon. What must be completely condemned is the distortion of reality in an attempt to prove an untrue idea or figure. It is totally immoral, for example, to claim that the enemy controlled a certain town while the clashes are still ongoing in its vicinity. Since the beginning of the Israeli ground invasion of South Lebanon, the hostile media tried its best to magnify the Israeli aggression 'achievements' and trivialize the Resistance feats. A very sharp and clear example, in this regard, can be the promotion of the idea that the Israeli ground progress is much faster than that which was in 2006 in order to solidify the claim that Hezbollah in 2024 is weaker than it was in 2006. A factual comparison between the Zionist ground invasion in 2024 and that in 2006 shows that - the Israeli Merkava tanks reached in 30 days Ghandouriyeh (landing) and Wadi Al Houjeir Reserve, which lie around 10 kilometers away from the Lebanese Palestinian borders in 2006. - the Israeli Merkava tanks failed in around 55 days to cross Deir Mimas which lies around one kilometer away from the Lebanese Palestinian borders in 2024. A map shows the difference between the ground invasion in 2024 and that in 2006 Another clear example can be that, in 2006, the Merkava tanks reached Al-Bayada and even the outskirts of Al-Mansouri in Tyre district. Whereas, in 2024, the enemy vehicles reached only the outskirts of Shamaa and Al-Bayada. These are mere instances to say that the Islamic Resistance fighters are bravely fighting to defend the South Lebanon town, including Khiam and Bint Jbeil, and that the pace of the Israeli ground advance is not at all faster than that in 2006, yet even much slower. Thus, those who are promoting the Israeli ground advance must hold on and wait for the consequences of the battle which will gradually appear.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2276089	2024-11-23T10:59:13-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-02851670017323882094.png
Hezbollah Fighters Frustrate Israeli Advance Schemes in South Leb...	The Islamic Resistance fighters continued on Saturday, November 23, 2024, confronting the barbaric Israeli war on Lebanon, showing unprecedented bravery in the ground fight against the enemy troops attempting to control towns in the South. More than 51 Merkava tanks have been destroyed by Hezbollah fighters who audaciously repelled the Zionist ground advance into the towns of Khiam, Deir Mimas and Al-Bayada. It is worth noting that the Israeli ground invasion of South Lebanon has taken the form of incursion lines which do not grant the enemy forces the capability of controlling any of the villages in South Lebanon. To give a clearer view of situation, the Islamic Resistance fighters fiercely clashed with the enemy troops in Al-Jebayn town which is closer to the border line than Shamaa town where an Israeli incursion line reached.

No Hezbollah Figure Targeted in Beirut Strike: Lawmaker	Member of Hezbollah’s Loyalty to Resistance bloc MP Amin Sherri firmly denied on Saturday that the Israeli strike on Beirut’s Al-Basta targeted a Hezbollah figure, noting that the brutal attack which killed or injured dozens in the Lebanese capital is only aimed at terrifying the Lebanese citizens. As he visited the scene of the Israeli strike, MP Sherri said: 'This is the eighth attack on Beirut (since the start of the war on September 23). No military target was hit in all of these attacks.' 'Neither a military figure nor an individual who is affiliated with any political party was targeted in any of the two destroyed buildings,' the lawmaker affirmed. ⚡Lebanese MP Amin Sherri from Basta: There is no Hezbollah figure in the targeted building #Iraq #Syria #Hezbollah #Beirut #Lebanon #Israel #TelAviv #Gaza #Yemen #Iran #Tehran #IRGC pic.twitter.com/B1jLCfOdhe — War Analysis (@iiamguri9) November 23, 2024 He saluted the people who have been displaced from the unsafe regions across Lebanon to the capital Beirut. 'These attacks will never break the will of our people,' MP Sherri stressed. He noted, meanwhile, that the real confrontation is in south Lebanon, with the resistance fighters, rather than the systematic killings of civilians. Massive Israeli strike that employed bunker busting bombs on Beirut's Al-Basta area killed or injured dozens of people at dawn on Saturday.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2275913	2024-11-23T06:23:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-07648920017323717154.png
Iran to Launch New Advanced Centrifuges: AEOI	Spokesman of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) Behrouz Kamalvandi said that the organization plans to activate a series of new and advanced centrifuges in response to the IAEA politically-motivated resolution. The International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors on Thursday voted 19 to 3, with 12 abstentions, for the resolution, brought by the UK, France, and Germany (E3), that accused the Islamic Republic of poor cooperation with the agency. Speaking in a televised interview on Friday, Kamalvandi said that after the resolution was issued, the AEOI immediately started its remedial measures. 'We will significantly increase the enrichment capacity with different kinds of advanced machines,' he said, naming the increase in the speed of industrial research and development as another measure that would be taken by Iran in response to the resolution. He further stressed that after the resolution was issued, the President and the AEOI chief issued the necessary orders, and the process started that night. 'Soon, the IAEA will surely provide its reports and it will be clear that what they did led to the increase of Iran's nuclear industry capacity in various fields,' he added. The AEOI official said that the IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi was informed during his visit to Iran that Tehran is seeking interaction but if the IAEA wants to adopt other methods, the Islamic Republic is also ready to act accordingly. Iran has announced it has launched new advanced centrifuges after the E3-US drafted resolution was passed at the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors (IAEA BoG) on Thursday night. In a joint statement, the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) and the Iranian Foreign Ministry condemned the passing of the resolution as a politically motivated, unrealistic, and counterproductive move.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2275869	2024-11-23T05:32:06-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/04/manar-04755240016178797859.jpg

The strikes late Friday hit residential areas of Beer Al-Abed in Haret Hreik, Chiah and Ghobeiry. In its latest update, issued on Friday, Lebanese Health Ministry announced that the number of martyrs reached 3,645 and that the number of injured surpassed 15,350 since September 23. 3645 شهيدا و 15355 جريحا منذ بدء العدوان، وحصيلة يوم أمس 62 شهيدا و 111 جريحا pic.twitter.com/jJ8P11zA1U — Ministry of Public Health - Lebanon (@mophleb) November 22, 2024	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2275528	2024-11-23T01:24:04-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-02823460017323537436.jpg
Putin Says Oreshnik Missile System Cutting-edge Innovation by Rus...	Russia’s Oreshnik hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile system is not an upgraded version of previous versions dating back from the Soviet times, and it is in the line of the latest and modern developments, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday. 'The Oreshnik system has nothing to do with the modernization of the old Soviet systems,' Putin said. 'It is obvious that we were all raised watching various systems of the Soviet Union operating, we were all brought up on what was done by previous generations, and to a certain extent we used their results,' Putin said. 'However, this system is indeed the prime result of your work, the work that was done in Russian times, under the conditions of the new Russia, it was waged on the basis of modern, latest developments,' Putin said addressing the meeting with the Defense Ministry executive board, representatives of the military-industrial complex and missile weapon designers. The Russian Defense Ministry announced earlier in the day that the country’s latest Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile hit all the targets at a major Ukrainian military-industrial enterprise in Dnepr (Dnepropetrovsk) with its MIRVed warheads. 'On November 21, 2024, in response to the use of American-and British-made long-range missiles against facilities on Russian territory, the Armed Forces delivered a combined strike on one of the Ukrainian military-industrial sites in Dnepropetrovsk. For the first time, the Oreshnik hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile with a non-nuclear payload was employed in combat conditions in the strike. The goal of the strike was achieved. All the warheads hit the facility,' the ministry said in a statement. On November 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree approving the Foundations of State Policy in the Field of Nuclear Deterrence, the country’s updated nuclear doctrine. The fundamental principle of the doctrine is that the use of nuclear weapons is a measure of last resort to protect the country’s sovereignty. The emergence of new military threats and risks prompted Russia to clarify the conditions for the use of nuclear weapons. In particular, the amended doctrine expands the range of countries and military alliances subject to nuclear deterrence, as well as the list of military threats that such deterrence is designed to counter. In addition, the document states that Russia will now view any attack by a non-nuclear country supported by a nuclear power as a joint attack. Moscow also reserves the right to consider a nuclear response to a conventional weapons attack threatening its sovereignty, a large-scale launch of enemy aircraft, missiles, and drones targeting Russian territory, their crossing of the Russian border, and an attack on its ally Belarus.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2275176	2024-11-22T11:52:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-09745410017323051094.jpg

Iran Hails ICC Warrant for Netanyahu as ‘Political Death’ of ‘Isr...	The Commander of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps, General Hossein Salami, has welcomed the International Criminal Court's (ICC) arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Security Minister Yoav Gallant, describing the move as marking the 'end and political death' of 'Israel.' Salami declared in a speech aired on Iranian state television that the ICC's decision signifies 'the end and political death of the Zionist regime, a regime that today lives in absolute political isolation in the world, and its officials can no longer travel to other countries.' IRGC chief urges Muslim countries to cut aid routes to Israel — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) November 22, 2024 The Iranian commander characterized the warrants as a 'great victory for the Palestinian and Lebanese resistance movements' and a pivotal step in holding the Israeli occupation accountable for its actions, particularly the ongoing genocide in Gaza. In contrast, Netanyahu and his allies have dismissed the ICC's move as politically motivated and antisemitic, with the Israeli president accusing the court of undermining justice and siding with 'terrorism and evil.' The United States, Israel's closest ally, has also criticized the ICC's decision. The warrants, which theoretically restrict Netanyahu's international travel, come as the death toll from the Israeli war against Gaza surpasses 44,000 martyrs over 412 days.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2274923	2024-11-22T06:37:50-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/12/manar-067219500170375961910.jpg
Iran Activates Advanced Centrifuges in Retaliation of IAEA Resolu...	Iran has denounced a United Nations nuclear watchdog resolution as 'unjustifiable' and initiated the operation of advanced centrifuges in reciprocal response. Iran's Foreign Ministry and the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) issued a joint statement early Friday, announcing the activation of 'a substantial number of advanced centrifuges of various models.' The statement emphasized that the move is a defensive measure to protect Iran's national interests and address its increasing need for a civilian nuclear program, in line with its obligations under the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement. 📌 Joint Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Regarding the Unjust Resolution Adopted by the IAEA Board of Governors on Iran’s Peaceful Nuclear Program In the final hours of the #IAEA Board of Governors meeting on 21 Nov 2024, a… pic.twitter.com/XjM5Up5eLs — Foreign Ministry, Islamic Republic of Iran 🇮🇷 (@IRIMFA_EN) November 22, 2024 The action follows a resolution passed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors, which accused Tehran of inadequate cooperation and called for a 'comprehensive' report on its nuclear activities by spring 2025. The resolution passed with 19 votes in favor, three against, and 12 abstentions. IAEA Director General @rafaelmgrossi briefed the Board of Governors on his high-level meetings in Tehran last week, describing his discussions with the new government as constructive. Nevertheless, he pointed out, there were ongoing concerns. Read more: pic.twitter.com/Jt4uIzucsJ — IAEA - International Atomic Energy Agency ⚛️ (@iaeaorg) November 22, 2024 Iran described the resolution as a 'non-consensus' measure driven by the 'pressure and insistence' of the US, UK, France and Germany, despite lacking support from nearly half of the 35-member Board of Governors. 'The actions of the three European nations and the United States—countries with a documented history of reneging on their commitments, including under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and resorting to unlawful sanctions and pressures against the Iranian nation—are both confrontational and unjustifiable,' the statement read. It criticized the resolution as 'politically motivated' and warned it undermines the constructive atmosphere fostered during IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi's recent visit to Tehran. 'This politicized and destructive measure undermines the positive momentum achieved between Iran and the Agency and blatantly contradicts the professed commitment of the three European nations and the United States to preserving the integrity and impartiality of the IAEA. It lays bare their use of the nuclear issue as a pretext to advance illegitimate objectives,' the statement added. Despite its condemnation of the resolution, Iran reaffirmed its commitment to cooperating with the IAEA within the framework of the Safeguards Agreement. 'The principled policy of the I.R. of Iran has consistently been to engage constructively with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) within the framework of rights and obligations enshrined in the Treaty on the NPT and the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement,' it said. Iran signed the JCPOA in 2015, proving the peaceful intent of its nuclear program to six world powers. However, the deal has been in jeopardy since the United States unilaterally withdrew in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. In response to unmet commitments by other signatories, Iran began rolling back its JCPOA obligations in 2019.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2274835	2024-11-22T05:50:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/06/manar-02354790016244400227.jpg

Meanwhile, the northern Gaza Strip continues to bear the brunt of the ongoing offensive, as the Israeli occupation forces have intensified their bombardment of the Jabalia refugee camp. Residential buildings in the area have been systematically destroyed, in what appears to be a deliberate attempt to displace the local population. Last night, Israeli occupation warplanes targeted and bombed an inhabited residential block in the vicinity of Kamal Adwan hospital, massacring at least 66 civilians and injuring over 100. pic.twitter.com/zoUqz1z6zn — PALESTINE ONLINE 🇵🇸 (@OnlinePalEng) November 21, 2024 On October 5, the occupation army invaded the northern Gaza governorate under the pretext of preventing the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) from regaining its strength in the area, committing the most heinous atrocities against the people of the north in a clear attempt to displace them in implementation of the so-called 'generals’ plan.' The Palestinians confirm that the enemy wants to occupy the northern Gaza Strip and turn it into a buffer zone after displacing its residents under the pressure of continuous bloody bombing and a tight siege that prevents the entry of food, water and medicine.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2274626	2024-11-22T04:18:17-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-09688970017322778755.jpg
‘Israel’ Greenlights Settler Attacks, Announces End of Administra...	New Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced an end to administrative detention orders for Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank settlers, in a new measure that is seen a practice of apartheid against Palestinian people, and a green light for Zionist settlers to attack the native people of Palestine. While the practice is primarily deployed against Palestinian people in Israeli jails, it is also used against some Israelis, described as 'extremist Jewish'. It sees individuals held without charge for up to six months at a time. The detentions can be renewed indefinitely while allowing military prosecutors to keep suspects from being able to see the evidence against them. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem on November 10, 2024. In a statement, Katz claimed that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are subject to so-called 'serious Palestinian terror threats and unjustified international sanctions are taken against the settlers.' 'It is not appropriate for the State of Israel to take such a severe measure against the people of the settlements,' the Israeli DM added. Katz met with Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar this week and told him that he had decided 'to stop the use of administrative detention orders against Jewish settlers in Judea and Samaria, and asked him to put alternative tools in place,' his office said, referring to the Hebrew name of the West Bank. The measure could be seen as a new Israeli attempt to permit settler violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, which spiked since October 2023. Israeli occupation authorities rarely arrest Jewish perpetrators in such attacks. Rights groups lament that convictions are even more unusual and that the vast majority of charges in these types of attacks are dropped.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2274494	2024-11-22T03:08:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-01632750017322734949.jpg
Israeli Warplanes Launch a New Attack on Beirut’s Southern Suburb...	Israeli warplanes launched a series of airstrikes on the Southern Suburb of Beirut on Friday, reducing several residential buildings to rubble. The brutal attacks appear to be part of Israel's retaliatory actions against areas inhabited by the Resistance's popular support base, following recent battlefield setbacks. the Israeli warplanes targeted the neighborhoods of Haret Hreik, al-Hadath, and al-Kafaat. The Israeli occupation military had issued three separate warnings, announcing plans to strike three residential buildings in the targeted areas. However, the number of strikes launched during each round of raids has consistently exceeded the number of individual warnings issued, and dozens of buildings have been struck with no prior notice. بالفيديو | لحظة تدمير الطيران الاسرائيلي مبنى في #الضاحية_الجنوبية لبيروت pic.twitter.com/efo5sxwGLM — قناة المنار (@TVManar1) November 21, 2024 Despite Israel's claims that the strikes target buildings affiliated with the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon, emerging footage and eyewitness statements continue to prove otherwise, revealing the indiscriminate nature of the attacks and the significant destruction caused. The ongoing Israeli aggression across Lebanon has resulted in the martyrdom of at least 3,583 people and the wounding of 15,244 since October 2023. On Thursday alone, the Lebanese Health Ministry reported 25 martyrs and 121 injuries, with the toll particularly high in the Baalbek-Hermel Governorate, where six members of the same family were killed in the town of Maqneh and at least 11 were martyred in Nabha. The relentless Israeli airstrikes have continued to target several towns in the Bekaa Valley, with the total number of raids reaching 1,182 and resulting in 839 martyrs and 1,399 wounded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2274373	2024-11-22T00:56:07-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-04603610017322657605.jpg
Enemy Has No Countermeasures for Russia’s Oreshnik Missile: Putin	There are currently no countermeasures for the Oreshnik missile, Russian President Vladimir Putin said. Speaking in a televised address, the head of state assured that Russia will issue notifications before using this type of missile. 'We will do it due to humanitarian concerns - openly, publicly, without any concerns about any countermeasures from the enemy, who will also receive this information,' Putin said. 'Why without any concerns? Because there are currently no countermeasures for this weapon at this moment.' Putin warned the West that Russia is prepared to face any developments and will always have an answer. 'We have always preferred, and are now ready to resolve all disputes through peaceful means, but we are also ready for any development,' he said. 'If anyone still doubts this, they shouldn’t.

ICC Issues Arrest Warrants for Israel’s Netanyahu, Gallant over W...	The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense chief for committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. In their decision, the ICC judges said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant were criminally responsible for acts including murder, persecution and starvation as a weapon of war as part of a 'widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza'. The decision was met with outrage in 'Israel', which called it shameful and absurd. Hamas welcomed the warrants, and a senior official told Reuters it was a first step towards justice. 'Israel' has rejected the jurisdiction of the Hague-based court and denied war crimes in Gaza. The United States, Israel's main supporter, is also not a member of the ICC. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan had announced on May 20 that he was seeking arrest warrants for crimes connected to the Israeli military response in Gaza. Israeli leaders have dismissed allegations that they committed war crimes. The court does not have its own police force to carry out arrests and relies on its 124 member states for that. Whether they are arrested or not depends on the member states. They have an obligation to do so but the court has only limited diplomatic means to force them if they do not want to. REACTIONS Netanyahu's office said the ICC decision was 'anti-semitic' and he will 'not yield to pressure, will not be deterred' until Israel's war objectives are met. The ICC has 'lost all legitimacy' after issuing the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said. 'A dark moment for the International Criminal Court,' Saar said on X, adding that it had issued 'absurd orders without authority'. There was no immediate comment from Gallant. The White House said Washington 'fundamentally rejects' the ICC decision, adding that they are 'deeply concerned by the Prosecutor’s rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision'. 'The United States has been clear that the ICC does not have jurisdiction over this matter,' a National Security Council spokesperson said. In a statement, Hamas welcomed the warrants against Gallant and Netanyahu and urged the court to expand accountability to all Israeli leaders. Senior Hamas official Basem Naim told Reuters the warrants against the Israelis were an important step towards bringing justice for the victims. 'But it remains a limited and spiritual step if it was not backed practically by all countries to get this decision implemented in compliance with law and justice,' he said. The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the decision was not a political one but made by a court and thus should be respected and implemented. 'The tragedy in Gaza has to stop,' Borrell said. Jordan's foreign minister Ayman Safadi also said the ICC's decision must be implemented, adding that the Palestinians deserved justice after what he termed Israel's 'war crimes' in Gaza. The Netherlands' foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp said his country was prepared to act upon the warrants, Dutch news agency ANP reported. In the United States, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, said: 'The Court is a dangerous joke. It is now time for the U.S. Senate to act and sanction this irresponsible body.' Israel's 13-month campaign in Gaza has killed about 44,000 Palestinians and displaced nearly all the enclave's population while creating a humanitarian crisis, Gaza officials say.

Hezbollah’s Epic Fight in Khiam Obliges Israeli Forces to Withdra...	The most eloquent description of the Islamic Resistance fight in the South Lebanon town of Khiam was posted by Al-Manar correspondent Ali Shoeib who said that usually the invading force leave an exit corridor for the defenders to depart the attacked area, but that Hezbollah fighters left the exit corridor to escape from Khiam. According to media reports, the Israeli occupation forces withdrew from Khiam due to the strikes of Hezbollah fighters. This epic fight performed by Hezbollah fighters has so far frustrated the Israeli invasion schemes which seem to be limitless amid the enemy's desperate attempts to occupy and control swathes of territories in South Lebanon. The enemy troops managed merely to advance through incursion lines away from the resistance fire into Shamaa without controlling neither the targeted village nor the towns behind it on the borders with occupied Palestine. In this regard, Hezbollah Operation Room issued a statement regarding the clash with an 'Israeli' force in the town of Tayr Harfa (supposed to be controlled by IOF)and the destruction of an armored vehicle. The Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance reports the following: - Islamic Resistance fighters observed an infiltration by an 'Israeli' army unit into a house on the western side of Tayr Harfa. - Our fighters opened fire on the house where the unit was stationed, using medium-range machine guns, followed by direct targeting of the house. This resulted in the partial destruction of the house on the unit inside. - An 'Israeli' force supported by an armored vehicle attempted to advance to evacuate the casualties from the site. - The armored vehicle was targeted with direct fire, leading to its destruction. Our fighters then combed the targeted area using machine guns. (Statement No. 17, issued at 7:29 pm yesterday). - Hours after the incident, the 'Israeli' army acknowledged of four soldiers being killed with injuries to several others. Meanwhile, 'Israeli' media reported the death of six soldiers in the ambush. - Among the casualties were an officer and a soldier from the 13th Battalion (Golani), a soldier from the 'Maglan' Unit, and an archaeologist accompanying the force under the supervision of the brigade commander to 'study the area,' as stated by the 'Israeli' army.

The United States' veto of a United Nations resolution calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip serves as a 'license' for the Israeli regime to continue its 'bloody wars' in the region, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said on Thursday. In a scathing rebuke, Baghaei condemned the 'disgraceful' US move, which blocked the draft resolution that had secured 14 votes in favor at the 15-member UN Security Council. He said the veto 'not only marks another failure of [the] UNSC to uphold its Charter-based mandate but also serves as a U.S.-granted license for the occupying regime to continue its carnage in Gaza and Lebanon with impunity.'

‘Israel’ Lies: Archeologist Killed in South Lebanon Wasn’t 'Civil...	Israeli archeologist was killed along with an Israeli soldier in south Lebanon on Wednesday, as the family of the researcher disputed the occupation military’s count that he was a civilian. Ze'ev (Jabo) Hanoch Erlich, 71, was killed along with a soldier of Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion, with an officer and another soldier being injured in south Lebanon’s western sector. Israeli media cited an initial investigation into the incident found that a force led by Golani Brigade Chief of Staff Brig. Gen. Yoav Yarom entered the area where the brigade was operating. Israeli soldier was killed along with researcher Ze'ev (Jabo) Hanoch Erlich in south Lebanon (Wednesday, November 20, 2024). The force reached an ancient fort considered an archaeological site, the probe found, adding that two Hezbollah fighters who were hiding at the scene opened fire at the force, killing Erlich. Yarom was wounded, while another soldier was seriously injured in the confrontation. The head of the IDF Personnel Directorate decided to recognize Erlich as an IDF casualty. The occupation army said the incident was 'severe' and will be investigated, claiming that Erlich entered the battlefield as a 'civilian' was not authorized as needed by the commanders of the division and command, but was allowed by Yarom. However, the researcher’s brother, Yigal Amitai disputed the occupation military’s claim. 'Contrary to the IDF spokesperson’s claims, we clarify that Jabo was enlisted and treated in the field as a soldier,' Amitai told Ynet. 'He was fully recognized as a soldier, entering Lebanon with the IDF’s approval and accompaniment, albeit for archaeological research, as he always did in Judea and Samaria,' Amitai said referring to the Hebrew name of the occupied West Bank. He said he last spoke with Erlich on Wednesday morning before his entry into Lebanon. 'At 11 a.m., he told me, ‘We’re going into Lebanon,’' Amitai added, accusing the Israeli army spokesperson of 'shielding senior officers while shifting blame onto mid-level ranks'. The Israeli occupation army also announced the death of an Israeli soldier, of the Maglan commando unit, and the injury of another, in an alleged building collapse in another incident in south Lebanon, raising the toll of Wednesday battles in south Lebanon to 3 Israelis killed and 3 wounded.

Sheikh Qassem: Beirut versus Central Tel Aviv	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem stressed on Wednesday that the Resistance will certainly emerge victorious from the ongoing battle when it prevents the Zionist enemy from achieving its goals. In a televised speech, Sheikh Qassem hailed the soul of the martyred leader Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, underlining his pivotal role in presiding over Hezbollah Executive Council concerned with the educations, social, economic and medical files. Sheikh Qassem added that the Israeli enemy launched an aggression on the Lebanese capital, Beirut, assassinating the icon of the jihadi and resistance media and Head of Hezbollah Media Relations Department, Martyr Hajj Mohammad Afif. Regarding the aggression on Beirut, Sheikh Qassem maintained that Israeli enemy should understand that Central Tel Aviv will pay the price for any aggression on Beirut. 'We may never abandon Beirut under strikes.' Do not falter in pursuit of the enemy—if you are suffering, they too are suffering. But you can hope to receive from Allah what they can never hope for. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.

His eminence affirmed that Hezbollah has been keen on supporting Gaza, taking into consideration Lebanon's circumstances. 'We are proud to be among the few who have supported Gaza amid a listless world, except for Iraq, Yemen, and Iran.' Sheikh Qassem noted that it is true that the Israeli strikes have been painful, yet that Hezbollah has enough cadres who are formidable in might. His eminence clarified that Hezbollah had accepted Biden-Macron ceasefire proposal, yet that the Israeli enemy assassinated the Secretary General. Hezbollah restored its well-being in all the domains after the assassination of the Secretary General, Sheikh Qassem said. Sheikh Qassem indicated that Hezbollah has been fighting in 'Formidable in Might' Battle to confront the Zionist all-out war on Lebanon for two months after the battle of supporting Gaza. After two months of the Israeli all out war on Lebanon, the Resistance showed a mythical steadfastness, his eminence affirmed. Commenting on the news reports about Israeli invasion of some villages in South Lebanon, Sheikh Qassem noted that the Resistance is not a classical army, yet fights the enemy wherever it advances. 'Check their losses and where the resistance confronts them.' Sheikh Qassem confirmed that ‘Israel’ may never defeat Hezbollah and impose its terms on Lebanon, adding that the Islamic Resistance is ready for a long battle. 'We are left with the two choices of war and humiliation; humiliation is far from us!' Sheikh Qassem went on to say that Hezbollah will not speak publicly about its notes pertaining to Hochstein’s proposal submitted to the Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, adding that let it be known that Hezbollah will continue its military battle along with the ongoing negotiations. Hezbollah leader greeted the mujahideen (the Islamic Resistance fighters) and the honorable people (the resistance supporters), stressing that this is the great model of embracing the resistance. Sheikh Qassem asserted that Hezbollah will continue the battle regardless of the costs which will rise with respect to the enemy as well 'When we prevent the enemy from reaching its goals, we emerge from the battle victorious/' Regarding the Lebanese politics, Hezbollah Secretary General stressed Hezbollah would contribute to the presidential elections and the public life in the framework of Taif Accord. Hezbollah will present in the resistance field and politics simultaneously in order to protect and build up the nation, Sheikh Qassem emphasized.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2272921	2024-11-20T07:58:06-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-099385300173211828010.jpg

Gaza Genocide Continues as Death Toll Rises on 411th Day of Israe...	411 days into the ongoing genocide against the people of the Gaza Strip. For the past 47 days, ‘Israel’ has escalated its so-called 'military operation' in northern Gaza, which is in reality an advanced phase of the year-long campaign of mass destruction across the entire territory. ‘Israel’ has mobilized three combat brigades there, ruthlessly pursuing a 'scorched earth' policy through horrific daily airstrikes, shelling, and ground attacks on residential areas in Beit Lahia, Jabalia, Beit Hanoun, and elsewhere.

However, a heated debate has emerged within Israeli media circles about the military's limited achievements, 'particularly in light of the continued qualitative confrontation and the ongoing ability to rebuild and restore' by the Palestinians. This comes as an Israeli occupation army lieutenant colonel, the commander of the 90th Battalion in the Kfir Brigade, was reported injured in northern Gaza on Tuesday. At least 27 Israeli occupation soldiers have been killed in the Jabalia area since the start of the latest ground offensive. 12 more Palestinians martyred in an airstrike on a home in northern Gaza early Wednesday, and ongoing bombardment and raids across the Strip.

Hezbollah Ops Room Illustrates Failure of Israeli Ground Invasion...	The Islamic Resistance fighters have continued confronting the Israeli aggression on Lebanon, inflicting heavy losses upon the enemy's soldiers, officers, and equipment along the border area as well as their deployment positions in occupied Palestine, the Islamic Resistance Operations Room introduced its statement summing the latest developments of the battlefield. The statement summarized the most important developments in the main field confrontations between the Islamic Resistance and the Israeli enemy: 1. Haifa Qualitative Operation: - Haifa qualitative missile operation is part of the promise made by the Islamic Resistance Operations Room to intensify and escalate the 'Khaibar' series of special operations. It also serves to refute the claims of enemy leaders regarding the destruction of the Resistance's missile force. - Through this operation, the Resistance affirms its ability to target enemy military bases of various types simultaneously and with large salvos of precise missiles, which rained down on the occupied city of Haifa and successfully hit their targets. - The operation achieved its objectives, with Resistance missiles striking the five announced military bases, forcing over 300,000 settlers into shelters. - Settlers are paying the price for the 'Israeli' enemy army’s strategy of placing military bases within settlements and occupied cities, near commercial and economic interests. - The Resistance has prepared itself to ensure its readiness and capability to conduct such operations in Haifa and beyond [beyond] Haifa, over a time frame that the enemy does not anticipate. 2. The Enemy's Declaration of the Second Phase of the Ground Operation in Southern Lebanon: - Following a 40% retreat in the 'Israeli' enemy army’s air and ground operations in the border area, due to its inability to establish control within Lebanese territory, the enemy rushed to announce the second phase of its ground operation in southern Lebanon. - The Islamic Resistance Operations Room confirms that the concentrated and strategic defensive operations it carried out during the 'first phase' of the enemy's ground operations forced its forces to retreat beyond the border in some areas and denied them the ability to stabilize in most of the border towns. - The 'Israeli' enemy's air force continues to attack border villages —which it claims to control—with dozens of airstrikes by warplanes and drones daily, regardless of the artillery shelling and sweeping with machine guns from border positions targeting many of these villages. These assaults confirm the enemy's failure to establish control within Lebanese territory. The recent attempts to advance toward areas south of Al-Khiam—where they previously attempted to enter but were forced to withdraw under the blows of the fighters—further demonstrate the failure of the first phase. - Since the start of the ground operation until the date of this statement, our heroic fighters have carried out over 350 operations against 'Israeli' enemy forces on Lebanese territories, and more than 600 fire operations targeting the zones of responsibility of 'Israeli' military divisions on occupied Palestinian territories, causing significant losses to the enemy army. - To the officers and soldiers of the 'Israeli' enemy army, we affirm that what happened to Battalion 51 of the Golani Brigade at the outskirts of the Ainata – Maroun Al-Ras – Aitaroun triangle is just the beginning, and between us and you there are the days, the nights, and the battlefield. As our most sacred martyr [His Eminence Martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah] said: 'You will enter vertically and leave horizontally.' 3. Ground Engagements: - Western Sector: - 'Israeli' enemy forces advanced toward the town of Shamaa in the western sector in an attempt to seize control and pressure the second-line towns of the front, aiming to reduce the Resistance’s missile strikes on the city of Nahariya and the Haifa area in occupied Palestine. - Enemy forces infiltrated from Al-Labbuneh forests, passing through the forests of Alma Al-Shaab and Tayr Harfa, heading toward Shamaa. - The advancing forces fell into a series of ambushes prepared by our fighters on the outskirts of the town and within it. - As a crew, including an armored company, attempted to advance toward the vicinity of the town’s mosque and municipal building (east of the UNIFIL site), our fighters targeted them with guided missiles, destroying two Merkava tanks and a bulldozer accompanying the force. Additionally, a guided missile targeted an infantry force near the shrine of Prophet Shamoun Al-Safa in the town center, resulting in several casualties. - Close-range clashes occurred between our fighters and enemy forces around the shrine, the municipal building, the mosque, and the outskirts of the town. These engagements, which involved machine guns, hand grenades, and rocket-propelled grenades, took place over five times, causing significant casualties among enemy forces. 'Israeli' evacuation units responded by dispatching two helicopters for rescue and evacuation, utilizing flares to identify their location near the town’s school. - On the western outskirts of Al-Jibein, our fighters targeted a Merkava tank with a guided missile, killing and wounding its crew. The area was then shelled with 120mm and 81mm mortar rounds. - The Resistance’s missile units targets enemy soldier positions and military equipment along this axis with dozens of missile salvos and artillery shells. Central Sector: Ainata – Maroun Al-Ras – Aitaroun Triangle: Refuting the 'Israeli' enemy’s narrative regarding the ambush that ensnared its forces at the Ainata – Maroun Al-Ras – Aitaroun triangle, and to document the heroics of our fighters on the battlefronts, the Islamic Resistance Operations Room announces the following: - At dawn on Wednesday, November 13, 2024, our fighters detected a force from Battalion 51 of the Golani Brigade belonging to Division 36 infiltrating from the border area between Aitaroun and Maroun Al-Ras toward the southeastern outskirts of Bint Jbeil aiming to conduct reconnaissance at the Ainata – Maroun Al-Ras – Aitaroun triangle. - Despite intense aerial bombardments by the 'Israeli' air force over the area, the enemy force fell into a well-planned ambush set by a group of Resistance fighters. - The enemy force reached the ambush site at 9:50 am, where a group of our fighters was positioned in a building damaged by the aggression and its surrounding area. - As the 'Israeli' force approached the 'kill zone', our fighters opened fire from all directions using machine guns, forcing the enemy to scatter in the place. - A portion of the hostile force entered a house in the region to protect itself from the fire of our fighters while the rest soldiers deployed around it. - Once the enemy stabilized in the house, and with the call of Labbaik Ya Nasrallah, [We are at your service O Nasrallah] our fighters targeted the house with several RPG rounds designed for personnel and armor, destroying parts of the building and killing those inside. - As the house collapsed, and amidst the panic among the remaining 'Israeli' enemy forces in its vicinity, our fighters opened fire on those who have remained from the force with machine guns. - The clashes continued for over three hours, during which evacuation operations took place under heavy smoke and cover fire. - The 'Israeli' army admitted that an officer and 5 soldiers from Battalion 51 of Golani Brigade were killed in addition to four being wounded. - No ground activity by the Israeli enemy army has been recorded in the area since the incident until this date. - It is worth noting that during July 2006 aggression, a force from Battalion 51 of the Golani Brigade fell into a Resistance ambush on the eastern outskirts of Bint Jbeil which resulted in 8 soldiers being killed and over 25 being wounded, marking it as one of the most significant battles in the Golani Brigade's history and one of the hardest-fought engagements of the 'Second Lebanon War'. Eastern Sector: - The enemy has intensified its aggression on Al-Khiam city and its surroundings over recent days, carrying out over 60 airstrikes and drone attacks, in addition to launching more than 130 artillery shells. This was in preparation for a renewed attempt to advance toward the city after its initial failure over ten days ago due to the severe blows inflicted by the fighters. - Our fighters engaged with the advancing forces as they reached Wata Al-Khiam area south of the city, using machine guns and rocket shells. They also targeted two Merkava tanks with guided missiles, setting them ablaze and killing and wounding those inside. - Following a series of concentrated missile operations and direct clashes with the advancing forces from the eastern and southern directions of Al-Khiam, the enemy, facing heavy losses and under the relentless strikes of the fighters, partially retreated from the positions it had advanced to for the second time. The statement also illustrated the enemy losses in the ongoing ground battle between the Islamic Resistance and the Israeli enemy: Since the 'Israeli' enemy announced the start of the 'second phase' of its ground operation in southern Lebanon on November 12, 2024, the Islamic Resistance fighters have documented the following losses: - Over 18 killed and 32 wounded (some critically) among enemy troops. - Destruction of five Merkava tanks and one military bulldozer. So the cumulative losses of the 'Israeli' enemy from October 1, 2024, to the date of this statement are as follows: - Over 110 killed and more than 1,050 wounded among enemy officers and soldiers. - Destruction of 48 Merkava tanks, 9 military bulldozers, 2 Hummer vehicles, 2 armored vehicles, and 2 troop carriers. - Downing of 6 'Hermes 450' drones, 2 'Hermes 900' drones, and 1 'Quadcopter' glider. It is noteworthy that these figures do not include the enemy's losses at its bases, military sites, barracks, settlements, or occupied cities.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2271678	2024-11-19T11:16:08-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-09014400017320436769.jpg
Battlefield Has the Final Say: Hezbollah Responds with Fire, Stri...	As the indirect talks aimed at reaching a ceasefire in Lebanon are underway on Tuesday, Hezbollah went ahead to record epic battles and game-changing missile strikes against the Zionist entity, sending clear message that the fire is met with fire and that the battlefield has the final say. The Lebanese resistance group shot down a new Israeli drone on Tuesday, as it struck the occupied Israeli cities of Tel Aviv, Safed and Karmiel and kept up its rocket attacks against Israeli forces across the border between Lebanon and the occupied Palestinian territories.

In support for the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and resistance, the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out an operation targeting the ship 'Anadolu S' in the Red Sea with a number of appropriate ballistic and naval missiles. The naval hit was accurate and direct, the Yemeni military spokesman General Yahya Sarea said. The ship was targeted because it did not respond to the warnings of the naval forces and because the company that owns it violated the ban decision of entry to the ports of occupied Palestine, General Sarea added. The Yemeni Armed Forces confirmed the continuation in imposing a naval blockade on the Israeli enemy and targeting all ships linked , heading , or dealing with it as well as their continuation in targeting the Israeli enemy with missiles and drones, and that these operations will not stop until the aggression stops, the siege on the Gaza Strip is lifted, and the aggression on Lebanon stops. بيان القوات المسلحة اليمنية بشأن استهداف سفينة 'Anadolu S' في البحر الأحمر بعدد من الصواريخ الباليستية والبحرية المناسبة، وذلك لعدم استجابتها لتحذيرات القوات البحرية ولانتهاك الشركة المالكة لها قرار حظر الدخول إلى موانئ فلسطين المحتلة. pic.twitter.com/MXbfx1CgMQ — العميد يحيى سريع (@army21ye) November 19, 2024	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2271414	2024-11-19T06:37:44-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2019/09/manar-06187460015686244773.jpg
Gaza genocide continues for the 410th day, Catastrophic Condition...

The occupation forces also continue for the 28th day to forcibly disrupt the work of civil defense in the areas of the northern Gaza Strip due to the ongoing Israeli targeting and aggression, thus leaving thousands of citizens there without humanitarian and medical care.

Two Palestinians died of their wounds in the bombing of the central and southern Gaza Strip. An infant was also killed as a result of enemy artillery shelling that targeted Palestinian homes north of Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip. According to the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, Hussam Abu Safiya, the healthcare crisis in northern Gaza is rapidly deteriorating. 'Every day that passes since the beginning of the genocide in the northern governorate, the situation is getting worse. The health system is still in a state of disaster, and we are providing services at a minimum level,' he said. Abu Safiya confirmed the dire shortage of medical capabilities in the region, noting that Israel continues to block the arrival of critical medical delegations. 'Cases of malnutrition have begun to arrive at the hospital, most of them children and the elderly due to famine,' he added, warning that 'the risk of death threatens the lives of elderly patients due to the depletion of medicine and the spread of famine in northern Gaza.' The hospital director also reported that 'injured people are losing their lives daily due to the lack of doctors and medicines in the hospital.' This crisis has only worsened with the recent destruction of the only hospital in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, by the enemy. The worsening healthcare situation in Gaza is a direct result of the ongoing Israeli blockade and military attacks, which have crippled the region's medical infrastructure and left its most vulnerable populations without access to life-saving care.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2271337	2024-11-19T05:22:13-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-08604690017306480946.jpg
Lebanon Stands Firm against Israeli Conditions in Under-Fire Ceas...	Lebanon has been firmly standing against the Israeli conditions during talks aimed at reaching a ceasefire. The Israeli enemy has been escalating its attacks in the latest days with at least 3 strikes targeting the capital Beirut on Sunday and Monday, in attacks that described by observers as a direct message of pressure and negotiations that are under fire. The latest strike on Beirut was on Monday evening, when an aerial attack targeted a center for humanitarian aids in a densely populated residential area, killing at least five people, including a mayor and his assistant, and injuring many others. In a new push for a ceasefire between Lebanon and the Zionist entity, US envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut on Tuesday, a day after Lebanon handed its response to the US ceasefire proposal. Hochstein met with Lebanese officials including Speaker Nabih Berri, caretaker PM Najib Mikati and Army Commander Joseph Aoun. US envoy AMos Hochstein and Lebanese Speaker Nabih Berri in Beirut (October 21, 2024). Meanwhile, and despite reports on 'optimism' over reaching a deal, caution still prevails ‘Israel Can’t Be Trusted’ Al-Araby Al-Jadeed newspaper quoted sources close to Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri as saying that the Zionist entity 'cannot be trusted,' and that Beirut is negotiating under fire and constant escalation. 'Although the atmosphere is somewhat positive, it cannot be built upon or taken into account, whether for previous experiences with the enemy on the Lebanese level, the latest of which was the American-French initiative, or the truce path in Gaza,' the sources said. 'The enemy is resorting to escalation, expanding its targets, and attacking civilians and civil defense. On Sunday, it also attacked the Lebanese army in the south, which indicates its criminality, intentions, and attempt to exert pressure with force of fire to impose its conditions,' according to the sources. Conditions As for details of the US ceasefire proposal, Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar reported on Tuesday that the US, Lebanon and the Zionist entity kept the draft proposal confidential. However, leaks revealed that it includes 12 points, and that the points of contention are two: The first is related to the 'principle of self-defense,' which the draft calls for adopting as a right for both parties (Lebanon and the Zionist entity), while the second is related to the membership of the committee overseeing the implementation of the UN Resolution 1701, according to the Lebanese daily. Lebanon believes that the 'right to self-defense' is guaranteed by the international laws and cannot be included in a ceasefire deal, and that Tel Aviv’s insistence on it conceals a desire to obtain so-called 'legitimacy' for any hostile action against Lebanon under the pretext of 'self-defense', Al-Akhbar added, stressing that Beirut categorically rejects such conditions. Regarding the committee overseeing the implementation of 1701, Al-Akhbar reported that Lebanon has reservations about the membership of Britain and Germany and about the working mechanism of this committee. Hezbollah Stance Earlier on Monday, Member of Hezbollah’s Loyalty to Resistance parliamentary bloc, MP Ihab Hamade stressed that the stance on the ceasefire has 3 constants: 'Adherence to Resolution 1701 without any amendment, safeguarding Lebanese sovereignty, and ensuring that the enemy gains nothing politically it couldn’t achieve militarily.' 'We seek a ceasefire and remain open to dialogue, but we are not begging for any agreement; our focus is on the battlefield,' the Lebanese lawmaker added. #Israeli Army Took 7 Days to Reach #Beirut in 1982, Battling #Hezbollah on Border for 40 Days in 2024 #جنوب_لبنان #المقاومة_الاسلامية pic.twitter.com/kC1pDx1Oj5 — ManarWeb (@WebManar) November 9, 2024 In his latest speech, Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem stressed that Speaker Nabih Berri is leading Lebanon’s talks, along with PM Najib Mikati, stressing that Lebanon will never accept any deal that violate its sovereignty.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2271172	2024-11-19T04:35:21-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-02967310017320196763.jpg
