The ceremony saw participation from political, military, social, and community leaders, followed by Friday prayers led by Imam Khamenei. Imam Khamenei delivered two sermons, one in Persian language while the other in Arabic language, in a bid to address the entire Muslim nation, especially the Lebanese and Palestinian people. He warned that Tyrants aim to sow division and discord among Muslims as part of their arrogant policy, stressing that the Muslim nation has become aware today and can overcome these schemes against the enemies of Muslims. 'The policies adopted by our enemy is to sow the seeds of division and sedition, to drive a wedge among all the Muslims. They are the same enemies to the Palestinians, Lebanese, Egyptians, and the Iraqis. They are the enemy to the Yemeni and Syrian people,' the Leader told the large crowd. 'Our enemy is one,' his eminence affirmed, addressing thousands of worshipers carrying portraits of Sayyed Nasrallah and Ismail Haniyeh, former Hamas chief, who was assassinated by the Zionist enemy last July. On the Iranian missile attack which took place on Tuesday, the Leader stressed that what Tehran did is the minimal punishment for the Zionist entity in response to its horrific crimes. ‚ö°Ô∏èüáÆüá∑Iran‚Äôs supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei: The actions taken by our armed forces were the least punishment for the occupying Zionist regime in the face of the crimes, the unbelievable crimes committed by that regime, that bloodthirsty regime, that wolfish regime, that rabid‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/dW3dQrmyIX ‚Äî Suppressed News.

'We are all deeply saddened by the martyrdom of our dear Sayyed but consolation does not mean despair and confusion.' He affirmed, meanwhile, that 'Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah‚Äôs body has departed, but his spirit, principles, and resonant voice will remain with us forever.' 'The cowardly enemy, unable to deliver a decisive blow to the resistance‚Äôs cohesive structure, resorts to feigning victory through assassinations, killing civilians and breaking their hearts,' the Leader said. üáÆüá∑| Ayatollah Khamenei switched to Arabic in a message meant for the Arabic audience: ‚Ä¢ Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah's body may have left us, but his character, path, and voice remain and will continue to exist. ‚Ä¢ The dear people of Lebanon and Palestine are the special audience.‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/jHWNSoqxLD ‚Äî Arya - ÿ¢ÿ±€åÿß (@AryJeay) October 4, 2024 'Hezbollah is truly a good tree.

He assured that the Zionist entity 'is rootless and unstable, barely surviving with US support, but, God willing, it will not endure.' 'The resistance in the region will not back down, even as its fighters are martyred; it will emerge victorious,' Imam Khamenei said. Imam Khamenei said the Islamic Republic won‚Äôt 'procrastinate or rush to carry out its duty' in confronting the Zionist entity. 'The Palestinian people have a lawful right to defend themselves. To stand up to those criminals ‚Äì the occupation forces. There is not a single court or international organization that can blame the Palestinian people for simply defending their homeland,' his eminence said. The Leader stressed that every country has the right to defend itself from aggressor, stating: 'Muslim nations have to prepare their defense against the common enemy.' Imam Khamenei also affirmed that Hamas‚Äôs Operation Al-Aqsa Flood on October 7 attack and Iran‚Äôs recent ballistic missile strike were 'legal and legitimate'. 'Each and every country, each and every people have the ultimate right to defend themselves against the ultimate tyranny,' the Leader told the cheering crowd.

‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô Launches Massive Air Raid on Beirut‚Äôs Suburb	Dozens of Israeli air raid targeted residential areas in the southern suburb of Beirut, specifically Mrayjeh, igniting a series of loud explosions that reverberated throughout the city. Witnesses reported that the blasts were so powerful they could be heard as far away as Sidon and Tyre. The strikes occurred in proximity to Beirut International Airport. Notably, the focused site is situated in a densely populated residential neighborhood, raising concerns over civilian safety. Additional bombings were also reported in areas close to residential regions and a school in Hadath, further amplifying fears of collateral damage. As the night wore on, around 3:00 AM local time, media reported flames rising from the location of the airstrikes, while Israeli drones continued to patrol overhead, leaving residents in a state of heightened anxiety. Sources indicate that the targeted locations included hospitals and emergency service facilities, marking one of the most severe assaults in the ongoing conflict. Israeli airstrikes have intensified dramatically in recent days, with reports of nearly 20 bombings occurring within a single day. The Israeli occupation military appears to be conducting these operations in the dead of night, intensifying the terror experienced by civilians in the affected areas. These air raids are part of a broader campaign that has included attempts at incursions into Lebanese border towns. However, the Islamic Resistance group in Lebanon has managed to thwart several of these attempts, inflicting significant losses on Israeli occupation forces; just on Thursday, 17 soldiers were reportedly ambushed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2218779	2024-10-04T00:40:08-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-07017690017280276044.jpg
Watch Hezbollah Missiles Striking Mossad Headquarters in Tel Aviv	Hezbollah Military Media released a video which shows footage of the Islamic Resistance's operation targeting the Galilot Base and the Mossad headquarters north of Tel Aviv as part of the 'Khaibar Operations' series against the 'Israeli' enemy army. Hezbollah fighters have fiercely repelled all Israeli attempts to cross in Lebanon‚Äôs territory on Thursday, with Islamic Resistance heroes turning the border area with occupied Palestine into a graveyard for the Zionists. An Islamic Resistance battlefield source told Al-Manar that so far, all Israeli attempts to infiltrate into the Lebanese territory have failed, and that Hezbollah fighters have inflicted heavy losses upon the Zionist troops. 'Hezbollah fighters have repelled all Israeli attempts to advance in several axes in southern Lebanon,' the source told Al-Manar, noting that the resistance fighters have employed different kinds of weapons. 'Resistance‚Äôs prepared ambushes are inflicting heavy losses on Israeli soldiers,' according to the source. A field officer in the operations chamber of the Islamic Resistance stated: 'The explosives detonated by the fighters of the Islamic Resistance today, Thursday, October 3, 2024, against the Israeli elite forces that attempted to advance in the outskirts of the towns of Maroun al-Ras and Yaroun resulted in the deaths and injuries of more than 20 officers and soldiers. These explosives were recently planted based on the monitoring and tracking of the enemy‚Äôs movements by the fighters, with some being planted just hours before the detonation.' The officer added that the fighters of the Islamic Resistance managed to plant these explosives along potential advance routes of the enemy‚Äôs elite soldiers at the Lebanese-Palestinian border. This occurred amid the mobilization and buildup of 'Israeli' enemy forces at their positions and military barracks across the border, alongside the heavy presence of reconnaissance aircraft in the skies over the area.'

Houthi: Israeli Enemy Saw Sayyed Nasrallah as Main Barrier Hinder...	Head of Yemen's Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi addressed 'the great Israeli crime of targeting and killing the martyr of Islam and humanity, the martyr of Jerusalem, Al-Aqsa, and Palestine, His Eminence the Secretary-General of Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah (may Allah be pleased with him).' In a televised speech, Houthi stressed that Sayyed Nasrallah's martyrdom wounds the entire Islamic Umma as His Eminence had a great role, Islamic symbolism, and global, regional, and local significance and impact. Confronting the Zionist enemy and inflicting defeats upon it topped Sayyed Nasrallah's role, Houthi said, adding that for over 40 years, Sayyed Nasrallah had been present in the field of jihad, effectively confronting the Zionist threat with a distinguished stance and great performance. 'Sayyed Nasrallah maintained strong communication with the people, striving to clarify the truths to those he considered the major support in the field and in stance. The impact of Sayyed Nasrallah on the enemy's populace was evident, and the enemy viewed him as possessing high competence in fulfilling his duties and responsibilities.' The Israeli enemy recognized Sayyed Nasrallah as a formidable leader, endowed with courage, faith, insight, wisdom, determination, and steadiness in his stance, Houthi said, adding that the targeting of Sayyed Nasrallah stemmed from an 'Israeli' desire to eliminate what they view as a major barrier to their ambitions in controlling Palestine, Lebanon, and the broader region. 'Sayyed Nasrallah had a significant and pioneering role in thwarting the American and Israeli conspiracy to stir sectarian strife among Muslims. The dangerous destructive project aimed at inciting strife among Muslims and tearing them apart is one of the most serious American and Israeli conspiracies intended to destroy the Ummah.' 'Sayyed Nasrallah paid great attention to fostering friendly and brotherly relations among Muslims, and his efforts in this regard are well-known.' The Israeli enemy's targeting of Sayyed Nasrallah is aimed at undermining Hezbollah's role and the Lebanese front in confronting the Israeli enemy and supporting the Palestinian people, Houthi affirmed. 'The Israeli enemy failed even when targeting specific leaders or prominent figures of Hezbollah or committing mass murder, Houthi noted, 'The conspiracies against the Lebanese front were not carried out by the 'Israelis' alone; the Americans were always involved.' 'Had other Arab armies or entities, without a faithful approach, faced what Hezbollah did, they would have collapsed. Arab regimes and armies have collapsed in days, despite not facing the same level of difficulties as Hezbollah.' 'Hezbollah remains steadfast with a strong public support as well as a powerful and active front that cannot be toppled by storms and hardships.' Houthi maintained that, despite the great loss with the martyrdom of Sayyed Nasrallah, Hezbollah's path remains firm and enduring. Sayyed Nasrallah worked to instill the faithful, fighting, and Husseini spirit in every past stage, as an attitude, thought, awareness, and certainty, according to Houthi, who added that His Eminence worked on building the practical and organizational structure of the resisting Ummah, shaping it into Hezbollah's Ummah. Houthi emphasized that Hezbollah's structure is cohesive, being a faithful and jihadi entity that does not disintegrate or collapse in the face of storms, hardships, and sorrows. 'Hezbollah's supporters are also a strong, cohesive entity, facing challenges and ordeals. Hezbollah's supporters endured the Beirut port explosion, subsequent assassinations, and ongoing wide-scale destruction crimes in recent days.' 'The speech of His Eminence Sheikh Naim Qassem, Deputy Secretary-General of Hezbollah, expressed confidence, cohesion, and continued resilience.' The Israeli enemy resorted to a ground offensive, thinking the conditions were favorable for it and that Hezbollah's structure had collapsed, but it was surprised, maintained Houthi. 'The Israeli enemy was strongly and significantly shocked at Lebanon's borders with occupied Palestine and even within occupied locations.' 'The fighters in Hezbollah now have more motivation and drive after the martyrdom of the Secretary-General than they did before. The condition reflected in the reality of Hezbollah's fighters is not one of collapse, incapacity, failure, or weakness; rather, it is determination, resolve, and a commitment to performing the great honorable duty.' The Islamic Republic of Iran has carried out the largest missile strike the 'Israeli' enemy has faced since it began occupying Palestine, said Houthi, adding that the Iranian missile strikes covered an area spanning across occupied Palestine, reached the vicinity of Ashkelon, focused on military bases and espionage centers. 'The Second True Promise operation was in fulfillment of the Islamic Republic's commitment after the Israeli enemy's assassination of the martyr of the Islamic Ummah, Ismail Haniyeh, and the targeting of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, may Allah's blessings be upon him, and the commander in the Revolutionary Guard.' 'The Second True Promise operation was successful, powerful, and decisive, undeterred by American bases despite repeated claims that they would protect the Israeli enemy.' 'The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has carried out intense operations in recent days and is heading towards further escalation with high effectiveness,' Houthi said, 'The Yafa operation carried out by Al-Qassam Brigades shook the Israeli entity.' 'More American armed reconnaissance drones (MQ-9) were shot down, bringing the total to 11 of such drones this year.' Targeting Hodeidah by the 'Israeli' and American enemy will not stop our operations; our fight continues, Houthi underscored. Yemeni Armed Forces (YAF) have claimed responsibility for a drone operation targeting Tel Aviv, known to its residents as Yafa. Brigadier General Yahya Saree, the spokesperson for the YAF, announced that multiple drones successfully struck important targets within the city without interception from Israeli defense systems.

Empty Promises: Iran‚Äôs Pezeshkian Warns of Severe Consequences if...	Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian arrived in Qatar on Wednesday to attend the Asia Cooperation Dialogue summit, focusing on strategies to curtail Israeli aggression in the region. During a meeting with officials from the Hamas Political Bureau, Pezeshkian voiced strong criticism of Western nations, claiming they have repeatedly made empty promises to Iran while urging the country to exercise restraint in the face of ongoing conflict in Gaza. Pezeshkian warned that the relentless Israeli actions could provoke a severe response from Iran, stating, 'If Israel makes the slightest mistake, it should prepare for an even harsher reaction.' He also shared his deep sorrow over the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, highlighting it as one of the most painful events of his tenure, recalling that Haniyeh had been a guest at his inauguration. Pezeshkian criticized Western countries for making empty promises, saying they invited Iran to exercise self-restraint and refrain from giving a response to Israel‚Äôs July assassination of Haniyeh. Therefore, 'the continuation of the Zionist regime‚Äôs crimes made the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran to give a decisive response,' he added. The Iranian president condemned the atrocities perpetrated by ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô in Gaza and Lebanon, and lashed out at the United States and Western countries for pursuing hypocritical approaches, saying they back Israel while claiming to advocate democracy and human rights. These countries are constantly talking about human rights and human dignity, but they have proven that they are completely alien to these concepts as they are supporting the criminal Israeli regime, he said. 'People's lives, especially those of women and children, are of no value to them, and all their claims are lies,' Pezeshkian added. Furthermore, the Iranian president reiterated the need to foster coherence among Muslim nations, emphasizing that the lack of such unity has emboldened the Israeli regime to commit more crimes against the oppressed people of Palestine and Lebanon. He noted that the ongoing developments in the region are the outcome of lack of unity among Muslim states, saying, 'If Muslims had been united, the Zionist regime would not have dared commit such crimes.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2217921	2024-10-03T02:42:27-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-07888060017279485407.jpg

Al-Rudwan Forces to Israeli Elite Soldiers: You Can Either Die or...	Upon the start of the failed Israeli invasion on Lebanon, fighters of Hezbollah elite military unit, Al-Rudwan, clashed directly with the enemy soldiers, ambushing them and leaving deaths as well as numerous injuries, according to Israeli media reports. Dozens of Israeli soldiers were either killed or injured during the first day of the direct clash. In this regard, Islamic Resistance's military sources told Al-Jazeera TV Channel that all the Zionist soldiers who tried to invade South Lebanon were either killed or injured. 'The rest fled away.'

Al-Odaisseh Ambush Islamic Resistance's military sources also told Al-Mayadeen TV Channel about the ambush in Al-Odaisseh / Khallet al-Mahaffar on the Lebanese-Palestinian border, giving important details. 'In the early hours of Tuesday, 01-10-2024, the fighters of the Islamic Resistance observed reconnaissance movements by the Israeli enemy army in an uncovered area opposite the town of Al-Odaisseh, as part of scouting a possible advance path for enemy soldiers.' 'The fighters did not engage the recon force and let it complete its mission and return. Based on the movements and behavior of this force, the fighters were able to set up an advanced ambush in Al-Mahaffar - Al-Odaisseh area, awaiting the entry of elite forces to position themselves in one of the houses in the area.' 'At dawn on Wednesday, 02-10-2024, a force from the Israeli elite army began silently infiltrating the ambush area, numbering over 30 officers and soldiers.' When the 'Israeli' force reached the ambush point (not far from the border), the Resistance fighters shouted 'Labbayka ya Nasrallah,' and showered them with a hail of bullets and shells, according to the sources. 'The clash with the force reached point-blank range, resulting in numerous casualties and injuries among the infiltrating force, causing the soldiers to cry out in anguish over their dead and wounded.' 'Simultaneously, support groups in the Resistance targeted the enemy's supply lines in Misgav Am, Kfar Giladi , and Al-Metula with mortars and rockets, impeding reinforcements for the targeted force.' The 'Israeli' Air Force immediately intervened with helicopters to comb the area and evacuate the dead and wounded, while the enemy began launching smoke bombs, the sourced added. The Islamic Resistance promises its most sacred martyr, His Eminence Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah (peace be upon him), its loyal, brave, and generous people, and all the righteous martyrs, that it remains steadfast in defending the precious land of Lebanon according to the field plans overseen by its martyred leaders, according to the sources. The Islamic Resistance sources warned the enemy that what it witnessed today was just a tiny sample of what awaits them in every inch of southern Lebanese land if they dare to advance. 'Between us and this enemy are days, nights, and the battlefield.' Hezbollah‚Äôs Islamic Resistance continued its unwavering efforts to defend Lebanese territories and support the Gaza Strip. Since the early morning on Wednesday, the group‚Äôs valiant fighters confronted an Israeli occupation infantry force attempting to infiltrate Lebanese territory while also targeting gatherings of Zionist soldiers in the border areas.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2217404	2024-10-02T15:33:48-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04080290017279084089.jpg

Member of Loyalty to Resistance Parliamentary Bloc, MP Hasan Fadlallah stressed that the Israeli enemy, through its aggression on Lebanon ongoing for ten days, plotted to crush Hezbollah, defeat Lebanon, and change the political map of the entire Middle East. 'Israel' thought that the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and the aerial aggression on Lebanon would let it reach a major achievement, MP Fadlallah told Al-Mayadeen Channel, adding that the Iranian missile strike placed limits that could curb the Israeli barbarism. 'In 1992, the Israeli enemy assassinated Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Abbas Al-Moussawi and started a ground invasion of the liberated areas in South Lebanon. However, the Islamic Resistance fighters, led by martyr Sayyed Nasrallah, confronted the occupation forced and defeated it.' MP Fadlalah stressed that Hezbollah fighters will be able to defeat the enemy in accordance with the plans devised by martyr Sayyed Nasrallah. MP Al-Moussawi Loyalty to Resistance Parliamentary Bloc's Member, MP Ibrahim Al-Moussawi, stressed, in an interview with Al Jazeera TV Channel, that Hezbollah is defending Lebanon, warning of ultimate goals of Netanyahu's war.

Pezeshkian made the remarks standing alongside the Emir of Qatar in Doha in a joint press conference on Wednesday afternoon. He called for broadening of bilateral Tehran-Doha ties following talks with Qatari Emir. 'We are looking for the development of relations with the government of Qatar, and the common will of the two countries is to improve the level of cooperation,' he said. He expressed hope that the negotiations between his accompanying Iranian delegation with the Qatari side will result in the expansion of ties in all fields of transportation, culture, tourism, health and treatment, further hoping that 'We will be able to make joint investments.' 'The security of the region is the security of all Muslims. Since I was elected as the president, I have been looking for peace and tranquility. No country has been able to develop through war,' he further stressed. 'Israeli regime cannot continue atrocities if regional countries work hand in hand,' the Iranian president said. 'We are not looking for war; It is the Zionist regime that forced us to react,' he said in an apparent reference to the Tuesday missile attack on the Zionist entity. The Iranian president further warned the Israeli regime of a harsher response. He stressed the Zionist regime is seeking instability and insecurity in the region, calling on the US and Europe to stop the regime as war is in no one's interest. Upon his arrival at Doha airport on Wednesday, Pezeshkian referred to the assassination of the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran two months ago, noting that the US and European countries had asked Iran not to take any action, promising that they would bring peace to Gaza within a week. He emphasized that Iran‚Äôs decision to wait allowed the Zionist regime to expand its crimes and become more emboldened. Referring to establishing peace and security in the region, the Iranian president highlighted, 'It was Israel that assassinated Haniyeh in Tehran.' For his part, Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani called on the international community to stop the Zionist aggression on Lebanon, saying he supports regional and international efforts to reduce tensions and protect peace and security in the region. 'In recent days, we have warned about increasing tensions in Lebanon. The occupying regime must stop its oppressive war on Gaza, the West Bank, and Lebanon. Mediation is our strategic option.' Sheikh Tamim said they will continue their mediation efforts aimed at stopping the genocidal campaign in Gaza and securing the release of the captives.

Iran‚Äôs Tolerance Fades Following Assassination of Sayyed Nasralla...	Iran's top military commander stated that Iran had shown restraint following aggressive actions from ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô in July but could no longer remain patient after the assassination of Hezbollah Leader Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and a prominent Iranian general. Major General Mohammad Baqeri made this announcement on Wednesday after Operation True Promise II. The regime assassinated Ismail Haniyeh, former chief of the Political Bureau of the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas, during a targeted killing in the Iranian capital Tehran on July 31. 'After Martyr Haniyeh‚Äôs assassination, Iran went through a tough period of self-restraint amid repeated requests by the Americans and Europeans, who would ask us to exercise self-restraint so they would establish a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip (where the Israeli regime has been waging a genocidal war),' Bagheri said. 'However, after Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah‚Äôs and [Brigadier] General [Abbas] Nilforoushan‚Äôs martyrdom, the situation was no longer tolerable,' he added. Hezbollah Leader Sayyed Nasrallah and the Iranian commander were assassinated during intense Israeli airstrikes on the southern suburb of Beirut on Friday. On Tuesday, Iran responded to the triple assassinations as well as the regime‚Äôs ongoing deadly aggression against Gaza and Lebanon by launching hundreds of missiles toward the Zionist entity‚Äôs military and intelligence bases all over the occupied Palestinian territories.

According to Bagheri, the targets of the 'heroic' operation that 'served as a response to many of the Zionists‚Äô crimes,' included three of the Israeli regime‚Äôs main airbases. He named the bases as the headquarters of the regime‚Äôs Mossad spy agency, which he identified as the 'center for terrorism,' the regime‚Äôs Nevatim airbase that houses its F-35 warplanes, and the Hatzerim base that was used towards enabling Nasrallah‚Äôs assassination. The targets also featured the regime‚Äôs strategic radars, the centers housing the regime‚Äôs tanks and personnel carriers, and the center accommodating those of the regime‚Äôs forces that partake in massacres against Palestinians in Gaza. 'All Israeli infrastructures to be targeted if it repeats its atrocities' The military chief asserted that the Islamic Republic‚Äôs Armed Forces were completely prepared to respond to the potential repetition of such atrocities on the part of the regime, describing the forces‚Äô capabilities as 'many times more than' what was displayed during True Promise II. 'If the Zionist regime, which has reached madness, was not controlled by the United States and Europe, and sought to either continue its atrocities or take action against our territorial integrity and sovereignty, tonight‚Äôs operation would be repeated with multiple magnitude and all of their infrastructures would be struck.' He, however, hoped that the US would reverse its approach and stop the regime so the region could move towards experiencing calm. The General Staff of Iran‚Äôs Armed Forces also commented on the operation in a statement, saying it came in reaction to the regime‚Äôs disregard for the legitimate sovereign rights of the Islamic Republic. It praised the response as an instance of the country‚Äôs 'making any malicious aggressor, at any level, regret their actions.' The statement, meanwhile, warned the aggressive regime that 'it should expect the widespread and comprehensive destruction of its infrastructure within the occupied Palestinian lands if it responds [to the operation] in kind.' It finally cautioned the regime‚Äôs supporters, including the United States, against taking part in direct intervention against the Islamic Republic, saying such interference would warrant 'a powerful and regret-inducing response against their centers and interests across the region.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2215809	2024-10-02T03:00:23-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04726330017278632178.jpg
Yemeni Armed Forces launch Quds-5 cruise missiles deep into ‚ÄòIsra...	The missile force of the Yemeni Armed Forces (YAF) has launched a significant attack on military sites deep within the Israeli occupation territory using three Quds-5 cruise missiles, as confirmed by YAF spokesperson Brigadier General Yahya Saree on Wednesday. Saree emphasized that the Israeli occupation authorities have remained silent regarding the outcomes of this operation, which is declared as a show of support for the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and a demonstration of solidarity with their Resistance. In addition, the YAF extended their congratulations on Iran's Operation True Promise 2 against the Israeli occupation entity and expressed their readiness to partake in joint military actions in support of the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples, as well as in response to any Israeli aggression against their support fronts. Furthermore, the spokesperson issued a warning concerning the continued support of, The United States and Britain for ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô, stating that such support places American and British interests in the region at risk. Brigadier General Saree also underlined the YAF's unwavering determination to escalate their military operations against, ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô, and its supporters until the aggression on Gaza ceases, the blockade on the Strip is lifted, and the aggression on Lebanon comes to an end. The senior military source highlighted the Quds-5's exceptional features, including its high speed, formidable destructive power, and capability to penetrate all types of air defenses deployed in the region. Moreover, Saree hinted at the element of surprise associated with the Quds-5, drawing a parallel to the previous shock caused by the Quds-3 missile and indicating that further unexpected developments should be expected. This remarkable attack follows closely on the heels of Saree's announcement that the YAF's naval, missile, and UAV forces executed three separate military operations in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. The initial operation targeted the Cordelia Moon British oil tanker in the Red Sea, employing eight ballistic and cruise missiles, a drone, and an uncrewed surface boat, resulting in significant damage to the vessel. The subsequent operations took aim at the Marathopolis tanker in the Indian Ocean, utilizing a cruise missile and a drone to enforce the YAF's maritime ban on ships heading towards the occupied ports of Palestine. The YAF's UAV force had previously struck an Israeli military target in occupied Yafa (Eilat) using a Yafa-type drone, as well as other military targets in occupied Umm al-Rashrash (Eilat) with four Samad-4 drones, all of which achieved their objectives effectively.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2216062	2024-10-02T03:00:10-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/06/manar-00923210017183201212.jpg

Eight Zionists Dead in Jaffa Shooting, Many More Wounded	Six people were murdered and dozens were wounded in a terrorist shooting attack at a light rail station in Jaffa on Tuesday evening. Eight people were taken to Ichilov Medical Center with at least two in critical condition with head wounds and the others moderately to seriously wounded. Twelve wounded, including a child, were transferred to the Wolfson Medical Center; five were in serious condition. Security forces initially believed the incident was criminal because there has been a criminal shooting in the area nearly every day recently due to a well-known criminal living nearby, according to Maariv. Once they heard the shooting and shouts of 'Allahu Akbar,' the authorities arrived on the scene ready for a terror incident. Eyewitnesses described the terror and chaos. 'We were on the light rail when we suddenly heard gunfire from outside,' one witness said. 'At first, we thought it was fireworks, but then we realized it was something much worse. There were many gunshots. We dropped to the floor, and people were crying. I saw someone bleeding on the ground.' A nearby shop owner added, 'I saw crowds of people running and shouting ‚Äòterror attack.‚Äô I quickly closed my shutters and locked up.' The two attackers, Muhammad Chalaf Sahar Rajab and Hassan Muhammad Hassan Tamimi, from Hebron, were shot dead by members of a Tel Aviv-Jaffa Municipality security patrol unit and citizens using personal firearms, according to the police. Chaos in Tel Aviv's light rail Hanan Peretz, head of the local patrol unit, praised his team‚Äôs swift response. 'They identified the gunman, took cover without hesitation, and fired at him,' he said. 'It seems the attacker‚Äôs weapon malfunctioned during the shooting.' The police and security services are continuing their investigation into the attack, which took place near the Gush Dan Light Rail‚Äôs Erlich Station. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Police Commissioner Daniel Levy arrived at the scene, along with Tel Aviv District Commander Haim Sargrof. 'This is a difficult incident,' Sargrof said. 'At around 7 p.m., we received a report that two attackers had boarded the light rail and opened fire. They injured four people, then exited the train and continued shooting at civilians on the street. A light rail security guard, two officers from the municipal Sela Unit, and police officers shot at the attackers and neutralized both of them. We know their origin and are conducting further checks with the Shin Bet [Israel Security Agency]. They are not Israeli citizens.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2215622	2024-10-01T13:21:05-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-09163930017278140366.jpg
Iran‚Äôs Ballistic Missiles Strike ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô	The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps carried out a missile strike against the Israeli occupation entity on Tuesday evening. The IRGC said in a statement that it has targeted 'the heart of the occupied territories' in response to the martyrdom of Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh, Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, and IRGC general Abbas Nilforoushan at the hands of the Zionist regime. The statement said the retaliatory attack has been launched after a period of self-restraint following the violation of Iran‚Äôs sovereignty. The IRGC said it has fired tens of ballistic missiles at vital military and security Israeli targets. The IRGC has also warned the Zionist regime that if it intends to react militarily to Iran‚Äôs operation which conforms with Tehran‚Äôs legitimate rights and the international law, it will have to face subsequent 'crushing and devastating strikes'. Reports suggest that as many as 200 Iranian missiles have been fired during half an hour. Images released by the media outlets show a large number of projectiles over Tel Aviv a number of other cities across the occupied territories. Hamas Hamas Resistance Movement issued a statement to commend the Iranian missile strikes in response to the Zionist aggression against the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples. What follows is the text of Hamas Movement: In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, We commend the Iranian missile strikes in response to the Zionist aggression against the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples. The Islamic Resistance Movement - Hamas, expresses its support for the heroic missile launches executed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran, targeting large areas of our occupied lands. These strikes are a response to the ongoing crimes of the Zionist occupation against the peoples of the region and an act of retribution for the blood of our honored martyrs: the martyred fighter Ismail Haniyeh, His Eminence Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, and General Abbas Nilforoushan. We affirm that this honorable Iranian retaliation sends a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government, aiming to deter their continued terrorism. Their persistent violations of international law and humanitarian norms, as well as their crimes and arrogance, have exceeded all bounds. We take pride in our brothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran and deeply appreciate their stance against unchecked Zionist aggression. Their commitment to justice aligns with the struggles of the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and the broader interests of the Islamic Nation, embodied in ending the occupation and curbing the fascist Zionist enemy. We call on all countries, peoples, parties, and forces within the Arab and Islamic Nations to unite in confronting Zionist crimes and their expansionist project, which threatens us all. We urge collective efforts to liberate our lands and sacred sites from the defilement of the fascist occupation. The Islamic Resistance Movement - Hamas Hamas Palestinian resistance movement logo. Abu Ubaidah The spokesman of Al-Qassam Brigades, Abu Ubaidah, also issued a statement to commend the retaliatory strike that reached the heart of occupied Palestine, delivering a decisive blow to the criminal occupation, which mistakenly believes its rampant aggression in the region can continue without consequence. 'Today marks a pivotal moment in the history of the conflict, as the flames of the nation‚Äôs resistance converge in the skies over Palestine. Tel Aviv now faces the strikes of the Mujahideen from Yemen, Lebanon, Palestine, and Iran. This is a call to the entire nation, urging all to unite as a single arrow aimed at the liberation of Palestine.' Spokesman of Al-Qassam Brigades Abu Obeida during a speech broadcast on Facebook Live late Tuesday (July 23, 2019).	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2215567	2024-10-01T12:55:14-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-035383300172781248510.jpg

Furthermore, the Yemeni Armed Forces called upon all Arab and Islamic nations to break their silence and engage actively in this critical struggle. Saree remarked that the current moment marks the first anniversary of the initiation of this significant battle, asserting that it will persist until the anticipated victory is realized. Israeli media reported the launch of a hypersonic missile from Yemen aimed at 'Gush Dan,' which encompasses Tel Aviv, the central region, and a small portion of the southern region. A loud explosion was reportedly heard in Tel Aviv, prompting over one and a half million residents to seek shelter. In related news, the British Trade Operations Authority indicated that they received a report regarding an incident approximately 97 nautical miles northwest of the Yemeni city of Hodeidah, where a ship claimed to have been attacked by a drone boat.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2214830	2024-10-01T01:36:19-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/06/manar-00923210017183201212.jpg
Avenging Sayyed Nasrallah‚Äôs Blood Requires Achieving Palestine‚Äôs ...	The very heavy words about the martyrdom of Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah can never be up to the major challenges it poses. Shrewd plans and adept performance are necessary in order to reach the intended victory. Sayyed Nasrallah's lovers were aggrieved by the loss of the leader and the guide; however, their faith and patience helped them to accept Holy God's will and move on to the stage of consecrating the great martyrs objectives in a general framework to be followed. The main question that is raised in the aftermath of the Zionist massacre is focused on the manner of avenging Sayyed Nasrallah's blood. The Lebanese politician, Nasser Kandil, told Al-Manar TV that avenging Sayyed Nasrallah's blood necessitates working for achieving victory in Palestine through the eradication of the occupation entity. Kandil stressed, in an interview with the Resistance Channel, that observing the requirements of achieving victory is much more important that dealing a loud blow in order to take an emotional revenge. The editor-in-chief of Al-Binaa newspaper called for maintaining trust in the resistance and its choices established by the martyred leader, underlining the loyalty to the Resistance in accordance with the teachings of Sayyed Nasrallah. Deputy Leader Sheikh Naim Qassem assured on Monday that the Lebanese resistance group is strong enough and ready for all scenarios, adding that Hezbollah will go on with its goals and its battle. In this regard, Kandil indicated that all the Israeli aerial attacks and their consequences will fail to achieve any of the enemy's goals, including the return of the northern settlers to their houses. Iran and the regional war The Lebanese politician affirmed that the Palestinian cause needs the operations of the resistance groups who are free of all the state considerations, explaining that state wars always lead to compromises that delay the ultimate victory. The resistance groups can inflict accumulating losses upon the enemy without involving the regional states in devastating wars, he said, recalling Sayyed Nasrallah's notion of achieving victory through scoring successive goals, not dealing not dealing a mortal combat. Kandil noted that Hezbollah has the border advantage of firing heavy missiles from short distances and within a very limited time, and is not in need of any Iranian help to destroy Tel Aviv. The relation between Iran and Hezbollah is not based of servitude, Kandil said, mentioning instances in which Tehran rejected to strike any deal with the United States at the expense of the Lebanese resistance group. Kandil called for trusting the resistance and its choices established by the martyred leader Sayyed Nasrallah, ridiculing all the malicious media attempts to cause strife and sedition among the components of the axis of resistance.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2214390	2024-09-30T14:28:33-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-02397330017277316942.jpeg

A Message to Sayyed Nasrallah from Al-Manar English Website: We S...	Your Eminence, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, our beloved leader, For years, it has been our deepest honor at Al-Manar English Website to translate your speeches. It was not just a duty but a privilege, as we shared your words with the world. We were humbled to bring your guidance to those who sought your wisdom, across lands and languages. Each speech carried with it a weight that we could never fully capture in translation, for your words were filled with a depth and grace beyond any language. Forgive us, Sayyed, if we ever fell short. We labored with utmost care to reflect the true essence of your thoughts, yet we know that no translation could ever truly embody the power of your words. Your eloquence transcended every boundary we tried to cross. We searched dictionaries, deliberated among ourselves, and strove to find the perfect words, yet we were always conscious of the greatness that our efforts could not fully convey. Your words were not just spoken‚Äîthey were lived, and they breathed life into your beloved ones‚Äô hearts. This past Saturday, as the news of your martyrdom echoed across the land, our hearts shattered. The followers of the resistance felt the weight of Karbala in every tear. Was it possible? Could our leader, who stood with such strength and conviction, truly be gone? The vile enemy gloated, but we could not comprehend a world without you, Sayyed. How do we write these words when our hands tremble with grief? How do we address you now, knowing that you have joined the ranks of the martyrs? Reporting the breaking news of your martyrdom was our hardest task ever. Our fingers were quivering while typing the tragic words. We seek shelter beneath the cloak of Zainab (peace be upon her), for she too faced a grief that words could not describe. We pray, as she did, that God accepts this immense sacrifice. Today, the resistance faces its greatest test: 'If only we were with you, so we could win a great victory.' In our mourning, we recall the final words of Imam Hussein (peace be upon him) as he spoke to Zainab: 'Do not tear your clothes for me, do not slap your cheeks. Protect the children for me.' And so we, too, must stand firm. We are called to endure this test with the strength of those who came before us, and in their example, we find our courage. From the hilltops of Zainabi, the Islamic Resistance looks to the Commander of the Faithful, Imam Ali (peace be upon him), and hears his command: 'Hold fast. Stand firm. Look to the farthest reaches.' The truth is, Sayyed, this is the harshest battle we have faced. Not one fought with weapons, but one that tears at the very core of our being. No words can console us. No voice can calm the pain we feel. But let there be no doubt: Hezbollah's grief does not come from weakness or fear. We are not shaken. The answer to those who question will be found not in words, but in action‚Äîon the front lines, where your spirit continues to guide us. A leader like you, Sayyed, never wavered. From the beginning, you knew the cost of this path. You knew the sacrifices it would demand, but you were never afraid. What weighed on your heart was not the risk to yourself, but the lives of your comrades, the people who believed in you and followed your leadership with unwavering trust. Every decision you made was for us, and we can only imagine the burden you carried. And yet, through it all, you found solace in your faith, in your deep connection to God, and in the wisdom of those who guided you, like the Supreme Leader Sayyed Ali Khamenei, who you once turned to in times of overwhelming pressure, and whom we turn to despite all the deceitful schemes against the resistance axis. Sayyed, your martyrdom is a wound that no victory can heal. The resistance could burn 'Israel' to the ground, and still, the loss of you is a grief beyond measure. Yet, as you told us: 'The news is in what you see, not in what you hear.' The struggle continues, and so too does your legacy. You once said that if we were to die a thousand deaths, we would never leave the side of Imam Hussein (peace be upon him). Now, we face this reality with broken hearts, but with our heads held high. You have been martyred, just as Sayyed Abbas al-Moussawi was before you. Your legacy now carries on, burning brightly in the hearts of those who walked with you on this path. In your absence, we at Al-Manar English Website pledge to continue the work you inspired. We shall endure. We will keep spreading your message, translating the resistance words, carrying the light you kindled for us all. We once took pride in every speech you gave, in every stance you took. Now, that pride is mixed with sorrow, but it is also strengthened by our resolve. You were not just our leader, Sayyed. You were our guide, our teacher, our inspiration. Your blood now flows in the hands of the faithful, who will raise it to the sky and ask: 'Are you satisfied, O Lord?' We will not rest until we fulfill our duty, until your sacrifice is victorious, until your memory and legacy are honored in full. Sayyed, you are our leader. You are the heart of our resistance. And we, the Al-Manar English team, will continue to serve you with all that we have. We will spread your word, and we will remain true to the path you have set before us. With love, loyalty, and eternal gratitude, The Al-Manar English Website Team	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2213290	2024-09-29T13:53:02-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-09574970017276430486.jpg

He emphasized that this tragic loss will not weaken their resolve but rather enhance their determination to continue the fight.

It is a rogue entity that disregards all values, norms, and international treaties, openly threatening global peace and security amid international silence, incapacity, and complacency,' Hamas affirmed. Hamas' statement concluded with a prayer for mercy upon Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and his fellow leaders who were martyred alongside him on the path to liberating Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa.

Imam Khamenei: All Resistance Forces Stand by Hezbollah	Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei stressed that committing massacres against the unarmed people in Lebanon has once again exposed the savage nature of the rabid Zionist dog to everyone and demonstrated the shortsightedness and foolish policy of the leaders of the usurping regime. In a statement, Imam Khamenei indicated that the terrorist gang ruling over the Zionist entity has not learned from their criminal year-long war in Gaza, nor have they realized that the mass killing of women, children, and civilians cannot weaken or overthrow the strong structure of the Resistance. 'Now they are testing the same foolish policy in Lebanon.' The Zionist criminals must know that they are far too insignificant to cause any significant harm to the strong structure of the Lebanese Hezbollah, His Eminence added, all Resistance forces in the region stand by Hezbollah and support it. The fate of this region will be determined by the Resistance forces, with the victorious Hezbollah at the forefront, Imam Khamenei affirmed. 'The people of Lebanon have not forgotten that once upon a time, the military forces of the usurping regime even reached Beirut, and it was Hezbollah that cut their legs off and made Lebanon dignified and proud. Today as well, with the power and might of Allah, Lebanon will make the aggressive, evil, and cowardly enemy regret. It is incumbent upon all Muslims to stand with their capabilities beside the people of Lebanon and the victorious Hezbollah and assist them in confronting this usurping, unjust, and evil regime.'

Houthi: Any Israeli Ground Invasion of Lebanon Will Be Doomed to ...	Head of Yemen‚Äôs Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Al-Houthi stressed that Hezbollah defeated the Israeli enemy in epochs during which the Resistance group did not possess the capabilities it has now. In his weekly speech, Houthi noted that the Zionist enemy has escalated in Lebanon, relying on its criminal tactics of widespread targeting, killing civilians, and destroying homes, similar to its actions in the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah‚Äôs role in supporting Gaza since the beginning of the aggression has been the strongest and most influential among the support fronts, he affirmed. 'Hezbollah plays a fundamental and important role in confronting the enemy, and its heroic record, achievements, and victories prove its pivotal role for Palestine, Lebanon, and the entire nation.' The 'Israeli' goal of escalation in Lebanon is to prevent Hezbollah from supporting Gaza and the Palestinian people, a goal that will not be achieved, Houthi underscored. 'Hezbollah‚Äôs stance in supporting Gaza is principled, religious, humanitarian, and ethical, and at the same time, it serves Lebanon‚Äôs interests. If the enemy were to achieve its objectives in Palestine and free itself for other fronts, Lebanon would be at the top of its target list.' The enemy had been preparing for aggression against Lebanon and Hezbollah, gathering intelligence, devising targeting plans, and arranging the necessary components for such attacks, Houthi pointed out. 'We observe the strength, resilience, and determination of Hezbollah, despite the scale of the Zionist aggression. The fighters in Lebanon and Palestine are driven by faith, fully aware of their sacred fight duty in standing for the just cause.' The Yemeni leader indicated that the danger facing the Ummah (nation) is not in its movement and raising the banner of fight in the path of Allah to confront its hateful enemies, but in its hesitation, stagnation, surrender, and incapacity. The experience of the fighters in the Gaza Strip has brought about significant victories and inflicted heavy losses on the 'Israeli' enemy, and they have developed a firm, steadfast, and resilient approach in confronting the enemy, according to Houthi. If the 'Israeli' enemy undertakes a ground operation in Lebanon, it will face defeat and will not succeed, he underscored. 'Hezbollah has the military and missile capabilities to reach all parts of occupied Palestine; thus, the enemy will not win this escalation.' Houth emphasized that the Iraqi support front is strong, with significant and impactful operations on the rise from the Jordan Valley to Eilat and towards Haifa and beyond. The Red Sea, Arabian Sea, and Gulf of Aden have become completely prohibited areas for the Israeli, American, and British enemies Houthi recalled. We will never hesitate to support Gaza and Palestine as a whole, as well as Lebanon and Hezbollah, and to cooperate with them, Houthi concluded. The Islamic Resistance continued on Thursday confronting the criminal Israeli aggression on Lebanon, firing dozens of missiles at northern Palestine.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2210265	2024-09-26T13:31:28-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-08909880017273826794.jpg

Global Outcry as Israeli Aggression Leaves Hundreds Dead, Thousan...	The world has reacted with outrage after a devastating Israeli aggression on Lebanon resulted in the deaths of nearly 500 people and left over 1,600 injured. The airstrikes, which began on Monday, have sparked a chorus of international condemnation. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi voiced strong support for Lebanon, denouncing the 'indiscriminate attacks against civilians' during a meeting with his Lebanese counterpart. 'No matter how the situation changes, we will always stand on the side of justice, on the side of our Arab brothers, including Lebanon,' Wang said. Arab foreign ministers also issued a robust condemnation of Israel's increasing aggression against Lebanon, reaffirming their steadfast support for the Lebanese government and its citizens, during the annual Arab League Council meeting held on Monday alongside the 79th United Nations General Assembly. 'We strongly condemn the Israeli regime's escalating aggression against Lebanon, particularly the recent assaults that commenced on Monday morning. We express our readiness to support Lebanon in the face of these attacks, while holding the Israeli regime accountable for this alarming escalation,' the statement said. Turkey: Israel Pushing Region Deeper into 'Chaos' The Turkish Foreign Ministry in a statement warned that Israel's attacks on Lebanon threatened to push the West Asia region deeper into 'chaos.' 'Israel's attacks on Lebanon mark a new phase in its efforts to drag the entire region into chaos,' the statement said. The ministry added that 'the countries that unconditionally support ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô are helping [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu shed blood for his political interests.' France Urges UNSC to Take Immediate Measures Meanwhile, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot on Monday said that France urged all involved parties and their supporters to deescalate tensions and prevent a regional conflict that could have catastrophic consequences, particularly for civilians. The country has also requested an emergency meeting of the Security Council regarding Lebanon to take place this week. The ministry urged all institutions responsible for maintaining international peace and security, especially the UN Security Council, as well as the international community, to take necessary measures without any delay. EU Urges Solution European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned on Monday that the escalating clashes between ‚ÄòIsrael‚Äô and Lebanon threaten to plunge the region into an all-out war. 'We're seeing more military strikes, more damage, more collateral damage, more victims,' Borrell said ahead of a gathering of world leaders at the United Nations. He emphasized the urgent need for collective action to stop the crisis, stating that everyone must fully commit to finding a solution during discussions in New York. The top EU diplomat said 'despite all the diplomatic capacity that we have deployed, nothing has been able to stop the war' in Gaza. 'A Genocide' As he held a meeting with Brazil's Landless Movement in Caracas, Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro referred to the Israeli strikes in Lebanon on Monday as 'genocide,' calling it a global battle between fascism and the people. 'It is no longer simply a threat, it is a reality,' Maduro said, adding that what is happening now in Lebanon is genocide against the Arab nation. Greece's Foreign Minister, George Gerapetritis, said that Israel is not facing sufficient pressure to end the war in Gaza, adding that the escalation in Lebanon is a minefield that the international community may not be able to deal with. 'We have not prevented the spillover, and the more dispersed the war becomes, the more the situation becomes more complicated to be solved,' he said, adding 'Lebanon could easily be a zone of tremendous hostility, and this is something that we cannot deal with. It's a clear minefield.' Gerapetritis emphasized the importance of collaboration between Arabs and Europeans on coming up with unified initiatives instead of pursuing separate actions, noting that the recent escalation at the Lebanon border with the Israeli occupied territories highlighted a significant international failure. Jordan‚Äôs King Abdullah II has affirmed his country‚Äôs 'absolute support for Lebanon, its security, sovereignty, and the safety of its citizens in the face of Israel‚Äôs war on it.' Speaking with Lebanon‚Äôs caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati on Monday, the Jordanian King highlighted the risks posed by Israel‚Äôs escalating actions and underscored the urgent need for global intervention to avert a regional conflict. He emphasized that the path to peace begins with an 'immediate end to the war on Gaza.' Other countries, including Egypt, Syria, Qatar and Iraq, in separate statements have also condemned Israel‚Äôs aggression against Lebanon and expressed their solidarity with the Lebanese government and people. This comes as Mikati urged the United Nations and the world powers to deter what he called Israel's 'plan that aims to destroy Lebanese villages and towns.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2207757	2024-09-24T02:41:13-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-04166000017270915569.jpg

Palestinian Resistance Denounces Dahiyeh Aggression, Voices Full ...	Palestinian resistance groups denounced the Israeli aggression on Beirut‚Äôs southern suburb (Dahiyeh) on Friday, voicing full support to Hezbollah Lebanese resistance movement. Hamas condemned the Israeli attack as brutal and terrorist aggression which targeted a densely populated residential area, leading to casualties including children and civilians. 'The Israeli aggression is a new crime in a series of ongoing Zionist crimes, a violation of Lebanese sovereignty, and an escalation of the Zionist aggression,' the Palestinian resistance group said in a statement. Hamas said the Israeli occupation government 'escalates its aggression, intensifying its raids on residential areas, or blowing up civilian communications facilities with the aim of causing the largest number of victims, without differentiating between military and civilian in Lebanon.' The attacks in Lebanon and the genocide in Gaza as well as the aggression in the west Bank, 'is a blatant violation of all humanitarian rules and norms, international laws and agreements,' the group said, stressing that such war crimes 'require urgent action by the international community to stop them and hold their perpetrators accountable.' 'We support our brothers in Hezbollah as we affirm our full solidarity with them and laud their courageous stances and their insistence to adhere to national, religious and humanitarian values by continuing the battle to support our people in the Gaza Strip,' Hamas added. Israel dropped bombs on a crowded neighborhood in Beirut‚Äôs southern suburbs, pulverizing an entire residential building, right as children were walking home from schools. There is no word for this but terrorism. pic.twitter.com/laDrt13KwM ‚Äî sarah (@sahouraxo) September 20, 2024 The Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine 'condemned in the strongest terms the treacherous aggression launched by the Zionist enemy this afternoon on the southern suburb of Beirut (Dahiyeh), targeting residential areas, which resulted in a number of martyrs including civilians.' 'The government of the Zionist enemy is going ahead with its crimes against the brotherly Lebanese people, with the aim of dragging Lebanon into an all-out war, or imposing humiliating conditions on it, on top of which is stopping the support front that Hezbollah is leading in defense of the Palestinian people.' 'As we highly appreciate the great sacrifices made by Hezbollah and the Lebanese people in confronting the Zionist enemy, we ask God Almighty to bestow mercy upon the souls of the martyrs, and to grant the wounded a speedy and complete recovery,' the Islamic Jihad added. For its part, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine stressed that targeting populated areas in Dahiyeh 'is a new crime to be added to the record of crimes of the terrorist Israeli army and this criminal fascist government.' The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine also denounced the aggression on Dahiyeh, warning that: 'It is no longer a secret that the goal of the Israeli escalation against Lebanon is to drag the region into a large-scale war‚Ä¶ in a bid to implement the US-Israeli colonial terrorist project.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2204127	2024-09-20T11:09:38-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-07082930017268556631.jpg
