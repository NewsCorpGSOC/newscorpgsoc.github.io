Body of Missing Zionist rabbi Found in UAE	The Israeli enemy entity officially announced today, Sunday, that the body of Rabbi Zvi Kogan, who has been missing since Thursday in the United Arab Emirates, was found. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the entity's Foreign Ministry said in a joint statement, 'The intelligence and security authorities in the UAE have found the body of Zvi Kogan, who has been missing since Thursday.' The statement described Kogan's killing as 'a heinous anti-Semitic terrorist act,' according to its expression, noting that the temporary entity will do its utmost 'until justice is served against the criminals responsible for his killing.' There was no immediate comment from the Emirati authorities on the Israeli announcement of the rabbi's death. It is noteworthy that Zvi Kogan is one of the representatives of the Jewish 'Chabad' movement in the Emirates and holds Moldovan citizenship in addition to Israeli citizenship. According to the Israeli newspaper 'Yedioth Ahronoth', Kogan (28 years old) was officially residing in the Emirates as an assistant to the Chief Rabbi of Abu Dhabi. The Chabad organization, which 'does not believe in the right of the Palestinians to exist,' calls for their expulsion from occupied Palestine, and 'opposes any agreement that would give them part of the land,' at a time when the Palestinians have the right to all of Palestine, not just part of it.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2276683	2024-11-24T02:57:48-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-061088300173244586310.jpg
Jordan Security Forces Kill Man Who Opened Fire Near Israeli Emba...	Tensions escalated near the Israeli embassy in Jordan's capital city of Amman on Sunday, as a gunman opened fire on security personnel, leading to a deadly confrontation. According to the Jordanian Public Security, the incident occurred in the Rabieh area of Amman. The gunman reportedly opened fire on a police patrol, prompting a security team to respond. In the ensuing clash, the shooter was pursued and surrounded, at which point he opened fire on the security forces. Authorities say the security team then 'applied the rules of engagement,' resulting in the gunman's death. The attack left 3 police officers injured. Jordanian officials have not released the identity of the shooter or provided details on a possible motive. Earlier reports from Israeli media had indicated a security incident near the Israeli embassy in Amman, with the gunman firing towards the embassy premises for several minutes. A heavy security presence was deployed to the area around the embassy following the sound of gunfire.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2276540	2024-11-24T01:16:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-00931000017324397837.jpg
Hamas Announces Death of Female Captive in Israeli Bombardment of...	Military spokesperson for Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas Resistance Movement, announced the death of one more captive in the Zionist aggression of the various zones of Gaza. After re-establishing contact with fighters assigned to protect Israeli enemy captives, it was revealed that one of the enemy’s female captives was killed in an area under heavy Israeli aggression in the northern Gaza Strip, Abu Ubaida said. Meanwhile, another female captive remains in grave danger, he added. Abu Ubaida affirmed that the war criminal Netanyahu, his government, and the leaders of his army bear full responsibility for the lives of their captives, as they persist in causing their suffering and deaths. The enemy must prepare to deal with the issue of the disappearance of the bodies of their fallen soldiers due to widespread destruction and the martyrdom of some of the captors, Abu Ubaida warned. Al-Qassam Brigades posted a photo which shows body of the dead captive with a caption that reads, 'A new victim of Netanyahu and Halevi.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2276287	2024-11-23T13:54:55-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/11/manar-095946600169999520110.jpg
Merkava Tanks Couldn’t Reach Quarter of Distance Crossed in 2006:...	TV channels, newspapers, politicians, journalists, analysts, and social media accounts are all involved in providing an instant media coverage for the ongoing military confrontation between Hezbollah and the Israeli occupation army in accordance with the adopted values, principles and political affiliations. The military confrontation with the Zionist enemy is accompanied by a hostile propaganda aimed supporting the goals of Israeli war on Lebanon. What must be completely condemned is the distortion of reality in an attempt to prove an untrue idea or figure. It is totally immoral, for example, to claim that the enemy controlled a certain town while the clashes are still ongoing in its vicinity. Since the beginning of the Israeli ground invasion of South Lebanon, the hostile media tried its best to magnify the Israeli aggression 'achievements' and trivialize the Resistance feats. A very sharp and clear example, in this regard, can be the promotion of the idea that the Israeli ground progress is much faster than that which was in 2006 in order to solidify the claim that Hezbollah in 2024 is weaker than it was in 2006. A factual comparison between the Zionist ground invasion in 2024 and that in 2006 shows that - the Israeli Merkava tanks reached in 30 days Ghandouriyeh (landing) and Wadi Al Houjeir Reserve, which lie around 10 kilometers away from the Lebanese Palestinian borders in 2006. - the Israeli Merkava tanks failed in around 55 days to cross Deir Mimas which lies around one kilometer away from the Lebanese Palestinian borders in 2024. A map shows the difference between the ground invasion in 2024 and that in 2006 Another clear example can be that, in 2006, the Merkava tanks reached Al-Bayada and even the outskirts of Al-Mansouri in Tyre district. Whereas, in 2024, the enemy vehicles reached only the outskirts of Shamaa and Al-Bayada. These are mere instances to say that the Islamic Resistance fighters are bravely fighting to defend the South Lebanon town, including Khiam and Bint Jbeil, and that the pace of the Israeli ground advance is not at all faster than that in 2006, yet even much slower. Thus, those who are promoting the Israeli ground advance must hold on and wait for the consequences of the battle which will gradually appear.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2276089	2024-11-23T10:59:13-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-02851670017323882094.png
Hezbollah Fighters Frustrate Israeli Advance Schemes in South Leb...	The Islamic Resistance fighters continued on Saturday, November 23, 2024, confronting the barbaric Israeli war on Lebanon, showing unprecedented bravery in the ground fight against the enemy troops attempting to control towns in the South. More than 51 Merkava tanks have been destroyed by Hezbollah fighters who audaciously repelled the Zionist ground advance into the towns of Khiam, Deir Mimas and Al-Bayada. It is worth noting that the Israeli ground invasion of South Lebanon has taken the form of incursion lines which do not grant the enemy forces the capability of controlling any of the villages in South Lebanon.

No Hezbollah Figure Targeted in Beirut Strike: Lawmaker	Member of Hezbollah’s Loyalty to Resistance bloc MP Amin Sherri firmly denied on Saturday that the Israeli strike on Beirut’s Al-Basta targeted a Hezbollah figure, noting that the brutal attack which killed or injured dozens in the Lebanese capital is only aimed at terrifying the Lebanese citizens. As he visited the scene of the Israeli strike, MP Sherri said: 'This is the eighth attack on Beirut (since the start of the war on September 23). No military target was hit in all of these attacks.' 'Neither a military figure nor an individual who is affiliated with any political party was targeted in any of the two destroyed buildings,' the lawmaker affirmed. ⚡Lebanese MP Amin Sherri from Basta: There is no Hezbollah figure in the targeted building #Iraq #Syria #Hezbollah #Beirut #Lebanon #Israel #TelAviv #Gaza #Yemen #Iran #Tehran #IRGC pic.twitter.com/B1jLCfOdhe — War Analysis (@iiamguri9) November 23, 2024 He saluted the people who have been displaced from the unsafe regions across Lebanon to the capital Beirut. 'These attacks will never break the will of our people,' MP Sherri stressed. He noted, meanwhile, that the real confrontation is in south Lebanon, with the resistance fighters, rather than the systematic killings of civilians. Massive Israeli strike that employed bunker busting bombs on Beirut's Al-Basta area killed or injured dozens of people at dawn on Saturday.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2275913	2024-11-23T06:23:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-07648920017323717154.png
Iran to Launch New Advanced Centrifuges: AEOI	Spokesman of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) Behrouz Kamalvandi said that the organization plans to activate a series of new and advanced centrifuges in response to the IAEA politically-motivated resolution. The International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors on Thursday voted 19 to 3, with 12 abstentions, for the resolution, brought by the UK, France, and Germany (E3), that accused the Islamic Republic of poor cooperation with the agency. Speaking in a televised interview on Friday, Kamalvandi said that after the resolution was issued, the AEOI immediately started its remedial measures. 'We will significantly increase the enrichment capacity with different kinds of advanced machines,' he said, naming the increase in the speed of industrial research and development as another measure that would be taken by Iran in response to the resolution. He further stressed that after the resolution was issued, the President and the AEOI chief issued the necessary orders, and the process started that night. 'Soon, the IAEA will surely provide its reports and it will be clear that what they did led to the increase of Iran's nuclear industry capacity in various fields,' he added. The AEOI official said that the IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi was informed during his visit to Iran that Tehran is seeking interaction but if the IAEA wants to adopt other methods, the Islamic Republic is also ready to act accordingly. Iran has announced it has launched new advanced centrifuges after the E3-US drafted resolution was passed at the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors (IAEA BoG) on Thursday night. In a joint statement, the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) and the Iranian Foreign Ministry condemned the passing of the resolution as a politically motivated, unrealistic, and counterproductive move.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2275869	2024-11-23T05:32:06-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/04/manar-04755240016178797859.jpg

Putin Says Oreshnik Missile System Cutting-edge Innovation by Rus...	Russia’s Oreshnik hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile system is not an upgraded version of previous versions dating back from the Soviet times, and it is in the line of the latest and modern developments, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday. 'The Oreshnik system has nothing to do with the modernization of the old Soviet systems,' Putin said. 'It is obvious that we were all raised watching various systems of the Soviet Union operating, we were all brought up on what was done by previous generations, and to a certain extent we used their results,' Putin said. 'However, this system is indeed the prime result of your work, the work that was done in Russian times, under the conditions of the new Russia, it was waged on the basis of modern, latest developments,' Putin said addressing the meeting with the Defense Ministry executive board, representatives of the military-industrial complex and missile weapon designers. The Russian Defense Ministry announced earlier in the day that the country’s latest Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile hit all the targets at a major Ukrainian military-industrial enterprise in Dnepr (Dnepropetrovsk) with its MIRVed warheads. 'On November 21, 2024, in response to the use of American-and British-made long-range missiles against facilities on Russian territory, the Armed Forces delivered a combined strike on one of the Ukrainian military-industrial sites in Dnepropetrovsk. For the first time, the Oreshnik hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile with a non-nuclear payload was employed in combat conditions in the strike. The goal of the strike was achieved. All the warheads hit the facility,' the ministry said in a statement. On November 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree approving the Foundations of State Policy in the Field of Nuclear Deterrence, the country’s updated nuclear doctrine. The fundamental principle of the doctrine is that the use of nuclear weapons is a measure of last resort to protect the country’s sovereignty. The emergence of new military threats and risks prompted Russia to clarify the conditions for the use of nuclear weapons. In particular, the amended doctrine expands the range of countries and military alliances subject to nuclear deterrence, as well as the list of military threats that such deterrence is designed to counter. In addition, the document states that Russia will now view any attack by a non-nuclear country supported by a nuclear power as a joint attack. Moscow also reserves the right to consider a nuclear response to a conventional weapons attack threatening its sovereignty, a large-scale launch of enemy aircraft, missiles, and drones targeting Russian territory, their crossing of the Russian border, and an attack on its ally Belarus.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2275176	2024-11-22T11:52:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-09745410017323051094.jpg

Iran Hails ICC Warrant for Netanyahu as ‘Political Death’ of ‘Isr...	The Commander of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps, General Hossein Salami, has welcomed the International Criminal Court's (ICC) arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Security Minister Yoav Gallant, describing the move as marking the 'end and political death' of 'Israel.' Salami declared in a speech aired on Iranian state television that the ICC's decision signifies 'the end and political death of the Zionist regime, a regime that today lives in absolute political isolation in the world, and its officials can no longer travel to other countries.' IRGC chief urges Muslim countries to cut aid routes to Israel — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) November 22, 2024 The Iranian commander characterized the warrants as a 'great victory for the Palestinian and Lebanese resistance movements' and a pivotal step in holding the Israeli occupation accountable for its actions, particularly the ongoing genocide in Gaza. In contrast, Netanyahu and his allies have dismissed the ICC's move as politically motivated and antisemitic, with the Israeli president accusing the court of undermining justice and siding with 'terrorism and evil.' The United States, Israel's closest ally, has also criticized the ICC's decision. The warrants, which theoretically restrict Netanyahu's international travel, come as the death toll from the Israeli war against Gaza surpasses 44,000 martyrs over 412 days.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2274923	2024-11-22T06:37:50-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/12/manar-067219500170375961910.jpg

Iran has denounced a United Nations nuclear watchdog resolution as 'unjustifiable' and initiated the operation of advanced centrifuges in reciprocal response. Iran's Foreign Ministry and the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) issued a joint statement early Friday, announcing the activation of 'a substantial number of advanced centrifuges of various models.' The statement emphasized that the move is a defensive measure to protect Iran's national interests and address its increasing need for a civilian nuclear program, in line with its obligations under the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement. 📌 Joint Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Regarding the Unjust Resolution Adopted by the IAEA Board of Governors on Iran’s Peaceful Nuclear Program In the final hours of the #IAEA Board of Governors meeting on 21 Nov 2024, a… pic.twitter.com/XjM5Up5eLs — Foreign Ministry, Islamic Republic of Iran 🇮🇷 (@IRIMFA_EN) November 22, 2024 The action follows a resolution passed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors, which accused Tehran of inadequate cooperation and called for a 'comprehensive' report on its nuclear activities by spring 2025. The resolution passed with 19 votes in favor, three against, and 12 abstentions. IAEA Director General @rafaelmgrossi briefed the Board of Governors on his high-level meetings in Tehran last week, describing his discussions with the new government as constructive. Nevertheless, he pointed out, there were ongoing concerns. Read more: pic.twitter.com/Jt4uIzucsJ — IAEA - International Atomic Energy Agency ⚛️ (@iaeaorg) November 22, 2024 Iran described the resolution as a 'non-consensus' measure driven by the 'pressure and insistence' of the US, UK, France and Germany, despite lacking support from nearly half of the 35-member Board of Governors. 'The actions of the three European nations and the United States—countries with a documented history of reneging on their commitments, including under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and resorting to unlawful sanctions and pressures against the Iranian nation—are both confrontational and unjustifiable,' the statement read. It criticized the resolution as 'politically motivated' and warned it undermines the constructive atmosphere fostered during IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi's recent visit to Tehran. 'This politicized and destructive measure undermines the positive momentum achieved between Iran and the Agency and blatantly contradicts the professed commitment of the three European nations and the United States to preserving the integrity and impartiality of the IAEA. It lays bare their use of the nuclear issue as a pretext to advance illegitimate objectives,' the statement added. Despite its condemnation of the resolution, Iran reaffirmed its commitment to cooperating with the IAEA within the framework of the Safeguards Agreement. 'The principled policy of the I.R. of Iran has consistently been to engage constructively with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) within the framework of rights and obligations enshrined in the Treaty on the NPT and the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement,' it said. Iran signed the JCPOA in 2015, proving the peaceful intent of its nuclear program to six world powers. However, the deal has been in jeopardy since the United States unilaterally withdrew in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. In response to unmet commitments by other signatories, Iran began rolling back its JCPOA obligations in 2019.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2274835	2024-11-22T05:50:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/06/manar-02354790016244400227.jpg
Bloodshed Continues in Gaza as Israeli Occupation Raids Leave Ove...	On the 413th day of the ongoing Israeli aggression on Gaza, the death toll continues to rise.

In the Shuja'iyya neighborhood of Gaza City, an airstrike on the home of the Abu Asr family claimed 8 lives, while 5 Palestinians were killed in a bombing of a house north of the Nuseirat refugee camp in the central region. Two more Palestinians were martyred in a strike that hit a house west of Deir al-Balah city.

Meanwhile, the northern Gaza Strip continues to bear the brunt of the ongoing offensive, as the Israeli occupation forces have intensified their bombardment of the Jabalia refugee camp. Residential buildings in the area have been systematically destroyed, in what appears to be a deliberate attempt to displace the local population. Last night, Israeli occupation warplanes targeted and bombed an inhabited residential block in the vicinity of Kamal Adwan hospital, massacring at least 66 civilians and injuring over 100. pic.twitter.com/zoUqz1z6zn — PALESTINE ONLINE 🇵🇸 (@OnlinePalEng) November 21, 2024 On October 5, the occupation army invaded the northern Gaza governorate under the pretext of preventing the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) from regaining its strength in the area, committing the most heinous atrocities against the people of the north in a clear attempt to displace them in implementation of the so-called 'generals’ plan.' The Palestinians confirm that the enemy wants to occupy the northern Gaza Strip and turn it into a buffer zone after displacing its residents under the pressure of continuous bloody bombing and a tight siege that prevents the entry of food, water and medicine.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2274626	2024-11-22T04:18:17-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-09688970017322778755.jpg
‘Israel’ Greenlights Settler Attacks, Announces End of Administra...	New Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced an end to administrative detention orders for Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank settlers, in a new measure that is seen a practice of apartheid against Palestinian people, and a green light for Zionist settlers to attack the native people of Palestine. While the practice is primarily deployed against Palestinian people in Israeli jails, it is also used against some Israelis, described as 'extremist Jewish'. It sees individuals held without charge for up to six months at a time. The detentions can be renewed indefinitely while allowing military prosecutors to keep suspects from being able to see the evidence against them. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem on November 10, 2024. In a statement, Katz claimed that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are subject to so-called 'serious Palestinian terror threats and unjustified international sanctions are taken against the settlers.' 'It is not appropriate for the State of Israel to take such a severe measure against the people of the settlements,' the Israeli DM added. Katz met with Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar this week and told him that he had decided 'to stop the use of administrative detention orders against Jewish settlers in Judea and Samaria, and asked him to put alternative tools in place,' his office said, referring to the Hebrew name of the West Bank. The measure could be seen as a new Israeli attempt to permit settler violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, which spiked since October 2023. Israeli occupation authorities rarely arrest Jewish perpetrators in such attacks. Rights groups lament that convictions are even more unusual and that the vast majority of charges in these types of attacks are dropped.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2274494	2024-11-22T03:08:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-01632750017322734949.jpg
Israeli Warplanes Launch a New Attack on Beirut’s Southern Suburb...	Israeli warplanes launched a series of airstrikes on the Southern Suburb of Beirut on Friday, reducing several residential buildings to rubble. The brutal attacks appear to be part of Israel's retaliatory actions against areas inhabited by the Resistance's popular support base, following recent battlefield setbacks. the Israeli warplanes targeted the neighborhoods of Haret Hreik, al-Hadath, and al-Kafaat. The Israeli occupation military had issued three separate warnings, announcing plans to strike three residential buildings in the targeted areas. However, the number of strikes launched during each round of raids has consistently exceeded the number of individual warnings issued, and dozens of buildings have been struck with no prior notice. بالفيديو | لحظة تدمير الطيران الاسرائيلي مبنى في #الضاحية_الجنوبية لبيروت pic.twitter.com/efo5sxwGLM — قناة المنار (@TVManar1) November 21, 2024 Despite Israel's claims that the strikes target buildings affiliated with the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon, emerging footage and eyewitness statements continue to prove otherwise, revealing the indiscriminate nature of the attacks and the significant destruction caused. The ongoing Israeli aggression across Lebanon has resulted in the martyrdom of at least 3,583 people and the wounding of 15,244 since October 2023. On Thursday alone, the Lebanese Health Ministry reported 25 martyrs and 121 injuries, with the toll particularly high in the Baalbek-Hermel Governorate, where six members of the same family were killed in the town of Maqneh and at least 11 were martyred in Nabha. The relentless Israeli airstrikes have continued to target several towns in the Bekaa Valley, with the total number of raids reaching 1,182 and resulting in 839 martyrs and 1,399 wounded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2274373	2024-11-22T00:56:07-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-04603610017322657605.jpg

Speaking in a televised address, the head of state assured that Russia will issue notifications before using this type of missile. 'We will do it due to humanitarian concerns - openly, publicly, without any concerns about any countermeasures from the enemy, who will also receive this information,' Putin said. 'Why without any concerns? Because there are currently no countermeasures for this weapon at this moment.' Putin warned the West that Russia is prepared to face any developments and will always have an answer. 'We have always preferred, and are now ready to resolve all disputes through peaceful means, but we are also ready for any development,' he said. 'If anyone still doubts this, they shouldn’t.

ICC Issues Arrest Warrants for Israel’s Netanyahu, Gallant over W...	The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense chief for committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. In their decision, the ICC judges said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant were criminally responsible for acts including murder, persecution and starvation as a weapon of war as part of a 'widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza'. The decision was met with outrage in 'Israel', which called it shameful and absurd. Hamas welcomed the warrants, and a senior official told Reuters it was a first step towards justice. 'Israel' has rejected the jurisdiction of the Hague-based court and denied war crimes in Gaza. The United States, Israel's main supporter, is also not a member of the ICC. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan had announced on May 20 that he was seeking arrest warrants for crimes connected to the Israeli military response in Gaza. Israeli leaders have dismissed allegations that they committed war crimes. The court does not have its own police force to carry out arrests and relies on its 124 member states for that. Whether they are arrested or not depends on the member states. They have an obligation to do so but the court has only limited diplomatic means to force them if they do not want to. REACTIONS Netanyahu's office said the ICC decision was 'anti-semitic' and he will 'not yield to pressure, will not be deterred' until Israel's war objectives are met. The ICC has 'lost all legitimacy' after issuing the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said. 'A dark moment for the International Criminal Court,' Saar said on X, adding that it had issued 'absurd orders without authority'. There was no immediate comment from Gallant. The White House said Washington 'fundamentally rejects' the ICC decision, adding that they are 'deeply concerned by the Prosecutor’s rush to seek arrest warrants and the troubling process errors that led to this decision'. 'The United States has been clear that the ICC does not have jurisdiction over this matter,' a National Security Council spokesperson said. In a statement, Hamas welcomed the warrants against Gallant and Netanyahu and urged the court to expand accountability to all Israeli leaders. Senior Hamas official Basem Naim told Reuters the warrants against the Israelis were an important step towards bringing justice for the victims. 'But it remains a limited and spiritual step if it was not backed practically by all countries to get this decision implemented in compliance with law and justice,' he said. The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the decision was not a political one but made by a court and thus should be respected and implemented. 'The tragedy in Gaza has to stop,' Borrell said. Jordan's foreign minister Ayman Safadi also said the ICC's decision must be implemented, adding that the Palestinians deserved justice after what he termed Israel's 'war crimes' in Gaza. The Netherlands' foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp said his country was prepared to act upon the warrants, Dutch news agency ANP reported. In the United States, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, said: 'The Court is a dangerous joke. It is now time for the U.S. Senate to act and sanction this irresponsible body.' Israel's 13-month campaign in Gaza has killed about 44,000 Palestinians and displaced nearly all the enclave's population while creating a humanitarian crisis, Gaza officials say.

Hezbollah’s Epic Fight in Khiam Obliges Israeli Forces to Withdra...	The most eloquent description of the Islamic Resistance fight in the South Lebanon town of Khiam was posted by Al-Manar correspondent Ali Shoeib who said that usually the invading force leave an exit corridor for the defenders to depart the attacked area, but that Hezbollah fighters left the exit corridor to escape from Khiam. According to media reports, the Israeli occupation forces withdrew from Khiam due to the strikes of Hezbollah fighters. This epic fight performed by Hezbollah fighters has so far frustrated the Israeli invasion schemes which seem to be limitless amid the enemy's desperate attempts to occupy and control swathes of territories in South Lebanon. The enemy troops managed merely to advance through incursion lines away from the resistance fire into Shamaa without controlling neither the targeted village nor the towns behind it on the borders with occupied Palestine. In this regard, Hezbollah Operation Room issued a statement regarding the clash with an 'Israeli' force in the town of Tayr Harfa (supposed to be controlled by IOF)and the destruction of an armored vehicle. The Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance reports the following: - Islamic Resistance fighters observed an infiltration by an 'Israeli' army unit into a house on the western side of Tayr Harfa. - Our fighters opened fire on the house where the unit was stationed, using medium-range machine guns, followed by direct targeting of the house. This resulted in the partial destruction of the house on the unit inside. - An 'Israeli' force supported by an armored vehicle attempted to advance to evacuate the casualties from the site. - The armored vehicle was targeted with direct fire, leading to its destruction. Our fighters then combed the targeted area using machine guns. (Statement No. 17, issued at 7:29 pm yesterday). - Hours after the incident, the 'Israeli' army acknowledged of four soldiers being killed with injuries to several others. Meanwhile, 'Israeli' media reported the death of six soldiers in the ambush. - Among the casualties were an officer and a soldier from the 13th Battalion (Golani), a soldier from the 'Maglan' Unit, and an archaeologist accompanying the force under the supervision of the brigade commander to 'study the area,' as stated by the 'Israeli' army.

US Veto of UN Gaza Resolution ‘License’ for More Israeli Atrociti...	The United States' veto of a United Nations resolution calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip serves as a 'license' for the Israeli regime to continue its 'bloody wars' in the region, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said on Thursday. In a scathing rebuke, Baghaei condemned the 'disgraceful' US move, which blocked the draft resolution that had secured 14 votes in favor at the 15-member UN Security Council. He said the veto 'not only marks another failure of [the] UNSC to uphold its Charter-based mandate but also serves as a U.S.-granted license for the occupying regime to continue its carnage in Gaza and Lebanon with impunity.'

‘Israel’ Lies: Archeologist Killed in South Lebanon Wasn’t 'Civil...	Israeli archeologist was killed along with an Israeli soldier in south Lebanon on Wednesday, as the family of the researcher disputed the occupation military’s count that he was a civilian. Ze'ev (Jabo) Hanoch Erlich, 71, was killed along with a soldier of Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion, with an officer and another soldier being injured in south Lebanon’s western sector. Israeli media cited an initial investigation into the incident found that a force led by Golani Brigade Chief of Staff Brig. Gen. Yoav Yarom entered the area where the brigade was operating. Israeli soldier was killed along with researcher Ze'ev (Jabo) Hanoch Erlich in south Lebanon (Wednesday, November 20, 2024). The force reached an ancient fort considered an archaeological site, the probe found, adding that two Hezbollah fighters who were hiding at the scene opened fire at the force, killing Erlich. Yarom was wounded, while another soldier was seriously injured in the confrontation. The head of the IDF Personnel Directorate decided to recognize Erlich as an IDF casualty. The occupation army said the incident was 'severe' and will be investigated, claiming that Erlich entered the battlefield as a 'civilian' was not authorized as needed by the commanders of the division and command, but was allowed by Yarom. However, the researcher’s brother, Yigal Amitai disputed the occupation military’s claim. 'Contrary to the IDF spokesperson’s claims, we clarify that Jabo was enlisted and treated in the field as a soldier,' Amitai told Ynet. 'He was fully recognized as a soldier, entering Lebanon with the IDF’s approval and accompaniment, albeit for archaeological research, as he always did in Judea and Samaria,' Amitai said referring to the Hebrew name of the occupied West Bank. He said he last spoke with Erlich on Wednesday morning before his entry into Lebanon. 'At 11 a.m., he told me, ‘We’re going into Lebanon,’' Amitai added, accusing the Israeli army spokesperson of 'shielding senior officers while shifting blame onto mid-level ranks'. The Israeli occupation army also announced the death of an Israeli soldier, of the Maglan commando unit, and the injury of another, in an alleged building collapse in another incident in south Lebanon, raising the toll of Wednesday battles in south Lebanon to 3 Israelis killed and 3 wounded.

Sheikh Qassem: Beirut versus Central Tel Aviv	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem stressed on Wednesday that the Resistance will certainly emerge victorious from the ongoing battle when it prevents the Zionist enemy from achieving its goals. In a televised speech, Sheikh Qassem hailed the soul of the martyred leader Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, underlining his pivotal role in presiding over Hezbollah Executive Council concerned with the educations, social, economic and medical files. Sheikh Qassem added that the Israeli enemy launched an aggression on the Lebanese capital, Beirut, assassinating the icon of the jihadi and resistance media and Head of Hezbollah Media Relations Department, Martyr Hajj Mohammad Afif. Regarding the aggression on Beirut, Sheikh Qassem maintained that Israeli enemy should understand that Central Tel Aviv will pay the price for any aggression on Beirut. 'We may never abandon Beirut under strikes.' Do not falter in pursuit of the enemy—if you are suffering, they too are suffering. But you can hope to receive from Allah what they can never hope for. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.

His eminence affirmed that Hezbollah has been keen on supporting Gaza, taking into consideration Lebanon's circumstances. 'We are proud to be among the few who have supported Gaza amid a listless world, except for Iraq, Yemen, and Iran.' Sheikh Qassem noted that it is true that the Israeli strikes have been painful, yet that Hezbollah has enough cadres who are formidable in might. His eminence clarified that Hezbollah had accepted Biden-Macron ceasefire proposal, yet that the Israeli enemy assassinated the Secretary General. Hezbollah restored its well-being in all the domains after the assassination of the Secretary General, Sheikh Qassem said. Sheikh Qassem indicated that Hezbollah has been fighting in 'Formidable in Might' Battle to confront the Zionist all-out war on Lebanon for two months after the battle of supporting Gaza. After two months of the Israeli all out war on Lebanon, the Resistance showed a mythical steadfastness, his eminence affirmed. Commenting on the news reports about Israeli invasion of some villages in South Lebanon, Sheikh Qassem noted that the Resistance is not a classical army, yet fights the enemy wherever it advances. 'Check their losses and where the resistance confronts them.' Sheikh Qassem confirmed that ‘Israel’ may never defeat Hezbollah and impose its terms on Lebanon, adding that the Islamic Resistance is ready for a long battle. 'We are left with the two choices of war and humiliation; humiliation is far from us!' Sheikh Qassem went on to say that Hezbollah will not speak publicly about its notes pertaining to Hochstein’s proposal submitted to the Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, adding that let it be known that Hezbollah will continue its military battle along with the ongoing negotiations. Hezbollah leader greeted the mujahideen (the Islamic Resistance fighters) and the honorable people (the resistance supporters), stressing that this is the great model of embracing the resistance. Sheikh Qassem asserted that Hezbollah will continue the battle regardless of the costs which will rise with respect to the enemy as well 'When we prevent the enemy from reaching its goals, we emerge from the battle victorious/' Regarding the Lebanese politics, Hezbollah Secretary General stressed Hezbollah would contribute to the presidential elections and the public life in the framework of Taif Accord. Hezbollah will present in the resistance field and politics simultaneously in order to protect and build up the nation, Sheikh Qassem emphasized.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2272921	2024-11-20T07:58:06-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-099385300173211828010.jpg

Gaza Genocide Continues as Death Toll Rises on 411th Day of Israe...	411 days into the ongoing genocide against the people of the Gaza Strip. For the past 47 days, ‘Israel’ has escalated its so-called 'military operation' in northern Gaza, which is in reality an advanced phase of the year-long campaign of mass destruction across the entire territory. ‘Israel’ has mobilized three combat brigades there, ruthlessly pursuing a 'scorched earth' policy through horrific daily airstrikes, shelling, and ground attacks on residential areas in Beit Lahia, Jabalia, Beit Hanoun, and elsewhere.

However, a heated debate has emerged within Israeli media circles about the military's limited achievements, 'particularly in light of the continued qualitative confrontation and the ongoing ability to rebuild and restore' by the Palestinians. This comes as an Israeli occupation army lieutenant colonel, the commander of the 90th Battalion in the Kfir Brigade, was reported injured in northern Gaza on Tuesday. At least 27 Israeli occupation soldiers have been killed in the Jabalia area since the start of the latest ground offensive. 12 more Palestinians martyred in an airstrike on a home in northern Gaza early Wednesday, and ongoing bombardment and raids across the Strip.

Hezbollah Ops Room Illustrates Failure of Israeli Ground Invasion...	The Islamic Resistance fighters have continued confronting the Israeli aggression on Lebanon, inflicting heavy losses upon the enemy's soldiers, officers, and equipment along the border area as well as their deployment positions in occupied Palestine, the Islamic Resistance Operations Room introduced its statement summing the latest developments of the battlefield. The statement summarized the most important developments in the main field confrontations between the Islamic Resistance and the Israeli enemy: 1. Haifa Qualitative Operation: - Haifa qualitative missile operation is part of the promise made by the Islamic Resistance Operations Room to intensify and escalate the 'Khaibar' series of special operations. It also serves to refute the claims of enemy leaders regarding the destruction of the Resistance's missile force. - Through this operation, the Resistance affirms its ability to target enemy military bases of various types simultaneously and with large salvos of precise missiles, which rained down on the occupied city of Haifa and successfully hit their targets. - The operation achieved its objectives, with Resistance missiles striking the five announced military bases, forcing over 300,000 settlers into shelters. - Settlers are paying the price for the 'Israeli' enemy army’s strategy of placing military bases within settlements and occupied cities, near commercial and economic interests. - The Resistance has prepared itself to ensure its readiness and capability to conduct such operations in Haifa and beyond [beyond] Haifa, over a time frame that the enemy does not anticipate. 2. The Enemy's Declaration of the Second Phase of the Ground Operation in Southern Lebanon: - Following a 40% retreat in the 'Israeli' enemy army’s air and ground operations in the border area, due to its inability to establish control within Lebanese territory, the enemy rushed to announce the second phase of its ground operation in southern Lebanon. - The Islamic Resistance Operations Room confirms that the concentrated and strategic defensive operations it carried out during the 'first phase' of the enemy's ground operations forced its forces to retreat beyond the border in some areas and denied them the ability to stabilize in most of the border towns. - The 'Israeli' enemy's air force continues to attack border villages —which it claims to control—with dozens of airstrikes by warplanes and drones daily, regardless of the artillery shelling and sweeping with machine guns from border positions targeting many of these villages. These assaults confirm the enemy's failure to establish control within Lebanese territory. The recent attempts to advance toward areas south of Al-Khiam—where they previously attempted to enter but were forced to withdraw under the blows of the fighters—further demonstrate the failure of the first phase. - Since the start of the ground operation until the date of this statement, our heroic fighters have carried out over 350 operations against 'Israeli' enemy forces on Lebanese territories, and more than 600 fire operations targeting the zones of responsibility of 'Israeli' military divisions on occupied Palestinian territories, causing significant losses to the enemy army. - To the officers and soldiers of the 'Israeli' enemy army, we affirm that what happened to Battalion 51 of the Golani Brigade at the outskirts of the Ainata – Maroun Al-Ras – Aitaroun triangle is just the beginning, and between us and you there are the days, the nights, and the battlefield. As our most sacred martyr [His Eminence Martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah] said: 'You will enter vertically and leave horizontally.' 3. Ground Engagements: - Western Sector: - 'Israeli' enemy forces advanced toward the town of Shamaa in the western sector in an attempt to seize control and pressure the second-line towns of the front, aiming to reduce the Resistance’s missile strikes on the city of Nahariya and the Haifa area in occupied Palestine. - Enemy forces infiltrated from Al-Labbuneh forests, passing through the forests of Alma Al-Shaab and Tayr Harfa, heading toward Shamaa. - The advancing forces fell into a series of ambushes prepared by our fighters on the outskirts of the town and within it. - As a crew, including an armored company, attempted to advance toward the vicinity of the town’s mosque and municipal building (east of the UNIFIL site), our fighters targeted them with guided missiles, destroying two Merkava tanks and a bulldozer accompanying the force. Additionally, a guided missile targeted an infantry force near the shrine of Prophet Shamoun Al-Safa in the town center, resulting in several casualties. - Close-range clashes occurred between our fighters and enemy forces around the shrine, the municipal building, the mosque, and the outskirts of the town. These engagements, which involved machine guns, hand grenades, and rocket-propelled grenades, took place over five times, causing significant casualties among enemy forces. 'Israeli' evacuation units responded by dispatching two helicopters for rescue and evacuation, utilizing flares to identify their location near the town’s school. - On the western outskirts of Al-Jibein, our fighters targeted a Merkava tank with a guided missile, killing and wounding its crew. The area was then shelled with 120mm and 81mm mortar rounds. - The Resistance’s missile units targets enemy soldier positions and military equipment along this axis with dozens of missile salvos and artillery shells. Central Sector: Ainata – Maroun Al-Ras – Aitaroun Triangle: Refuting the 'Israeli' enemy’s narrative regarding the ambush that ensnared its forces at the Ainata – Maroun Al-Ras – Aitaroun triangle, and to document the heroics of our fighters on the battlefronts, the Islamic Resistance Operations Room announces the following: - At dawn on Wednesday, November 13, 2024, our fighters detected a force from Battalion 51 of the Golani Brigade belonging to Division 36 infiltrating from the border area between Aitaroun and Maroun Al-Ras toward the southeastern outskirts of Bint Jbeil aiming to conduct reconnaissance at the Ainata – Maroun Al-Ras – Aitaroun triangle. - Despite intense aerial bombardments by the 'Israeli' air force over the area, the enemy force fell into a well-planned ambush set by a group of Resistance fighters. - The enemy force reached the ambush site at 9:50 am, where a group of our fighters was positioned in a building damaged by the aggression and its surrounding area. - As the 'Israeli' force approached the 'kill zone', our fighters opened fire from all directions using machine guns, forcing the enemy to scatter in the place. - A portion of the hostile force entered a house in the region to protect itself from the fire of our fighters while the rest soldiers deployed around it. - Once the enemy stabilized in the house, and with the call of Labbaik Ya Nasrallah, [We are at your service O Nasrallah] our fighters targeted the house with several RPG rounds designed for personnel and armor, destroying parts of the building and killing those inside. - As the house collapsed, and amidst the panic among the remaining 'Israeli' enemy forces in its vicinity, our fighters opened fire on those who have remained from the force with machine guns. - The clashes continued for over three hours, during which evacuation operations took place under heavy smoke and cover fire. - The 'Israeli' army admitted that an officer and 5 soldiers from Battalion 51 of Golani Brigade were killed in addition to four being wounded. - No ground activity by the Israeli enemy army has been recorded in the area since the incident until this date. - It is worth noting that during July 2006 aggression, a force from Battalion 51 of the Golani Brigade fell into a Resistance ambush on the eastern outskirts of Bint Jbeil which resulted in 8 soldiers being killed and over 25 being wounded, marking it as one of the most significant battles in the Golani Brigade's history and one of the hardest-fought engagements of the 'Second Lebanon War'. Eastern Sector: - The enemy has intensified its aggression on Al-Khiam city and its surroundings over recent days, carrying out over 60 airstrikes and drone attacks, in addition to launching more than 130 artillery shells. This was in preparation for a renewed attempt to advance toward the city after its initial failure over ten days ago due to the severe blows inflicted by the fighters. - Our fighters engaged with the advancing forces as they reached Wata Al-Khiam area south of the city, using machine guns and rocket shells. They also targeted two Merkava tanks with guided missiles, setting them ablaze and killing and wounding those inside. - Following a series of concentrated missile operations and direct clashes with the advancing forces from the eastern and southern directions of Al-Khiam, the enemy, facing heavy losses and under the relentless strikes of the fighters, partially retreated from the positions it had advanced to for the second time. The statement also illustrated the enemy losses in the ongoing ground battle between the Islamic Resistance and the Israeli enemy: Since the 'Israeli' enemy announced the start of the 'second phase' of its ground operation in southern Lebanon on November 12, 2024, the Islamic Resistance fighters have documented the following losses: - Over 18 killed and 32 wounded (some critically) among enemy troops. - Destruction of five Merkava tanks and one military bulldozer. So the cumulative losses of the 'Israeli' enemy from October 1, 2024, to the date of this statement are as follows: - Over 110 killed and more than 1,050 wounded among enemy officers and soldiers. - Destruction of 48 Merkava tanks, 9 military bulldozers, 2 Hummer vehicles, 2 armored vehicles, and 2 troop carriers. - Downing of 6 'Hermes 450' drones, 2 'Hermes 900' drones, and 1 'Quadcopter' glider. It is noteworthy that these figures do not include the enemy's losses at its bases, military sites, barracks, settlements, or occupied cities.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2271678	2024-11-19T11:16:08-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-09014400017320436769.jpg

Yemeni Armed Forces Target New Ship in Red Sea in Support of Resi...	In support for the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and resistance, the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out an operation targeting the ship 'Anadolu S' in the Red Sea with a number of appropriate ballistic and naval missiles. The naval hit was accurate and direct, the Yemeni military spokesman General Yahya Sarea said. The ship was targeted because it did not respond to the warnings of the naval forces and because the company that owns it violated the ban decision of entry to the ports of occupied Palestine, General Sarea added. The Yemeni Armed Forces confirmed the continuation in imposing a naval blockade on the Israeli enemy and targeting all ships linked , heading , or dealing with it as well as their continuation in targeting the Israeli enemy with missiles and drones, and that these operations will not stop until the aggression stops, the siege on the Gaza Strip is lifted, and the aggression on Lebanon stops. بيان القوات المسلحة اليمنية بشأن استهداف سفينة 'Anadolu S' في البحر الأحمر بعدد من الصواريخ الباليستية والبحرية المناسبة، وذلك لعدم استجابتها لتحذيرات القوات البحرية ولانتهاك الشركة المالكة لها قرار حظر الدخول إلى موانئ فلسطين المحتلة. pic.twitter.com/MXbfx1CgMQ — العميد يحيى سريع (@army21ye) November 19, 2024	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2271414	2024-11-19T06:37:44-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2019/09/manar-06187460015686244773.jpg
Gaza genocide continues for the 410th day, Catastrophic Condition...	On the 410th day of the aggression, the Israeli enemy continues its brutal aggression on every part of the Gaza Strip, while sources from inside the Strip reported that the occupation forces have blown up a number of buildings in the Beit Lahia Project area in the north.

The occupation forces also continue for the 28th day to forcibly disrupt the work of civil defense in the areas of the northern Gaza Strip due to the ongoing Israeli targeting and aggression, thus leaving thousands of citizens there without humanitarian and medical care. BREAKING: Five bodies have been recovered from a house in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza, that was bombarded yesterday by Israeli occupation forces, according to local sources. pic.twitter.com/XeNIPDrKDC — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) November 19, 2024 In this context, the Gaza Health announced that 'the occupation committed 3 massacres during the last 24 hours, of which 50 martyrs and 110 wounded arrived at hospitals,' noting that 'the number of victims of the Israeli aggression on the Strip has risen to 43,972 martyrs and 104 and 8 wounded.' Two Palestinians died of their wounds in the bombing of the central and southern Gaza Strip. An infant was also killed as a result of enemy artillery shelling that targeted Palestinian homes north of Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip. According to the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, Hussam Abu Safiya, the healthcare crisis in northern Gaza is rapidly deteriorating. 'Every day that passes since the beginning of the genocide in the northern governorate, the situation is getting worse. The health system is still in a state of disaster, and we are providing services at a minimum level,' he said. Abu Safiya confirmed the dire shortage of medical capabilities in the region, noting that Israel continues to block the arrival of critical medical delegations. 'Cases of malnutrition have begun to arrive at the hospital, most of them children and the elderly due to famine,' he added, warning that 'the risk of death threatens the lives of elderly patients due to the depletion of medicine and the spread of famine in northern Gaza.' The hospital director also reported that 'injured people are losing their lives daily due to the lack of doctors and medicines in the hospital.' This crisis has only worsened with the recent destruction of the only hospital in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, by the enemy. The worsening healthcare situation in Gaza is a direct result of the ongoing Israeli blockade and military attacks, which have crippled the region's medical infrastructure and left its most vulnerable populations without access to life-saving care.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2271337	2024-11-19T05:22:13-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-08604690017306480946.jpg
Lebanon Stands Firm against Israeli Conditions in Under-Fire Ceas...	Lebanon has been firmly standing against the Israeli conditions during talks aimed at reaching a ceasefire. The Israeli enemy has been escalating its attacks in the latest days with at least 3 strikes targeting the capital Beirut on Sunday and Monday, in attacks that described by observers as a direct message of pressure and negotiations that are under fire. The latest strike on Beirut was on Monday evening, when an aerial attack targeted a center for humanitarian aids in a densely populated residential area, killing at least five people, including a mayor and his assistant, and injuring many others. In a new push for a ceasefire between Lebanon and the Zionist entity, US envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut on Tuesday, a day after Lebanon handed its response to the US ceasefire proposal. Hochstein met with Lebanese officials including Speaker Nabih Berri, caretaker PM Najib Mikati and Army Commander Joseph Aoun. US envoy AMos Hochstein and Lebanese Speaker Nabih Berri in Beirut (October 21, 2024). Meanwhile, and despite reports on 'optimism' over reaching a deal, caution still prevails ‘Israel Can’t Be Trusted’ Al-Araby Al-Jadeed newspaper quoted sources close to Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri as saying that the Zionist entity 'cannot be trusted,' and that Beirut is negotiating under fire and constant escalation. 'Although the atmosphere is somewhat positive, it cannot be built upon or taken into account, whether for previous experiences with the enemy on the Lebanese level, the latest of which was the American-French initiative, or the truce path in Gaza,' the sources said. 'The enemy is resorting to escalation, expanding its targets, and attacking civilians and civil defense. On Sunday, it also attacked the Lebanese army in the south, which indicates its criminality, intentions, and attempt to exert pressure with force of fire to impose its conditions,' according to the sources. Conditions As for details of the US ceasefire proposal, Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar reported on Tuesday that the US, Lebanon and the Zionist entity kept the draft proposal confidential. However, leaks revealed that it includes 12 points, and that the points of contention are two: The first is related to the 'principle of self-defense,' which the draft calls for adopting as a right for both parties (Lebanon and the Zionist entity), while the second is related to the membership of the committee overseeing the implementation of the UN Resolution 1701, according to the Lebanese daily. Lebanon believes that the 'right to self-defense' is guaranteed by the international laws and cannot be included in a ceasefire deal, and that Tel Aviv’s insistence on it conceals a desire to obtain so-called 'legitimacy' for any hostile action against Lebanon under the pretext of 'self-defense', Al-Akhbar added, stressing that Beirut categorically rejects such conditions. Regarding the committee overseeing the implementation of 1701, Al-Akhbar reported that Lebanon has reservations about the membership of Britain and Germany and about the working mechanism of this committee. Hezbollah Stance Earlier on Monday, Member of Hezbollah’s Loyalty to Resistance parliamentary bloc, MP Ihab Hamade stressed that the stance on the ceasefire has 3 constants: 'Adherence to Resolution 1701 without any amendment, safeguarding Lebanese sovereignty, and ensuring that the enemy gains nothing politically it couldn’t achieve militarily.' 'We seek a ceasefire and remain open to dialogue, but we are not begging for any agreement; our focus is on the battlefield,' the Lebanese lawmaker added. #Israeli Army Took 7 Days to Reach #Beirut in 1982, Battling #Hezbollah on Border for 40 Days in 2024 #جنوب_لبنان #المقاومة_الاسلامية pic.twitter.com/kC1pDx1Oj5 — ManarWeb (@WebManar) November 9, 2024 In his latest speech, Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem stressed that Speaker Nabih Berri is leading Lebanon’s talks, along with PM Najib Mikati, stressing that Lebanon will never accept any deal that violate its sovereignty.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2271172	2024-11-19T04:35:21-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-02967310017320196763.jpg

Hochstein Arrives in Beirut for Ceasefire Talks	US Presidential Envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut, Lebanon today, landing at Rafic Hariri International Airport around 8:00 am. Hochstein's visit comes amid cautious optimism from Lebanese officials, including Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, about the prospects of reaching an agreement to end the 58-day Israeli aggression on Lebanon. Lebanon delivered a response to a proposed US draft ceasefire agreement to the US embassy in Beirut yesterday. This came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for the 'freedom of action for the Israeli army' and preventing weapons from entering Lebanon from Syria - remarks seen as an attempt to gain political ground he has failed to achieve militarily. The resistance's response to Netanyahu's aggression was swift and painful. Yesterday, the resistance launched heavy missiles that reached the heart of Tel Aviv, directly hitting a building and sparking a fire in the Ramat Gan area, resulting in injuries among Israeli settlers. The Islamic Resistance also announced an air attack using suicide drones on sensitive military targets in Tel Aviv. As Hochstein arrives in Beirut to broker a ceasefire, the resistance has made it clear it will not back down in the face of continued Israeli aggression, raising the stakes in this high-stakes diplomatic dance.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2270831	2024-11-19T01:13:17-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-00451270017320075923.jpg

'We hope to reach a ceasefire in Lebanon in the nearest time,' he said. 'The key matter for us in the US ceasefire proposal is the implementation of Resolution 1701. Lebanon is committed to its implementation, and our goal is its implementation in south of Litani,' he stressed, emphasizing the necessity of restoring stability and ending the bloodshed and destruction in south Lebanon. 'Speaker Nabih Berri is leading the negotiations with the US mediator, and I am in constant touch with him, and I haven’t heard about any condition relevant to Israel’s operational freedom in Lebanon,' he went on saying. 'What matters to me is to reinforce the presence of the (Lebanese) army in south Lebanon,' he stated, adding that there should only be the so-called 'legitimate' weapons. Mikati also stressed that 'the Israeli enemy must draw back from any move it has taken inside the Lebanese territory.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2270237	2024-11-18T04:38:20-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-07260790017286522724.jpg
Israeli Security Chiefs Urge Netanyahu to Soften Stance on Captiv...	Families of Israeli captives held in Gaza protested on Monday calling on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach a deal to free the hostages. The protest was a day after a select group of Israeli ministers and top security brass reportedly planned to tell an emergency meeting on efforts to free the Israeli captives that agreeing to an end to the war with Hamas was the only way to reach a deal. Dozens of family members of Israeli captives and their supporters demonstrated outside Netanyahu’s residence in occupied Al-Quds (Jerusalem), calling on him to reach a deal to free the captives held by Hamas in Gaza. They warned that a deal is even more urgent with winter approaching. Families of Israeli captives rally outside PM Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in occupied Al-Quds on Monday 'The hostages won’t survive the freezing cold in the tunnels of Gaza,' the organizers said in a statement, according to The Times of Israel. 'While Netanyahu and his team are busy trying to skew public opinion, 101 hostages are dying in impossible conditions.' The protest on Monday was preceded by another rally, also outside Netanyahu’s residence, to call on the Israeli premier to release the captives and end the war in Gaza. Protesters rally outside Netanyahu’s residence in Al-Quds, demanding reaching a deal (Sunday, November 17, 2024). On Sunday evening, Netanyahu hosted an emergency meeting with some ministers and top security chiefs at the Kirya Defense Ministry headquarters in Tel Aviv. The head of the Shin Bet security agency, Ronen Bar, Israeli Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, Mossad Director David Barnea, and the Israeli military’s hostage point man Maj. Gen. (res.) Nitzan Alon were set to tell ministers that Hamas is still demanding an end to the war and the military’s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, even after troops killed the Palestinian resistance group’s leader Yahya Sinwar last month, unnamed sources told multiple Hebrew media outlets. The security chiefs planned on emphasizing that agreeing to such demands would be the only way to reach a deal, the reports said. A senior defense official told Channel 13 news that Barnea was set to present new options for reaching a deal given Hamas’s stance, with the report not going into further detail. Defense Minister Israel Katz, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich were reportedly involved in Sunday’s meeting. The meeting came off the back of an assessment held earlier Sunday between Katz and defense officials on the subject of the captives, announced by the defense minister’s office, and a separate joint meeting between Bar, Halevi, Barnea and Alon, announced by the Shin Bet, which said it focused on 'advancing the efforts to return the hostages.' Israeli Channel 12 reported that the security chiefs gave Katz a very grim assessment of the condition of the captives who have been held by in Gaza for more than 400 days.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2270083	2024-11-18T03:01:23-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-02946160017319276042.jpeg

Berri to Netanyahu: Pressure-for-Surrender Policy Doesn’t Work	Lebanese Speaker Nabih Berri revealed that efforts aimed at reaching a ceasefire between Lebanon and the Zionist entity are underway, stressing that the Israeli policy aimed at pressuring Lebanon in a bid to force it to surrender doesn’t work. In remarks published by Al-Sharq Al-Awsat Newspaper late Friday, Berri affirmed that 'There can be no undermining of our sovereignty.' He firmly denied reports that the US proposal which was reportedly delivered to him via US Ambassador Lisa Johnson earlier this week, didn’t stipulated that the Israeli occupation military would have freedom of movement in Lebanon. Concerning freedom of (Israeli) movement in Lebanon, 'This is not up for discussion and there is no room for discussion about it. The Americans know this very well,' the Lebanese speaker said, as quoted by the paper. Meanwhile, he added that the US proposal is not unacceptable regarding the formation of an international committee that will monitor the implementation of Resolution 1701. 'As for Resolution 1701, There is no approval to form an international committee that will monitor the implementation of Resolution 1701, nor to introduce multinational or NATO forces. There is commitment to UN Resolution 1701. The work of UNIFIL forces and the Lebanese army will be activated to implement it.' Asked about the massive Israeli strikes on his hometown of Tebnine and other neighborhoods in Beirut’s Dahiyeh, Speaker Berri said: 'It seems that (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu thinks that when he wants to force someone to surrender he acts harshly. However, he doesn’t know whom he is dealing with, and that this policy doesn’t work with us.' Earlier on Friday, Berri met with Ali Larijani, an advisor to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, in Beirut.

Sayyed Houthi: Targeting US Aircraft Carrier Frustrated Major Ame...	Head of Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi indicated that Yemen continues its operations and activities as part of the Promised Victory Battle and Sacred Jihad. This week, military operations were carried out with 29 ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as drones, Sayyed Houthi said Thursday in his speech. Our military operations targeted deep and southern areas of occupied Palestine, including Jaffa, Ashkelon, Umm Al-Rashrash, and an 'Israeli' enemy air base in the Negev Desert, as well as maritime targets, he added. Sayyed Houthi revealed that the most notable of our naval operations was the targeting of the American aircraft carrier 'USS Abraham Lincoln' in the Arabian Sea, which fled hundreds of miles after being struck. Since the retreat of the American aircraft carrier that was previously in the Red Sea, the enemy has avoided entering the Red Sea, and no aircraft carrier has entered it since that time, he stressed. 'The American aircraft carrier now moves either from the Gulf to the Gulf of Oman, the edges of the Indian Ocean, or in the Arabian Sea with caution and disguise. In some instances, the American aircraft carrier navigates close to certain African coastlines out of fear of being targeted.' 'No nation in the world has decided to target an American aircraft carrier like Yemen has, thanks to Allah's support and the result of the faith-based, Quranic, and fight orientation of our esteemed people.' 'Who dares to make the decision to target an American aircraft carrier and execute it by actually launching missiles and drones to attack it?!' Sayyed Houthi noted that the American aircraft carrier 'Lincoln' retreated hundreds of miles deep into the Arabian Sea following its targeting. 'Along with the targeting of the aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, two American warships were targeted in the Red Sea.' The maritime operation was executed at a time when the Americans were preparing to carry out the most extensive aerial assault on our country since their declaration of support for the 'Israeli' enemy, Sayyed Houthi added. 'The American-planned operation failed, putting them on the defensive line, and their aircraft carrier retreated hundreds of miles.' As long as the 'Israeli' enemy continues its aggression—along with the American support—against Gaza and the Lebanese people, we will continue our operations, Sayyed Houthi reiterated.

Israeli Police to Question Netanyahu Chief of Staff over Blackmai...	Israeli police will question Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s chief of staff over blackmailing of an Israeli occupation officer. Tzachi Braverman will be questioned under caution today by the police’s Lahav 443 serious crimes unit, Hebrew media reported. Braverman was reported on Sunday to be the official suspected of blackmailing an Israeli military officer to alter minutes from wartime meetings by threatening him over a sensitive video recording of the officer. The case, one of several scandals roiling the Netanyahu’s office, is largely under a court gag order. The reports said police will ask to lift the order after he completes his questioning. Braverman’s name was first reported by the Kan public broadcaster, which also stated that the video in question had been obtained from security cameras in the Israeli premier’s office and that other employees in the office had been allowed to watch the recording. In a statement, Braverman denied any such activity, calling the report 'false' and 'defamatory,' and claiming he had neither collected any such video nor attempted to use it for blackmail purposes: 'This is a lie from start to finish, whose aim is to harm me and the Prime Minister’s Office in the middle of a war.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2266200	2024-11-14T02:19:23-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-06789110017315795038.jpg

Islamic Resistance Ops Room: Our Attacks Have Left More than 100 ...	The Islamic Resistance Operations Room issued on Tuesday a statement to detail the developments of 'The Formidable in Might' Battle, highlighting the achievements reached by the Resistance fighters. The Islamic Resistance fighters continue to confront the 'Israeli' aggression on Lebanon, inflicting severe losses on the enemy's army in personnel and equipment, including officers and soldiers, across the frontlines and into the depth of occupied Palestine, according to the statement which highlighted every section of this confrontation, as follows: Ground Engagements: • Western Sector: - Due to intensive and concentrated strikes by the Resistance, the 'Israeli' army has withdrawn from most towns it had advanced into, retreating behind the border, except for the continued presence of Division 146 units in the forests of Al-Labbuneh and east of Al-Naqoura, where they attempt to advance toward Wadi Hamoul from the eastern side of the town. No infiltration attempts have been recorded in the border towns of the western sector since October 28, 2024. The enemy conducts repeated sweeps from border positions, targeting areas it has withdrawn from with artillery fire and airstrikes on secondary line towns, including Tyr Harfa, Al-Batishiyah, Al-Jibein, Shihine, and Sidiqeen,etc&#8230; - In Maroun Al-Ras area, our fighters carried out more than 24 operations using missiles and attack drones against 'Israeli' army positions and gatherings of forces and equipment advancing into Lebanese territory. Additionally, 26 missile and artillery strikes targeted settlements, including Avivim, Dovev, Sa’sa, Bar’am, Yir'on, Dishon, Malkiya, and Bar Yohai. These settlements house air defense and missile bases, command centers for participating battalions, weapons depots, and vehicle assembly areas under the command of Division 36 in the 'Israeli' army. - When an 'Israeli' force attempted to infiltrate from the town of Yaroun toward western Maroun Al-Ras, our fighters ambushed and engaged the infiltrating force with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, inflicting casualties among the enemy. - East of Maroun Al-Ras, between the town and Aitaroun, our fighters ambushed an 'Israeli' force attempting to infiltrate toward Ainatha. Intense close-range combat erupted, with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, resulting in all members of the enemy force being killed and wounded. Our fighters withdrew from the ambush point under cover fire from the Islamic Resistance support units. • Eastern Sector: - Under the Resistance’s strikes, 'Israeli' forces retreated from the towns of Meiss El Jabal, Markaba Rab Thalathin, Odaisseh, and Al-Khiam to positions behind the border. The enemy is now targeting secondary line villages in this sector with artillery and airstrikes. - Following the precise operation in Al-Khiam and after tracking Division 91’s movements at the eastern edges of Hula and around the Al-Abbad border post, our fighters launched qualitative missiles at a gathering of 'Israeli' forces and equipment, causing massive explosions, casualties, and extensive damage to the site and the vehicles within it. - In Kfar Kila, as the engineering units of Division 98 in the 'Israeli' army were demolishing homes and infrastructure, our fighters struck two bulldozers and an armored personnel carrier with guided missiles, killing and wounding the personnel within. Attempts to extract the casualties were met with intense missile barrages. Khaibar Operations Series: - Since its initiation, the Khaibar operations series has included 70 operations, targeting 33 strategic objectives up to 145 km south of Tel Aviv, such as military, logistics, air, and naval bases, air defense and missile sites, command centers, communication and intelligence bases, and training camps.  - The Resistance’s air force participated in 22 operations within the Khaibar series, launching more than 60 advanced drones with a range of up to 145 km, reaching the southern outskirts of 'Tel Aviv.' Missile Force: - The Resistance’s missile force continues targeting enemy concentrations at military sites and bases along the Lebanese-Palestinian border and strategic, security, and military bases within occupied Palestine. Various types of missiles, including precision-guided ones used for the first time, are employed. - Since the start of 'The Formidable in Might' battle on September 17, 2024, the missile force has conducted over 1,020 missile strikes, 125 of which occurred in the past week alone. - On November 6, 2024, for the first time, the missile force launched the Fateh 110 missile, striking the Tzrifin base located 130 km from the closest point to the Lebanese-Palestinian border. Air Force: - The Resistance’s air force continues targeting enemy military sites, bases, and gatherings of enemy officers and soldiers, straining all levels of the 'Israeli' air defense system and the 'Israeli' air force, which is deploying both fighter jets and helicopters. This has led to a state of exhaustion and incapacity among 'Israeli' military branches. - Cameras operated by frightened settlers - prompted by ongoing alarms in all settlements and cities since our drones breached the border - document repeated 'Israeli' failures to down Resistance drones, which reach their targets with precision, causing losses in the 'Israeli' army ranks. - Since the start of Al-Aqsa Flood Battle until November 12, 2024, the Resistance’s air force has conducted more than 315 operations, deploying over 1,000 drones of varying sizes and capabilities, including 105 operations that have been conducted with more than 300 drones since the beginning of 'The Formidable in Might' battle on September 17, 2024. • According to the statement, the cumulative toll of the enemy’s losses observed by the Islamic Resistance fighters since the enemy began its so-called 'ground maneuver in southern Lebanon' on October 1, 2024, includes: - Over 100 killed and 1,000 wounded among 'Israeli' army officers and soldiers. - Destruction of 43 Merkava tanks, eight military bulldozers, two Hummer vehicles, two armored personnel carriers, and two troop carriers. - Downing of four 'Hermes 450' drones and two 'Hermes 900' drones. It is noted that these figures do not include enemy losses in military bases, installations, settlements, and occupied cities. The Islamic Resistance Operations Room affirmed, in the statement, the following: - The decision by the 'Israeli' army leadership to move to the second phase of its 'ground maneuver' in southern Lebanon will lead only to more losses and failures; our fighters are ready. - The Resistance has taken all defensive measures to engage in a prolonged battle, preventing the enemy from achieving its goals, and is committed to defending the freedom, sovereignty, and dignity of its people. The frontlines in all sectors are fully equipped with personnel and resources across various military specialties. - Despite enemy claims of control over the border villages, our fighters have continued to conduct missile strikes from the Lebanese-Palestinian border into occupied territory, surprising the enemy with direct engagements behind its lines. - The Khaibar operations series continues at a high pace. Despite the enemy’s intense intelligence and aerial campaigns, it cannot prevent these operations from reaching their military objectives and inflicting confirmed damage, forcing hundreds of thousands of settlers into shelters with each missile and drone launch.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2264803	2024-11-12T13:28:58-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-05112750017314469268.jpg
Yemeni Armed Forces Attack American Aircraft Carrier, Two Destroy...	In retaliation to the American-British aggression against Yemen and in continuation of supporting the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples, the missile, UAV forces of the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out two specific military operations. In a statement read by the military spokesman, General Yahya Sarea, the Yemeni Armed Forces detailed the attacks and their outcomes. The first operation targeted the American aircraft carrier (Abraham) located in the Arabian Sea with a number of cruise missiles and drones while the American enemy was preparing to carry out hostile operations targeting our country, Sarea said. The operation has successfully achieved its objectives, and led to thwarting the operation that the American enemy was preparing against our country, he added. 'The other operation targeted two American destroyers in the Red Sea with a number of ballistic missiles and drones. The operation has successfully achieved its objectives.' The two operations took eight hours in a row, Sarea affirmed. Accordingly, the Yemeni Armed Forces hold the American and British enemy responsible for turning the Red Sea region into a zone of military tension and its repercussions on maritime navigation, according to the statement. 'Launching an aggression against Yemen within the American-British defensive actions of the Israeli enemy by the American warships will only push the Yemeni Armed Forces to further use their legitimate right to defend, confront and strike all hostile threats in the Red and Arab Seas and in any other region that Yemeni weapons reach.' The operations of the Yemeni Armed Forces will not stop until the aggression on Gaza is stopped, the siege is lifted and the aggression on Lebanon is stopped, the statement concluded. بيان القوات المسلحة اليمنيةبشأن تنفيذ عمليتين عسكريتين أولاهمااستهدفت حاملة الطائرات الأمريكية(إبراهام) في البحر العربي بعدد من الصواريخ المجنحةوالطائرات المسيرة،والأخرى استهدفت مدمرتين أمريكيتين في البحرالأحمربعدد من الصواريخ الباليستيةوالطائرات المسيرة. pic.twitter.com/WqnepzykiY — العميد يحيى سريع (@army21ye) November 12, 2024	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2264495	2024-11-12T08:51:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/04/manar-09219370016189056621.jpg

Speaker Berri: No Solution at Lebanon’s Expense, Battlefield Has ...	Lebanese Speaker Nabih Berri affirmed on Tuesday that no settlement will be at the expense of Lebanon, as he reiterated that the battlefield has the final say. In remarks to Lebanese newspaper Al-Jumhouriya, Speaker Berri said that 'Lebanon’s stance is clear: Ceasefire and implementation of UN Resolution 1701.' 'Any sane person can believe that we would agree to a settlement that serves the interests of ‘Israel’ at the expense of Lebanon and its sovereignty?' the Lebanese speaker wondered. 'Last September, France put forward an initiative that was supported by the UA and signed by a large group of countries. It was like a joint call to end the war. All parties responded to this call, except for ‘Israel’, which alone did not commit and blew up these efforts,' Speaker Berri told the Lebanese paper. 'That call is now behind us and we won’t return to. What is required now is a ceasefire and the full implementation of UN Resolution 1701. This is what we agreed upon with US envoy Amos Hochstein.'

On the other hand, the Lebanese speaker noted that the Israeli forces haven’t managed to seize control of any of the Lebanese border towns, stressing: 'The battlefield has the final say.' Earlier last week, Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem said that Speaker Berri has been responsible for talks aimed at ending the Israeli aggression, describing Berri’s efforts as the political resistance. The newly elected Hezbollah S.G. stressed in a televised speech that there is no room for any solution that disregards Lebanon’s sovereignty.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2264209	2024-11-12T04:45:18-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/03/manar-08269500016170111069.jpg

Hezbollah on Martyr’s Day: 100K Fighters to Avenge Sayyed Nasrall...	Head of Hezbollah Media Relation Department Hajj Mohammad Afifi held on Monday a press conference at Sayyed Al-Shuhada Complex in Ruweis, Beirut's Dahiyeh, on the occasion of the Resistance Group's Martyr Day which falls every November 11. Afif recalled how every year the former Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah attends the Complex in order to address the eager crowds on martyrdom and narrate the great stories of the martyrs. This year the scene is different, and Sayyed Nasrallah has been martyred, yet still leading the battle of the 'Formidable in Might', Afif stressed. Hezbollah designates November 11 as Martyr’s Day, a solemn occasion commemorating the sacrifice of all martyrs and especially Ahmad Kassir, who valiantly orchestrated a pivotal operation against the Israeli military command in Tyre back in 1982, reshaping the course of history Marking the anniversary of Martyr Kassir this year is done by achieving victory in the battle field, Afif stressed. Afif stressed that valiant fighters of Hezbollah are eager to meet the enemy and avenge the martyrdom of their master, adding that the Resistance fight will determine the fate of the nation and the entire Middle East. Afif added that around 65 thousand Israeli soldiers have failed to control any of the Lebanese border villages after 45 days of fierce clashes with Hezbollah fighters. Hezbollah has the Husseini will to fight till martyrdom, enough time till the advent of the winter season when it will submerge the Zionist tanks in the Lebanese mud, and the land which it knows well and where the Resistance fighters can perform free movements and maneuvers. Afif noted that the air force supremacy cannot grant the enemy victory, adding that, if the Israeli occupation forces fail to control the ground, Tel Aviv will not be able to impose its terms in politics. 'Along with more 'home' front cracks, there will be a turning point which will prove again that 'Israel' is weaker than a spider web.' Afif maintained that Hezbollah has enough weapons, equipment and supplies to engage in a long battle, adding that the Resistance use of heavy and precision missile barrages, including Fateh-110, answers the Zionist claims about the deficiency of Hezbollah rocket stockpiles. Hezbollah official underlined the firm ties between Hezbollah and the Lebanese Army, recalling the martyrdom of martyr Sayyed Hadi Nasrallah along with the Army officer Jawad Azar in addition to the martyrdom of the army officer Mohammad Farhat in the border village of Aitaroun as well as his funeral in Zgharta which turned to be a national wedding. This reflects the real role of the army in protecting Lebanon, Afif affirmed. Some Lebanese parties who fought the Army in the civil war allege now to defending the army by opening the political fire at the Resistance raising a normal question about the Israeli landing operation in Batroun, Afif said, emphasizing that those will fail to strike the relation between Hezbollah and the Resistance. Afif highlighted the malicious pro-Israeli propaganda against the Resistance and its social milieu, adding that it witnessed a come-back after Hezbollah restored its power. The Israeli aggression dates back to the thirties of the past century and has started before the emergence of Hezbollah, according to Afif who wondered about the intentions behind this reality distortion. Afif indicated that Hezbollah acknowledges the high cost of the resistance against the occupation and aggression, asking about the alternative choice and maintaining that patience will certainly lead to victory. Afif underscored that the battlefield was portrayed by Maariv which said that 50K Zionist soldiers have failed to occupy any Lebanese village. Hezbollah official praised Amsterdam protests against the Zionist hooligans, adding that, despite the governmental complicity in the West, the public can highlight Israeli's isolation. After the press conference, Afif led the reporters in a tour to inspect the massive destruction caused by the barbaric Zionist aggression on Beirut's Dahiyeh.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2263472	2024-11-11T10:05:01-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-02866230017313482725.jpeg

General Saree reiterated Yemen's commitment to supporting the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples, vowing that YAF operations will continue until the Israeli aggression ends, the blockade on Gaza is lifted, and attacks on Lebanon cease. This strike comes just days after the YAF announced to have targeted and hit the Nevatim airbase in southern occupied Palestine. The Yemeni forces also recently announced downing a US MQ-9 drone that was conducting hostile operations in Yemeni airspace over the al-Jawf province.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2263318	2024-11-11T04:38:19-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/04/manar-09219370016189056621.jpg
Iraqi Resistance Unleashes 6 Drone Strikes on Occupied Israeli Ta...	The Islamic Resistance in Iraq launched a series of six drone strikes targeting strategic sites in the occupied territories on Monday. This latest round of attacks comes as part of the group's ongoing efforts to support the people of Palestine and Lebanon and resist the Israeli occupation. According to statements from the Islamic Resistance, the first operation involved a drone strike on a vital target in the southern region of the occupied territories. This was followed by two more strikes against significant locations in the north, marking a successive operation in that area. Later, a fourth drone strike was launched against a vital target in southern occupied Palestine, the second such attack in that region since midnight. 🔻مشاهد من اطلاق المقاومة الاسلامية في العراق لطيران مسير باتجاه هدف حيوي في شمال الاراضي المحتلة. بتاريخ ١١-١١-٢٠٢٤ pic.twitter.com/vFcFfF1fpK — قناة المنار (@TVManar1) November 11, 2024 On Monday morning, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq announced that its fighters had carried out two additional operations, using drones to strike two separate vital targets in northern occupied Palestine. This brings the total number of operations conducted overnight to six, and eight since last night, as the Iraqi Resistance vowed to escalate its retaliation against Israeli aggression in Palestine and Lebanon. 🔻مشاهد من اطلاق المقاومة الاسلامية في العراق لطيران مسير باتجاه هدف عسكري في شمال الاراضي المحتلة بتاريخ ١١-١١-٢٠٢٤ pic.twitter.com/1jIHoi1aBp — قناة المنار (@TVManar1) November 11, 2024 These actions are in direct response to the massacres committed by the Israeli occupation against Palestinian civilians, including children, women, and the elderly. The Resistance has emphasized its commitment to continuing and intensifying these operations to strike at enemy strongholds. This latest wave of drone strikes follows a previous announcement by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq on November 6, when its fighters launched three separate drone strikes targeting an Israeli military site in northern occupied Palestine.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2263296	2024-11-11T04:15:21-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-021635200172940795210.png
Israeli Settlers in Northern ‘Israel’ Voice Doubts over Security ...	Israeli settlers in northern occupied territories are expressing deep concern and skepticism toward their government and military’s assurances about returning to their homes, as resistance rocket fire continues to strike the area. Many settlers are questioning the future of settlement in northern ‘Israel’, warning of the war’s potential long-term impact on the region. Despite the Israeli army's expanded operations against Lebanon, settlers in the north remain unconvinced. The continuing rocket fire and lack of 'apparent safety' have left many pessimistic about returning, especially as Hezbollah maintains a fortified presence in the Galilee, creating uncertainty about the future. 'It is said that many will not return to the north; a lot of the displaced have moved elsewhere because we feel isolated. There’s nothing here—no shops, no infrastructure. We travel to Nahariya weekly for necessities. There’s little to encourage people to build a life here,' said Zohar Levi, a resident of Netu’a. Another settler, who preferred anonymity, Israeli media said, highlighted the dangers faced by children in the region: 'Why would I expose my children to such danger? I grew up like this, with my father killed in Lebanon and the constant threat of rockets. I don’t want my children to live this way.' ⚡️JUST IN: Haifa is turning into a ghost town, and the Israeli army radio reports that more than a million settlers ran to shelters after Hezbollah launched a rocket at Haifa and the north, just a short while ago. pic.twitter.com/x2QQ9jBmrl — Suppressed News. (@SuppressedNws) September 29, 2024 Benny Cohen, a soldier from Netu’a, expressed resistance to evacuation: 'I don’t believe in leaving. If we abandon our homes, it signals the end of the Zionist project. We must stay here, even under threat, to ensure the future of settlements.' Ron Avman, a former IOF commander, echoed the loss of confidence: 'Before October 7, parents in the north trusted the IDF for protection. Now, that trust is broken. If we don’t investigate this thoroughly and learn, we may never rebuild it.' Local northern authorities have rejected military calls for settlers to return, deeming them irresponsible and endangering lives. Ongoing attacks from Hezbollah underscore the fragility of Israeli assurances, casting doubt on any notion of peace and security in the region, Israeli media reported. Resistance Strengthens Its Grip on Northern Occupied Territories Islamic Resistance forces continue their attacks, dispelling Israeli leaders' promises to settlers about returning safely. Statements by Israeli officials paint a picture of stability, but field realities suggest otherwise, as the Resistance exerts control over the northern border. IOF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi recently suggested a gradual return of residents in the coming months, yet these remain 'pipe dreams' given the Resistance’s determination to disrupt them. In northern occupied territories, many settlers are hesitant to return, citing the continuous threat of rocket fire and lack of reliable protection. Halevi’s meetings with local leaders failed to assuage fears or encourage resettlement, as heavy rocket barrages persist. Just yesterday, resistance fire rained on Haifa Bay and Sharon, with around seventy missiles and numerous drones targeting strategic locations despite Israeli airstrikes. Israeli Media Highlights Security Concerns in the North Israeli news channel correspondent Uria Keshet noted that Hezbollah has managed to maintain its attacks despite intensified Israeli ground and air operations. Meanwhile, Channel 13 military correspondent Or Heller reported that while the ground operation is nearing its end, a strategic deadlock remains. Israeli forces are hesitant to conclude their ground operation without political progress, aware that northern residents are unlikely to return without robust security guarantees. The ongoing resistance operations cast doubt on Israel’s efforts to secure its northern regions. With the possibility of a ceasefire being discussed, Israeli leaders are insisting on the right to intervene, signaling an uncertain path ahead for northern settlements.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2262834	2024-11-10T11:57:51-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/11/manar-08607740016993491181.jpg

The Syrian Ministry of Defense reported that an Israeli airstrike targeted a residential building in the Sayyida Zeinab area near Damascus on Sunday resulting in civilian casualties and significant damage. According to the ministry, the attack took place around 5:00 PM local time and was launched from the occupied Syrian Golan Heights.

A Syrian military source confirmed that these attacks resulted in injuries to several soldiers and caused material damage. Explosions were heard near the al-Safira area southeast of Aleppo, where multiple sites were targeted. The Syrian Foreign Ministry condemned the repeated Israeli attacks, asserting that the continued targeting of civilian areas by the Israeli Occupation Forces reflects a lack of serious international efforts to curb such aggression. The ministry renewed its call for the United Nations to take immediate action to halt these assaults and hold those responsible to account.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2262779	2024-11-10T09:58:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-00847950017312614597.jpg
Israeli Occupation Forces Carry Out More Massacres in Northern Ga...	On the 401st day of Israel’s aggression against Gaza, it has become clear that the enemy is committing acts of extermination against the people of the north, witnessed by the world. Even Israeli media has admitted this, with Haaretz reporting that the commander of the 162nd division confirmed executing 'ethnic cleansing' operations in northern Gaza, preventing Palestinians from returning under orders from the military and political leadership. For 37 days, nothing has been spared from destruction—people, homes, and even animals—amid the use of internationally banned weapons. In this context, Hamas' Al-Qassam Brigades announced on Sunday that its fighters targeted and killed a 15-soldier Israeli patrol with RPGs and light weapons west of Sheikh Zayed, in northern Gaza. The brigades also hit two Israeli military vehicles with 'Yassin 105' and 'Tandem' rockets and destroyed a bulldozer near the Al-Qassam mosque in Jabaliya camp.

A young man was martyred in the ongoing Israeli shelling of the camp. Additionally, five Palestinians were martyred and others injured in an Israeli airstrike on a house near Al-Salam Mosque in the Sabra neighborhood, south of Gaza City. Rescue operations are still underway for missing persons. On the other hand, Israeli warboats fired several shells towards the shores of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip. A Palestinian martyr was reported and others injured as a result of an Israeli airstrike on a house in the Old Gaza Street in northern Gaza City. Israeli enemy warboats also targeted the area west of the Nusseirat Refugee Camp in central Gaza. Additionally, a young man from the Al-Shaboura Refugee Camp was martyred due to Israeli shelling on the city of Rafah. Hamas Urges Arab Leaders to Act Against Gaza Genocide Hamas condemned the Alloush family massacre in Jabalia as further proof of Israeli enemy's ethnic cleansing efforts against the besieged population in northern Gaza. The group called on Arab and Islamic leaders to take a firm stance, demanding urgent international intervention to halt the genocide and hold Israeli war criminals accountable. Popular Front: Jabalia Massacre a Stain on Arab Regimes The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced the Jabalia massacre as a shameful mark on Arab governments and the international community. It accused the US of playing a central role in the ongoing genocide, as the global silence and complicity continue. Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor Warns of Imminent Hunger Crisis The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor demanded that the famine be recognized officially, emphasizing that 'Israel' continues to use starvation as a weapon. The group noted that 'more than 50 days have passed since the occupation blocked aid to the besieged people in the north,' adding that 'tens of thousands of Palestinians in the north are facing the imminent threat of death by hunger.' The Monitor stressed that 'the world bears responsibility for the hunger crisis created by the occupation in Gaza,' warning that 'the famine crisis in Gaza has reached a point of no return.' This comes as Israeli Channel 11 reported that Netanyahu’s government is concerned that a potential famine declaration by the World Health Organization could lead to sanctions on 'Israel' and an arms export ban.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2262735	2024-11-10T09:11:38-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-03554820017312583591.png
Day 49: Israeli Enemy Commits Massacres Across Lebanon to Conceal...	The Israeli enemy persisted for the 49th day in its relentless assault on Lebanon, unleashing a deadly campaign against innocent civilians, marked by unmatched brutality and senseless destruction. Yet, even by its own admission, it has spectacularly failed to achieve its main goal: ensuring the safe return of northern settlers. Highlighting this failure, the head of the settlement council in Zar’it, northern occupied Palestine, admitted, 'We do not feel safe, and the army’s operations in Lebanon are insufficient to give us a sense of security and allow us to return home.' Horrific Maacre in Almat, Jbeil District Even in so-called 'safe areas,' where hundreds of displaced people have sought refuge from its aggression in the Bekaa Valley, the south, and Beirut's southern suburbs, the Israeli enemy continues to perpetrate horrific massacres. On Sunday, Israeli warplanes targeted a house sheltering displaced families in the town of Almat (Jbeil district), resulting in a massacre that claimed 24 lives, including seven children, and left several others injured. Video Captures Aftermath of Israeli Strike on Almat, Jbeil The Lebanese Ministry of Health issued a statement updating the toll: 24 martyrs, including seven children, and six wounded. The ministry added, 'Efforts to clear the rubble are still ongoing.' Israeli Aggression on South Lebanon Israeli occupation warplanes also launched an airstrike on the town of Adloun, targeting an Islamic Health Organization vehicle, resulting in the martyrdom of three paramedics. Meanwhile, Israeli enemy aircraft bombed the town of Sarafand in the Sidon district. In the town of Jdeidet Marjeyoun, Israeli occupation airstrikes targeted two vehicles, while Israeli jets also attacked the town of Al-Wazzani. Since morning, the town of Khiyam has been subject to intermittent artillery shelling, while the towns of Beit Leif and Ain Ebel in the Bint Jbeil district were also shelled by Israeli forces. An Israeli occupation drone also carried out a guided missile strike on the area between the towns of Kfarsir and Sir Al-Gharbiyeh. In the Nabatieh district, another Israeli drone targeted the area between the towns of Kfar Tibnit and Arnoun. Additionally, enemy aircraft launched a strike on a house in the Al-Saha neighborhood of Zawtar Al-Gharbiyeh, completely destroying it. Additionally, the southern and eastern outskirts of the town of Yohmor Al-Shakif were shelled, with the attack hitting the center of the town.
