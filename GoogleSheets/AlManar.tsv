Nicaragua Severs Ties with Genocidal ‘Israel’ over Its War on Gaz...	Nicaragua has severed diplomatic relations with 'Israel' in response to the ongoing military assault on Gaza, denouncing the Israeli government as fascist and genocidal. In a televised announcement on Friday, Vice President Rosario Murillo, who also serves as First Lady, confirmed that leftist President Daniel Ortega ordered the move in protest against 'Israel's' actions in the Palestinian territories. 'Our president has instructed the republic's Foreign Ministry to comply with the request of the national parliament and begin to sever diplomatic ties with the Nazi and genocidal government of Israel,' Murillo said on state television. The decision came after the National Assembly convened a regular session on Friday, during which lawmakers condemned the Israeli government's military offensive and urged the Nicaraguan government to formally cut ties with the 'occupation regime.' This marks the third time Nicaragua has severed relations with 'Israel,' with previous instances occurring in 2010 and 1982 under different administrations. Nicaragua has also called out the governments of the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, and Canada for their alleged accountability under international law regarding the Israeli aggression against Palestinians, most notably in Gaza. The Central American country had even filed a case against Germany before the International Court of Justice, requesting that the court impose urgent measures to prevent Berlin from supplying weapons and other forms of support to 'Israel.' However, the ICJ said that 'the circumstances were not such' to accuse Germany of violating a genocide convention. The move by Nicaragua comes as the Israeli occupation military continues its offensive across the Gaza Strip, killing more than 42,000 Palestinians and targeting and destroying civilian infrastructure since the war began on October 7, 2023.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2229218	2024-10-12T02:42:51-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04081840017287261964.jpg

Hezbollah Military Command Warns Israeli Settlers to Keep Away fr...	The Operations Chamber of the Islamic Resistance issued on Friday a statement which highlighted the Israeli failure to achieve any progress in the ground offensive it has launched against Lebanon, warning the Israeli to stay away from the army bases in order to keep safe. 'In light of the resounding failure and heroic resistance that the Israeli enemy army has been facing in its attempts to advance towards the eastern sector of the southern villages bordering occupied Palestine, it tried in the past two days to create new axes of advance in the western sector from the direction of the Ras al-Naqoura and Jal al-Alam sites towards Al-Mushayrifah and Al-Labouneh, trying to take advantage of the terrain that it believes will help it. Before attempting to advance on the new axes, the Israeli Air Force launched dozens of raids in conjunction with violent artillery shelling from the land and sea on the towns of Al-Dhahirah, Alma Al-Shaab and Al-Naqoura.' The statement detailed how the Resistance fighters four Israeli attempts to advance: - On Tuesday at dawn, an Israeli military force tried to advance from Ras Al-Naqoura towards the border area of Al-Labouneh with the aim of reaching the UNIFIL forces site in Al-Labouneh and positioning themselves there, but the Islamic Resistance fighters confronted them with appropriate weapons and forced them to retreat. - On Wednesday, the Israeli enemy's army attempted thrice to advance towards Labouneh, but the Mujahideen confronted it in each attempt with rocket weapons, artillery shells and guided missiles, forcing it to retreat and inflicting heavy losses upon its soldiers. - On Wednesday, the Resistance fighters monitored an infiltration attempt by an Israeli enemy force from Ras Al-Naqoura towards the Al-Mushairfeh area, so they targeted it with an assault glider that exploded among the infiltrating force, killing and wounding most of its members. - On Thursday, a group of Israeli enemy soldiers, accompanied and protected by a Merkava tank, attempted to advance towards the Labouneh area from Ras al-Naqoura, and as soon as the tank was within range of fire, the Resistance fighters targeted it with a guided missile that hit it directly, resulting in its destruction, incineration, the killing of its crew and the injury of the soldiers taking cover behind it. The enemy failed in four attempts, over a period of hours, to advance to withdraw the casualties, as the Mujahideen confronted it each time with appropriate weapons and forced it to withdraw, the statement affirmed. 'In conjunction with the heroic confrontations that the Islamic Resistance fighters are engaging in with the officers and soldiers of the Israeli enemy, the fire support groups continue to target the gatherings, positions and support lines of the Israeli enemy army in the military sites and barracks along the frontline and inside the border settlements in the occupied territories and achieve confirmed hits.' The missile force and air force of the Islamic Resistance also continue to target military bases and settlements deep in the north of occupied Palestine, in a way that is gradually increasing day after day, according to the statement. Yhe statement underlined all the above-mentioned military operations of the Islamic Resistance were carried out with high, complete and instant coordination between the leadership of the Islamic Resistance and the operations chamber, reaching the brothers stationed on the front lines of confrontation. 'It is worth noting that the Israeli enemy army, days after announcing the start of what it called the ground maneuver in southern Lebanon, does not dare to show its tanks and military vehicles to the Lebanese side for fear of being targeted, rather it hides them in places where they are, nevertheless, targeted with missiles and artillery shells and suffer heavy losses.' The statement added that the Israeli enemy has failed, until the time of preparing this statement, to control any of the overlooking hills it is trying to advance to, and is content with reaching some houses on the outskirts of some border villages with the aim of taking pictures and organizing media visits. 'The Israeli enemy army uses the homes of settlers in some settlements in north of occupied Palestine as gathering positions for its officers and soldiers, and its military bases that manage the aggression against Lebanon are also located inside settlement neighborhoods in major occupied cities such as Haifa, Tiberias, Acre, and others.' These homes and military bases are targets for the missile and air force of the Islamic Resistance, and accordingly we warn the settlers against being present near those military gatherings in order to preserve their lives until further notice. The Islamic Resistance is committed to its covenant and promise to its supreme and most holy martyr, His Eminence the Secretary-General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah (may his holy secret be sanctified), that the settlements in northern occupied Palestine will remain free of settlers until the war on Gaza and Lebanon stops. Sirens across the north of occupied Palestine were continuously heard on Friday. Hezbollah attacks on the Zionist military sites, settlements and cities did not stop throughout the day. Border confrontations also manifested the Resistance power in face of the monstrous enemy.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2228932	2024-10-11T14:53:22-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-027725400166239486010.jpg

Hezbollah: This is Not Karbala, It is Battle of Removing Gate of ...	Hezbollah Media Relations Official warned on Friday that the Lebanese media space is open to the toxic Israeli air without restrictions and amid absence of law enforcement. Hajj Mohammad Afif hailed the steadfast Lebanese journalists in the South, especially those who convey the reality of the field situation to the people and the world. He also praised a number of free Arab and foreign journalists who share the pain and hope, and story of resistance and steadfastness. Afif indicated that some Lebanese media outlets adopt the Israeli narrative without any scrutiny and incite against the Resistance and its supporters without any governmental measures. Hezbollah official regretted the fact that some Lebanese media outlets convey the Zionist story about any bombardment in Lebanon and display the enemy leaders threat in the context of the hostile propaganda targeting the Resistance and its incubation. Neither the ministry of information nor the competent authorities move against those outlets under the pretext of 'media freedom', he wondered. Afif asked: ' How can freedom of media be free of law enforcement? In it logical that those who are falsely called 'activists' post names of villages and towns and claim that Resistance commanders and munitions are present there? Does freedom of media cover inciting against hospitals in order to provoke a new Zionist massacre just as that which targeted Baptist Hospital in Gaza?' Hezbollah official warned that the Israeli enemy used timed missiles which explode after the raid in order to delude the public opinion that that attack targeted a weaponry cache and prevent the medics from evacuating the injured, stressing that this flimsy pretext can no longer be accepted. Afif affirmed that the US embassy in Lebanon is complicit and involved in the Israeli crimes against the civilians and the medics, asking about the UN and international community attitude towards the Israeli aggression on UNIFIL troops in South Lebanon. This aggression underlines the Zionist entity disregards the UN Resolutions, Afif affirmed, recalling the Zionist massacre against the civilians who resorted to the UNIFIL site in Qana in 1996. Hezbollah official stressed that the Israeli enemy has seen only a little bit of the Resistance military power, adding that the Resistance fire at Haifa, Safed and Acre is just the beginning. Afif underscored the flexibility of the Resistance military operations which are not geographically restricted, explaining that any slight Israeli field progress must not affect the morale of the Lebanese people. Hezbollah official warned some Lebanese parties against the political exploitation of the military battle, adding that it is still too early, and it is not 1982, the year the Israeli tanks reached Beirut. Afif hailed the sacrifices made by the resistance supporters who were displaced from their homes, reiterating that reconstruction is inevitable. Finally, Hezbollah official emphasized that this battle is not that of Karbala; it is the battle of removing the Gate of Khaybar.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2228701	2024-10-11T11:13:10-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-09127630017286708504.jpeg

The blockade has been characterized as an act of 'genocide and mass punishment' against the camp's residents, who have refused to evacuate despite the intense shelling. Alongside the artillery attacks, the occupation forces have also been demolishing residential buildings to the west of the camp. Red Crescent paramedics have transported several wounded individuals to the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabalia following airstrikes that targeted a house near the al-Ihsan Mosque.

Inadequate and Misleading Evacuation Warnings by ‘Israel’, Says A...	Evacuation warnings issued by the Israeli military to residents of southern Beirut and south Lebanon were inadequate and, , misleading, according to Amnesty International. The human rights organization said these warnings do not absolve ‘Israel’ of its obligations under international law to avoid targeting civilians and take all possible measures to minimize harm. Amnesty's Secretary General Agnès Callamard stated that the warnings to residents of the densely populated Dahieh suburb of Beirut were insufficient. The warnings, issued via social media less than 30 minutes before strikes, included misleading maps and failed to provide clear timelines or safe evacuation routes. AMNESTY INVESTIGATES: Evacuation warnings issued by the Israeli military to residents of the southern suburbs of Beirut and south Lebanon were inadequate, and in some cases also misleading. Read more: — Amnesty International (@amnesty) October 10, 2024 Similarly, the blanket warnings for entire towns and villages in southern Lebanon raised concerns that they were intended to trigger mass displacement rather than protect civilians. Callamard emphasized that people who choose to stay or are unable to leave must still be protected under international humanitarian law. Amnesty's analysis of over a dozen evacuation warnings found that the designated 'danger zones' on the maps were much smaller than the 500-meter radius advised by the Israeli occupation military. Residents reported chaotic evacuations, with some unable to leave due to mobility issues of elderly or disabled family members. The human rights group stressed that effective warnings must provide timely, clear instructions to allow civilians to safely move away from targeted military objectives. Broad orders to evacuate entire areas do not meet this standard under international law. It also noted that 'the heavy loss of life in Lebanon in recent days raises concerns that Israeli occupation forces are violating their obligation to take all feasible precautions to minimize harm to civilians wherever they may be, including by issuing effective warnings.' After spending the past 12 months investigating war crimes committed by 'Israel' in the Gaza Strip, Amnesty International 'is deeply concerned that Israel may seek to repeat the approach it took in Gaza, which resulted in unprecedented harm to civilians.' This comes as the Israeli occupation has been waging a large-scale aggression on Lebanon for 18 consecutive days, attacking cities and residential suburbs in Beirut, the south, the Bekaa and the mountains, committing bloody massacres, most of the time without any warnings or warnings. What Amnesty International has said confirms that the warnings issued by the occupation 'army' are nothing but misleading warnings, as the occupation, which is based on brutality and destruction, does not care about the warnings and does not adhere to the scope it has set, but rather publishes the warnings as part of a media campaign to justify its crimes.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2227854	2024-10-11T01:56:17-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-03829790017282136541.jpg

Hezbollah: Islamic Resistance Fire at ‘Israel’ Won’t Be Limited t...	The Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance issued a key statement late Tuesday to warn the Zionist enemy that the Resistance leadership's command and control system has returned stronger and more resilient than ever. The Islamic Resistance confirmed the remarks made by Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General, Sheikh Naim Qassem, regarding the readiness of the rocket force to target any location in occupied Palestine as determined by the Resistance leadership through a command and control system that has returned stronger and more resilient than ever. 'The continued aggression of the 'Israeli' enemy against our honorable people in all parts of steadfast Lebanon will make Haifa and elsewhere, for the rockets of the Resistance, akin to Kiryat Shmona, Metula, and other border settlements with Lebanon.' Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem stressed on Tuesday that the Lebanese resistance group’s chain of command is fine and that its military capabilities are solid, as he vowed that the resistance will emerge victorious against the Israeli enemy. Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem in a televised speech via Al-Manar (October 8, 2024). This was evidenced by what the enemy and its settlers witnessed in Haifa and its surroundings today, Tuesday, the statement added. 'The Islamic Resistance sees and hears where this enemy least expects it, and its hand is capable of reaching wherever it desires in occupied Palestine. Its fire directed at the Zionist depth will not be limited to rockets or suicide drones.' Our valiant fighters continue to confront every attempt by the elite Zionist soldiers to advance and occupy some southern villages at the front line with occupied Palestine, in a heroic battle unprecedented in this enemy's wars, the statement confirmed. 'They have even resorted to hiding behind UNIFIL positions and in paths not visible to the Lebanese side, and thus far, they have failed to penetrate our steadfast villages, suffering heavy losses exceeding 35 killed and 200 injured among their elite officers and soldiers.' 'We reiterate what we stated in the early days of this heroic battle: what this enemy witnesses from our fighters is just a glimpse of the firm strength awaiting it wherever it treads in southern Lebanon.' The statement also addressed the resistance supporters with sincere words, underlining the role in emerging victorious from this battle. 'To our honorable people, you are in the hearts of every fighter among us. You are our stronghold that humiliates this enemy, you are the cries of Takbeer in the field, and you are the prayer for victory that we draw closer to Allah with. O our people, you are the secret of our resilience and dignity, and all victories. We know that you are people of patience, sacrifice, and loyalty. From you, we draw all our determination and strength, and with your prayers, we rally our spirits and fight with pride.' Beloved Gaza was further addressed by the Islamic Resistance command which reiterated commitment to the support of the steadfast Palestinian people in Gaza and their valiant and honorable resistance. 'This is the legacy of the Master of Martyrs all the way to Al-Quds (may he be sanctified), and it is a trust upon our shoulders. We are worthy of this trust, with God's permission, until our last breath.'

Sheikh Qassem: Hezbollah’s Military Capabilities Solid, Will Emer...	Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem stressed on Tuesday that the Lebanese resistance group’s chain of command is fine and that its military capabilities are solid, as he vowed that the resistance will emerge victorious against the Israeli enemy. In a televised speech via Al-Manar on the first anniversary of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, Sheikh Qassem affirmed that Hezbollah is not frightened by the alliance of the Israeli enemy with the United States and some European countries. He addressed Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu who vowed to bring the Zionist settlers back to northern occupied Palestine by saying: 'Many more (settlers) will be displaced.' Sheikh Qassem lashed out at the US for being key partner in the war which is aimed at eliminating the Axis of Resistance and exterminating the Palestinian people. He said that the Operation Al-Aqsa Flood is an exceptional event and the beginning of change in the Middle East. The Hezbollah deputy chief hailed the resistance in Gaza as 'legendary and capable of withstanding more and more'. 'We Are Not Scared' Sheikh Qassem said that the alliance of the Israeli enemy along with the US and some European countries doesn’t frighten the Lebanese resistance. He said that the Zionist entity and the Western countries have been trying to 'put fear' into the Lebanese resistance group after the assassination of Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, 'but it’s not working.' 'We are the sons of Axis of Resistance’s Master of Martyrs Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah,' the Hezbollah deputy chief said, as he praised the martyred S.G. for putting 'fear in the hearts of the Zionists and fighting the criminals of the occupation'. He hailed Operation Al-Aqsa Flood as 'an extraordinary and exceptional event which represents the beginning of change in the Middle East… and the first step for change' towards freedom for the Palestinians.' Sheikh Qassem noted that the Israeli enemy’s goal 'was to completely eliminate the Axis of Resistance and exterminate the Palestinian people,' stressing that the Israeli crimes against Palestinian women, children and elderly are unparalleled in the history. In this regard, he hailed the Palestinian resistance in Gaza as legendary, noting that and 'it’s capable of withstanding more and more.' Sheikh Qassem stressed that the US is a key partner in this aggression, as well as some European countries. He said Lebanon has been under aggression, noting that Netanyahu has repeatedly declared that he wants a 'new Middle East.' Resistance’s Determination Firm Sheikh Qassem said that the Lebanese front 'has exhausted the enemy throughout 11 months and has displaced tens of thousands of Israeli settlers.' 'This war has never and will never affect our determination to confront the Israeli aggression.' He stressed that Hezbollah fighters in the battlefield are solid, and that the command is coherent. Hezbollah fighters carrying out pro-Gaza operations in south Lebanon (April 2024 / image released by Hezbollah Military Media). 'Netanyahu says that the settlers will return to the north and we tell him that many more will be displaced.' Sheikh Qassem warned the Israeli enemy that 'the longer the war continues; the more difficult impasse Israel will face.' 'We are striking the enemy and expanding the range of fire, we will reach any place at the time we decide according to our plan. We are steadfast and we will emerge victorious.' Meanwhile, Sheikh Qassem praised Lebanese Speaker Nabih Berri, stressing that Hezbollah and Amal Movement are 'one heart in good times and bad.' 'We fully trust our 'big brother' Speaker Nabih Berri,' his eminence said. He stressed: 'We are the people of the battlefield and we will never beg for a solution.' 'This war is a war of who screams first and we will not scream, we will continue and we will offer sacrifices, you will hear the enemy screaming, God willing.' Hezbollah Chain of Command Fine On the other hand, Sheikh Qassem reassured that the resistance’s chain of command is fine, noting that there is no vacant position in Hezbollah. 'I tell you that the chain of command is operating strictly regular and we have overcome the painful blows that have been inflicted on us.' 'We don’t have a vacant position, all positions are filled and Hezbollah is working with full readiness and regularity,' he added. He affirmed, meanwhile, that the resistance group 'will elect a new secretary-general and will announce it once it has been done.' 'Everything that the martyred leaders had, their assistants and replacements have copies of,' his eminence reassured. Solid Military Capabilities Sheikh Qassem affirmed that Hezbollah’s ability to resist Israel’s military is intact. 'Our military capabilities are fine. What our enemies say about our fighting capabilities is an illusion. They are lying.' 'Our fighters on the front line are solid. The Israeli plan is to kill Lebanese civilians and empty villages to cause chaos. But I tell them, your efforts are a failure.' He noted that the Israeli ground incursion in southern Lebanon began a week ago, stressing that the Israeli army has yet to advance. The Hezbollah deputy chief stressed that the resistance fighters are fully ready to engage in face-to-face battles with the Israeli enemy forces. 'We will neither abandon our positions, nor hand over our weapons,' stated Sheikh Qassem. Sheikh Qassem's speech is the second since martyrdom of S.G. Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah in a flagrant Israeli strike on Beirut's southern suburb, Dagiyeh, on September 27. On September 30, Sheikh Qassem said that Hezbollah was using the minimum of its capabilities, voicing full readiness for all scenarios.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2224389	2024-10-08T04:44:31-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-01467880017283873124.jpg

In continuation of the support of the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and resistance against the Israeli oppression, and to mark the first anniversary of October 7, the anniversary of the launch of Al-Aqsa Flood Battle, the Yemeni Armed Forces, carried out two military operations within the fifth round of escalation. In a statement, the spokesman of the Yemeni Armed Forces, General Yahya Sarea said that the first targeted two military targets of the Israeli enemy in the occupied Yaffa area with two missiles, the first of which was the Palestine 2 type, which succeeded in reaching its target, and the second was with Dhu al-Fiqar missile. The operation has achieved its objectives successfully, General Sarea noted. Earlier today, the UAV force of the Yemeni Armed Forces launched a number of drones on several targets in Yaffa area, and on Umm al-Rashrash area southern occupied Palestine with 'Yaffa' and 'Samad 4' drones, he added. 'A number of these drones have successfully reached their targets, thanks be to Allah.' 'On this occasion, the Yemeni Armed Forces salute the heroes of the Palestinian resistance with all its factions in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, as well as the brothers of the Mujahideen in the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon, and confirm their continuation in carrying out more military operations against the Israeli enemy, as well as the continuing to impose the naval blockade until the aggression stops and the siege on the Gaza Strip is lifted and until the aggression on Lebanon stops as well.' بيان القوات المسلحة اليمنية بشأن تنفيذ عمليتين عسكريتين الأولى استهدفت منطقة 'يافا' في فلسطين المحتلة بصاروخين باليستيين، والأخرى استهدفت منطقتي 'يافا وأم الرشراش' المحتلتين بعدة طائرات مسيرة نوع 'يافا' و 'صماد4' pic.twitter.com/rcHfK7p3cr — العميد يحيى سريع (@army21ye) October 7, 2024 Leader of Yemen’s Ansarullah movement Sayyed Abdul-Malik Badredine al-Houthi stated that the Operation Al-Aqsa Flood has reignited the culture of jihad in the name of Allah across the Muslim world.

Hezbollah Military Officer: Israeli Occupation Forces Taking UNIF...	A Hezbollah military officer told Al-Mayadeen TV that the Islamic Resistance fighters reported on Sunday monitoring an unusual movement for the Israeli occupation forces behind behind a UNIFIL military site in the outskirts of the border town of Maroun Al-Ras in southern Lebanon. The Islamic Resistance operations chamber asked the fighters to be patient and to avoid attacking the movement in order to preserve the lives of the international forces' soldiers. The Israeli enemy is trying to use the international UNIFIL forces as human shields to cover up its failure to advance towards the village, especially after its repeated failed attempts on more than one axis to advance towards Maroun Al-Ras and the loss of dozens of its soldiers as dead or wounded. Hezbollah’s Islamic Resistance intensified its military operations on the first anniversary of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, targeting Israeli sites along the Lebanese border with occupied Palestine, as well as military bases and settlements deeper within. This action stands as unwavering support for resilient Palestinians in Gaza and their resistance, simultaneously safeguarding Lebanon and its citizens.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2223212	2024-10-07T10:39:00-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/12/manar-07546110016711058981.jpg

Hezbollah Commemorates October 7: Era of Defeats Is Over; Divine ...	Hezbollah asserted that its decision to open a support front on October 8 in solidarity with the Palestinians and their resistance is rooted in truth, justice, and humanity. This choice reflects Hezbollah's commitment to defending Lebanon and its citizens while emphasizing its ability to repel aggression and declaring that the era of defeats is over and victory has arrived. In a statement commemorating the anniversary of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, Hezbollah noted that 'today marks one full year since the heroic Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, which exemplified the will of the Palestinian resistance in confronting Israeli aggression, injustice, and occupation that has afflicted Palestinians since 1948, along with the wars, tragedies, and destruction that followed. 'This operation will have historical repercussions and strategic outcomes on the overall situation in the region until justice is achieved through the elimination of Zionist occupation, allowing Palestinians to reclaim their legitimate rights to their land, from the river to the sea,' the group's statement added. Hezbollah harnessed this occasion to emphasize the 'full right of the Palestinian people to resist occupation by all means necessary to reclaim their legitimate rights and eliminate the occupation.' 'Despite the Israeli brutality, which has led to the martyrdom of tens of thousands of Palestinians and the unprecedented destruction of the Gaza Strip, this unjust and oppressive entity has proven to be weak, unable to survive without US support,' the group affirmed. Hezbollah also highlighted that 'there is no place for this temporary entity in the region or within our social, cultural, and humanitarian fabric; it has always been and will remain a malignant, aggressive tumor that must be removed, no matter how long it takes.' Regarding those who support the Zionist entity worldwide, Hezbollah stressed, 'The United States, along with its allies and agents both globally and in the region, are partners in this occupation, complicit in its aggression and crimes against the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and the peoples of the region. These countries bear full responsibility for the killings, atrocities, injustices, and devastating humanitarian tragedies.' The Islamic Resistance in Lebanon addressed the Palestinian people and their valiant resistance, praising their steadfastness after a year of patience and endurance, marked by tragedy, and affirming that they are 'worthy of victory.' Hezbollah hailed the courageous support fronts, declaring: 'We commend the strength and valor of our fellow fighters in the beloved arenas of Yemen and great Iraq. Furthermore, we recognize the historic decision by the Islamic Republic of Iran to execute a significant missile strike deep within enemy territory. This action will have profound implications and significant outcomes for the nature of this ongoing confrontation with the Zionist enemy. The group emphasized its determination to proceed with its decision to open a support front on October 8 in solidarity with the Palestinian people and their honorable resistance, noting that this choice aligns with truth, justice, and complete humanity. 'This decision also underscores our commitment to defending Lebanon and its people, for which our resistance and populace have paid a heavy price in leadership, military, and material losses, along with the forced displacement of hundreds of thousands of civilians and extensive property destruction. Meanwhile, the enemy persists in its relentless crimes and aggression,' the statement added. Hezbollah wrapped up its statement, reaffirming its confidence in the resistance's ability to repel the aggression and the resilience of its people until this crisis is resolved. 'We see ease following hardship and relief after distress; the era of defeats has passed, and divine victory has arrived,' the group stated.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2222794	2024-10-07T03:24:35-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-04165050017056142612.png
Video | Hezbollah Strikes Haifa, Tiberias in Occupied Palestine	In a resolute defense of Lebanese sovereignty and in retaliation against Israel's continued aggression on both Lebanon and Palestine, Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance launched a missile strike targeting the occupied city of Haifa, deep within northern occupied Palestine. The Islamic Resistance declared that this strike is part of the ongoing 'Khaybar' operations and a direct response to the Zionist enemy's targeting of civilians and the massacres it has committed. Following the rallying cry, 'We are at your service, O' Nasrallah,' Hezbollah fighters unleashed a salvo of Fadi-1 missiles at the Carmel base, located south of Haifa, at precisely 11:20 p.m. on Sunday. Israeli media reported that Rambam Hospital in Haifa received six casualties following the missile strikes on the city. Hebrew Channel 12 announced that schools in parts of the occupied city of Haifa have shifted to remote learning in the wake of Hezbollah's missile strikes on the city. At midnight on Monday, the Islamic Resistance launched a missile barrage targeting the Nimra base, one of the main military bases in the northern region, located west of Tiberias. Israeli media reported that the total number of casualties from the missile strikes launched from Lebanon on Haifa and Tiberias has reached 10, including one in critical condition and several with moderate injuries.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2222739	2024-10-07T02:14:40-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-074245200172829232510.jpg
Iran Cancels Flights Amid Preparations for ‘Strong Response’ Oper...	Iran has reportedly canceled several flights as part of preparations for a major military operation targeting 35 strategic sites in Israeli-occupied Palestine, according to an account linked to Iran's Supreme National Security Council on the social media platform X. The Nournews agency, also on X, stated late Sunday that flight cancellations, which began at 9:00 PM local time and are expected to last until 6:00 AM (0230 GMT) on Monday, are likely tied to preparations for the 'Strong Response' operation. به نظر می رسد توقف پروازها در فرودگاه‌های #ایران تا بامداد دوشنبه، بیش از آن که اقدامی احتیاطی در برابر احتمال شرارت رژیم #اسرائیل باشد، فراهم کردن زمینه های لازم برای اجرای طرح #پاسخ_سخت و در صورت لزوم‌هدف قرار دادن ۳۵ نقطه راهبردی در عمق سرزمین های اشغالی است — نور نیوز (@nournews_ir) October 6, 2024 The cancellations, the report suggests, are not due to concerns over an imminent Israeli attack, as some had speculated. The developments come amid rising tensions following recent ballistic missile strikes by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) on key Israeli targets in Tel Aviv and other areas. The missile attacks, aimed at Israeli military and security installations, were described by Iranian authorities as retaliation for Israel's involvement in regional conflicts and alleged sabotage operations inside Iran. Amid rumors of possible Israeli retaliation, particularly targeting Iran’s energy and economic infrastructure, Iranian officials have warned that any escalation by the Israeli enemy would be met with a 'swift and decisive' response. Earlier on Sunday, an informed source within Iran's armed forces told Tasnim news agency, which is close to the IRGC, that the country had developed a 'Strong Response Plan' to counter any Israeli retaliation. The source added that specific measures had been prepared, and authorities were ready to execute them depending on Israel's actions.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2222497	2024-10-06T14:08:46-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-05110800017280760165.png
Al-Hayya: What We Rejected Yesterday, We Will Not Accept Today – ...	Khalil Al-Hayya, a senior member of Hamas' Political Bureau, reiterated today, Sunday, that the Palestinian resistance remains resolute in its mission to liberate the land and people, declaring that what was rejected in the past will not be accepted today. Marking the first anniversary of the Al-Aqsa Flood operation, Al-Hayya reflected on the ongoing Palestinian struggle, noting that 'a year later, our people continue to write a new chapter of history with their resistance, blood, and steadfastness.' He emphasized that any gains Israel could not achieve through force will not be granted through negotiations. He stressed that the operation shattered the ZIonist entity's perceived military superiority, as fighters from the Al-Qassam Brigades and other factions carried out heroic acts that have changed the balance of power. Al-Hayya further pointed to the increasing resistance in the West Bank, where Palestinians are pushing back against Israeli settlement expansion and Judaization efforts. He highlighted the recent Jaffa operation as one of the latest examples of this ongoing resistance. 'Our objective is clear,' Al-Hayya said. 'We seek the complete liberation of our land and holy sites, the establishment of a sovereign, independent Palestinian state, and the return of refugees to their homeland.' Lebanese Resistance Al-Hayya praised the unwavering support of the Lebanese Islamic Resistance, which has been involved in the struggle since day one. He acknowledged the sacrifices made by the Lebanese, including thousands of martyrs and wounded, noting that Israel's aggression has turned Lebanon into a key front in the conflict. 'We are united in this battle,' he said, addressing the Lebanese people and their resistance fighters. 'Blood is blood, and destruction is destruction. The blood of our leaders, including Ismail Haniyeh and Hasan Nasrallah, has forged a new dawn for our nation with Al-Aqsa at its heart and Al-Quds as its destination.' Hamad Chief Ismail Haniyeh (L) in a meeting with Hezbollah S.G. Sayyed Nasrallah (photo relased by Hezbollah's Media Relations - Tuesday, June 29, 2021). Global Support and Shifting Battlefronts Al-Hayya extended his gratitude to Yemen’s Ansarullah for their steadfast support, both in terms of military action and the millions who have shown solidarity with the Palestinian cause. He noted that the missile and drone strikes launched by Yemen's resistance forces have significantly shifted the battle's dynamics, striking deep into the heart of Israeli territory. He also commended the Islamic Republic of Iran for its support, pointing to recent missile strikes in retaliation for Israel’s targeted killings of Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil. Al-Hayya described Iran’s actions as reshaping the battlefield, likening their missiles to 'meteors filling the skies over occupied Palestine.' Iraq’s contribution to the resistance was also acknowledged, with Al-Hayya highlighting drone and missile strikes from Iraq as a testament to the country's commitment to Palestine. He stressed that Iraq, both in its present and historical role, is deeply embedded in the Palestinian cause. A Call to Action and a Warning to the International Community Al-Hayya called on the Arab and Islamic nations to translate their solidarity into concrete action, saying, 'We appreciate your noble feelings towards our people, but now is the time for roaring resistance from east to west.' In a message to the international community, Al-Hayya urged an end to silence, warning that continued inaction would only allow further Israeli aggression. 'Enough with the silence,' he stated, 'as it only perpetuates the aggression against our people and the Lebanese. Israel is the epicenter of evil and destruction in the region, and the source of its instability.' He concluded by expressing confidence in the future of the Palestinian struggle, stating that past efforts have laid a strong foundation on which Palestinians can build their future. 'What we have previously achieved serves as an important foundation for what comes next,' Al-Hayya affirmed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2222387	2024-10-06T13:21:08-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2017/11/manar-01366360015117824491.jpg
Yemen’s Al-Houthi: Al-Aqsa Flood Revived the Culture of Jihad	Leader of Yemen's Ansarullah movement Sayyed Abdul-Malik Badredine al-Houthi stated that the Operation Al-Aqsa Flood has reignited the culture of jihad in the name of Allah across the Muslim world. Emphasizing that this event has shifted the nature of conflict with the Israeli occupation from rapid, short-term wars to prolonged wars of attrition, Sayyed Houthi said Sunday that this war weakened Israel's capabilities and its supporters. 'The Zionist enemy's ambitions extend far beyond Palestine, its objective is to dominate the entire region, including neighboring Arab countries,' Al-Houthi cautioned. These goals, he explained, are not merely historical aspirations but are active projects being pursued on the ground with significant resources. He pointed to Israel's aggressive wars and occupations as evidence of these expansionist efforts. The Ansarullah leader referenced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s explicit declaration of reshaping the Middle East to serve Israel's interests, noting that Netanyahu aims to shift the balance of power in the region. Al-Houthi elaborated that this involves neutralizing Palestinian resistance, dismantling the Palestinian statehood project, controlling Arab governments, and co-opting their military forces to serve Israeli goals. An Israeli female soldier appears in distress during a military exercise (photo from archive). According to al-Houthi, Netanyahu seeks to ensure the Zionist entity’s survival as the dominant military power in the Middle East, redrawing borders and asserting regional hegemony. He added that the Zionist entity plans to exploit internal divisions within the Arab world, weakening its peoples and redefining the rules of engagement to allow ‘Israel’ to strike any Arab or Islamic nation without resorting to full-scale war. Al-Houthi also pointed out Netanyahu’s efforts to reshape international alliances, strengthening ties with global powers and expanding relations with emerging nations like China and India. This would provide Israel with greater strategic influence on the global stage, enabling it to further its control over the region. In conclusion, al-Houthi warned that 'Israel's' ultimate goal is to become the dominant force in the Middle East with global influence. He called on the Arab and Islamic nations to unite and confront these ambitions before they come to fruition.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2222090	2024-10-06T11:36:09-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-00979760017282396438.jpg

Israeli Aggression Intensifies on Day 13: Heaviest Night of Bomba...	The Israeli enemy pressed forward with its aggression across Lebanon, launching airstrikes early Sunday morning that have been described as the most intense since the onset of aerial aggression on Beirut's southern suburbs over a week ago. Last night's Israeli airstrikes targeted the old airport road, which connects the city center to Beirut International Airport. The strikes resulted in damage to a hotel, residential apartments, commercial establishments, medical clinics, a car wash, and medical and food warehouses. Piles of debris blocked one lane of the airport road, prompting young volunteers to step in and manage traffic, redirecting vehicles toward safer routes. Small explosions were audible throughout the morning, with paramedics indicating that these sounds resulted from burning fuel tanks reacting with materials inside the buildings. Paramedics Hindered Volunteers searching for survivors reported that 'Israeli aircraft are dropping explosives around the targeted buildings in Beirut's southern suburb (Dahiyeh) to hinder the work of civil defense teams.' Military experts believe that the aircraft are deploying missiles loaded with a type of cluster bomb that continues to explode for several hours after the airstrikes end. Israeli drones continuously fly over the southern suburbs, employing armed drones equipped with precision-guided missiles to disrupt search and rescue operations, particularly in the Mreijeh area. Video Captures the Aftermath of Israeli Airstrikes on Dahiyeh The Zionist entity continues its war on Lebanon with American approval, European support, and global silence, claiming it aims to reshape the Middle East.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2221518	2024-10-06T04:06:16-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04165500017282126864.jpg
Hezbollah Deals Heavy Blows to Israeli Forces at Lebanon Border: ...	Hezbollah issued a statement on Saturday quoting a field officer from the Islamic Resistance Operations Room, who provided details of a series of heroic confrontations against Israeli occupation attempts to infiltrate Lebanese territory. The officer stated that, 'At approximately 10:20 PM on Friday, Islamic Resistance fighters in the Adaisseh axis detected unusual movements by Israeli forces near Border Marker 405, in the outskirts of Adaisseh. Our fighters immediately made the necessary arrangements. Then, at around 10:45 PM, an elite enemy force advanced toward the Adaisseh Municipality building. By 11:00 PM, the infiltrating force reached a pre-prepared ambush, and with the call 'We are at your service, O' Nasrallah,' our fighters opened fire with light and medium machine guns.' The officer declared that this defensive effort exploded the enemy's mines, which they intended to use to rig the municipality building. 'Approximately 15 soldiers were either killed or wounded, as their cries were clearly heard. Israeli occupation rescue teams, supported by helicopter fire, evacuated their casualties back to the occupied territories,' the Hezbollah officer concluded. Speaking of the Zionist attempts early on Saturday, the officer stated that, 'At approximately 1:50 AM on Saturday, another enemy force attempted to infiltrate through a different route towards the Adaisseh Municipality building. Islamic Resistance fighters confronted them with machine guns and rocket fire. The clashes lasted for more than two hours, during which the enemy suffered casualties among its soldiers and was forced to withdraw.' 'At 7:00 AM on Saturday, an Israeli occupation Merkava tank attempted to advance through a concealed route on the Lebanese side toward Al-Bat hill in the outskirts of Maroun Al-Ras. Islamic Resistance fighters precisely targeted the tank with a guided missile, resulting in its destruction and the killing or wounding of its crew,' the officer emphasized. The officer confirmed that Hezbollah's fire support groups continue to target Israeli occupation forces stationed in military barracks, sites, and settlements along the Lebanese border using artillery shells, rockets, and heavy machine gun fire, achieving direct hits. He emphasized that the group's missile force has consistently and is still striking various targets deep within northern occupied Palestine with intense rocket barrages. Additionally, he highlighted that the Islamic Resistance's air force continues to target Israeli occupation military bases and barracks in northern occupied Palestine with swarms of precision-guided drones. The Hezbollah field officer concluded by stating that the Islamic Resistance has documented the deaths of over 25 officers and soldiers from the elite units of the Israeli occupation forces in recent days, following the announcement of their ground operation into southern Lebanese villages. He further asserted that more than 130 troops have been wounded. 'While the enemy has acknowledged some of these casualties, the coming days are likely to reveal even more of what they have concealed from the public,' the Hezbollah field officer concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2221397	2024-10-06T03:23:26-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/06/manar-05562050017189021859.jpg

Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance fighters in an image published by the group's Military Media. 'In order to obtain these photos, which embattled (Israeli PM Benjamin) Netanyahu desperately needs, the price was more than 20 Israeli casualties among the elite soldiers,' he said, noting that the Israeli military censor barred the incident from publication in a bid to cover the Israeli losses. The Hezbollah officer said that the Israeli forces tried afternoon on Friday to advance towards the Lebanese territories through the axes of Maroun Al-Ras and Yaroun, adding that the enemy troops were ambushed by explosive devices that were previously planted.

Iranian Missiles Overwhelmed Israeli Defenses: WSJ	Iran’s barrage of ballistic missiles this week appears to have overwhelmed Israel’s air defenses in some places, The Wall Street Journal quoted independent researchers who examined emerging satellite imagery as saying. The assessment means that any new Iranian strikes against Israel, if launched, could have much more serious consequences if they target civilian infrastructure or heavily populated residential areas,the US paper reported . 'That is an important consideration as Israel contemplates its military response. Tehran has threatened strikes on Israeli power plants and oil refineries if Israel hits Iranian territory in a counterattack expected in the coming days.' 'Unlike April 13, when Iran fired a large number of slower cruise missiles and drones, Tuesday’s barrage was made up exclusively of some 180 much faster ballistic missiles, one of the largest such strikes in the history of warfare. Analysts say that most of these projectiles were Iran’s most modern ballistic missiles, the Fattah-1 and Kheibar Shekan.' 'The faster the missile, the harder it is to intercept it, that’s simple physics,' said Ulrich Kühn, head of research for arms control at the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy in Hamburg, Germany. 'It’s certainly much harder to defend against ballistic missiles, and even more so if there is a bulk of them coming in on a certain target, because then you have the ability to overwhelm the antimissile defenses—which is exactly what happened in Israel.' Satellite images of a target on Tuesday—the Nevatim air base in southern 'Israel', home to its F-35 jet fighters—show that as many as 32 Iranian missiles managed to land within the base’s perimeter, according to analysis by professor Jeffrey Lewis, at the Middlebury Institute for International Studies in Monterey, Calif. 'Thirty-two missiles is a lot of missiles,' Lewis said. 'We have exaggerated ideas about the effectiveness of air defenses. We have this pop-culture idea that missile defenses are much more effective or available than they actually are.' 'While Israel operates the sophisticated Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 missile-defense systems, co-produced with the U.S., the interceptors are limited in quantity and more expensive than the incoming Iranian missiles, Lewis said. It often takes multiple interceptors to try stopping one ballistic target.' It is more complicated to inflict damage on a sprawling and hardened air base in the middle of the desert than to strike infrastructure sites in heavily populated areas, WSJ noted. 'The Israelis would care more about defending Tel Aviv' than defending Nevatim, said Lewis. 'On the other hand, they would ultimately have the same problem there—Iranians could at the end of the day overwhelm the system.' The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps carried out a missile strike against the Israeli occupation entity on Tuesday evening. The IRGC said in a statement that it has targeted 'the heart of the occupied territories' in response to the martyrdom of Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh, Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, and IRGC general Abbas Nilforoushan at the hands of the Zionist regime.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2220088	2024-10-04T14:07:15-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-05110800017280760165.png

Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei stressed on Friday that the enemies will never achieve victory over Hezbollah and Hamas.

The ceremony saw participation from political, military, social, and community leaders, followed by Friday prayers led by Imam Khamenei. Imam Khamenei delivered two sermons, one in Persian language while the other in Arabic language, in a bid to address the entire Muslim nation, especially the Lebanese and Palestinian people. He warned that Tyrants aim to sow division and discord among Muslims as part of their arrogant policy, stressing that the Muslim nation has become aware today and can overcome these schemes against the enemies of Muslims. 'The policies adopted by our enemy is to sow the seeds of division and sedition, to drive a wedge among all the Muslims. They are the same enemies to the Palestinians, Lebanese, Egyptians, and the Iraqis. They are the enemy to the Yemeni and Syrian people,' the Leader told the large crowd. 'Our enemy is one,' his eminence affirmed, addressing thousands of worshipers carrying portraits of Sayyed Nasrallah and Ismail Haniyeh, former Hamas chief, who was assassinated by the Zionist enemy last July. On the Iranian missile attack which took place on Tuesday, the Leader stressed that what Tehran did is the minimal punishment for the Zionist entity in response to its horrific crimes. ⚡️🇮🇷Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei: The actions taken by our armed forces were the least punishment for the occupying Zionist regime in the face of the crimes, the unbelievable crimes committed by that regime, that bloodthirsty regime, that wolfish regime, that rabid… pic.twitter.com/dW3dQrmyIX — Suppressed News. (@SuppressedNws) October 4, 2024 Arabic Sermon Addressing the nation in Arabic, Imam Khamenei said: 'I chose to honor my dear brother, the pride of the Islamic world and eloquent voice of the region, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, during Friday prayers in Tehran.' 'We are all deeply saddened by the martyrdom of our dear Sayyed but consolation does not mean despair and confusion.' He affirmed, meanwhile, that 'Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah’s body has departed, but his spirit, principles, and resonant voice will remain with us forever.' 'The cowardly enemy, unable to deliver a decisive blow to the resistance’s cohesive structure, resorts to feigning victory through assassinations, killing civilians and breaking their hearts,' the Leader said. 🇮🇷| Ayatollah Khamenei switched to Arabic in a message meant for the Arabic audience: • Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah's body may have left us, but his character, path, and voice remain and will continue to exist. • The dear people of Lebanon and Palestine are the special audience.… pic.twitter.com/jHWNSoqxLD — Arya - آریا (@AryJeay) October 4, 2024 'Hezbollah is truly a good tree. Hezbollah and its martyred hero leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, are the essence of Lebanon’s virtues in its history and identity.' He assured that the Zionist entity 'is rootless and unstable, barely surviving with US support, but, God willing, it will not endure.' 'The resistance in the region will not back down, even as its fighters are martyred; it will emerge victorious,' Imam Khamenei said. Imam Khamenei said the Islamic Republic won’t 'procrastinate or rush to carry out its duty' in confronting the Zionist entity. 'The Palestinian people have a lawful right to defend themselves. To stand up to those criminals – the occupation forces. There is not a single court or international organization that can blame the Palestinian people for simply defending their homeland,' his eminence said. The Leader stressed that every country has the right to defend itself from aggressor, stating: 'Muslim nations have to prepare their defense against the common enemy.' Imam Khamenei also affirmed that Hamas’s Operation Al-Aqsa Flood on October 7 attack and Iran’s recent ballistic missile strike were 'legal and legitimate'. 'Each and every country, each and every people have the ultimate right to defend themselves against the ultimate tyranny,' the Leader told the cheering crowd. 'Over the past year, Operation Al-Aqsa Flood has forced this usurping entity to prioritize the preservation of its existence.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2219351	2024-10-04T03:40:20-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-09545590017280383145.jpg
Hezbollah Says Israeli Enemy Targets Rescuers Post Brutal Raids, ...	Hezbollah stated on Friday that the Zionist entity continues its inhumane acts of terrorism by targeting civil defense and rescue teams in targeted residential areas, prompting urgent action from the Lebanese government and international organizations.

These strikes have led to the martyrdom of one member of the Islamic Health Authority's civil defense team, with several others injured.'

‘Israel’ Launches Massive Air Raid on Beirut’s Suburb	Dozens of Israeli air raid targeted residential areas in the southern suburb of Beirut, specifically Mrayjeh, igniting a series of loud explosions that reverberated throughout the city. Witnesses reported that the blasts were so powerful they could be heard as far away as Sidon and Tyre. The strikes occurred in proximity to Beirut International Airport. Notably, the focused site is situated in a densely populated residential neighborhood, raising concerns over civilian safety. Additional bombings were also reported in areas close to residential regions and a school in Hadath, further amplifying fears of collateral damage. As the night wore on, around 3:00 AM local time, media reported flames rising from the location of the airstrikes, while Israeli drones continued to patrol overhead, leaving residents in a state of heightened anxiety. Sources indicate that the targeted locations included hospitals and emergency service facilities, marking one of the most severe assaults in the ongoing conflict. Israeli airstrikes have intensified dramatically in recent days, with reports of nearly 20 bombings occurring within a single day. The Israeli occupation military appears to be conducting these operations in the dead of night, intensifying the terror experienced by civilians in the affected areas. These air raids are part of a broader campaign that has included attempts at incursions into Lebanese border towns. However, the Islamic Resistance group in Lebanon has managed to thwart several of these attempts, inflicting significant losses on Israeli occupation forces; just on Thursday, 17 soldiers were reportedly ambushed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2218779	2024-10-04T00:40:08-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-07017690017280276044.jpg
Watch Hezbollah Missiles Striking Mossad Headquarters in Tel Aviv	Hezbollah Military Media released a video which shows footage of the Islamic Resistance's operation targeting the Galilot Base and the Mossad headquarters north of Tel Aviv as part of the 'Khaibar Operations' series against the 'Israeli' enemy army. Hezbollah fighters have fiercely repelled all Israeli attempts to cross in Lebanon’s territory on Thursday, with Islamic Resistance heroes turning the border area with occupied Palestine into a graveyard for the Zionists. An Islamic Resistance battlefield source told Al-Manar that so far, all Israeli attempts to infiltrate into the Lebanese territory have failed, and that Hezbollah fighters have inflicted heavy losses upon the Zionist troops. 'Hezbollah fighters have repelled all Israeli attempts to advance in several axes in southern Lebanon,' the source told Al-Manar, noting that the resistance fighters have employed different kinds of weapons. 'Resistance’s prepared ambushes are inflicting heavy losses on Israeli soldiers,' according to the source. A field officer in the operations chamber of the Islamic Resistance stated: 'The explosives detonated by the fighters of the Islamic Resistance today, Thursday, October 3, 2024, against the Israeli elite forces that attempted to advance in the outskirts of the towns of Maroun al-Ras and Yaroun resulted in the deaths and injuries of more than 20 officers and soldiers. These explosives were recently planted based on the monitoring and tracking of the enemy’s movements by the fighters, with some being planted just hours before the detonation.' The officer added that the fighters of the Islamic Resistance managed to plant these explosives along potential advance routes of the enemy’s elite soldiers at the Lebanese-Palestinian border. This occurred amid the mobilization and buildup of 'Israeli' enemy forces at their positions and military barracks across the border, alongside the heavy presence of reconnaissance aircraft in the skies over the area.'

Houthi: Israeli Enemy Saw Sayyed Nasrallah as Main Barrier Hinder...	Head of Yemen's Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi addressed 'the great Israeli crime of targeting and killing the martyr of Islam and humanity, the martyr of Jerusalem, Al-Aqsa, and Palestine, His Eminence the Secretary-General of Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah (may Allah be pleased with him).' In a televised speech, Houthi stressed that Sayyed Nasrallah's martyrdom wounds the entire Islamic Umma as His Eminence had a great role, Islamic symbolism, and global, regional, and local significance and impact. Confronting the Zionist enemy and inflicting defeats upon it topped Sayyed Nasrallah's role, Houthi said, adding that for over 40 years, Sayyed Nasrallah had been present in the field of jihad, effectively confronting the Zionist threat with a distinguished stance and great performance. 'Sayyed Nasrallah maintained strong communication with the people, striving to clarify the truths to those he considered the major support in the field and in stance. The impact of Sayyed Nasrallah on the enemy's populace was evident, and the enemy viewed him as possessing high competence in fulfilling his duties and responsibilities.' The Israeli enemy recognized Sayyed Nasrallah as a formidable leader, endowed with courage, faith, insight, wisdom, determination, and steadiness in his stance, Houthi said, adding that the targeting of Sayyed Nasrallah stemmed from an 'Israeli' desire to eliminate what they view as a major barrier to their ambitions in controlling Palestine, Lebanon, and the broader region. 'Sayyed Nasrallah had a significant and pioneering role in thwarting the American and Israeli conspiracy to stir sectarian strife among Muslims. The dangerous destructive project aimed at inciting strife among Muslims and tearing them apart is one of the most serious American and Israeli conspiracies intended to destroy the Ummah.' 'Sayyed Nasrallah paid great attention to fostering friendly and brotherly relations among Muslims, and his efforts in this regard are well-known.' The Israeli enemy's targeting of Sayyed Nasrallah is aimed at undermining Hezbollah's role and the Lebanese front in confronting the Israeli enemy and supporting the Palestinian people, Houthi affirmed. 'The Israeli enemy failed even when targeting specific leaders or prominent figures of Hezbollah or committing mass murder, Houthi noted, 'The conspiracies against the Lebanese front were not carried out by the 'Israelis' alone; the Americans were always involved.' 'Had other Arab armies or entities, without a faithful approach, faced what Hezbollah did, they would have collapsed. Arab regimes and armies have collapsed in days, despite not facing the same level of difficulties as Hezbollah.' 'Hezbollah remains steadfast with a strong public support as well as a powerful and active front that cannot be toppled by storms and hardships.' Houthi maintained that, despite the great loss with the martyrdom of Sayyed Nasrallah, Hezbollah's path remains firm and enduring. Sayyed Nasrallah worked to instill the faithful, fighting, and Husseini spirit in every past stage, as an attitude, thought, awareness, and certainty, according to Houthi, who added that His Eminence worked on building the practical and organizational structure of the resisting Ummah, shaping it into Hezbollah's Ummah. Houthi emphasized that Hezbollah's structure is cohesive, being a faithful and jihadi entity that does not disintegrate or collapse in the face of storms, hardships, and sorrows. 'Hezbollah's supporters are also a strong, cohesive entity, facing challenges and ordeals. Hezbollah's supporters endured the Beirut port explosion, subsequent assassinations, and ongoing wide-scale destruction crimes in recent days.' 'The speech of His Eminence Sheikh Naim Qassem, Deputy Secretary-General of Hezbollah, expressed confidence, cohesion, and continued resilience.' The Israeli enemy resorted to a ground offensive, thinking the conditions were favorable for it and that Hezbollah's structure had collapsed, but it was surprised, maintained Houthi. 'The Israeli enemy was strongly and significantly shocked at Lebanon's borders with occupied Palestine and even within occupied locations.' 'The fighters in Hezbollah now have more motivation and drive after the martyrdom of the Secretary-General than they did before. The condition reflected in the reality of Hezbollah's fighters is not one of collapse, incapacity, failure, or weakness; rather, it is determination, resolve, and a commitment to performing the great honorable duty.' The Islamic Republic of Iran has carried out the largest missile strike the 'Israeli' enemy has faced since it began occupying Palestine, said Houthi, adding that the Iranian missile strikes covered an area spanning across occupied Palestine, reached the vicinity of Ashkelon, focused on military bases and espionage centers. 'The Second True Promise operation was in fulfillment of the Islamic Republic's commitment after the Israeli enemy's assassination of the martyr of the Islamic Ummah, Ismail Haniyeh, and the targeting of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, may Allah's blessings be upon him, and the commander in the Revolutionary Guard.' 'The Second True Promise operation was successful, powerful, and decisive, undeterred by American bases despite repeated claims that they would protect the Israeli enemy.' 'The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has carried out intense operations in recent days and is heading towards further escalation with high effectiveness,' Houthi said, 'The Yafa operation carried out by Al-Qassam Brigades shook the Israeli entity.' 'More American armed reconnaissance drones (MQ-9) were shot down, bringing the total to 11 of such drones this year.' Targeting Hodeidah by the 'Israeli' and American enemy will not stop our operations; our fight continues, Houthi underscored. Yemeni Armed Forces (YAF) have claimed responsibility for a drone operation targeting Tel Aviv, known to its residents as Yafa. Brigadier General Yahya Saree, the spokesperson for the YAF, announced that multiple drones successfully struck important targets within the city without interception from Israeli defense systems.

Empty Promises: Iran’s Pezeshkian Warns of Severe Consequences if...	Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian arrived in Qatar on Wednesday to attend the Asia Cooperation Dialogue summit, focusing on strategies to curtail Israeli aggression in the region. During a meeting with officials from the Hamas Political Bureau, Pezeshkian voiced strong criticism of Western nations, claiming they have repeatedly made empty promises to Iran while urging the country to exercise restraint in the face of ongoing conflict in Gaza. Pezeshkian warned that the relentless Israeli actions could provoke a severe response from Iran, stating, 'If Israel makes the slightest mistake, it should prepare for an even harsher reaction.' He also shared his deep sorrow over the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, highlighting it as one of the most painful events of his tenure, recalling that Haniyeh had been a guest at his inauguration. Pezeshkian criticized Western countries for making empty promises, saying they invited Iran to exercise self-restraint and refrain from giving a response to Israel’s July assassination of Haniyeh. Therefore, 'the continuation of the Zionist regime’s crimes made the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran to give a decisive response,' he added. The Iranian president condemned the atrocities perpetrated by ‘Israel’ in Gaza and Lebanon, and lashed out at the United States and Western countries for pursuing hypocritical approaches, saying they back Israel while claiming to advocate democracy and human rights. These countries are constantly talking about human rights and human dignity, but they have proven that they are completely alien to these concepts as they are supporting the criminal Israeli regime, he said. 'People's lives, especially those of women and children, are of no value to them, and all their claims are lies,' Pezeshkian added. Furthermore, the Iranian president reiterated the need to foster coherence among Muslim nations, emphasizing that the lack of such unity has emboldened the Israeli regime to commit more crimes against the oppressed people of Palestine and Lebanon. He noted that the ongoing developments in the region are the outcome of lack of unity among Muslim states, saying, 'If Muslims had been united, the Zionist regime would not have dared commit such crimes.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2217921	2024-10-03T02:42:27-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-07888060017279485407.jpg

Al-Rudwan Forces to Israeli Elite Soldiers: You Can Either Die or...	Upon the start of the failed Israeli invasion on Lebanon, fighters of Hezbollah elite military unit, Al-Rudwan, clashed directly with the enemy soldiers, ambushing them and leaving deaths as well as numerous injuries, according to Israeli media reports. Dozens of Israeli soldiers were either killed or injured during the first day of the direct clash. In this regard, Islamic Resistance's military sources told Al-Jazeera TV Channel that all the Zionist soldiers who tried to invade South Lebanon were either killed or injured. 'The rest fled away.'

Al-Odaisseh Ambush Islamic Resistance's military sources also told Al-Mayadeen TV Channel about the ambush in Al-Odaisseh / Khallet al-Mahaffar on the Lebanese-Palestinian border, giving important details. 'In the early hours of Tuesday, 01-10-2024, the fighters of the Islamic Resistance observed reconnaissance movements by the Israeli enemy army in an uncovered area opposite the town of Al-Odaisseh, as part of scouting a possible advance path for enemy soldiers.' 'The fighters did not engage the recon force and let it complete its mission and return. Based on the movements and behavior of this force, the fighters were able to set up an advanced ambush in Al-Mahaffar - Al-Odaisseh area, awaiting the entry of elite forces to position themselves in one of the houses in the area.' 'At dawn on Wednesday, 02-10-2024, a force from the Israeli elite army began silently infiltrating the ambush area, numbering over 30 officers and soldiers.' When the 'Israeli' force reached the ambush point (not far from the border), the Resistance fighters shouted 'Labbayka ya Nasrallah,' and showered them with a hail of bullets and shells, according to the sources. 'The clash with the force reached point-blank range, resulting in numerous casualties and injuries among the infiltrating force, causing the soldiers to cry out in anguish over their dead and wounded.' 'Simultaneously, support groups in the Resistance targeted the enemy's supply lines in Misgav Am, Kfar Giladi , and Al-Metula with mortars and rockets, impeding reinforcements for the targeted force.' The 'Israeli' Air Force immediately intervened with helicopters to comb the area and evacuate the dead and wounded, while the enemy began launching smoke bombs, the sourced added. The Islamic Resistance promises its most sacred martyr, His Eminence Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah (peace be upon him), its loyal, brave, and generous people, and all the righteous martyrs, that it remains steadfast in defending the precious land of Lebanon according to the field plans overseen by its martyred leaders, according to the sources. The Islamic Resistance sources warned the enemy that what it witnessed today was just a tiny sample of what awaits them in every inch of southern Lebanese land if they dare to advance. 'Between us and this enemy are days, nights, and the battlefield.' Hezbollah’s Islamic Resistance continued its unwavering efforts to defend Lebanese territories and support the Gaza Strip. Since the early morning on Wednesday, the group’s valiant fighters confronted an Israeli occupation infantry force attempting to infiltrate Lebanese territory while also targeting gatherings of Zionist soldiers in the border areas.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2217404	2024-10-02T15:33:48-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04080290017279084089.jpg

Member of Loyalty to Resistance Parliamentary Bloc, MP Hasan Fadlallah stressed that the Israeli enemy, through its aggression on Lebanon ongoing for ten days, plotted to crush Hezbollah, defeat Lebanon, and change the political map of the entire Middle East. 'Israel' thought that the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and the aerial aggression on Lebanon would let it reach a major achievement, MP Fadlallah told Al-Mayadeen Channel, adding that the Iranian missile strike placed limits that could curb the Israeli barbarism. 'In 1992, the Israeli enemy assassinated Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Abbas Al-Moussawi and started a ground invasion of the liberated areas in South Lebanon. However, the Islamic Resistance fighters, led by martyr Sayyed Nasrallah, confronted the occupation forced and defeated it.' MP Fadlalah stressed that Hezbollah fighters will be able to defeat the enemy in accordance with the plans devised by martyr Sayyed Nasrallah.

Iran’s President Warns ‘Israel’ of Harsher Response, Urges Islami...	The President of Iran Masoud Pezeshkian said that Iran is not looking for war and instead seeks peace, calling on the Islamic countries to work hand in hand to stop the Zionist regime's atrocities. Pezeshkian made the remarks standing alongside the Emir of Qatar in Doha in a joint press conference on Wednesday afternoon. He called for broadening of bilateral Tehran-Doha ties following talks with Qatari Emir. 'We are looking for the development of relations with the government of Qatar, and the common will of the two countries is to improve the level of cooperation,' he said. He expressed hope that the negotiations between his accompanying Iranian delegation with the Qatari side will result in the expansion of ties in all fields of transportation, culture, tourism, health and treatment, further hoping that 'We will be able to make joint investments.' 'The security of the region is the security of all Muslims. Since I was elected as the president, I have been looking for peace and tranquility. No country has been able to develop through war,' he further stressed. 'Israeli regime cannot continue atrocities if regional countries work hand in hand,' the Iranian president said. 'We are not looking for war; It is the Zionist regime that forced us to react,' he said in an apparent reference to the Tuesday missile attack on the Zionist entity. The Iranian president further warned the Israeli regime of a harsher response. He stressed the Zionist regime is seeking instability and insecurity in the region, calling on the US and Europe to stop the regime as war is in no one's interest. Upon his arrival at Doha airport on Wednesday, Pezeshkian referred to the assassination of the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran two months ago, noting that the US and European countries had asked Iran not to take any action, promising that they would bring peace to Gaza within a week. He emphasized that Iran’s decision to wait allowed the Zionist regime to expand its crimes and become more emboldened. Referring to establishing peace and security in the region, the Iranian president highlighted, 'It was Israel that assassinated Haniyeh in Tehran.' For his part, Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani called on the international community to stop the Zionist aggression on Lebanon, saying he supports regional and international efforts to reduce tensions and protect peace and security in the region. 'In recent days, we have warned about increasing tensions in Lebanon. The occupying regime must stop its oppressive war on Gaza, the West Bank, and Lebanon. Mediation is our strategic option.' Sheikh Tamim said they will continue their mediation efforts aimed at stopping the genocidal campaign in Gaza and securing the release of the captives. The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps carried out a missile strike against the Israeli occupation entity on Tuesday evening. The IRGC said in a statement that it has targeted 'the heart of the occupied territories' in response to the martyrdom of Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh, Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, and IRGC general Abbas Nilforoushan at the hands of the Zionist regime.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2217228	2024-10-02T11:59:56-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-09212820017278955823.jpg

Iran’s Tolerance Fades Following Assassination of Sayyed Nasralla...	Iran's top military commander stated that Iran had shown restraint following aggressive actions from ‘Israel’ in July but could no longer remain patient after the assassination of Hezbollah Leader Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and a prominent Iranian general. Major General Mohammad Baqeri made this announcement on Wednesday after Operation True Promise II. The regime assassinated Ismail Haniyeh, former chief of the Political Bureau of the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas, during a targeted killing in the Iranian capital Tehran on July 31. 'After Martyr Haniyeh’s assassination, Iran went through a tough period of self-restraint amid repeated requests by the Americans and Europeans, who would ask us to exercise self-restraint so they would establish a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip (where the Israeli regime has been waging a genocidal war),' Bagheri said. 'However, after Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah’s and [Brigadier] General [Abbas] Nilforoushan’s martyrdom, the situation was no longer tolerable,' he added. Hezbollah Leader Sayyed Nasrallah and the Iranian commander were assassinated during intense Israeli airstrikes on the southern suburb of Beirut on Friday. On Tuesday, Iran responded to the triple assassinations as well as the regime’s ongoing deadly aggression against Gaza and Lebanon by launching hundreds of missiles toward the Zionist entity’s military and intelligence bases all over the occupied Palestinian territories. Iranian missiles successfully hit the Israeli regime's Tel Nof Airbase near Tel Aviv. pic.twitter.com/emlmIuXsrt — Mehr News Agency (@MehrnewsCom) October 1, 2024 Flares and missiles were seen in the Tel Aviv sky and explosions could be heard in the occupied al-Quds during the operation dubbed Operation True Promise II, while 'direct hits' were reported in Negev, Sharon, and other locations. According to Bagheri, the targets of the 'heroic' operation that 'served as a response to many of the Zionists’ crimes,' included three of the Israeli regime’s main airbases. He named the bases as the headquarters of the regime’s Mossad spy agency, which he identified as the 'center for terrorism,' the regime’s Nevatim airbase that houses its F-35 warplanes, and the Hatzerim base that was used towards enabling Nasrallah’s assassination. The targets also featured the regime’s strategic radars, the centers housing the regime’s tanks and personnel carriers, and the center accommodating those of the regime’s forces that partake in massacres against Palestinians in Gaza. 'All Israeli infrastructures to be targeted if it repeats its atrocities' The military chief asserted that the Islamic Republic’s Armed Forces were completely prepared to respond to the potential repetition of such atrocities on the part of the regime, describing the forces’ capabilities as 'many times more than' what was displayed during True Promise II. 'If the Zionist regime, which has reached madness, was not controlled by the United States and Europe, and sought to either continue its atrocities or take action against our territorial integrity and sovereignty, tonight’s operation would be repeated with multiple magnitude and all of their infrastructures would be struck.' He, however, hoped that the US would reverse its approach and stop the regime so the region could move towards experiencing calm. The General Staff of Iran’s Armed Forces also commented on the operation in a statement, saying it came in reaction to the regime’s disregard for the legitimate sovereign rights of the Islamic Republic. It praised the response as an instance of the country’s 'making any malicious aggressor, at any level, regret their actions.' The statement, meanwhile, warned the aggressive regime that 'it should expect the widespread and comprehensive destruction of its infrastructure within the occupied Palestinian lands if it responds [to the operation] in kind.' It finally cautioned the regime’s supporters, including the United States, against taking part in direct intervention against the Islamic Republic, saying such interference would warrant 'a powerful and regret-inducing response against their centers and interests across the region.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2215809	2024-10-02T03:00:23-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04726330017278632178.jpg
Yemeni Armed Forces launch Quds-5 cruise missiles deep into ‘Isra...	The missile force of the Yemeni Armed Forces (YAF) has launched a significant attack on military sites deep within the Israeli occupation territory using three Quds-5 cruise missiles, as confirmed by YAF spokesperson Brigadier General Yahya Saree on Wednesday. Saree emphasized that the Israeli occupation authorities have remained silent regarding the outcomes of this operation, which is declared as a show of support for the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and a demonstration of solidarity with their Resistance. In addition, the YAF extended their congratulations on Iran's Operation True Promise 2 against the Israeli occupation entity and expressed their readiness to partake in joint military actions in support of the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples, as well as in response to any Israeli aggression against their support fronts. Furthermore, the spokesperson issued a warning concerning the continued support of, The United States and Britain for ‘Israel’, stating that such support places American and British interests in the region at risk. Brigadier General Saree also underlined the YAF's unwavering determination to escalate their military operations against, ‘Israel’, and its supporters until the aggression on Gaza ceases, the blockade on the Strip is lifted, and the aggression on Lebanon comes to an end. The senior military source highlighted the Quds-5's exceptional features, including its high speed, formidable destructive power, and capability to penetrate all types of air defenses deployed in the region. Moreover, Saree hinted at the element of surprise associated with the Quds-5, drawing a parallel to the previous shock caused by the Quds-3 missile and indicating that further unexpected developments should be expected. This remarkable attack follows closely on the heels of Saree's announcement that the YAF's naval, missile, and UAV forces executed three separate military operations in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. The initial operation targeted the Cordelia Moon British oil tanker in the Red Sea, employing eight ballistic and cruise missiles, a drone, and an uncrewed surface boat, resulting in significant damage to the vessel. The subsequent operations took aim at the Marathopolis tanker in the Indian Ocean, utilizing a cruise missile and a drone to enforce the YAF's maritime ban on ships heading towards the occupied ports of Palestine. The YAF's UAV force had previously struck an Israeli military target in occupied Yafa (Eilat) using a Yafa-type drone, as well as other military targets in occupied Umm al-Rashrash (Eilat) with four Samad-4 drones, all of which achieved their objectives effectively.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2216062	2024-10-02T03:00:10-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/06/manar-00923210017183201212.jpg

Eight Zionists Dead in Jaffa Shooting, Many More Wounded	Six people were murdered and dozens were wounded in a terrorist shooting attack at a light rail station in Jaffa on Tuesday evening. Eight people were taken to Ichilov Medical Center with at least two in critical condition with head wounds and the others moderately to seriously wounded. Twelve wounded, including a child, were transferred to the Wolfson Medical Center; five were in serious condition. Security forces initially believed the incident was criminal because there has been a criminal shooting in the area nearly every day recently due to a well-known criminal living nearby, according to Maariv. Once they heard the shooting and shouts of 'Allahu Akbar,' the authorities arrived on the scene ready for a terror incident. Eyewitnesses described the terror and chaos. 'We were on the light rail when we suddenly heard gunfire from outside,' one witness said. 'At first, we thought it was fireworks, but then we realized it was something much worse. There were many gunshots. We dropped to the floor, and people were crying. I saw someone bleeding on the ground.' A nearby shop owner added, 'I saw crowds of people running and shouting ‘terror attack.’ I quickly closed my shutters and locked up.' The two attackers, Muhammad Chalaf Sahar Rajab and Hassan Muhammad Hassan Tamimi, from Hebron, were shot dead by members of a Tel Aviv-Jaffa Municipality security patrol unit and citizens using personal firearms, according to the police. Chaos in Tel Aviv's light rail Hanan Peretz, head of the local patrol unit, praised his team’s swift response. 'They identified the gunman, took cover without hesitation, and fired at him,' he said. 'It seems the attacker’s weapon malfunctioned during the shooting.' The police and security services are continuing their investigation into the attack, which took place near the Gush Dan Light Rail’s Erlich Station. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Police Commissioner Daniel Levy arrived at the scene, along with Tel Aviv District Commander Haim Sargrof. 'This is a difficult incident,' Sargrof said. 'At around 7 p.m., we received a report that two attackers had boarded the light rail and opened fire. They injured four people, then exited the train and continued shooting at civilians on the street. A light rail security guard, two officers from the municipal Sela Unit, and police officers shot at the attackers and neutralized both of them. We know their origin and are conducting further checks with the Shin Bet [Israel Security Agency]. They are not Israeli citizens.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2215622	2024-10-01T13:21:05-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-09163930017278140366.jpg
Iran’s Ballistic Missiles Strike ‘Israel’	The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps carried out a missile strike against the Israeli occupation entity on Tuesday evening. The IRGC said in a statement that it has targeted 'the heart of the occupied territories' in response to the martyrdom of Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh, Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, and IRGC general Abbas Nilforoushan at the hands of the Zionist regime. The statement said the retaliatory attack has been launched after a period of self-restraint following the violation of Iran’s sovereignty. The IRGC said it has fired tens of ballistic missiles at vital military and security Israeli targets. The IRGC has also warned the Zionist regime that if it intends to react militarily to Iran’s operation which conforms with Tehran’s legitimate rights and the international law, it will have to face subsequent 'crushing and devastating strikes'. Reports suggest that as many as 200 Iranian missiles have been fired during half an hour. Images released by the media outlets show a large number of projectiles over Tel Aviv a number of other cities across the occupied territories. Hamas Hamas Resistance Movement issued a statement to commend the Iranian missile strikes in response to the Zionist aggression against the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples. What follows is the text of Hamas Movement: In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, We commend the Iranian missile strikes in response to the Zionist aggression against the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples. The Islamic Resistance Movement - Hamas, expresses its support for the heroic missile launches executed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran, targeting large areas of our occupied lands. These strikes are a response to the ongoing crimes of the Zionist occupation against the peoples of the region and an act of retribution for the blood of our honored martyrs: the martyred fighter Ismail Haniyeh, His Eminence Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, and General Abbas Nilforoushan. We affirm that this honorable Iranian retaliation sends a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government, aiming to deter their continued terrorism. Their persistent violations of international law and humanitarian norms, as well as their crimes and arrogance, have exceeded all bounds. We take pride in our brothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran and deeply appreciate their stance against unchecked Zionist aggression. Their commitment to justice aligns with the struggles of the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and the broader interests of the Islamic Nation, embodied in ending the occupation and curbing the fascist Zionist enemy. We call on all countries, peoples, parties, and forces within the Arab and Islamic Nations to unite in confronting Zionist crimes and their expansionist project, which threatens us all. We urge collective efforts to liberate our lands and sacred sites from the defilement of the fascist occupation. The Islamic Resistance Movement - Hamas Hamas Palestinian resistance movement logo. Abu Ubaidah The spokesman of Al-Qassam Brigades, Abu Ubaidah, also issued a statement to commend the retaliatory strike that reached the heart of occupied Palestine, delivering a decisive blow to the criminal occupation, which mistakenly believes its rampant aggression in the region can continue without consequence. 'Today marks a pivotal moment in the history of the conflict, as the flames of the nation’s resistance converge in the skies over Palestine. Tel Aviv now faces the strikes of the Mujahideen from Yemen, Lebanon, Palestine, and Iran. This is a call to the entire nation, urging all to unite as a single arrow aimed at the liberation of Palestine.'
