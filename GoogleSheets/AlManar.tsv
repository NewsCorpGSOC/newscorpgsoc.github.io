Sheikh Qassem: Victorious Hezbollah Committed to Reconstruction a...	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem stressed on Thursday that the enemy sought to crush the resistance through its aggression but was met with the 'Battle of The Formidable in Might'. In a televised speech, Sheikh Qassem said, 'For 64 days, we endured sacrifices, pain, martyrs, and injuries with patience, resilience, and reliance on Allah.' According to Sheikh Qassem, three key factors contributed to Allah’s victory for us in this battle: 1. The presence and steadfastness of martyrdom-seeking fighters on the battlefield. 2. The blood of the martyrs, especially that of His Eminence Sayyed Nasrallah, which inspired the fighters to persevere. 3. The restoration of leadership and control structures within the party, enabling effective management of the 'Battle of The Formidable in Might'. Hezbollah Leader hailed the steadfastness of the displaced Lebanese people for their contribution to the victory, detailing Hezbollah plan to fund the reconstruction and thanking the Iranian-Iraqi-Yemeni financial support in this regard. Sheikh Qassem stressed that those whose houses were completely destroyed will receive a 14-thousand-dollar pay in order to purchase a new furniture and rent a house for a year. His eminence also underlined the Lebanese government in raising the debris, treating the infrastructure problems and contributing to the reconstruction project. Sheikh Qassem pointed out that the legendary resilience of the fighters astonished the world, displaying unparalleled courage and bravery on the frontlines. 'We achieved victory because the enemy failed to accomplish its objectives, marking their defeat. Our resistance remains steadfast, will endure, and will shine even brighter.' We agreed to the ceasefire mechanism outlined by Resolution 1701, which is not a new or standalone agreement, he added. Sheikh Qassem noted that Resolution 1701 mandates 'Israel's' withdrawal and prohibits armed presence south of the Litani River, adding that the provisions outlined in Resolution 1701 include mechanisms for Lebanon to reclaim its borders within the specified timeframe. 'Israel has committed over 60 violations of the ceasefire agreement, and the government is responsible for addressing those breaches. The Lebanese state is accountable for monitoring Israeli violations, while the resistance provides an opportunity to ensure the success of the ceasefire agreement.' Sheikh Qassem indicated that 'Israel' has no influence on our internal relationships or our ties with the Lebanese Army, adding that Hezbollah’s strength stems from supporting the rights of Palestinians and Lebanese to liberate their land.' We will evaluate the crises and war we endured, drawing lessons to improve and advance in all fields, Sheikh Qassem said. His eminence expressed gratitude to those who hosted the displaced, to the various entities offering support, whether governmental or civilian, and to the countries that provided aid. Meanwhile, Sheikh Qassem said that the aggression against Syria is backed by America and 'Israel', adding that the Takfiri groups in Syria were tools serving 'Israel' and America. Hezbollah will stand alongside Syria to thwart this aggression, Sheikh Qassem affirmed. 'We face a dangerous expansionist Israeli project, and I call on you to support the resistance against 'Israel'. Takfiri groups aim to shift Syria from its position of resistance to one that serves the Israeli enemy.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2284394	2024-12-05T10:27:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-09018800017334231657.png

Amnesty International Investigation Concludes ‘Israel’ Committing...	Amnesty International human rights group has concluded that the Zionist entity’s war on Gaza meets the legal threshold for genocide, in a report it said it was a 'wake-up call' for the international community. The report, published on Thursday, titled 'You Feel Like You Are Subhuman': Israel’s Genocide Against Palestinians in Gaza. The London-based rights organization said its findings were based on 'dehumanizing and genocidal statements by Israeli government and military officials', satellite images documenting devastation, fieldwork and ground reports from Gazans. It is the culmination of months of research by Amnesty, including extensive witness interviews, analysis of 'visual and digital evidence', including satellite imagery, and statements made by senior Israeli government and military officials. 'Month after month, Israel has treated Palestinians in Gaza as a subhuman group unworthy of human rights and dignity, demonstrating its intent to physically destroy them,' Amnesty chief Agnes Callamard said in a statement. 'Our damning findings must serve as a wake-up call to the international community: this is genocide. It must stop now,' she added.

'Our research reveals that, for months, Israel has persisted in committing genocidal acts, fully aware of the irreparable harm it was inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza,' Callamard said. 'It continued to do so in defiance of countless warnings about the catastrophic humanitarian situation and of legally binding decisions from the International Court of Justice [ICJ] ordering Israel to take immediate measures to enable the provision of humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza,' she added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2284009	2024-12-05T00:27:14-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-09111270017298671932.jpg

Hezbollah Can Resume Battle against Israeli Enemy with Long-range...	Deputy Chief of Hezbollah Politburo, Hajj Mahmoud Komati, indicated on Wednesday that the mechanism of the implementation of the ceasefire deal in southern Lebanon is vague, adding that the US deliberate leniency gave the Israeli enemy the chance to violate the Lebanese sovereignty. In a TV interview, Komati stressed that the response of the Islamic Resistance came after the Israeli attacks on the Lebanese civilians and violations of the ceasefire. The Islamic Resistance carried out on Monday, December 2, its first attack on Zionist military sites since the ceasefire took into effect last Wednesday, November 27, 2024, targeting Ruwaisat Al-Alam occupation post in KfarShuba Hills area. When Hezbollah realized that the Lebanese and American officials disregarded the Israeli violations, it carried out the attack on the Israeli occupation site, which pushed everyone to move to implement the mechanism of the ceasefire, he said. Komati pointed out that Hezbollah is waiting for and will cooperate with the committee tasked to overlook the truce implementation, but that the developments, in this regard are not satisfactory. Hezbollah will be patient for a period of time, yet can resume the battle against the Israeli enemy with long-range missiles, if needed, Komati added. Regarding the Lebanese presidential elections, Komati reiterated Hezbollah commitment to the nomination of the former minister Sleiman Frangieh, calling on the parliamentary bloc to reach a minimum consensus in this domain.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2283877	2024-12-04T11:29:42-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-027725400166239486010.jpg

Russia Reaffirms Support for Syrian Authorities Against Terror	Russia stands in solidarity with the Syrian people and leadership amid the escalating hostilities in the country and strongly supports efforts by the authorities to combat terrorists and restore peace, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stated. 'We express our solidarity with the leadership of Syria and its people in this difficult situation. We reaffirm our commitment to maintaining the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Syria. We fully support the Syrian authorities’ efforts to combat terrorist groups and restore constitutional order,' she said, as quoted by TASS news agency. The spokeswoman noted that Russia has been actively working with its international partners to reach the stabilization of the situation in the country as soon as possible and will primarily utilize the potential of the Astana format. 'Foreign ministers of the three guarantor countries, Russia, Iran, and Turkey, are in close communication,' she stressed, also expressing hope that all countries with influence on the situation in Syria will use it to achieve the early return of stability. The talks on the Syrian settlement were first held in the Kazakh capital in January 2017. The Astana format includes Russia, Iran, and Turkey as guarantor countries for the process to resolve the crisis.

Israeli Army Warns 30 Soldiers against Overseas Travel over War C...	The Israeli occupation military warned some 30 soldiers and officers who fought in the Gaza Strip to avoid traveling abroad after pro-Palestinian groups filed complaints against them for war crimes. At least eight of them — including troops who had traveled to Cyprus, Slovenia and the Netherlands — were told to immediately leave those nations due to fears they could be arrested or questioned, Ynet reported. The military currently does not bar soldiers from traveling abroad, but it does take a 'risk assessment' for troops who served in Gaza before approving their request, the report said. Since the beginning of the war, the army has asked soldiers to not publish footage online of their abuses in Gaza, to avoid it being used against them in a potential criminal investigation in another country. Journalists who have accompanied troops in Gaza have also been asked to blur the faces of soldiers for the same reason.

In the north, media sources reported that Israeli helicopter and drone strikes have targeted civilian homes in Beit Lahia, leaving the besieged residents there pleading for their lives as they face the horrors of hunger and violence.

It is worth noting that for the 61st consecutive day, northern Gaza has been under an Israeli siege and starvation amidst violent aerial and artillery bombardment, and the complete isolation of the northern governorate from Gaza. For the 43rd day, the occupation forces continue to forcibly disrupt the work of civil defense in the northern Gaza Strip due to the ongoing Israeli targeting and aggression, and thousands of citizens there are now without humanitarian and medical care. In turn, UNRWA stated that it was forced to stop delivering food and other supplies to Gaza via the Kerem Abu Salem border crossing due to the looting carried out by 'armed gangs.'

Norway Wealth Fund Divests from Israeli Telecommunication Company...	Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, announced it has sold all of its shares in an Israeli telecommunications company as it provides telecoms services to the Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. In its recommendation, released late on Tuesday, the fund’s watchdog said it was divesting from Bezeq, the Zionist entity’s largest telecoms group. 'The company, through its physical presence and provision of telecom services to Israeli settlements in the West Bank, is helping to facilitate the maintenance and expansion of these settlements, which are illegal under international law,' the recommendation read. 'By doing so the company is itself contributing to the violation of international law,' it added, according to Reuters news agency. The $1.8 trillion fund has been an international leader in the environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment field. It owns 1.5% of the world's listed shares across 8,700 companies, and its size carries influence. The watchdog said it noted that the company had said it was also providing telecoms services to Palestinian areas in the occupied West Bank, but that did not outweigh the fact that it was also providing services to Israeli settlements. The watchdog makes recommendations to the board of the Norwegian Central Bank, which has the final say on divestments. The fund has now sold all its stock in the company. Israeli settler units in the occupied West Bank (photo from archive). Before that, it had cut its stake during the first half of 2024, owning 0.76% of the company's shares valued at $23.7 million at the end of June, down from a holding of 2.2% at the start of the year, fund data showed. The watchdog's new definition of ethical breaches was partly based on the International Court of Justice finding in July that 'the occupation itself, Israel's settlement policy and the way Israel uses the natural resources in the areas are in conflict with international law', according to an August 30 letter it addressed to the finance ministry. Since the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023, the council had been investigating whether more companies fall outside its permitted investment guidelines. Before the announcement to divest, the fund had divested from nine companies operating in the occupied West Bank. Their operations include building roads and homes in Israeli settlements in East Al-Quds (Jerusalem) and the West Bank and providing surveillance systems for an Israeli wall around the occupied West Bank.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2283459	2024-12-04T01:47:32-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-00726770017333054101.jpg

PA, Hamas Agree to Form Committee to Run Post-War Gaza: Report	The Palestinian Authority and Hamas have signed a document agreeing to form a joint committee that would run the post-war Gaza Strip, Al-Araby Al-Jadeed Arab news site reported on Tuesday. The report said it has a copy of the document that was signed to formulate the committee, to be made of 10-15 leading Palestinian figures. It comes a day after Egypt’s foreign minister said that rival Palestinian groups Fatah and Hamas were in Cairo for talks seeking to bring post-war Gaza. The talks are part of Egypt’s broader mediation efforts to broker a ceasefire between the Zionist entity and the Hamas resistance group and to expand humanitarian access to the enclave. Displaced Palestinians line up to receive food at a distribution center in Gaza's Deir Al-Balah (November 26, 2024).

US Says Ceasefire Holding: Washington 'Hasn’t Determined if Israe...	The US State Department said on Monday that the ceasefire between the Zionist entity and Hezbollah is thus far 'successful, broadly speaking,' adding that Washington has not 'determined' if Tel Aviv violated the ceasefire. 'The ceasefire is holding,' Matthew Miller, the department’s spokesman, told reporters at the daily press briefing, after the Israeli enemy staged airstrikes on several areas across south Lebanon earlier on Monday. The ceasefire, brokered by the United States and France, has 'been successful in stopping the fighting and getting us on a path where we are not seeing the daily loss of life that we had seen for two months prior,' the spokesman added. Miller said that violations were expected, especially in the opening weeks 'when things are very fragile.' The ceasefire agreement, which took effect on Wednesday (November 27), contains a mechanism for reporting potential violations and for the ways that Washington and Paris will respond to them, he said. That mechanism will become more formalized in the coming days, the spokesman noted. 'When we get reports of potential violations, we have a mechanism that we put in place with the government of France to look at those potential violations, determine if they are in fact, violations, and then engage with the parties to ensure that they aren't repeated,' Miller said. Later on Monday, Miller said that Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, and the two discussed developments in Gaza and Lebanon. Blinken pointed to the 'importance of bringing all of the hostages home and ending the war in Gaza,' while stressing the 'importance' of implementing the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon. .@SecBlinken spoke with Israeli Minister Dermer.

Hezbollah Political Council Deputy Chief Mahmoud Komati underlined the contradiction between the US-Israeli calls for separating Lebanon's and Gaza's dossiers and the current endeavor to link the hostage deal with the Lebanese front. In a TV interview, Komati indicated that Hezbollah's resistance and political activity are very powerful politically, adding that the Resistance is not in need of any military or security action in order to preserve the political participation. Komati mentioned that Hezbollah resorted to silence about the Zionist violations, yet the enemy escalated its attacks, which made the Resistance response very necessary. We clearly said that Hezbollah's commitment to the UN Resolution 1701 is conditioned by the Israeli commitment too, he reiterated. Komati stressed that the Lebanese Army possesses the patriotic will to fight the enemy, yet lacks the weaponry needed for that mission.

US-Israeli Captive Confirmed Dead, IOF Announces	The Israeli occupation military confirmed Monday that an Israeli American soldier, previously believed to have been captured alive by Hamas during its Oct. 7, 2023 attack against the Zionist entity, is now presumed dead. Capt. Omer Neutra, 21, a New York native who enlisted in the Israeli military, was captured when Hamas fighters attacked the occupation settlements in Gaza enclave. It was previously thought he was being held hostage since then, but officials have announced it is thought he was killed on the day of the Hamas attack and his body was then taken into the Gaza Strip. Believing their son to be alive, the soldier's parents, Ronen and Orna Neutra, led a public campaign for over a year, speaking at rallies in both 'Israel' and the U.S., addressing the Republican National Convention, and maintaining contact with the Biden administration in a bid to secure his release. Hamas is still holding approximately 100 hostages inside Gaza, with at least a third believed to be dead. The Biden administration is renewing its push for a ceasefire and the release of the remaining captives after nearly a year of stalled negotiations between 'Israel' and Hamas. The situation remains dire, but diplomats see a glimmer of hope following a recent ceasefire between 'Israel' and Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based resistance group allied with Hamas.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2282568	2024-12-02T06:38:47-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-04473770017331503025.png

Before departing Tehran, Araghchi expressed confidence in Syria’s ability to overcome these challenges, stating, 'The Syrian army will once again triumph over the terrorists.' He further criticized the roles of external actors, asserting, 'The United States, the Zionist entity, and Takfiri groups have shown they are aligned in their objectives, but their actions will ultimately fail, as they have before.' The discussions underscore the close coordination between Syria and Iran in addressing shared security concerns and maintaining regional stability. The Syrian President expressed gratitude for Iran's unwavering support, extending his greetings to Ayatollah Khamenei and Iranian President Pezeshkian, acknowledging the strong bonds between the two nations. President Assad lauded Iran’s steadfast commitment to regional stability and security, particularly in supporting Syria’s ongoing battle against terrorism. He emphasized the importance of collective regional efforts to eradicate the scourge of terrorism, noting that its persistence benefits only the enemies of Muslim nations, especially the Israeli regime. Highlighting the significance of Minister Araghchi’s visit, Assad described it as a meaningful gesture of solidarity under the current sensitive circumstances. He affirmed that the visit reflects Iran’s strong message of support for the countries in the resistance front as they confront the challenges posed by the Israeli regime. The discussions underscored Syria and Iran’s shared vision of regional cooperation and their determination to address common threats to stability and security.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2282348	2024-12-01T12:42:41-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-09296260017330855762.jpg
Victorious Return: Resistance Community Rebuild Lives Amid Post-W...	With heads held high, the people of the resistance are triumphantly returning to their homes after the Islamic Resistance secured a significant victory against Israeli forces during 66 days of aggression on Lebanon. The assault left widespread destruction across southern villages, the Bekaa Valley, and Beirut’s southern suburbs (Dahiyeh). According to the latest statistics released by the Ministry of Health last Thursday, the Israeli aggression claimed the lives of 3,961 people and left 16,520 others injured. Life is gradually resuming in the areas affected by the Israeli occupation aggression as displaced families return after being forcibly uprooted by the brutal Israeli crimes and massacres against unarmed civilians. Businesses, pharmacies, bakeries, and cafés are reopening, while specialized teams and municipalities work tirelessly to clear debris and reopen roads. As they return, residents honor the memory of the martyrs, whether fallen in heroic battles or through Israeli occupation bombardments of homes. Many visited cemeteries to recite prayers for the souls of those who gave their lives during the conflict. Beirut's Dahiyeh Alive Again In Beirut’s southern suburbs (Dahiyeh), the resilience of the resistance community stands in sharp contrast to the disarray within Netanyahu's government, which struggles to encourage settlers to return to northern occupied territories. Reconstruction Process The Islamic Engineers' Association has launched a registration form to recruit engineers interested in participating in the surveying and rebuilding efforts of areas devastated by the Israeli aggression in the southern suburbs, southern Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley. Work is set to begin next week.

Iran Reaffirms Support for Syria as President Urges Blocking Isra...	Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has condemned the atrocities and disasters unfolding in the region, attributing them to the backing of the United States and certain European countries. He called on Islamic nations to prevent the US and Israeli occupation from exploiting the conflict in Syria. Speaking with optimism, President Pezeshkian expressed hope that Islamic countries would step in to resolve the Syrian crisis and not allow external powers to manipulate the situation again. He emphasized the need to address the nation's challenges through strength and expertise. In a separate address to the Iranian Islamic Consultative Assembly on Parliament Day, the president highlighted his administration's efforts to improve foreign relations, particularly with neighboring countries. 'In the short time since the formation of our government, we have engaged in dialogue with our neighbors, sharing our perspectives and policies,' he stated. President Pezeshkian also affirmed that the Islamic Republic has no intention of escalating wars or bloodshed. 'Those who perpetuate war and violence in this region and across the world are the very ones who claim to champion peace, human rights, and humanity,' he asserted. He criticized the hypocrisy of nations capable of leveraging science and technology to bomb children and women in hospitals and schools. 'In this war, over 10,000 innocent children have been martyred. The global community witnesses these atrocities in silence, and this silence is disgraceful,' he added. President Pezeshkian held the United States and European countries responsible for the catastrophes in the region, citing their support for Israel and extremist groups. He reaffirmed that Iran 'has never and will never covet the territory of any nation in the region.' He further noted a positive shift in regional dynamics, highlighting that for the first time, all nations in the region collectively condemned Israeli aggression against Iran. 'We express our gratitude to our neighboring countries for their unified stance,' Pezeshkian concluded.

Speaking at a Navy Day event, he announced his visit to Damascus to deliver a message of solidarity, emphasizing, 'We strongly back the Syrian government and military.' He equated the Zionist entity with Takfiri terrorists, stating, 'After Israel's failures, the enemy now seeks to destabilize the region through these terrorist groups.' Araghchi expressed confidence in Syria's victory over the militants, as in previous battles. Highlighting the synergy between diplomacy and defense, Araghchi stressed, 'Diplomacy without power is ineffective. As a diplomat, I rely on Iran's internal strengths, including its defensive capabilities.' He concluded, 'Diplomacy is a cost-effective path, but it depends on national power for success.' He also addressed the region's turmoil, accusing Takfiri forces of operating under U.S. leadership in a bid to advance its strategic goals.

Sheikh Qassem: Hezbollah’s Victory Surpasses That in 2006, Resist...	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem addressed on Friday the nation two days after the ceasefire took into effect and ended a two-month Zionist war on Lebanon, stressing that we are witnessing a major victory. Sheikh Qassem stressed that Hezbollah achieved a victory that is greater than that reached in 2006 despite all the sacrifices made and the Western support to the Israeli enemy, adding that we emerged triumphant because we prevented the enemy from eradicating the Resistance. When we launched the support front, we reiterated that we do not seek war but are ready for it if imposed by the 'Israeli' enemy, Sheikh Qassem said. His eminence added that the occupation built its plans 64 days ago based on eradicating Hezbollah, letting the northern settlers to return home, and establishing a new Middle East, adding that 'Israel' anticipated achieving its objectives in a short time after targeting our leadership system and the capabilities we possessed. Sheikh Qassem indicated that Hezbollah managed to remain steadfast on the frontlines and began striking the enemy's internal front, placing 'Israel' in a significant defensive position, noting that, during this war, the number of displaced in 'Israel' has grown from 70,000 to hundreds of thousands. According to Hezbollah leader, the Resistance has proven its readiness, with the plans set by His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah being effective and accounting for all developments. 'The occupation bet on internal discord with the hosts, but this gamble failed due to cooperation among sects and factions. The legendary and sacrificial [Martyrdom-Seeking] steadfastness of the fighters astonished the world, terrified the Israeli army, and sowed despair among the enemy.' 'We declare that, as a result of the 'The Formidable in Might' battle, we are witnessing a great victory because we prevented the enemy from destroying Hezbollah, weakening the Resistance, and forced the enemy to justify itself to its public,' Sheikh Qassem said. 'The Resistance has endured and will continue; this victory belongs to everyone who contributed to it, whether through bullets, martyrdom, wounds, prayers, words, or support. This victory is for every honorable and free individual who supported the Resistance and condemned the Israeli aggression.' Hezbollah leader affirmed, 'Defeat surrounds the enemy from all sides. A ceasefire and cessation of aggression have been agreed upon. This agreement is not a treaty or a new accord requiring signatures from states; rather, it is a set of procedural implementations of Resolution 1701, focusing on the area south of the Litani River.' Sheikh Qassem stressed that the coordination between the Resistance and the Lebanese Army will be of the highest level to ensure the implementation of this agreement, adding that no one should bet on any disagreement between us and the army; this agreement falls under the framework of Lebanese sovereignty. 'We thank Allah for our victory, and we express gratitude and pride in the Resistance fighters on the ground who humiliated the enemy and confronted it with legendary resilience. We extend our thanks to our great martyrs who paved the way for strength and dignity—every one of our martyrs is great because they transcended this world and rejected humiliation.' Hezbollah leader underscored that the central focus of the agreement today is south of the Litani River, affirming the withdrawal of the 'Israeli army' from all areas it has occupied. His eminence voiced gratitude to the Master of the Nation’s Martyrs for being the spark of victory and paving this path, alongside your companion, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, saluting the wounded, civil defense teams, and heartfelt respect and thanks to our people—the most honorable and purest. We honor your sacrifices and the martyrdom of your loved ones in the field of honor, and we deeply appreciate the displaced and those whose homes were destroyed, his eminence said. Sheikh Qassem also thanked the steadfast and resistant political negotiator, Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, Prime Minister Najib Mikati for his efforts, the leadership of the army and security forces, and the honorable media. His eminence expressed gratitude to the Islamic Republic of Iran and its leader, Imam Khamenei, for his guidance, support, and adherence to the path of Imam Khomeini, as well as to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the martyr Hajj Qassem Soleimani, who laid the foundations and contributed significantly, and to the compassionate Iranian people. 'We will work with our people to rebuild and restore, focusing in this phase on dignified shelter.

Israeli Enemy Violates Ceasefire, Opens Fire at Civilians in Sout...	Since the ceasefire took into effect early Wednesday, the Israeli enemy has been repeatedly violating its stipulations, opening fire at civilians and destroying properties. The Zionist violations have been accompanied by arrogant media publications which try to impose a new reality that contradicts with the Israeli military failure in face of Hezbollah fighters during the war. The Lebanese government that signed the agreement is requested today to put an end to these violations before the enemy goes too far, which entails the Lebanese people to move again in face of the Zionist aggression. In this regard, the Israeli occupation forces opened fire at a funeral in Khiam, pushing its tanks to the western side of the town. The Israeli enemy also cut off olive trees and bulldozed roads in Kfar Kila in the context of imposing a new reality on the border region. In the same context, the spokesman of the Zionist army also issued warnings to the locals of a large number of towns in South Lebanon to avoid returning home.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2281083	2024-11-29T08:09:01-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-07774010017328965354.jpg
Iranian Foreign Ministry Calls for Decisive Action Against Terror...	The spokesperson for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Esmail Baghaei, issued a stern warning on the resurgence of terrorist and extremist groups in Syria, urging for 'decisive and coordinated measures' to prevent the spread of terrorism across the region. Baghaei described recent movements of terrorist factions in Syria over the past two days as part of a 'sinister plot' orchestrated by the Israeli occupation regime and the United States to destabilize security in West Asia. He emphasized the critical need for vigilance and cooperation among regional countries, particularly Syria's neighbors, to thwart this dangerous conspiracy.

Highlighting existing agreements under the Astana Peace Process, Baghaei noted that areas such as Aleppo’s countryside and Idlib are designated de-escalation zones by the guarantor states—Iran, Turkey, and Russia. He condemned recent terrorist attacks in these areas as blatant violations of these agreements, warning that such actions endanger the positive outcomes of the Astana process and pose a serious threat to regional stability.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280962	2024-11-29T05:22:27-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-08000540017328864512.jpg

Terrorist Groups Move in Syria’s North just after Israeli Failure...	The Syrian army, backed by the Russian air force and allies, have been confronting a major attack launched by the terrorist groups on the territories it controls in Aleppo Countryside since Wednesday. The militant move comes immediately after the ceasefire in South Lebanon took into effect as Israeli invasion due to the fierce resistance of Hezbollah fighters, which raises several questions about the Zionist role in pushing the takfiris to operate in Syria again in an attempt to undermine its support to the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon. Well-informed sources mentioned that the militant offensive was almost repelled, adding that the Syrian military managed even to contain the terrorist move and launch a counterstrike. The terrorist offensive launched by the takfiri groups in Aleppo western countryside represents a major violation of the ceasefire agreement concluded in 2020 in accordance with Astana talks.

Lebanon Witnesses Political Momentum after Ceasefire: Speaker Ber...	House Speaker Nabih Berri has scheduled a parliament session devoted to electing a president of the republic for Monday, January 9, at the beginning of a parliament session on Thursday. Before starting the session, Berri asked the lawmakers to observe a moment of silence for the martyrs. Commenting on the president election session, Berri said: 'It will be fruitful, and we have given a one-month period to reach consensus among us.' He added that he will invite the ambassadors of states to attend the session. Speaker Berri, on Thursday received French Presidential Envoy, Jean-Yves Le Drian, at his office, accompanied by French Ambassador Hervé Magro and media advisor Ali Hamdan. Discussions focused on Lebanon's political developments, the presidential election, and the broader situation following the cessation of Israeli aggression. The House of Parliament on Thursday concluded its general session during which a proposal by Deputy House Speaker, Elias Bou Saab, to extend the term of Army brigadier generals and higher ranks for one year was put to a vote. The proposal received the support of 48 MPs, effectively extending the term of Lebanese Army Commander, General Joseph Aoun. Speaking from the House of Parliament, MP Hassan Fadlallah, emphasized that the decision to wage war is taken by Israel, stating, 'When they attack us, we will resist.' Fadlallah dismissed the notion of conflict between the Lebanese Army and the resistance, describing their relationship as one of 'unity and solidarity.' Moreover, Fadlallah affirmed support for the Army, recognizing its sacrifices alongside the resistance. 'We stand by the Lebanese Army, which has shed blood for this nation,' he said, explaining the bloc's vote to extend the terms of senior officers to avoid leadership vacancies. The lawmaker called for a unified national vision to build a just state, strengthen the Army with advanced weaponry, and confront Israeli violations. MP Hasan Fadlallah After its war on Lebanon failed to achieve any goal, the Israeli enemy accepted a ceasefire proposal submitted by US and France. The Lebanese health ministry reported 3961 martyrs claimed by the Zionist aggression which ended on November 27.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280423	2024-11-28T07:19:02-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-05319670017328071098.jpeg

Such remarks were echoed by the Israeli army radio, which said that the Israeli shelling of the Lebanese border towns aims at driving residents away from the so-called 'restricted area.' For its part, the Lebanese Army called on residents of Taybe to leave the town following the Israeli drone strike.

Egyptian Team Visits ‘Israel’ to Present ‘Comprehensive Vision’ f...	An Egyptian security delegation is reportedly expected to arrive in Tel Aviv in the coming hours in an effort to reach a Gaza captive and ceasefire deal. According to Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar, the Cairo officials are expected to present a 'comprehensive vision' for an agreement, amid optimism that a deal can be reached in the wake of ceasefire with Lebanon. The report said the plan calls for a truce that will initially last a month or two and will see the gradual release of Israeli captives held in Gaza, with first priority given to older captives or those who are sick. Concurrently, 'broader and longer discussions will take place, without military pressure on the ground,' the report added. Egyptian officials will request that Hamas be given a period of several days after the truce begins in order to provide a list of the living hostages. The plan would also see the Rafah Border Crossing between Egypt and Gaza quickly returned to operation, under the supervision of the Palestinian Authority, with Egyptian oversight. ‘Israel’ would be given, according to the report, the right to veto those crossing to Egypt, with Cairo guaranteeing it will secure a Palestinian commitment that Hamas will not be allowed to control either the crossing or the Strip 'during the coming period.' The deal would also see an increase in humanitarian aid for Gaza, and medications would enter the Strip for the hostages that need, Al-Akhbar added. The report also said that ‘Israel’ will initially be permitted to maintain its military positions within Gaza, but without carrying out operations. Israeli media also reported the visit, with Israeli Channel 12 saying a team from the Egyptian intelligence will visit Tel Aviv on Thursday. The Times of Israel also cited Al-Akhbar report, adding that: 'While not mentioned in the report, the potential deal is also assumed to include the release of Palestinian prisoners.' Earlier on Wednesday families of Israeli captives held for over a year in the Gaza Strip temporarily blocked the entrance to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Knesset office, demanding that he meet with them and promote a hostage deal. Relatives of Israeli captives held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip block the entrance to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Knesset office, in occupied Al-Quds (November 27, 2024). The protesters were removed by Knesset security. They then went down one floor and blocked the stairs leading to the faction wing of the building, where the various political parties hold meetings and press conferences Israeli media reported.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280170	2024-11-28T03:27:49-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-07819070017319274025.jpg
Resistance Unbreakable: Imam Khamenei Declares Israel’s Doom, Al-...	The Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, has asserted that the Israeli regime is doomed to perish from the West Asia region. Imam Khamenei stated that the ongoing anti-Israeli operations by regional resistance movements cannot be quelled. 'Al-Aqsa Storm cannot be quenched, and the usurping Zionist regime is destined for departure,' Khamenei's official Persian-language account wrote in a post on Wednesday, accompanied by an illustration of an Israeli tank buried half in the ground with a white flag protruding from its cannon. Leader: Israel destined for departure; al-Aqsa Storm can’t be quenched — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) November 28, 2024 The resistance movements, including Hamas from the Gaza Strip, Islamic Jihad, Lebanon's Hezbollah, and their counterparts in Iraq and Yemen, launched the 'Al-Aqsa Storm' operation last October after the Israeli regime began a genocidal war against the coastal enclave. The operation has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israeli troops and officers, as well as the destruction of a considerable amount of their advanced Western-funded equipment. Hezbollah's successful performance in the operation also forced the regime into approving a ceasefire deal with the movement, ending Tel Aviv's 13-month deadly aggression against Lebanon. In a statement, Hezbollah hailed the operation's success, stating that their fighters 'were able to bring down its (the enemy's) goals and defeat its army.' Hamas also praised Hezbollah's prowess, saying the ceasefire deal had shattered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 'illusion' of reshaping West Asia by force. Khamenei's remarks come after he called for the prosecution of all Israeli political and military officials for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and demanded the death sentence for Netanyahu. Regarding the ceasefire agreement, Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Esmail Baghaei announced that Iran welcomed the cessation of Israeli aggression against Lebanon, reiterating its steadfast support for the Lebanese government, people, and Resistance. Baghaei emphasized Iran's commitment to peace in the region and highlighted its ongoing diplomatic efforts to halt hostilities in Gaza and Lebanon over the past 14 months, which have killed tens of thousands and caused widespread destruction of vital infrastructure. 'The result of the warmongering and crimes committed by the Zionist regime, fully supported by the United States and certain European governments, is the martyrdom of 60,000 innocent people, the wounding of 120,000 individuals, and the displacement of over 3.5 million oppressed people in Palestine and Lebanon,' Baghaei said.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280181	2024-11-28T03:25:49-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-081728400173279314410.jpg
Hochstein: Israeli Buffer Zone in Lebanon 'Fantasy that Won’t Eve...	US special envoy Amos Hochstein dismissed as 'fantasy' the notion that the Zionist entity could have secured a better deal in which it would have been able to maintain a buffer zone inside Lebanon. During a round of interviews hours after the ceasefire came into place, Hochstein was presented with criticism voiced by former prime minister Naftali Bennett, who said the agreement’s lack of planned buffer zone in Lebanon will allow Hezbollah to rebuild homes along the border that the resistance group can use as a staging point for a future invasion of the northern settlements and as launch pads for the many anti-tank missiles. 'Yes, there are fantasy deals that are utopia where you get a ceasefire agreement with a security zone, but those won’t ever happen,' Hochstein responded to Channel 12. The senior adviser to US President Joe Biden maintained that a buffer zone would require ‘Israel’ to remain in Lebanon as an occupying force — something that no sovereign country would accept, Israeli media reported. 'If you choose to have a dead zone or a demilitarized zone, then you are there as an occupier, and you are not there in agreement; which means that while you may have two, three, four or five kilometers inside Lebanon, there won’t be an agreement to stop [Hezbollah from] shooting at Israel from longer ranges,' Hochstein said. Thousands of displaced Lebanese are returning to their homes in the south of the country as the Israel-Lebanon ceasefire agreement takes effect. pic.twitter.com/1eqxWNdGPB — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) November 27, 2024 Asked whether ‘Israel’ should’ve continued in its efforts to degrade Hezbollah militarily following the massive blows, Hochstein told Channel 12, 'At some point, you have to get to a deal itself.' During a briefing with Jewish American community leaders earlier in the day, Hochstein pointed out that the Zionist entity had never established a war aim of fully dismantling Hezbollah. Tel Aviv’s stated goal for the northern front was to allow the tens of thousands of Israelis to return to northern settlements near the Blue Line, which wouldn’t have been possible without a deal, he said. Hochstein was pressed on reports that he had also given ‘Israel’ an 'It’s now or never' ultimatum that ultimately convinced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a deal.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280071	2024-11-28T02:18:05-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-08746960017327885342.jpg
IRGC Chief Hails Lebanon Ceasefire as Strategic, Humiliating Defe...	The chief commander of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) has celebrated the recent ceasefire between Lebanon and ‘Israel’ as a strategic and humiliating defeat for the occupying regime. Major General Hossein Salami, in a message to Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem, congratulated Lebanon and its Hezbollah resistance movement for successfully imposing the ceasefire on Israel. Salami described the truce as a major setback for the Zionist regime, which he said failed to achieve any of its 'evil goals and ambitions' in the conflict with Hezbollah. IRGC chief: Lebanon truce ‘strategic, humiliating defeat’ for Israel — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) November 28, 2024 The IRGC chief noted that Israel's acceptance of the ceasefire, while under a barrage of Hezbollah missiles targeting its bases and strategic sites, held important lessons for Tel Aviv and its supporters. He emphasized that the 'usurping entity is on the decline' and the crimes it has committed in Gaza and Lebanon will only serve to strengthen the resistance. Salami further stated that Hezbollah's victory, secured through the 'pure blood of martyrs, the patience and resilience of the Lebanese people, and the unwavering courage and sacrifices of the youth,' represents a significant development in the Islamic Ummah's struggle against Zionists in the region. 'Undoubtedly, this great victory, which was secured thanks to the pure blood of martyrs, the patience and resilience of the Lebanese people, and the unwavering courage and sacrifices of the youth and Hezbollah, is considered a major development in the history of the Islamic Ummah's struggle against Zionists in West Asia.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2280049	2024-11-28T01:14:39-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/08/manar-05368670017225129456.jpg
Mikati: Return of Displaced Citizens to Southern Villages Demonst...	Caretaker Prime Minister, Najib Mikati, on Wednesday issued a statement following reports of displaced families returning to their homes in various regions of Lebanon, particularly in the south. Mikati emphasized that the sight of these returnees reaffirmed the Lebanese people's attachment to their land, values, and heritage. 'We have been closely monitoring the return of displaced citizens since early this morning, especially in the southern regions. This demonstrates the steadfastness of the Lebanese in holding onto their land and values,' Mikati said. Looking ahead, Mikati expressed confidence that the Lebanese Army's plan to strengthen its presence in the south would enable the gradual return of more displaced citizens to their homes and villages in the coming days. The Prime Minister also urged both returning citizens and those still remaining in their homes to exercise patience and wait for instructions from the Army's leadership to ensure their safety and security. 'We call on all returnees and those who are still steadfast in their homes to refrain from rushing and to follow the guidance of the Army Command for their own safety,' Mikati added. Shortly after the ceasefire with the Israeli enemy took effect in Lebanon on Wednesday, citizens started to return home in their towns and neighborhoods in Bekaa, south Lebanon and Dahiyeh (the southern suburb of Beirut), defying Israeli threats to return, especially to southern villages.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2279862	2024-11-27T14:57:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-04987210017327482264.png
Islamic Resistance Emerged Victorious over Delusional Enemy, Carr...	The Islamic Resistance Operations Room issued on Wednesday a statement which affirmed that, in support of the steadfast Palestinian people as well as their valiant and honorable resistance, and in defense of Lebanon and its resilient people, the Islamic Resistance continues its journey, answering the call of its Secretary-General and supreme martyr, His Eminence Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, may Allah sanctify his soul, and under the banner of his successor, His Eminence Sheikh Naim Qassem, may Allah preserve him. Over more than 13 months, the resistance has maintained its pledge and fight, achieving victory over the delusional enemy that has failed to break its resolve or will, according to the statement which added that it is the battlefield that has spoken, with steadfast fighters relying on Allah to thwart the enemy’s goals, defeat its army, and pen with their blood epics of resilience and defiance during the battles of Al-Aqsa Flood and The Formidable in Might. On this momentous occasion, the Resistance announced the following: - Since the launch of Al-Aqsa Flood operations on October 8, 2023, the Islamic Resistance has conducted more than 4,637 [announced] military operations over 417 days, averaging 11 operations daily. - Since the start of 'Israeli' enemy aggression on Lebanon and the launch of The Formidable in Might operations on September 17, 2024, the resistance has executed 1,666 diverse military operations, averaging 23 operations daily. These targeted 'Israeli' army sites, barracks, bases, cities, and settlements, ranging from the Lebanese-Palestinian border to beyond Tel Aviv. The operations also included heroic confrontations against ground incursions into Lebanese territories. - Within the framework of The Formidable in Might operations, the resistance conducted 105 military operations under the qualitative Khaibar series. These targeted dozens of strategic military and security bases, many for the first time in the enemy's history, employing qualitative ballistic and qualitative missiles and advanced drones, reaching depths of 150 km into occupied Palestinian territory, beyond Tel Aviv. - Cumulative losses inflicted on the 'Israeli' enemy army since its ground advance into Lebanese territories on October 1, 2024, until the issuance of this statement include: - Over 130 soldiers and officers were killed, with more than 1,250 wounded. - Destruction of 59 Merkava tanks, 11 military bulldozers, 2 Hummers, 2 armored vehicles, and 2 personnel carriers. - Downing of 6 Hermes 450 drones, 2 Hermes 900 drones, and one quadcopter glider. It should be noted that these figures do not include losses at military bases, sites, settlements, and occupied cities. The Islamic Resistance Operations Room emphasized the following: - During the 'Israeli' enemy ground operation into Lebanese territories since October 1, 2024, and due to the steadfastness of our fighters, the invading forces failed to occupy or secure any of the first-tier frontline towns—despite continuous aggression since the start of Al-Aqsa Flood. They also failed to establish a military-security buffer zone as they had hoped and were unable to prevent rocket and drone launches into occupied territory. Even on the last day of aggression, our fighters continued targeting the enemy's depth from within border towns. - The second phase of the ground operation was merely a political and media announcement. The enemy failed to advance into second-tier frontline towns, suffering heavy losses in Al-Khiam (which it withdrew from thrice), Ainatha, Tallousa, Bint Jbeil, and Al-Qawzah. The sole attempt to advance into Al-Bayyadah and Shamaa in the western sector turned into a graveyard for the tanks and elite troops of the 'Israeli' enemy army, who were forced to retreat under the resistance's blows. - The resistance's defensive strategy is based on area-specific defense. It has prepared over 300 defensive lines south of the Litani River, each fully equipped in terms of manpower, equipment, and readiness. The outcomes in Al-Bayyadah and Al-Khiam stand as clear proof. - The Islamic Resistance Operations Room reaffirms that its fighters across all military specializations remain fully prepared to confront 'Israeli' enemy ambitions and aggression. Their eyes remain fixed on the movements and withdrawals of enemy forces beyond the borders, with their hands ready on the trigger, in defense of Lebanon's sovereignty and for the honor and dignity of its people. The statement also addressed the Honorable People of the Resistance: O most noble, pure, and honorable of people, our dear and steadfast nation, free sons and daughters of our homeland, who, with your legendary resilience and limitless sacrifices, shattered the enemy’s illusions. Victory, by Allah’s grace, has been the ally of the righteous cause you have embraced and carried, returning to your villages and homes with pride and dignity. You roam the world with triumph, bearing the steadfast and elevated banner, rooted in the battlefield and conscience, a banner that will forever resist oppression and aggression.

US Pressed Netanyahu to Accept Lebanon Ceasefire due to Israeli M...	Member of Hezbollah Central Council, Sheikh Hasan Al-Baghdadi, indicated that the experience with the Americans and the Israelis confirms that they are one party and have one project, which is to plunder wealth, dominate the region, and launch a new Middle East scheme. 'This was clear from the statements of Netanyahu and others, in addition to what America and some of the West did by bringing fleets to isolate Gaza and prevent aid, issuing threats, and inciting against the Islamic Resistance inside Lebanon through its ambassador. The experience of more than a year and two months of aggression against Gaza and Lebanon proves that the Americans were undoubtedly managing and financing the war and did not want to stop it.' His eminence added: 'What happened was due to the huge difference in capabilities between Hezbollah and the resistance in Palestine, which put the temporary entity in the circle of danger. Therefore, the Americans and others began to pressure Netanyahu’s government to stop the war out of fear for them and their certainty that the Israeli army is unable to win, not for the sake of Lebanon, as all the killing and destruction here were by American missiles.' Al-Baghdadi affirmed that the Israeli losses were beyond imagination in various security and economic fields, especially in the military establishment that is on the verge of collapse. 'This is understood from the position of the West, American pressure, the Israeli opposition, mayors and competent authorities in the Zionist settlements, and some hypocritical parties in Lebanon who, like their masters, thought that Hezbollah collapsed after the security strikes, and they do not understand that it is an ideological Party that is not linked to individuals, no matter how high their status is.' Shortly after the ceasefire with the Israeli enemy took effect in Lebanon on Wednesday, citizens started to return home in their towns and neighborhoods in Bekaa, south Lebanon and Dahiyeh (the southern suburb of Beirut), defying Israeli threats to return, especially to southern villages.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2279796	2024-11-27T10:56:05-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-02607140017327337595.jpeg

Lebanese parliament Speaker Nabih Berri called for all displaced people, including those abroad, to return home, few hours after the ceasefire between Lebanon and the Zionist entity took effect at dawn. In a televised speech, Speaker Berri saluted the nation’s martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, whom he said tasked him with the responsibility of the political resistance. 'I call you to come back to your country, come back to your towns and come back to the places where you were born, even if they were in rubble. You should protect the land that saw the blood of all the martyrs,' stated Speaker Berri, who was mandated by Hezbollah to lead negotiations on behalf of Hezbollah and along PM Najib Mikati on behalf of the Lebanese State. 'Come back to your land and bring back life to all the neighborhoods that the Israeli occupation and aggression tried to destroy. The victory of your land relies on you coming back,' he added. Speaker Berri said Lebanon needs 'to elect a president as soon as possible'. 'It should unify all of us. It is a test so that we can protect Lebanon from all the threats including Israeli threats,' the Lebanese Parliament speaker said. 'The only thing which would keep us all together is to protect Lebanon, so we can overcome this challenge and be stronger,' Berri added. 'And also to demonstrate and show to the world that it is a country that can coexist with its different spiritual components, in contradiction with the racism of Israel,' he noted.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2279620	2024-11-27T03:33:32-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-07687950017327071093.jpg
Gaza’s Islamic Jihad Vows Unity with Hezbollah Until Victory	The secretary-general of the Gaza-based Palestinian resistance movement Islamic Jihad has pledged continued unity with its Lebanese counterpart, Hezbollah, until victory is achieved. In a message to Hezbollah's deputy secretary-general, Sheikh Naim Qassem, Ziad Nakhala declared, 'We will stay united as one front and one Resistance, until victory.' The Palestinian official further commended regional resistance movements for their valiant and successful struggle in the face of the Israeli regime and its allies. 'From Palestine to Lebanon, from the courageous Gaza to the resilient suburbs of Beirut, and from the heroic Palestinian fighters to the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon, we commend your unwavering steadfastness and strength,' he wrote. 'Despite the wounds and the relentless onslaught of enemies, led by the US and its allies, you continue to uphold the banner of resistance with pride and dignity.' Nakhala recalled how the resistance groups had rushed to Palestinians’ defense and support, 'offering your valuable lives, while others were unable to provide even basic relief to the thirsty and hungry people of Palestine.' The comments concerned hundreds of successful retaliatory operations that the movements have been carrying out against the occupied Palestinian territories since last October, when the Israeli regime began bringing the Gaza Strip under a genocidal war. The remarks come after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a ceasefire deal, following a deadly Israeli aggression on Gaza and Lebanon that claimed over 3,700 lives. Hezbollah has responded with hundreds of successful retaliatory strikes, which observers believe forced Israel's hand in accepting the ceasefire. Nakhala praised the resistance movements for rushing to the defense of Palestinians, 'offering your valuable lives, while others were unable to provide even basic relief to the thirsty and hungry people of Palestine.' He expressed confidence that the united front of resistance will continue to 'uphold the banner of resistance with pride and dignity' until victory is achieved.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2279521	2024-11-27T02:26:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/11/manar-09077080017008254086.jpeg

Shortly after the ceasefire with the Israeli enemy took effect in Lebanon on Wednesday, citizens started to return home in their towns and neighborhoods in Bekaa, south Lebanon and Dahiyeh (the southern suburb of Beirut), defying Israeli threats to return, especially to southern villages. Israeli occupation army warned soon after the ceasefire began at 4:00 at dawn that residents of south Lebanon should not approach enemy army positions and villages its forces had ordered to be evacuated. 'With the entry into force of the ceasefire agreement and based on its provisions, the IDF remains deployed in its positions inside southern Lebanon,' enemy army spokesman Avichay Adraee said in a post on X, referring to the Israeli occupation forces. 'You are prohibited from heading towards the villages that the IDF has ordered to be evacuated or towards IDF forces in the area.' However, photos and videos circulated on social media showed streams of cars carrying displaced people heading for southern villages, as the citizens couldn’t wait more to go to their hometowns after 65 days of brutal Israeli aggression that started on September 23. توثيق لزحمة السير.. النازحون يعودون إلى قراهم في الجنوب.#وقائع pic.twitter.com/XqouGZS10C — وقائع (@waqa2e3) November 27, 2024 The hours before the truce took effect were some of the most violent in the war, with the Israeli enemy staging violent raids on the capital Beirut, Dahiyeh, Bekaa and southern Lebanon.

Netanyahu Indirectly Acknowledges Failure of War on Lebanon: We N...	After around two months of war on Lebanon, the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Tel Aviv would approve an indirect ceasefire deal with Lebanon mediated by the United States and France. In a press conference on Tuesday evening, Netanyau claimed that the Israeli approval of the ceasefire came in order to concentrate on the 'Iranian threat', reactivate the army, overcome the restrictions imposed on the arms supplies to 'Israel', and separating the Lebanese and Gaza fronts in order to isolate Hamas were behind the Zionist decision to accept the ceasefire. In an attempt to justify the decision before the Israelis, Netanyahu said that the occupation army would attack whenever it detects violation of the deal, alleging that 'Israel' would prevent Hezbollah from rearming. The Israeli Channel 13 conducted a poll which showed that 61% of the Zionists believe that 'Israel' did not win the war. Netanyahu also faces a harsh criticism from the residents of the northern settlements over the agreement, amid assertions that the displaced settlers would not return home in light of the outcome of the ongoing confrontation. In this regard, the former minister Avigdor Lieberman said that none can prevent Hezbollah from rearming, calling on the displaced settlers to avoid returning to the 'North'.

The Israeli air raids also targeted Sultan Ibrahim area in Beirut in addition to numerous residential buildings in Beirut's Dahiyeh. The Zionist insanity was also reflected in targeting a house in Qobayat, Akkar. Sidon and Tyre received their portions from the Israeli grudge with air raid which also targeted towns in South Lebanon, including Khiam on the borders.

Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance demonstrated its might to protect Lebanon's people and territory from the Israeli occupation's continuous aggression. Through meticulous strikes on crucial Israeli positions, extending from the southern borders into occupied areas, the Resistance successfully halted Israeli attempts to advance into border villages and disrupted any major incursions. Notably, Israeli forces were compelled to retreat under the pressure of resistance attacks from Shama and Tayr Harfa, retreating towards Alma Al-Shab, near the occupied Palestinian border.

The suffering of Palestinians has been further compounded by the severe cold and heavy rainfall in the Gaza Strip. Seawater has swept through the tents of the displaced people set up on the shore of Mawasi Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip, while rainwater has flooded the tents in various northern, central, and southern areas. The Danish Refugee Council has warned that the remnants of Israeli munitions, both exploded and unexploded, pose a long-term threat to Gaza residents, who are at risk of injury and death as they search for basic necessities among the rubble. The report states that only 19 percent of victims of these explosive weapons receive first aid, and children are particularly vulnerable to mistaking them for toys or junk. في يومها الـ 417.. أبرز تطورات الإبادة الجماعية الإسرائيلية في غزة اقرأ المزيد عبر المركز الفلسطيني للإعلام: — المركز الفلسطيني للإعلام (@PalinfoAr) November 26, 2024 With American support, Israel has been waging a war on Gaza since October 7, 2023, leaving about 149,000 Palestinian martyrs and wounded, most of them children and women, and more than 10,000 missing, amid massive destruction and famine that killed dozens of children and the elderly, in one of the worst humanitarian disasters in the world.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2278267	2024-11-26T03:30:55-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/09/manar-05594880017260474442.jpg

Hezbollah Deals Heavy Blows to Israeli Forces, Crushes Incursion ...	Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance showcased its unwavering resolve to defend its people and land against the Israeli enemy's relentless aggression, executing 51 operations on Sunday—the highest in a single day since the aggression on Lebanon began. These strikes targeted key Israeli positions, from the southern borders to deep within occupied territories, halting attempted advances into border villages and thwarting any significant incursion. Among the highlights was a devastating blow in Al-Bayada, where eight Merkava tanks were destroyed within 48 hours; their burned remains a testament to the resistance's strength and precision. Hezbollah's military media released a series of statements detailing the attacks and their outcomes: The initial statement indicated that at 8:45 AM on Monday, November 25, 2024, Islamic Resistance fighters targeted the Shraga base (the administrative headquarters of the Golani Brigade command) north of the occupied city of Acre with a barrage of rockets.

Imam Khamenei Calls for Netanyahu’s Execution	Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, the leader of Iran's Islamic Revolution, has demanded that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be sentenced to death, dismissing the International Criminal Court's (ICC) recently issued arrest warrant as an inadequate response to Netanyahu's war crimes in Gaza and Lebanon. Ayatollah Khamenei Urges Capital Punishment for Netanyahu pic.twitter.com/fWnXiKV3DC — Tasnim News Agency (@Tasnimnews_EN) November 25, 2024 'The (ICC) arrest warrant is not enough, Netanyahu's death sentence must be ordered,' Imam Khamenei said during a meeting with members of the Iranian Basij volunteer force on Monday, as part of Basij Week celebrations. The ICC has issued arrest warrants against Netanyahu and his former defense minister Yoav Gallant for their roles in the ongoing genocide in Gaza and atrocities committed in Lebanon. The warrants mean the two Israeli leaders risk arrest if they travel to any of the 124 countries that have signed the Rome Statute establishing the ICC. Condemning Israel's aggression in Gaza and Lebanon, Imam Khamenei dismissed the bombing of civilian homes as a crime rather than a victory. The Leader asserted that ‘Israel’ has failed to win its wars in these regions and will never succeed. The Leader noted that Imam Khomeini, founder of the Islamic Revolution, created Basij volunteer force as a 'bulwark' against threats. Basiji is not intimidated by the US and Israeli propaganda, he asserted, adding that some of the prominent Iranian scientists, who were assassinated by the enemy, were members of the volunteer force. Imam Khamenei further said that Basij will definitely destroy the Zionist regime. Basij, he emphasized, should strengthen, expand and maintain preparedness. The leader said the United States' ideal for the region is either submission or chaos, urging the force to counter US duality of dictator ship and anarchy. Additionally in his remarks, the Leader praised Basij’s successes in foiling enemies’ plots against the Islamic Revolution. Imam Khamenei touched on a deal around 15 years ago, when the US 'vowed' to deliver uranium with 20 percent purity to Iran to be used for radio pharmaceuticals in return for taking all of the country's 3.5 percent uranium. 'The Americans were cheating, we realized that they were cheating. It (the deal) was stopped,' the Leader said.'Those who disrupted the US's evil conspiracy in the case of 20 percent enriched uranium, which was needed by the country, were Basij members.' 'At the same time, Iran’s Basiji professors managed to produce the 20 percent enriched uranium inside the country. Americans could not believe this would happen,' the Leader added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2277596	2024-11-25T04:05:35-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-08656070017325363297.jpg

Later that same day, the group claimed responsibility for another drone attack on a 'military target' in the south. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq said the attacks were carried out 'in support of our people in Palestine and Lebanon' and in response to Israel's massacres against civilians, including women, children and the elderly. The resistance vowed to continue striking Israeli sites at an 'increasing pace', stating the operations were a reaction to Israel's ongoing aggression. Since the start of Israel's aggression on Gaza last October, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has conducted similar attacks against sensitive targets across the occupied territories. This latest barrage comes amid a broader escalation, as Hezbollah in Lebanon has also retaliated against Israeli strikes.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2277541	2024-11-25T02:10:33-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-00502260017314075886.jpg

The Israeli occupation's genocidal campaign in the Gaza Strip has reached a grim milestone, as the Israeli aggression entered its 415th day.

Body of Missing Zionist rabbi Found in UAE	The Israeli enemy entity officially announced today, Sunday, that the body of Rabbi Zvi Kogan, who has been missing since Thursday in the United Arab Emirates, was found. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the entity's Foreign Ministry said in a joint statement, 'The intelligence and security authorities in the UAE have found the body of Zvi Kogan, who has been missing since Thursday.' The statement described Kogan's killing as 'a heinous anti-Semitic terrorist act,' according to its expression, noting that the temporary entity will do its utmost 'until justice is served against the criminals responsible for his killing.' There was no immediate comment from the Emirati authorities on the Israeli announcement of the rabbi's death. It is noteworthy that Zvi Kogan is one of the representatives of the Jewish 'Chabad' movement in the Emirates and holds Moldovan citizenship in addition to Israeli citizenship. According to the Israeli newspaper 'Yedioth Ahronoth', Kogan (28 years old) was officially residing in the Emirates as an assistant to the Chief Rabbi of Abu Dhabi. The Chabad organization, which 'does not believe in the right of the Palestinians to exist,' calls for their expulsion from occupied Palestine, and 'opposes any agreement that would give them part of the land,' at a time when the Palestinians have the right to all of Palestine, not just part of it.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2276683	2024-11-24T02:57:48-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-061088300173244586310.jpg
Jordan Security Forces Kill Man Who Opened Fire Near Israeli Emba...	Tensions escalated near the Israeli embassy in Jordan's capital city of Amman on Sunday, as a gunman opened fire on security personnel, leading to a deadly confrontation. According to the Jordanian Public Security, the incident occurred in the Rabieh area of Amman. The gunman reportedly opened fire on a police patrol, prompting a security team to respond. In the ensuing clash, the shooter was pursued and surrounded, at which point he opened fire on the security forces. Authorities say the security team then 'applied the rules of engagement,' resulting in the gunman's death. The attack left 3 police officers injured. Jordanian officials have not released the identity of the shooter or provided details on a possible motive. Earlier reports from Israeli media had indicated a security incident near the Israeli embassy in Amman, with the gunman firing towards the embassy premises for several minutes. A heavy security presence was deployed to the area around the embassy following the sound of gunfire.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2276540	2024-11-24T01:16:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-00931000017324397837.jpg
Hamas Announces Death of Female Captive in Israeli Bombardment of...	Military spokesperson for Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas Resistance Movement, announced the death of one more captive in the Zionist aggression of the various zones of Gaza. After re-establishing contact with fighters assigned to protect Israeli enemy captives, it was revealed that one of the enemy’s female captives was killed in an area under heavy Israeli aggression in the northern Gaza Strip, Abu Ubaida said. Meanwhile, another female captive remains in grave danger, he added. Abu Ubaida affirmed that the war criminal Netanyahu, his government, and the leaders of his army bear full responsibility for the lives of their captives, as they persist in causing their suffering and deaths. The enemy must prepare to deal with the issue of the disappearance of the bodies of their fallen soldiers due to widespread destruction and the martyrdom of some of the captors, Abu Ubaida warned. Al-Qassam Brigades posted a photo which shows body of the dead captive with a caption that reads, 'A new victim of Netanyahu and Halevi.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2276287	2024-11-23T13:54:55-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/11/manar-095946600169999520110.jpg
Merkava Tanks Couldn’t Reach Quarter of Distance Crossed in 2006:...	TV channels, newspapers, politicians, journalists, analysts, and social media accounts are all involved in providing an instant media coverage for the ongoing military confrontation between Hezbollah and the Israeli occupation army in accordance with the adopted values, principles and political affiliations. The military confrontation with the Zionist enemy is accompanied by a hostile propaganda aimed supporting the goals of Israeli war on Lebanon. What must be completely condemned is the distortion of reality in an attempt to prove an untrue idea or figure. It is totally immoral, for example, to claim that the enemy controlled a certain town while the clashes are still ongoing in its vicinity. Since the beginning of the Israeli ground invasion of South Lebanon, the hostile media tried its best to magnify the Israeli aggression 'achievements' and trivialize the Resistance feats. A very sharp and clear example, in this regard, can be the promotion of the idea that the Israeli ground progress is much faster than that which was in 2006 in order to solidify the claim that Hezbollah in 2024 is weaker than it was in 2006. A factual comparison between the Zionist ground invasion in 2024 and that in 2006 shows that - the Israeli Merkava tanks reached in 30 days Ghandouriyeh (landing) and Wadi Al Houjeir Reserve, which lie around 10 kilometers away from the Lebanese Palestinian borders in 2006. - the Israeli Merkava tanks failed in around 55 days to cross Deir Mimas which lies around one kilometer away from the Lebanese Palestinian borders in 2024. A map shows the difference between the ground invasion in 2024 and that in 2006 Another clear example can be that, in 2006, the Merkava tanks reached Al-Bayada and even the outskirts of Al-Mansouri in Tyre district. Whereas, in 2024, the enemy vehicles reached only the outskirts of Shamaa and Al-Bayada. These are mere instances to say that the Islamic Resistance fighters are bravely fighting to defend the South Lebanon town, including Khiam and Bint Jbeil, and that the pace of the Israeli ground advance is not at all faster than that in 2006, yet even much slower. Thus, those who are promoting the Israeli ground advance must hold on and wait for the consequences of the battle which will gradually appear.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2276089	2024-11-23T10:59:13-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-02851670017323882094.png
Hezbollah Fighters Frustrate Israeli Advance Schemes in South Leb...	The Islamic Resistance fighters continued on Saturday, November 23, 2024, confronting the barbaric Israeli war on Lebanon, showing unprecedented bravery in the ground fight against the enemy troops attempting to control towns in the South. More than 51 Merkava tanks have been destroyed by Hezbollah fighters who audaciously repelled the Zionist ground advance into the towns of Khiam, Deir Mimas and Al-Bayada. It is worth noting that the Israeli ground invasion of South Lebanon has taken the form of incursion lines which do not grant the enemy forces the capability of controlling any of the villages in South Lebanon.

No Hezbollah Figure Targeted in Beirut Strike: Lawmaker	Member of Hezbollah’s Loyalty to Resistance bloc MP Amin Sherri firmly denied on Saturday that the Israeli strike on Beirut’s Al-Basta targeted a Hezbollah figure, noting that the brutal attack which killed or injured dozens in the Lebanese capital is only aimed at terrifying the Lebanese citizens. As he visited the scene of the Israeli strike, MP Sherri said: 'This is the eighth attack on Beirut (since the start of the war on September 23). No military target was hit in all of these attacks.' 'Neither a military figure nor an individual who is affiliated with any political party was targeted in any of the two destroyed buildings,' the lawmaker affirmed. ⚡Lebanese MP Amin Sherri from Basta: There is no Hezbollah figure in the targeted building #Iraq #Syria #Hezbollah #Beirut #Lebanon #Israel #TelAviv #Gaza #Yemen #Iran #Tehran #IRGC pic.twitter.com/B1jLCfOdhe — War Analysis (@iiamguri9) November 23, 2024 He saluted the people who have been displaced from the unsafe regions across Lebanon to the capital Beirut. 'These attacks will never break the will of our people,' MP Sherri stressed. He noted, meanwhile, that the real confrontation is in south Lebanon, with the resistance fighters, rather than the systematic killings of civilians.

Iran to Launch New Advanced Centrifuges: AEOI	Spokesman of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) Behrouz Kamalvandi said that the organization plans to activate a series of new and advanced centrifuges in response to the IAEA politically-motivated resolution. The International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors on Thursday voted 19 to 3, with 12 abstentions, for the resolution, brought by the UK, France, and Germany (E3), that accused the Islamic Republic of poor cooperation with the agency. Speaking in a televised interview on Friday, Kamalvandi said that after the resolution was issued, the AEOI immediately started its remedial measures. 'We will significantly increase the enrichment capacity with different kinds of advanced machines,' he said, naming the increase in the speed of industrial research and development as another measure that would be taken by Iran in response to the resolution. He further stressed that after the resolution was issued, the President and the AEOI chief issued the necessary orders, and the process started that night. 'Soon, the IAEA will surely provide its reports and it will be clear that what they did led to the increase of Iran's nuclear industry capacity in various fields,' he added. The AEOI official said that the IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi was informed during his visit to Iran that Tehran is seeking interaction but if the IAEA wants to adopt other methods, the Islamic Republic is also ready to act accordingly. Iran has announced it has launched new advanced centrifuges after the E3-US drafted resolution was passed at the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors (IAEA BoG) on Thursday night. In a joint statement, the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) and the Iranian Foreign Ministry condemned the passing of the resolution as a politically motivated, unrealistic, and counterproductive move.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2275869	2024-11-23T05:32:06-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/04/manar-04755240016178797859.jpg

Putin Says Oreshnik Missile System Cutting-edge Innovation by Rus...	Russia’s Oreshnik hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile system is not an upgraded version of previous versions dating back from the Soviet times, and it is in the line of the latest and modern developments, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday. 'The Oreshnik system has nothing to do with the modernization of the old Soviet systems,' Putin said. 'It is obvious that we were all raised watching various systems of the Soviet Union operating, we were all brought up on what was done by previous generations, and to a certain extent we used their results,' Putin said. 'However, this system is indeed the prime result of your work, the work that was done in Russian times, under the conditions of the new Russia, it was waged on the basis of modern, latest developments,' Putin said addressing the meeting with the Defense Ministry executive board, representatives of the military-industrial complex and missile weapon designers. The Russian Defense Ministry announced earlier in the day that the country’s latest Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile hit all the targets at a major Ukrainian military-industrial enterprise in Dnepr (Dnepropetrovsk) with its MIRVed warheads. 'On November 21, 2024, in response to the use of American-and British-made long-range missiles against facilities on Russian territory, the Armed Forces delivered a combined strike on one of the Ukrainian military-industrial sites in Dnepropetrovsk. For the first time, the Oreshnik hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile with a non-nuclear payload was employed in combat conditions in the strike. The goal of the strike was achieved. All the warheads hit the facility,' the ministry said in a statement. On November 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree approving the Foundations of State Policy in the Field of Nuclear Deterrence, the country’s updated nuclear doctrine. The fundamental principle of the doctrine is that the use of nuclear weapons is a measure of last resort to protect the country’s sovereignty. The emergence of new military threats and risks prompted Russia to clarify the conditions for the use of nuclear weapons. In particular, the amended doctrine expands the range of countries and military alliances subject to nuclear deterrence, as well as the list of military threats that such deterrence is designed to counter. In addition, the document states that Russia will now view any attack by a non-nuclear country supported by a nuclear power as a joint attack. Moscow also reserves the right to consider a nuclear response to a conventional weapons attack threatening its sovereignty, a large-scale launch of enemy aircraft, missiles, and drones targeting Russian territory, their crossing of the Russian border, and an attack on its ally Belarus.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2275176	2024-11-22T11:52:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-09745410017323051094.jpg

Iran Hails ICC Warrant for Netanyahu as ‘Political Death’ of ‘Isr...	The Commander of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps, General Hossein Salami, has welcomed the International Criminal Court's (ICC) arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Security Minister Yoav Gallant, describing the move as marking the 'end and political death' of 'Israel.' Salami declared in a speech aired on Iranian state television that the ICC's decision signifies 'the end and political death of the Zionist regime, a regime that today lives in absolute political isolation in the world, and its officials can no longer travel to other countries.' IRGC chief urges Muslim countries to cut aid routes to Israel — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) November 22, 2024 The Iranian commander characterized the warrants as a 'great victory for the Palestinian and Lebanese resistance movements' and a pivotal step in holding the Israeli occupation accountable for its actions, particularly the ongoing genocide in Gaza. In contrast, Netanyahu and his allies have dismissed the ICC's move as politically motivated and antisemitic, with the Israeli president accusing the court of undermining justice and siding with 'terrorism and evil.' The United States, Israel's closest ally, has also criticized the ICC's decision. The warrants, which theoretically restrict Netanyahu's international travel, come as the death toll from the Israeli war against Gaza surpasses 44,000 martyrs over 412 days.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2274923	2024-11-22T06:37:50-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/12/manar-067219500170375961910.jpg
Iran Activates Advanced Centrifuges in Retaliation of IAEA Resolu...	Iran has denounced a United Nations nuclear watchdog resolution as 'unjustifiable' and initiated the operation of advanced centrifuges in reciprocal response. Iran's Foreign Ministry and the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) issued a joint statement early Friday, announcing the activation of 'a substantial number of advanced centrifuges of various models.' The statement emphasized that the move is a defensive measure to protect Iran's national interests and address its increasing need for a civilian nuclear program, in line with its obligations under the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement. 📌 Joint Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Regarding the Unjust Resolution Adopted by the IAEA Board of Governors on Iran’s Peaceful Nuclear Program In the final hours of the #IAEA Board of Governors meeting on 21 Nov 2024, a… pic.twitter.com/XjM5Up5eLs — Foreign Ministry, Islamic Republic of Iran 🇮🇷 (@IRIMFA_EN) November 22, 2024 The action follows a resolution passed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors, which accused Tehran of inadequate cooperation and called for a 'comprehensive' report on its nuclear activities by spring 2025. The resolution passed with 19 votes in favor, three against, and 12 abstentions. IAEA Director General @rafaelmgrossi briefed the Board of Governors on his high-level meetings in Tehran last week, describing his discussions with the new government as constructive. Nevertheless, he pointed out, there were ongoing concerns. Read more: pic.twitter.com/Jt4uIzucsJ — IAEA - International Atomic Energy Agency ⚛️ (@iaeaorg) November 22, 2024 Iran described the resolution as a 'non-consensus' measure driven by the 'pressure and insistence' of the US, UK, France and Germany, despite lacking support from nearly half of the 35-member Board of Governors. 'The actions of the three European nations and the United States—countries with a documented history of reneging on their commitments, including under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and resorting to unlawful sanctions and pressures against the Iranian nation—are both confrontational and unjustifiable,' the statement read. It criticized the resolution as 'politically motivated' and warned it undermines the constructive atmosphere fostered during IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi's recent visit to Tehran. 'This politicized and destructive measure undermines the positive momentum achieved between Iran and the Agency and blatantly contradicts the professed commitment of the three European nations and the United States to preserving the integrity and impartiality of the IAEA. It lays bare their use of the nuclear issue as a pretext to advance illegitimate objectives,' the statement added. Despite its condemnation of the resolution, Iran reaffirmed its commitment to cooperating with the IAEA within the framework of the Safeguards Agreement. 'The principled policy of the I.R. of Iran has consistently been to engage constructively with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) within the framework of rights and obligations enshrined in the Treaty on the NPT and the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement,' it said. Iran signed the JCPOA in 2015, proving the peaceful intent of its nuclear program to six world powers. However, the deal has been in jeopardy since the United States unilaterally withdrew in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. In response to unmet commitments by other signatories, Iran began rolling back its JCPOA obligations in 2019.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2274835	2024-11-22T05:50:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2021/06/manar-02354790016244400227.jpg
