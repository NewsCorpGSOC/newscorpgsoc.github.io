Hezbollah Military Command Announces Moving to an Escalated Phase...	The Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance issued early Friday a statement to announce the escalation of the military confrontation with the Zionist enemy. The statement indicated that the Islamic Resistance has continued to confront the Israeli aggression against Lebanon, inflicting heavy losses on the Israeli enemy army in terms of personnel and equipment, along the front lines in southern Lebanon, extending to their positions deep within occupied Palestine. Since the beginning of ground operations near the Lebanese-Palestinian border, the Israeli enemy has deployed five military divisions comprising over 70,000 officers and soldiers, along with hundreds of tanks and military vehicles. In contrast, hundreds of fighters from the Islamic Resistance have been fully prepared to counter any Israeli ground incursion into southern Lebanese villages. The statement explained the feats of the each unit of the Islamic Resistance: 1. Ground Engagements: The beginning of this week witnessed an escalation in the heroic confrontations between the fighters of the Islamic Resistance and the 'Israeli' enemy's officers and soldiers advancing through several routes in the eastern and western sectors towards the villages of Al-Odaisseh, Rab El Thalathin, Blida, Markaba, Al-Qawzah, Aita al-Shaab, and Ramya, under heavy artillery and air cover targeting the mentioned villages and their surroundings. According to pre-prepared field plans, the fighters of the Islamic Resistance engaged the enemy forces in and around some villages by targeting their advance routes and luring them into ambushes within some border villages. Violent clashes took place with the enemy at close range, especially in the towns of Al-Qawzah and Rab El Thalathin, resulting in 10 enemy fatalities and over 150 injuries, as well as the destruction of 9 'Merkava' tanks and 4 military bulldozers. 2. Rocket Force: The rocket force of the Islamic Resistance continues to escalate day by day, targeting 'Israeli' enemy concentrations in military sites and barracks along the Lebanese-Palestinian border, as well as settlements and cities in the north, reaching their military bases deep within occupied Palestine, using various types of missiles, including precision-guided ones that are being deployed for the first time. 3. Air Force: The air force of the Islamic Resistance continues to escalate day by day, targeting enemy military bases from the Lebanese-Palestinian border to deep within occupied Palestine, utilizing various types of attack drones, including advanced ones being used for the first time, in addition to reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering missions. 4. Air Defense Unit: Fighters of the Islamic Resistance in the air defense unit have successfully engaged 'Israeli' military aircraft that violate Lebanese airspace, both reconnaissance and combat. They managed to shoot down two reconnaissance aircraft of the type 'Hermes 450.' 'According to observations from the fighters of the Islamic Resistance, the enemy's losses have reached approximately 55 deaths and over 500 injuries among Israeli officers and soldiers, in addition to the destruction of 20 Merkava tanks, 4 military bulldozers, an armored vehicle, and a troop carrier, along with the downing of two 'Hermes 450&#8243; drones.' This tally does not include the losses of the Israeli enemy in military bases and barracks along the Lebanese-Palestinian border extending into occupied Palestine, according to the statement. Based on the directives of the Resistance Command, the Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance announces a transition to a new and escalatory phase in the confrontation with the Israeli enemy, which will be reflected in the developments and events of the coming days.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2235642	2024-10-17T14:54:45-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-02707250017292020287.png
Israeli Enemy Commits Massacre in Jabalia, Continues Besieging No...	The Zionist occupation forces continued, for the 13th consecutive day, the bloody aggression on northern Gaza, amidst an escalation of bombardment, killing, destruction, and attempts to displace residents and empty the governorate of its inhabitants. The occupation forces committed on Thursday a massacre in Jabalia, north of the Gaza Strip, where they targeted a school housing displaced people, which led to the martyrdom of at least 25 of them, and the injury of at least 150 of others, most of whom were women and children. The occupation aircraft bombed the 'Abu Hussein Elementary School' affiliated with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), and fires broke out in the tents of the displaced within the school campus as a result of the occupation bombing. Some of the martyrs and wounded were transferred to Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda hospitals in the northern Gaza Strip, as the ambulance crews were unable to reach the rest in the targeted school, and the hospitals in the northern Gaza Strip were unable to provide services to the wounded in light of the strict siege imposed by the occupation. The occupation forces have continued their ground, maritime and aerial aggression on the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, which has resulted in the martyrdom of 42,438 citizens and the injury of 99,246 others, the majority of whom are children and women according to an incomplete toll, as thousands of missing people are still under the rubble. Hamas Movement denounced in a statement, Jabalia massacre, holding the Zionist enemy accountable for its consequences. In turn, Al-Qassam Brigades released a video which shows its fighters detonating a tunnel opening against an Israeli engineering force on October 17, 2024.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2235543	2024-10-17T13:51:32-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04607990017291978246.jpg
Houthi: None Excluded from US-Israeli 'New Middle East' Scheme	Head of Yemen’s Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Al-Houthi stressed on Thursday that the Israeli enemy is committing crimes against Lebanon similar to those it has been committing Gaza for more than one year. In a televised speech, Sayyed Houthi indicated that Muslims, in particular, and humanity in general, need to reach a high level of awareness about the reality of what is happening and what the enemies are aiming for. 'Arabs, as the primary targets, must be especially aware of the enemies' intentions.' Houthi added that the horrific crimes committed by the 'Israeli' enemy, along with the accompanying international and regional positions, should create a heightened level of awareness and insight. The U.S. is a partner in every sense of the word in the crimes and tyranny of the 'Israeli' enemy, he noted. 'Without American support and partnership, the Israeli enemy would not have been able to sustain its aggression for this long and at this intensity. Both the American and Israeli agendas aim to achieve a common goal, with similar backgrounds and beliefs, and a unified vision regarding the Arabs.' The American goal is to empower the 'Israeli' enemy to control the region directly or politically and economically, fully dominating it, Houthi said, adding that the objective is to keep the peoples of our nation without freedom, independence, or dignity, denying them the right to an independent civilization based on their religion and Islamic identity. 'It has become clear to all that neither the United Nations nor the Security Council nor international organizations or courts can counter the threat of the enemy except through the awakening of the nation itself.' Houthi underlined the 'fruits of steadfastness among the fighters in Gaza and Lebanon, who continue to inflict damage on the enemy despite the immense betrayal and complicity of some in the Arab and Islamic circles'. According to the Yemeni leader, the Israeli enemy resorts to mass killings and assassinations when it fails in the battlefield. 'The Israeli enemy poses a real threat to Lebanon since the establishment of the occupation entity. The brave fighters of Hezbollah and their supporters played a pivotal role in expelling the Israeli enemy from Lebanon.' Houthi addressed those who think they are safe from the enemy: 'No one in this entire region is safe from Israeli conspiracies.' 'The ambitions and goals of the Israelis are clear, and when the criminal Netanyahu speaks of changing the Middle East, he is targeting you as well.' Houthi underscored that the Yemeni fight would continue, and the number of targeted Israeli-US-UK ships has reached 196. 'Support continues with rockets and drones to occupied Palestine, and operations this week were carried out using 25 ballistic and cruise missiles as well as drones.' Houthi called upon the Yemenis to participate tomorrow in a million-man march in honor of fight for the sake of Allah and in support of the Palestinian and Lebanese people in the capital, Sanaa, and other governorates. The US and the UK carried out a series of air strikes on Yemen late on Wednesday, in a new aggression on the Arab impoverished country over its stance in support of the oppressed people of Gaza.

Hezbollah Fighters Turned the Tables on Netanyahu: MP	Member of the Loyalty to the Resistance parliamentary bloc, Hasan Fadlallah, asserted that the Israeli enemy has failed to achieve its objectives of repopulating the north with settlers and displacing resistance fighters, as the Islamic Resistance fighters on the ground have turned the tables on Netanyahu. In a press conference held at the Lebanese parliament on Thursday, MP Fadlallah addressed the ongoing Israeli aggression on the country, noting that despite the extensive airstrikes, the occupation has not been able to capture any villages. He underscored that 'the resistance on the ground knows how to confront the enemy effectively,' stating that 'the matter of a ceasefire is in the hands of Speaker of the House Nabih Berri, in collaboration with caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati.' Speaking of Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's foolish idea of the so-called 'new Middle East,' Hezbollah MP said that 'the image that Netanyahu painted for his project is changing; what he thought would be a swift victory to eliminate Hezbollah and restructure Lebanon and the region has turned out to be the rashness of an arrogant leader.' 'Netanyahu believed that by assassinating our leader and his fellow martyrs and committing horrific massacres against our people, he could fully achieve his objectives. However, the brave resistance fighters along the border reversed the narrative and entered a new phase dedicated to confronting the aggression against Lebanon and defending the nation,' Fadlallah added. Hezbollah's Fadlallah stated that 'the Israeli occupation has adopted a scorched-earth policy, systematically destroying villages and towns, particularly in the south along the border, to implement its long-standing project of establishing what it calls a 'buffer zone'. 'This plan began in 1978 and culminated in the 2006 war, aiming to make the area south of the Litani River part of its entity, as openly stated by some of its officials. However, the strength of the resistance fighters and the resilience of our people will undoubtedly thwart it,' Fadlallah affirmed. Hezbollah MP Hasan Fadlallah stated that efforts are being extended on three main fronts: 'First, on the battlefield, where brave fighters have successfully maintained control and are determined to prevent the Israeli enemy from achieving its declared objectives, such as repopulating the north and occupying southern Lebanon.' 'Despite heavy Israeli strikes and the deployment of elite troops, resistance fighters—many of whom are from local villages—defend their land with remarkable courage. Thousands of fighters stand ready to join the front lines, eager to fulfill the late leader’s wish to destroy the enemy forces in the south,' Fadlallah said. Regarding the political front, MP Fadlallah mentioned that Speaker Nabih Berri and the Lebanese government have been negotiating with international envoys since the establishment of the support front a year ago to reach a ceasefire. They are currently focused on achieving a ceasefire, with close coordination between Hezbollah leadership and Speaker Berri’s office. However, Fadlallah declared that 'details of these negotiations remain confidential.' Concerning displacement, Fadlallah stated that 'Hezbollah and the Amal Movement are maximizing their efforts to alleviate the suffering of displaced people while appreciating the national unity and various initiatives aimed at managing the crisis.' 'Both groups emphasize the need for humanitarian cooperation and assert that the reconstruction efforts are in trustworthy hands. The return of displaced individuals to their homes, from the southern border to the Bekaa Valley and the Dahiyeh, remains a solemn promise from the resistance to their steadfast people,' Fadlallah stressed. MP Hasan Fadlallah concluded by addressing the steadfast Lebanese families, saying: 'You pay a heavy price in blood to defend our land, dignity, and sovereignty. To the families of martyrs and the wounded, your sacrifices purify our homeland and pave the way for a future of freedom. To the brave men along the borders, you protect our people's dignity against enemy fire.' 'This is your destined day to honor Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah’s legacy by defending Lebanon’s honor and safeguarding its land,' Fadlallah said.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2235136	2024-10-17T06:36:53-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-06043330017291721311.jpg
Day 25 of Israeli Aggression on Lebanon: Zionist Enemy Intensifie...	The Israeli occupation's assault on Lebanon entered its 25th day, following a bloody night for Israeli forces at the Aita Al-Shaab-Al-Qouzah-Ramiyeh triangle. Resistance fighters fiercely repelled the occupation’s attempt to capture Al-Karmel Hill in Al-Qouzah. The Israeli military, still withholding details about the 'severe incident' in the north, responded with heavy air and artillery strikes to cover up its substantial losses. These same brutal tactics are repeatedly used against Lebanese civilians, destroying homes and livelihoods under the guise of targeting resistance positions, underscoring the cowardly and imbalanced nature of the conflict. Amid this ongoing aggression, Lebanon’s Ministry of Health announced on Wednesday that 17 people had been martyred and 182 wounded in the last 24 hours alone, raising the total toll since the start of the conflict on October 8, 2023, to 2,367 martyrs and 11,106 injured.

Day 24 of Israeli Aggression in Lebanon: Relentless Bloodshed, De...	The Israeli brutal aggression against Lebanon persists for the 24th consecutive day, relentlessly targeting civilians and infrastructure while perpetrating further atrocities. This escalation has claimed the lives of over 2,000 martyrs and left more than 10,000 injured. Israeli occupation aircraft launched on Wednesday morning an assault on Al-Shoura Street in the Hara Hreik area of the southern suburbs of Beirut (Dahiyeh). This attack starkly illustrates the brutality of the occupation forces, who have demonstrated a complete disregard for civilians, their homes, and commercial centers. Israeli occupation army spokesperson Avichay Adraee announced that occupation warplanes from the Air Force carried out strikes based on 'precise intelligence from military intelligence,' targeting what they alleged were 'strategic weapon storage facilities belonging to Hezbollah located in an underground warehouse in the southern suburbs.' In retaliation, Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance continues to strike key Israeli sites, responding to the Israeli aggression on Lebanon and defending its people. Nabatieh Massacre Speaking of Israeli atrocities in south Lebanon, the occupation warplanes unleashed a relentless barrage on the city of Nabatieh today, conducting over 10 airstrikes across various neighborhoods, particularly targeting the neighborhoods of Al-Rahbat, the Al-Maslakh, the city's market, and the municipality building.

He commended the sacrifices made by Civil Defense personnel during these tragic times, reaffirming their commitment to their humanitarian mission. The Lebanese Ministry of Health reported that six people were martyred and 43 others were injured in the Israeli airstrike on the municipality building in Nabatieh. PM Mikati Condemns Israeli Aggression on Nabatieh Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the new Israeli aggression against civilians in Nabatieh, which deliberately targeted a municipal council meeting intended to discuss the city's service and humanitarian conditions. PM Mikati stated, 'This new aggression, in addition to the ongoing crimes against civilians, occurs amid a deliberate global silence regarding the atrocities committed by the occupier, which encourages the Israeli enemy to persist in its actions.' 'If all the countries of the world are unable to deter this blatant aggression against the Lebanese people, how effective will it be to turn to the Security Council for a ceasefire? What can restrain the enemy from its crimes, especially after targeting peacekeeping forces in the south? And what solutions can be hoped for in this reality?' Mikati further added. Israeli Airstrikes on Qana: One Martyr and 30 Injured Earlier on Tuesday evening, the Ministry of Public Health's PHEOC announced in a statement that 'the continuous Israeli airstrikes on the town of Qana have resulted in the martyrdom of one person and injuries to thirty others, with debris removal operations still ongoing.' The intense Israeli bombardment on Qana in southern Lebanon has caused significant destruction to residential buildings, with many reduced to rubble, as search operations for missing persons continue for the second consecutive day. Reports indicate that Civil Defense teams from the Islamic Al-Risala Scouts are still searching through the rubble in Qana and the nearby town of Al-Majadel for individuals who remain unaccounted for following last night’s and this morning’s repeated airstrikes.

He described the assault as a 'complete genocide,' with occupation forces bombarding residential homes, civilian infrastructure like streets, bakeries, hospitals, and water wells. The Hamas leader emphasized the urgent need to address this 'ongoing Israeli massacre against civilians' and called for active engagement 'in mobilizing the community to confront Zionist aggression and US support for it.'

Fierce Clashes in Jenin: Palestinian Fighters Ambush and Kill Isr...	Palestinian resistance fighters in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin engaged Israeli occupation forces, killing and injuring several Israeli troops, according to reports. The confrontation began after Israeli occupation forces invaded Jenin and several other towns in the region, including Nablus and Ramallah. In Jenin, the Israeli occupation troops were ambushed by fighters from the Al-Quds Brigades - Jenin Brigade, who detonated improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and opened fire on the invading forces. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades also participated in the clashes, targeting an undercover Israeli unit that had entered the Jenin refugee camp. The fierce fighting resulted in the deaths and injuries of multiple Israeli soldiers. Following the confrontation, the Israeli occupation forces withdrew from Jenin late on Tuesday. However, they did manage to abduct the body of 20-year-old Karim Samer Jabarin, whom they had allegedly assassinated in the Jenin refugee camp. The clashes in Jenin were part of a larger Israeli military operation across the occupied West Bank, with forces also invading the towns of Kfar Jammal in Tulkarm, Dura in Hebron, Al-Mazraa Al-Qibilya in Ramallah, and the Aaskar refugee camp in Nablus. In Nablus, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades engaged the Israeli occupation troops in fierce confrontations, using automatic weapons and explosives.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2233013	2024-10-16T01:09:47-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-08975160017047103214.jpg
Iraqi Resistance Strikes Vital Target in Occupied Palestine	The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has announced that its fighters launched an attack on Tuesday evening against a vital target in central occupied Palestine. The attack was carried out using an advanced-capability aircraft. In a statement, the Islamic Resistance emphasized that these operations are part of its 'steadfast approach in resisting the occupation, in support of our people in Palestine and Lebanon, and in response to the massacres committed by the usurping entity against civilians, including children, women, and the elderly.' The group also affirmed the continuation of its operations 'to strike enemy strongholds with increasing intensity.' This comes after the Iraqi Resistance said on October 15 that it had targeted a vital location in the northern part of Israeli-occupied territories using drones. Footage was also published showing the fighters launching drones towards a vital target in occupied Tabaraya. The head of the Iraqi Hezbollah Brigades' Security Bureau, Abu Ali al-Askari, warned that the Iraqi Resistance's response to any targeting of the country or use of its territory or airspace to strike Iran will not be limited to 'Israel' but will extend to US bases and interests in Iraq and the region. Al-Askari also indicated that if an 'energy war' were to break out, the world would lose 12 million barrels per day, which the Iraqi Resistance will ensure. This development comes as the Israeli occupation regime has threatened to respond to Iran's Operation True Promise II, which saw the Islamic Republic launching at least 200 ballistic missiles against Israeli military and intelligence facilities across the occupied Palestinian territories. The operation was in retaliation for the Israeli assassination of Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, and Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and IRGC General Abbas Nilforoushan in the Southern Suburb of Beirut.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2232991	2024-10-16T00:06:30-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/04/manar-01043040017122111854.jpg

Hezbollah called on relevant parties in Lebanon and international human rights and humanitarian organizations to condemn this heinous crime by all standards, particularly due to its long-term negative impacts on civilians.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2232782	2024-10-15T09:44:04-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-04165050017056142612.png
Sheikh Qassem: Hezbollah Will Hold Reins of Israeli Beast and Ret...	Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem addressed the nation on Tuesday, vowing victory over the US-backed Israeli war and schemes. Sheikh Qassem started his address by reiterating that the martyred leader, Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, has always guided the resistance. 'Your positions are our constitution, your words are the light of our path, and your discourse is the foundation of our journey.' 'Your enemies fear your presence and see you in every fighter and supporter,' Sheikh Qassem addressed Martyr Sayyed Nasrallah. Tackling the latest developments, Sheikh Qassem stressed that 'Israel' is an occupation entity that poses a real threat to the region and the world. ''Israel' is an expansionist occupation that does not confine itself to Palestine.' 'Israel' bets on the crimes that intimidate others and enjoys absolute support from America, his eminence added. Sheikh Qassem maintained that Lebanon, or even the region, cannot be separated from Palestine, adding that Al-Aqsa Flood Operation came after 75 years of occupation. Sheikh Qassem underlined that Lebanon is part of the Israeli expansionist project. 'Our support for the Palestinians is support for justice, as the Palestinians are rightful owners.' Sheikh Qassem warned that America seeks a new Middle East. 'If it weren't for America, the Great Satan, 'Israel' would not have been able to maintain its current control.' Foreign ambassadors were communicating with Hezbollah's leadership to urge it to stop supporting Gaza, Sheikh Qassem said. We are facing the threat of a new Middle East in the Israeli-American style, his eminence noted. 'We are not facing an Iranian project; rather, we are witnessing a Palestinian project supported by Iranians and the free people of this region.' Supporting Palestine is a source of pride for Iran, which is exerting all efforts to strengthen and empower the Palestinians, his eminence added. If we do not confront 'Israel', it will achieve its goals, Sheikh Qassem warned. Those who harm Lebanon are not those who defend the people, but those who kill them, Sheikh Qassem maintained. 'We fight as a resistance with conditions and target the occupation army while it kills brutally and cowardly, targeting children, women, and the elderly.' When we bear sacrifices and cause pain to 'Israel', we protect generations for decades and centuries to come, his eminence pointed out. Hezbollah Deputy Chief warned that the 'Israeli' project is destructive and aims to eliminate the resistance and its people. 'It is true that the strike on leadership, especially the Secretary-General, is significant and harsh; they attempted to undermine our capabilities, but, thank God, they could not surpass the first step.' The path to restore the land requires the steadfastness of the resistance and the support of its people, his eminence affirmed. 'We are facing a raging beast that cannot tolerate being hindered by the resistance from achieving its goals, and I assure you that we will hold its reins and return it to the pen.' Since September 17, we are in a new phase called confronting the 'Israeli' aggression and war on Lebanon, and we are no longer in a phase of mere support, his eminence clarified. 'Honestly, what the brothers have accomplished in the field over the past two weeks has been greater and better than they expected. The mission of the resistance is to pursue the army and conduct operations against it wherever it advances. The youth (fighters) are waiting to engage more and more; note that in the first week on the front line, there were 25 dead and 150 injured.' 'Since last week, we have established a new equation called the equation of inflicting pain on the enemy, and missiles will reach Haifa and beyond as desired by the leader.' Since the enemy has targeted all of Lebanon, we have the right, from a defensive position, to target any point within the enemy entity, Sheikh Qassem underscored. 'We can target any point in the Israeli entity, and we will choose the appropriate point.' Hezbollah Deputy S.G. addressed the Zionist 'home' front: 'The solution is a ceasefire, and after the ceasefire, according to the indirect agreement, the settlers will return to the north.' As the war continues, more Zionist settlements will be evacuated, and hundreds of thousands, even more than two million settlers, will be in danger, Sheikh Qassem threatened. 'The resistance will not be defeated because it is the rightful owner of the land, and its fighters are martyrs who accept nothing less than a life of dignity; your army is now defeated and will be defeated further.' Hezbollah is strong despite the harsh blows after the communication devices attack and the aftermath, Sheikh Qasssem confirmed. 'The party is strong with its fighters, its capabilities, and the solidarity of Hezbollah and Amal Movement, with a community that works together with strength and determination.' Sheikh Qassem emphasized that 'Israel' is the one disrupting all the lives of the Lebanese, and national unity today enhances their cohesion. 'Together, we will stand strong, and no one should bet on investing outside this framework.' Sheikh Qassem concluded his televised speech by addressing the Lebanese people who were displaced due to the Zionist war, 'Your are the noblest of people, and we are all in the same boat.' 'Victory comes with patience, but I recall our Secretary General's promise: you will return to your homes, which we will rebuild to be more beautiful than they were, and we have already begun preparations for this.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2232639	2024-10-15T07:57:53-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-01460760017290041622.png

Seven BBC Arabic Employees Suspend Work over South Lebanon Report...	Seven BBC Arabic employees suspended their work on Monday in protest over the news agency's report from South Lebanon, where its reporters were embedded with the Israeli army attempting to invade the area. The employees, Sanaa al-Khoury, Mohammad Hamdar, Marie-Josee Azzi and Joy Slim, along with three others from the BBC Extra team, stated that they would not return to their jobs unless the agency issued an apology or held the team that accompanied the Israeli army accountable. The report, broadcast two days ago, shows BBC crew inside the Zionist military vehicles interviewing the IOF who managed to advance only few miles within the Lebanese territories. Hezbollah on Monday lashed out at the BBC, saying the British media outlet had breached the Lebanese sovereignty and press ethics as one of its teams accompanied Israeli occupation forces as they entered a Lebanese village at the border with occupied Palestine. 'It was not enough for the BBC, in all platforms and languages, to blindly side with murderers and criminals and justify the Zionist barbarism against the Palestinian – Lebanese peoples. Rather, it impudently sent a press team that entered one of the southern villages, accompanied by the occupation army, in a breach of the Lebanese territories’ sanctity and sovereignty, as well as the applicable Lebanese laws, as reported by the media outlet itself,' statement by Hezbollah’s Media Relations Office read.

Nicaragua Severs Ties with Genocidal ‘Israel’ over Its War on Gaz...	Nicaragua has severed diplomatic relations with 'Israel' in response to the ongoing military assault on Gaza, denouncing the Israeli government as fascist and genocidal. In a televised announcement on Friday, Vice President Rosario Murillo, who also serves as First Lady, confirmed that leftist President Daniel Ortega ordered the move in protest against 'Israel's' actions in the Palestinian territories. 'Our president has instructed the republic's Foreign Ministry to comply with the request of the national parliament and begin to sever diplomatic ties with the Nazi and genocidal government of Israel,' Murillo said on state television. The decision came after the National Assembly convened a regular session on Friday, during which lawmakers condemned the Israeli government's military offensive and urged the Nicaraguan government to formally cut ties with the 'occupation regime.' This marks the third time Nicaragua has severed relations with 'Israel,' with previous instances occurring in 2010 and 1982 under different administrations. Nicaragua has also called out the governments of the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, and Canada for their alleged accountability under international law regarding the Israeli aggression against Palestinians, most notably in Gaza. The Central American country had even filed a case against Germany before the International Court of Justice, requesting that the court impose urgent measures to prevent Berlin from supplying weapons and other forms of support to 'Israel.' However, the ICJ said that 'the circumstances were not such' to accuse Germany of violating a genocide convention. The move by Nicaragua comes as the Israeli occupation military continues its offensive across the Gaza Strip, killing more than 42,000 Palestinians and targeting and destroying civilian infrastructure since the war began on October 7, 2023.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2229218	2024-10-12T02:42:51-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04081840017287261964.jpg
Resistance Strikes Back: Iraqi Drones 2 sites in occupied Golan	The Islamic Resistance in Iraq launched a series of drone strikes against vital targets in the occupied Golan Heights and a US-controlled gas facility in Syria, according to a statement released on Saturday, October 12, 2024. The group confirmed its continued support for the Palestinian and Lebanese people, stating that the operations were carried out in response to the 'massacres committed by the occupying entity against civilians, including children, women, and the elderly.' In the Golan Heights, the Resistance conducted two separate drone strikes on key positions, underscoring their commitment to targeting the strongholds of the Israeli occupation. In response, US occupation forces stationed at the occupied Syrian gas facility launched missiles toward the Saker Island area, also located in northern Deir Ezzor. Reports indicate that the US aggression that followed did not cause any damage. This marks the fourth consecutive day of US occupation strikes on the northern outskirts of Deir Ezzor in Syria.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2229174	2024-10-12T01:46:01-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/04/manar-01043040017122111854.jpg
Hezbollah Military Command Warns Israeli Settlers to Keep Away fr...	The Operations Chamber of the Islamic Resistance issued on Friday a statement which highlighted the Israeli failure to achieve any progress in the ground offensive it has launched against Lebanon, warning the Israeli to stay away from the army bases in order to keep safe. 'In light of the resounding failure and heroic resistance that the Israeli enemy army has been facing in its attempts to advance towards the eastern sector of the southern villages bordering occupied Palestine, it tried in the past two days to create new axes of advance in the western sector from the direction of the Ras al-Naqoura and Jal al-Alam sites towards Al-Mushayrifah and Al-Labouneh, trying to take advantage of the terrain that it believes will help it. Before attempting to advance on the new axes, the Israeli Air Force launched dozens of raids in conjunction with violent artillery shelling from the land and sea on the towns of Al-Dhahirah, Alma Al-Shaab and Al-Naqoura.' The statement detailed how the Resistance fighters four Israeli attempts to advance: - On Tuesday at dawn, an Israeli military force tried to advance from Ras Al-Naqoura towards the border area of Al-Labouneh with the aim of reaching the UNIFIL forces site in Al-Labouneh and positioning themselves there, but the Islamic Resistance fighters confronted them with appropriate weapons and forced them to retreat. - On Wednesday, the Israeli enemy's army attempted thrice to advance towards Labouneh, but the Mujahideen confronted it in each attempt with rocket weapons, artillery shells and guided missiles, forcing it to retreat and inflicting heavy losses upon its soldiers. - On Wednesday, the Resistance fighters monitored an infiltration attempt by an Israeli enemy force from Ras Al-Naqoura towards the Al-Mushairfeh area, so they targeted it with an assault glider that exploded among the infiltrating force, killing and wounding most of its members. - On Thursday, a group of Israeli enemy soldiers, accompanied and protected by a Merkava tank, attempted to advance towards the Labouneh area from Ras al-Naqoura, and as soon as the tank was within range of fire, the Resistance fighters targeted it with a guided missile that hit it directly, resulting in its destruction, incineration, the killing of its crew and the injury of the soldiers taking cover behind it. The enemy failed in four attempts, over a period of hours, to advance to withdraw the casualties, as the Mujahideen confronted it each time with appropriate weapons and forced it to withdraw, the statement affirmed. 'In conjunction with the heroic confrontations that the Islamic Resistance fighters are engaging in with the officers and soldiers of the Israeli enemy, the fire support groups continue to target the gatherings, positions and support lines of the Israeli enemy army in the military sites and barracks along the frontline and inside the border settlements in the occupied territories and achieve confirmed hits.' The missile force and air force of the Islamic Resistance also continue to target military bases and settlements deep in the north of occupied Palestine, in a way that is gradually increasing day after day, according to the statement. Yhe statement underlined all the above-mentioned military operations of the Islamic Resistance were carried out with high, complete and instant coordination between the leadership of the Islamic Resistance and the operations chamber, reaching the brothers stationed on the front lines of confrontation. 'It is worth noting that the Israeli enemy army, days after announcing the start of what it called the ground maneuver in southern Lebanon, does not dare to show its tanks and military vehicles to the Lebanese side for fear of being targeted, rather it hides them in places where they are, nevertheless, targeted with missiles and artillery shells and suffer heavy losses.' The statement added that the Israeli enemy has failed, until the time of preparing this statement, to control any of the overlooking hills it is trying to advance to, and is content with reaching some houses on the outskirts of some border villages with the aim of taking pictures and organizing media visits. 'The Israeli enemy army uses the homes of settlers in some settlements in north of occupied Palestine as gathering positions for its officers and soldiers, and its military bases that manage the aggression against Lebanon are also located inside settlement neighborhoods in major occupied cities such as Haifa, Tiberias, Acre, and others.' These homes and military bases are targets for the missile and air force of the Islamic Resistance, and accordingly we warn the settlers against being present near those military gatherings in order to preserve their lives until further notice. The Islamic Resistance is committed to its covenant and promise to its supreme and most holy martyr, His Eminence the Secretary-General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah (may his holy secret be sanctified), that the settlements in northern occupied Palestine will remain free of settlers until the war on Gaza and Lebanon stops. Sirens across the north of occupied Palestine were continuously heard on Friday. Hezbollah attacks on the Zionist military sites, settlements and cities did not stop throughout the day. Border confrontations also manifested the Resistance power in face of the monstrous enemy.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2228932	2024-10-11T14:53:22-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-027725400166239486010.jpg

Hezbollah: This is Not Karbala, It is Battle of Removing Gate of ...	Hezbollah Media Relations Official warned on Friday that the Lebanese media space is open to the toxic Israeli air without restrictions and amid absence of law enforcement. Hajj Mohammad Afif hailed the steadfast Lebanese journalists in the South, especially those who convey the reality of the field situation to the people and the world. He also praised a number of free Arab and foreign journalists who share the pain and hope, and story of resistance and steadfastness. Afif indicated that some Lebanese media outlets adopt the Israeli narrative without any scrutiny and incite against the Resistance and its supporters without any governmental measures. Hezbollah official regretted the fact that some Lebanese media outlets convey the Zionist story about any bombardment in Lebanon and display the enemy leaders threat in the context of the hostile propaganda targeting the Resistance and its incubation. Neither the ministry of information nor the competent authorities move against those outlets under the pretext of 'media freedom', he wondered. Afif asked: ' How can freedom of media be free of law enforcement? In it logical that those who are falsely called 'activists' post names of villages and towns and claim that Resistance commanders and munitions are present there? Does freedom of media cover inciting against hospitals in order to provoke a new Zionist massacre just as that which targeted Baptist Hospital in Gaza?' Hezbollah official warned that the Israeli enemy used timed missiles which explode after the raid in order to delude the public opinion that that attack targeted a weaponry cache and prevent the medics from evacuating the injured, stressing that this flimsy pretext can no longer be accepted. Afif affirmed that the US embassy in Lebanon is complicit and involved in the Israeli crimes against the civilians and the medics, asking about the UN and international community attitude towards the Israeli aggression on UNIFIL troops in South Lebanon. This aggression underlines the Zionist entity disregards the UN Resolutions, Afif affirmed, recalling the Zionist massacre against the civilians who resorted to the UNIFIL site in Qana in 1996. Hezbollah official stressed that the Israeli enemy has seen only a little bit of the Resistance military power, adding that the Resistance fire at Haifa, Safed and Acre is just the beginning. Afif underscored the flexibility of the Resistance military operations which are not geographically restricted, explaining that any slight Israeli field progress must not affect the morale of the Lebanese people. Hezbollah official warned some Lebanese parties against the political exploitation of the military battle, adding that it is still too early, and it is not 1982, the year the Israeli tanks reached Beirut. Afif hailed the sacrifices made by the resistance supporters who were displaced from their homes, reiterating that reconstruction is inevitable. Finally, Hezbollah official emphasized that this battle is not that of Karbala; it is the battle of removing the Gate of Khaybar.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2228701	2024-10-11T11:13:10-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-09127630017286708504.jpeg

Hezbollah: Reuters Report on New Resistance Command 'Pure Fiction...	Hezbollah on Friday dismissed as a 'pure fiction' a report published by Reuters news agency which claimed that the Lebanese resistance group has allegedly 'forged' a new command for the ground battles in south Lebanon after the assassination of its top leaders. 'Reuters news agency has published a report on what it called a new military command directing the Israeli ground offensive in south Lebanon and on some details related to this war, its nature, plans and weapons,' Hezbollah Media Relations announced in a statement. 'This report is not but a pure fiction imagined by Reuters’ writers, journalists and security advisers,' the statement read. 'What the agency has attributed to a so-called field commander is totally false, and our policy, as it has become well known, though it’s necessary to reiterate: There is nothing called Hezbollah sources,' it added.

Alongside the artillery attacks, the occupation forces have also been demolishing residential buildings to the west of the camp.

Inadequate and Misleading Evacuation Warnings by ‘Israel’, Says A...	Evacuation warnings issued by the Israeli military to residents of southern Beirut and south Lebanon were inadequate and, , misleading, according to Amnesty International. The human rights organization said these warnings do not absolve ‘Israel’ of its obligations under international law to avoid targeting civilians and take all possible measures to minimize harm. Amnesty's Secretary General Agnès Callamard stated that the warnings to residents of the densely populated Dahieh suburb of Beirut were insufficient. The warnings, issued via social media less than 30 minutes before strikes, included misleading maps and failed to provide clear timelines or safe evacuation routes. AMNESTY INVESTIGATES: Evacuation warnings issued by the Israeli military to residents of the southern suburbs of Beirut and south Lebanon were inadequate, and in some cases also misleading. Read more: — Amnesty International (@amnesty) October 10, 2024 Similarly, the blanket warnings for entire towns and villages in southern Lebanon raised concerns that they were intended to trigger mass displacement rather than protect civilians. Callamard emphasized that people who choose to stay or are unable to leave must still be protected under international humanitarian law. Amnesty's analysis of over a dozen evacuation warnings found that the designated 'danger zones' on the maps were much smaller than the 500-meter radius advised by the Israeli occupation military. Residents reported chaotic evacuations, with some unable to leave due to mobility issues of elderly or disabled family members. The human rights group stressed that effective warnings must provide timely, clear instructions to allow civilians to safely move away from targeted military objectives. Broad orders to evacuate entire areas do not meet this standard under international law. It also noted that 'the heavy loss of life in Lebanon in recent days raises concerns that Israeli occupation forces are violating their obligation to take all feasible precautions to minimize harm to civilians wherever they may be, including by issuing effective warnings.' After spending the past 12 months investigating war crimes committed by 'Israel' in the Gaza Strip, Amnesty International 'is deeply concerned that Israel may seek to repeat the approach it took in Gaza, which resulted in unprecedented harm to civilians.' This comes as the Israeli occupation has been waging a large-scale aggression on Lebanon for 18 consecutive days, attacking cities and residential suburbs in Beirut, the south, the Bekaa and the mountains, committing bloody massacres, most of the time without any warnings or warnings. What Amnesty International has said confirms that the warnings issued by the occupation 'army' are nothing but misleading warnings, as the occupation, which is based on brutality and destruction, does not care about the warnings and does not adhere to the scope it has set, but rather publishes the warnings as part of a media campaign to justify its crimes.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2227854	2024-10-11T01:56:17-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-03829790017282136541.jpg

Hezbollah: Islamic Resistance Fire at ‘Israel’ Won’t Be Limited t...	The Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance issued a key statement late Tuesday to warn the Zionist enemy that the Resistance leadership's command and control system has returned stronger and more resilient than ever. The Islamic Resistance confirmed the remarks made by Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General, Sheikh Naim Qassem, regarding the readiness of the rocket force to target any location in occupied Palestine as determined by the Resistance leadership through a command and control system that has returned stronger and more resilient than ever. 'The continued aggression of the 'Israeli' enemy against our honorable people in all parts of steadfast Lebanon will make Haifa and elsewhere, for the rockets of the Resistance, akin to Kiryat Shmona, Metula, and other border settlements with Lebanon.' Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem stressed on Tuesday that the Lebanese resistance group’s chain of command is fine and that its military capabilities are solid, as he vowed that the resistance will emerge victorious against the Israeli enemy. Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem in a televised speech via Al-Manar (October 8, 2024). This was evidenced by what the enemy and its settlers witnessed in Haifa and its surroundings today, Tuesday, the statement added. 'The Islamic Resistance sees and hears where this enemy least expects it, and its hand is capable of reaching wherever it desires in occupied Palestine. Its fire directed at the Zionist depth will not be limited to rockets or suicide drones.' Our valiant fighters continue to confront every attempt by the elite Zionist soldiers to advance and occupy some southern villages at the front line with occupied Palestine, in a heroic battle unprecedented in this enemy's wars, the statement confirmed. 'They have even resorted to hiding behind UNIFIL positions and in paths not visible to the Lebanese side, and thus far, they have failed to penetrate our steadfast villages, suffering heavy losses exceeding 35 killed and 200 injured among their elite officers and soldiers.' 'We reiterate what we stated in the early days of this heroic battle: what this enemy witnesses from our fighters is just a glimpse of the firm strength awaiting it wherever it treads in southern Lebanon.' The statement also addressed the resistance supporters with sincere words, underlining the role in emerging victorious from this battle. 'To our honorable people, you are in the hearts of every fighter among us. You are our stronghold that humiliates this enemy, you are the cries of Takbeer in the field, and you are the prayer for victory that we draw closer to Allah with. O our people, you are the secret of our resilience and dignity, and all victories. We know that you are people of patience, sacrifice, and loyalty. From you, we draw all our determination and strength, and with your prayers, we rally our spirits and fight with pride.' Beloved Gaza was further addressed by the Islamic Resistance command which reiterated commitment to the support of the steadfast Palestinian people in Gaza and their valiant and honorable resistance. 'This is the legacy of the Master of Martyrs all the way to Al-Quds (may he be sanctified), and it is a trust upon our shoulders. We are worthy of this trust, with God's permission, until our last breath.' Hezbollah Military Media released a video to mark the first anniversary of the Islamic Resistance battle in support of Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2224917	2024-10-08T13:30:59-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-02313730017284200797.png

Sheikh Qassem: Hezbollah’s Military Capabilities Solid, Will Emer...	Hezbollah Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem stressed on Tuesday that the Lebanese resistance group’s chain of command is fine and that its military capabilities are solid, as he vowed that the resistance will emerge victorious against the Israeli enemy. In a televised speech via Al-Manar on the first anniversary of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, Sheikh Qassem affirmed that Hezbollah is not frightened by the alliance of the Israeli enemy with the United States and some European countries. He addressed Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu who vowed to bring the Zionist settlers back to northern occupied Palestine by saying: 'Many more (settlers) will be displaced.' Sheikh Qassem lashed out at the US for being key partner in the war which is aimed at eliminating the Axis of Resistance and exterminating the Palestinian people. He said that the Operation Al-Aqsa Flood is an exceptional event and the beginning of change in the Middle East. The Hezbollah deputy chief hailed the resistance in Gaza as 'legendary and capable of withstanding more and more'. 'We Are Not Scared' Sheikh Qassem said that the alliance of the Israeli enemy along with the US and some European countries doesn’t frighten the Lebanese resistance. He said that the Zionist entity and the Western countries have been trying to 'put fear' into the Lebanese resistance group after the assassination of Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, 'but it’s not working.' 'We are the sons of Axis of Resistance’s Master of Martyrs Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah,' the Hezbollah deputy chief said, as he praised the martyred S.G. for putting 'fear in the hearts of the Zionists and fighting the criminals of the occupation'. He hailed Operation Al-Aqsa Flood as 'an extraordinary and exceptional event which represents the beginning of change in the Middle East… and the first step for change' towards freedom for the Palestinians.' Sheikh Qassem noted that the Israeli enemy’s goal 'was to completely eliminate the Axis of Resistance and exterminate the Palestinian people,' stressing that the Israeli crimes against Palestinian women, children and elderly are unparalleled in the history. In this regard, he hailed the Palestinian resistance in Gaza as legendary, noting that and 'it’s capable of withstanding more and more.' Sheikh Qassem stressed that the US is a key partner in this aggression, as well as some European countries. He said Lebanon has been under aggression, noting that Netanyahu has repeatedly declared that he wants a 'new Middle East.' Resistance’s Determination Firm Sheikh Qassem said that the Lebanese front 'has exhausted the enemy throughout 11 months and has displaced tens of thousands of Israeli settlers.' 'This war has never and will never affect our determination to confront the Israeli aggression.' He stressed that Hezbollah fighters in the battlefield are solid, and that the command is coherent. Hezbollah fighters carrying out pro-Gaza operations in south Lebanon (April 2024 / image released by Hezbollah Military Media). 'Netanyahu says that the settlers will return to the north and we tell him that many more will be displaced.' Sheikh Qassem warned the Israeli enemy that 'the longer the war continues; the more difficult impasse Israel will face.' 'We are striking the enemy and expanding the range of fire, we will reach any place at the time we decide according to our plan. We are steadfast and we will emerge victorious.' Meanwhile, Sheikh Qassem praised Lebanese Speaker Nabih Berri, stressing that Hezbollah and Amal Movement are 'one heart in good times and bad.' 'We fully trust our 'big brother' Speaker Nabih Berri,' his eminence said. He stressed: 'We are the people of the battlefield and we will never beg for a solution.' 'This war is a war of who screams first and we will not scream, we will continue and we will offer sacrifices, you will hear the enemy screaming, God willing.' Hezbollah Chain of Command Fine On the other hand, Sheikh Qassem reassured that the resistance’s chain of command is fine, noting that there is no vacant position in Hezbollah. 'I tell you that the chain of command is operating strictly regular and we have overcome the painful blows that have been inflicted on us.' 'We don’t have a vacant position, all positions are filled and Hezbollah is working with full readiness and regularity,' he added. He affirmed, meanwhile, that the resistance group 'will elect a new secretary-general and will announce it once it has been done.' 'Everything that the martyred leaders had, their assistants and replacements have copies of,' his eminence reassured. Solid Military Capabilities Sheikh Qassem affirmed that Hezbollah’s ability to resist Israel’s military is intact. 'Our military capabilities are fine. What our enemies say about our fighting capabilities is an illusion. They are lying.' 'Our fighters on the front line are solid. The Israeli plan is to kill Lebanese civilians and empty villages to cause chaos. But I tell them, your efforts are a failure.' He noted that the Israeli ground incursion in southern Lebanon began a week ago, stressing that the Israeli army has yet to advance. The Hezbollah deputy chief stressed that the resistance fighters are fully ready to engage in face-to-face battles with the Israeli enemy forces. 'We will neither abandon our positions, nor hand over our weapons,' stated Sheikh Qassem. Sheikh Qassem's speech is the second since martyrdom of S.G. Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah in a flagrant Israeli strike on Beirut's southern suburb, Dagiyeh, on September 27. On September 30, Sheikh Qassem said that Hezbollah was using the minimum of its capabilities, voicing full readiness for all scenarios.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2224389	2024-10-08T04:44:31-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-01467880017283873124.jpg

Hezbollah Military Officer: Israeli Occupation Forces Taking UNIF...	A Hezbollah military officer told Al-Mayadeen TV that the Islamic Resistance fighters reported on Sunday monitoring an unusual movement for the Israeli occupation forces behind behind a UNIFIL military site in the outskirts of the border town of Maroun Al-Ras in southern Lebanon. The Islamic Resistance operations chamber asked the fighters to be patient and to avoid attacking the movement in order to preserve the lives of the international forces' soldiers. The Israeli enemy is trying to use the international UNIFIL forces as human shields to cover up its failure to advance towards the village, especially after its repeated failed attempts on more than one axis to advance towards Maroun Al-Ras and the loss of dozens of its soldiers as dead or wounded. Hezbollah’s Islamic Resistance intensified its military operations on the first anniversary of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, targeting Israeli sites along the Lebanese border with occupied Palestine, as well as military bases and settlements deeper within.

Hezbollah Commemorates October 7: Era of Defeats Is Over; Divine ...	Hezbollah asserted that its decision to open a support front on October 8 in solidarity with the Palestinians and their resistance is rooted in truth, justice, and humanity. This choice reflects Hezbollah's commitment to defending Lebanon and its citizens while emphasizing its ability to repel aggression and declaring that the era of defeats is over and victory has arrived. In a statement commemorating the anniversary of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, Hezbollah noted that 'today marks one full year since the heroic Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, which exemplified the will of the Palestinian resistance in confronting Israeli aggression, injustice, and occupation that has afflicted Palestinians since 1948, along with the wars, tragedies, and destruction that followed. 'This operation will have historical repercussions and strategic outcomes on the overall situation in the region until justice is achieved through the elimination of Zionist occupation, allowing Palestinians to reclaim their legitimate rights to their land, from the river to the sea,' the group's statement added. Hezbollah harnessed this occasion to emphasize the 'full right of the Palestinian people to resist occupation by all means necessary to reclaim their legitimate rights and eliminate the occupation.' 'Despite the Israeli brutality, which has led to the martyrdom of tens of thousands of Palestinians and the unprecedented destruction of the Gaza Strip, this unjust and oppressive entity has proven to be weak, unable to survive without US support,' the group affirmed. Hezbollah also highlighted that 'there is no place for this temporary entity in the region or within our social, cultural, and humanitarian fabric; it has always been and will remain a malignant, aggressive tumor that must be removed, no matter how long it takes.' Regarding those who support the Zionist entity worldwide, Hezbollah stressed, 'The United States, along with its allies and agents both globally and in the region, are partners in this occupation, complicit in its aggression and crimes against the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples and the peoples of the region. These countries bear full responsibility for the killings, atrocities, injustices, and devastating humanitarian tragedies.' The Islamic Resistance in Lebanon addressed the Palestinian people and their valiant resistance, praising their steadfastness after a year of patience and endurance, marked by tragedy, and affirming that they are 'worthy of victory.' Hezbollah hailed the courageous support fronts, declaring: 'We commend the strength and valor of our fellow fighters in the beloved arenas of Yemen and great Iraq. Furthermore, we recognize the historic decision by the Islamic Republic of Iran to execute a significant missile strike deep within enemy territory. This action will have profound implications and significant outcomes for the nature of this ongoing confrontation with the Zionist enemy. The group emphasized its determination to proceed with its decision to open a support front on October 8 in solidarity with the Palestinian people and their honorable resistance, noting that this choice aligns with truth, justice, and complete humanity. 'This decision also underscores our commitment to defending Lebanon and its people, for which our resistance and populace have paid a heavy price in leadership, military, and material losses, along with the forced displacement of hundreds of thousands of civilians and extensive property destruction. Meanwhile, the enemy persists in its relentless crimes and aggression,' the statement added. Hezbollah wrapped up its statement, reaffirming its confidence in the resistance's ability to repel the aggression and the resilience of its people until this crisis is resolved. 'We see ease following hardship and relief after distress; the era of defeats has passed, and divine victory has arrived,' the group stated.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2222794	2024-10-07T03:24:35-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-04165050017056142612.png
Video | Hezbollah Strikes Haifa, Tiberias in Occupied Palestine	In a resolute defense of Lebanese sovereignty and in retaliation against Israel's continued aggression on both Lebanon and Palestine, Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance launched a missile strike targeting the occupied city of Haifa, deep within northern occupied Palestine. The Islamic Resistance declared that this strike is part of the ongoing 'Khaybar' operations and a direct response to the Zionist enemy's targeting of civilians and the massacres it has committed. Following the rallying cry, 'We are at your service, O' Nasrallah,' Hezbollah fighters unleashed a salvo of Fadi-1 missiles at the Carmel base, located south of Haifa, at precisely 11:20 p.m. on Sunday. Israeli media reported that Rambam Hospital in Haifa received six casualties following the missile strikes on the city. Hebrew Channel 12 announced that schools in parts of the occupied city of Haifa have shifted to remote learning in the wake of Hezbollah's missile strikes on the city. At midnight on Monday, the Islamic Resistance launched a missile barrage targeting the Nimra base, one of the main military bases in the northern region, located west of Tiberias. Israeli media reported that the total number of casualties from the missile strikes launched from Lebanon on Haifa and Tiberias has reached 10, including one in critical condition and several with moderate injuries.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2222739	2024-10-07T02:14:40-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-074245200172829232510.jpg
Iran Cancels Flights Amid Preparations for ‘Strong Response’ Oper...	Iran has reportedly canceled several flights as part of preparations for a major military operation targeting 35 strategic sites in Israeli-occupied Palestine, according to an account linked to Iran's Supreme National Security Council on the social media platform X. The Nournews agency, also on X, stated late Sunday that flight cancellations, which began at 9:00 PM local time and are expected to last until 6:00 AM (0230 GMT) on Monday, are likely tied to preparations for the 'Strong Response' operation. به نظر می رسد توقف پروازها در فرودگاه‌های #ایران تا بامداد دوشنبه، بیش از آن که اقدامی احتیاطی در برابر احتمال شرارت رژیم #اسرائیل باشد، فراهم کردن زمینه های لازم برای اجرای طرح #پاسخ_سخت و در صورت لزوم‌هدف قرار دادن ۳۵ نقطه راهبردی در عمق سرزمین های اشغالی است — نور نیوز (@nournews_ir) October 6, 2024 The cancellations, the report suggests, are not due to concerns over an imminent Israeli attack, as some had speculated. The developments come amid rising tensions following recent ballistic missile strikes by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) on key Israeli targets in Tel Aviv and other areas. The missile attacks, aimed at Israeli military and security installations, were described by Iranian authorities as retaliation for Israel's involvement in regional conflicts and alleged sabotage operations inside Iran. Amid rumors of possible Israeli retaliation, particularly targeting Iran’s energy and economic infrastructure, Iranian officials have warned that any escalation by the Israeli enemy would be met with a 'swift and decisive' response. Earlier on Sunday, an informed source within Iran's armed forces told Tasnim news agency, which is close to the IRGC, that the country had developed a 'Strong Response Plan' to counter any Israeli retaliation. The source added that specific measures had been prepared, and authorities were ready to execute them depending on Israel's actions.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2222497	2024-10-06T14:08:46-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-05110800017280760165.png
Al-Hayya: What We Rejected Yesterday, We Will Not Accept Today – ...	Khalil Al-Hayya, a senior member of Hamas' Political Bureau, reiterated today, Sunday, that the Palestinian resistance remains resolute in its mission to liberate the land and people, declaring that what was rejected in the past will not be accepted today. Marking the first anniversary of the Al-Aqsa Flood operation, Al-Hayya reflected on the ongoing Palestinian struggle, noting that 'a year later, our people continue to write a new chapter of history with their resistance, blood, and steadfastness.' He emphasized that any gains Israel could not achieve through force will not be granted through negotiations. He stressed that the operation shattered the ZIonist entity's perceived military superiority, as fighters from the Al-Qassam Brigades and other factions carried out heroic acts that have changed the balance of power. Al-Hayya further pointed to the increasing resistance in the West Bank, where Palestinians are pushing back against Israeli settlement expansion and Judaization efforts. He highlighted the recent Jaffa operation as one of the latest examples of this ongoing resistance. 'Our objective is clear,' Al-Hayya said. 'We seek the complete liberation of our land and holy sites, the establishment of a sovereign, independent Palestinian state, and the return of refugees to their homeland.' Lebanese Resistance Al-Hayya praised the unwavering support of the Lebanese Islamic Resistance, which has been involved in the struggle since day one. He acknowledged the sacrifices made by the Lebanese, including thousands of martyrs and wounded, noting that Israel's aggression has turned Lebanon into a key front in the conflict. 'We are united in this battle,' he said, addressing the Lebanese people and their resistance fighters. 'Blood is blood, and destruction is destruction. The blood of our leaders, including Ismail Haniyeh and Hasan Nasrallah, has forged a new dawn for our nation with Al-Aqsa at its heart and Al-Quds as its destination.' Hamad Chief Ismail Haniyeh (L) in a meeting with Hezbollah S.G. Sayyed Nasrallah (photo relased by Hezbollah's Media Relations - Tuesday, June 29, 2021). Global Support and Shifting Battlefronts Al-Hayya extended his gratitude to Yemen’s Ansarullah for their steadfast support, both in terms of military action and the millions who have shown solidarity with the Palestinian cause. He noted that the missile and drone strikes launched by Yemen's resistance forces have significantly shifted the battle's dynamics, striking deep into the heart of Israeli territory. He also commended the Islamic Republic of Iran for its support, pointing to recent missile strikes in retaliation for Israel’s targeted killings of Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil. Al-Hayya described Iran’s actions as reshaping the battlefield, likening their missiles to 'meteors filling the skies over occupied Palestine.' Iraq’s contribution to the resistance was also acknowledged, with Al-Hayya highlighting drone and missile strikes from Iraq as a testament to the country's commitment to Palestine. He stressed that Iraq, both in its present and historical role, is deeply embedded in the Palestinian cause. A Call to Action and a Warning to the International Community Al-Hayya called on the Arab and Islamic nations to translate their solidarity into concrete action, saying, 'We appreciate your noble feelings towards our people, but now is the time for roaring resistance from east to west.' In a message to the international community, Al-Hayya urged an end to silence, warning that continued inaction would only allow further Israeli aggression. 'Enough with the silence,' he stated, 'as it only perpetuates the aggression against our people and the Lebanese. Israel is the epicenter of evil and destruction in the region, and the source of its instability.' He concluded by expressing confidence in the future of the Palestinian struggle, stating that past efforts have laid a strong foundation on which Palestinians can build their future. 'What we have previously achieved serves as an important foundation for what comes next,' Al-Hayya affirmed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2222387	2024-10-06T13:21:08-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2017/11/manar-01366360015117824491.jpg
Yemen’s Al-Houthi: Al-Aqsa Flood Revived the Culture of Jihad	Leader of Yemen's Ansarullah movement Sayyed Abdul-Malik Badredine al-Houthi stated that the Operation Al-Aqsa Flood has reignited the culture of jihad in the name of Allah across the Muslim world. Emphasizing that this event has shifted the nature of conflict with the Israeli occupation from rapid, short-term wars to prolonged wars of attrition, Sayyed Houthi said Sunday that this war weakened Israel's capabilities and its supporters. 'The Zionist enemy's ambitions extend far beyond Palestine, its objective is to dominate the entire region, including neighboring Arab countries,' Al-Houthi cautioned. These goals, he explained, are not merely historical aspirations but are active projects being pursued on the ground with significant resources. He pointed to Israel's aggressive wars and occupations as evidence of these expansionist efforts. The Ansarullah leader referenced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s explicit declaration of reshaping the Middle East to serve Israel's interests, noting that Netanyahu aims to shift the balance of power in the region. Al-Houthi elaborated that this involves neutralizing Palestinian resistance, dismantling the Palestinian statehood project, controlling Arab governments, and co-opting their military forces to serve Israeli goals. An Israeli female soldier appears in distress during a military exercise (photo from archive). According to al-Houthi, Netanyahu seeks to ensure the Zionist entity’s survival as the dominant military power in the Middle East, redrawing borders and asserting regional hegemony. He added that the Zionist entity plans to exploit internal divisions within the Arab world, weakening its peoples and redefining the rules of engagement to allow ‘Israel’ to strike any Arab or Islamic nation without resorting to full-scale war. Al-Houthi also pointed out Netanyahu’s efforts to reshape international alliances, strengthening ties with global powers and expanding relations with emerging nations like China and India. This would provide Israel with greater strategic influence on the global stage, enabling it to further its control over the region. In conclusion, al-Houthi warned that 'Israel's' ultimate goal is to become the dominant force in the Middle East with global influence. He called on the Arab and Islamic nations to unite and confront these ambitions before they come to fruition.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2222090	2024-10-06T11:36:09-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-00979760017282396438.jpg

Israeli Aggression Intensifies on Day 13: Heaviest Night of Bomba...	The Israeli enemy pressed forward with its aggression across Lebanon, launching airstrikes early Sunday morning that have been described as the most intense since the onset of aerial aggression on Beirut's southern suburbs over a week ago. Last night's Israeli airstrikes targeted the old airport road, which connects the city center to Beirut International Airport. The strikes resulted in damage to a hotel, residential apartments, commercial establishments, medical clinics, a car wash, and medical and food warehouses. Piles of debris blocked one lane of the airport road, prompting young volunteers to step in and manage traffic, redirecting vehicles toward safer routes. Small explosions were audible throughout the morning, with paramedics indicating that these sounds resulted from burning fuel tanks reacting with materials inside the buildings. Paramedics Hindered Volunteers searching for survivors reported that 'Israeli aircraft are dropping explosives around the targeted buildings in Beirut's southern suburb (Dahiyeh) to hinder the work of civil defense teams.' Military experts believe that the aircraft are deploying missiles loaded with a type of cluster bomb that continues to explode for several hours after the airstrikes end. Israeli drones continuously fly over the southern suburbs, employing armed drones equipped with precision-guided missiles to disrupt search and rescue operations, particularly in the Mreijeh area. Video Captures the Aftermath of Israeli Airstrikes on Dahiyeh The Zionist entity continues its war on Lebanon with American approval, European support, and global silence, claiming it aims to reshape the Middle East.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2221518	2024-10-06T04:06:16-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-04165500017282126864.jpg
Hezbollah Deals Heavy Blows to Israeli Forces at Lebanon Border: ...	Hezbollah issued a statement on Saturday quoting a field officer from the Islamic Resistance Operations Room, who provided details of a series of heroic confrontations against Israeli occupation attempts to infiltrate Lebanese territory. The officer stated that, 'At approximately 10:20 PM on Friday, Islamic Resistance fighters in the Adaisseh axis detected unusual movements by Israeli forces near Border Marker 405, in the outskirts of Adaisseh. Our fighters immediately made the necessary arrangements. Then, at around 10:45 PM, an elite enemy force advanced toward the Adaisseh Municipality building. By 11:00 PM, the infiltrating force reached a pre-prepared ambush, and with the call 'We are at your service, O' Nasrallah,' our fighters opened fire with light and medium machine guns.' The officer declared that this defensive effort exploded the enemy's mines, which they intended to use to rig the municipality building. 'Approximately 15 soldiers were either killed or wounded, as their cries were clearly heard. Israeli occupation rescue teams, supported by helicopter fire, evacuated their casualties back to the occupied territories,' the Hezbollah officer concluded. Speaking of the Zionist attempts early on Saturday, the officer stated that, 'At approximately 1:50 AM on Saturday, another enemy force attempted to infiltrate through a different route towards the Adaisseh Municipality building. Islamic Resistance fighters confronted them with machine guns and rocket fire. The clashes lasted for more than two hours, during which the enemy suffered casualties among its soldiers and was forced to withdraw.' 'At 7:00 AM on Saturday, an Israeli occupation Merkava tank attempted to advance through a concealed route on the Lebanese side toward Al-Bat hill in the outskirts of Maroun Al-Ras. Islamic Resistance fighters precisely targeted the tank with a guided missile, resulting in its destruction and the killing or wounding of its crew,' the officer emphasized. The officer confirmed that Hezbollah's fire support groups continue to target Israeli occupation forces stationed in military barracks, sites, and settlements along the Lebanese border using artillery shells, rockets, and heavy machine gun fire, achieving direct hits. He emphasized that the group's missile force has consistently and is still striking various targets deep within northern occupied Palestine with intense rocket barrages. Additionally, he highlighted that the Islamic Resistance's air force continues to target Israeli occupation military bases and barracks in northern occupied Palestine with swarms of precision-guided drones. The Hezbollah field officer concluded by stating that the Islamic Resistance has documented the deaths of over 25 officers and soldiers from the elite units of the Israeli occupation forces in recent days, following the announcement of their ground operation into southern Lebanese villages.

Iranian Missiles Overwhelmed Israeli Defenses: WSJ	Iran’s barrage of ballistic missiles this week appears to have overwhelmed Israel’s air defenses in some places, The Wall Street Journal quoted independent researchers who examined emerging satellite imagery as saying. The assessment means that any new Iranian strikes against Israel, if launched, could have much more serious consequences if they target civilian infrastructure or heavily populated residential areas,the US paper reported . 'That is an important consideration as Israel contemplates its military response. Tehran has threatened strikes on Israeli power plants and oil refineries if Israel hits Iranian territory in a counterattack expected in the coming days.' 'Unlike April 13, when Iran fired a large number of slower cruise missiles and drones, Tuesday’s barrage was made up exclusively of some 180 much faster ballistic missiles, one of the largest such strikes in the history of warfare. Analysts say that most of these projectiles were Iran’s most modern ballistic missiles, the Fattah-1 and Kheibar Shekan.' 'The faster the missile, the harder it is to intercept it, that’s simple physics,' said Ulrich Kühn, head of research for arms control at the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy in Hamburg, Germany. 'It’s certainly much harder to defend against ballistic missiles, and even more so if there is a bulk of them coming in on a certain target, because then you have the ability to overwhelm the antimissile defenses—which is exactly what happened in Israel.' Satellite images of a target on Tuesday—the Nevatim air base in southern 'Israel', home to its F-35 jet fighters—show that as many as 32 Iranian missiles managed to land within the base’s perimeter, according to analysis by professor Jeffrey Lewis, at the Middlebury Institute for International Studies in Monterey, Calif. 'Thirty-two missiles is a lot of missiles,' Lewis said. 'We have exaggerated ideas about the effectiveness of air defenses. We have this pop-culture idea that missile defenses are much more effective or available than they actually are.' 'While Israel operates the sophisticated Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 missile-defense systems, co-produced with the U.S., the interceptors are limited in quantity and more expensive than the incoming Iranian missiles, Lewis said. It often takes multiple interceptors to try stopping one ballistic target.' It is more complicated to inflict damage on a sprawling and hardened air base in the middle of the desert than to strike infrastructure sites in heavily populated areas, WSJ noted. 'The Israelis would care more about defending Tel Aviv' than defending Nevatim, said Lewis. 'On the other hand, they would ultimately have the same problem there—Iranians could at the end of the day overwhelm the system.' The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps carried out a missile strike against the Israeli occupation entity on Tuesday evening. The IRGC said in a statement that it has targeted 'the heart of the occupied territories' in response to the martyrdom of Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh, Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, and IRGC general Abbas Nilforoushan at the hands of the Zionist regime.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2220088	2024-10-04T14:07:15-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-05110800017280760165.png

Hezbollah stated on Friday that the Zionist entity continues its inhumane acts of terrorism by targeting civil defense and rescue teams in targeted residential areas, prompting urgent action from the Lebanese government and international organizations. In a statement, Hezbollah’s Media Relations Office reported, 'After its brutal airstrikes destroyed numerous residential buildings in the southern suburbs last night, its aircraft are now attacking civil defense teams engaged in debris removal and rescue operations. These strikes have led to the martyrdom of one member of the Islamic Health Authority's civil defense team, with several others injured.' Hezbollah called on the Lebanese government and relevant international bodies to denounce this barbaric action, which contravenes humanitarian norms and international resolutions, and to take necessary measures to enable these humanitarian teams to carry out their rescue missions.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2219307	2024-10-04T03:21:54-07:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-04165050017056142612.png
