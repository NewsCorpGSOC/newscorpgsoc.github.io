Hariri Says Al-Mustaqbal Movement Will Return to Political Life: ...	Former Prime Minister Saad Hariri underlined support for the Lebanese Army in order to achieve the Israeli enemy's withdrawal from all the villages in South Lebanon, stressing that the Southerners as well as Bekaa and Dahiyeh residents are part of the new national opportunity. Marking the twentieth commemoration of his father's martyrdom, Hariri said: 'Today, after twenty years, we have returned to this square to say to Rafik Hariri - we have missed you!' He considered that Rafik Hariri and his supporters are still present in Beirut's Martyrs' Square and all arenas, and belong not only to the Future (Al-Mustaqbal) Movement but to all of Lebanon, asserting that the movement remains one of moderation, reconstruction, liberties, and building of the state and its institutions, and the movement of Arabism, modernity, openness, and coexistence among all the Lebanese. Addressing the gathering of supporters who came to pay tribute to the memory of the late Prime Minister, Hariri said, 'This is an occasion to announce our support for the stability of Syria and the best equal relations from one country to another, as announced by the new Syrian leadership. In these 20 years, our country has gone through many crises, and we have never denied that part of the responsibility lies with us. I submitted my resignation and made way for three years or more. We are responsible for ourselves before the people and before the Lord Almighty.' Hariri continued to pay respect to all the fallen martyrs in all Lebanese regions, hailing the solidarity demonstrated among the Lebanese in supporting each other in the hard times, and stressing that solving the economic crisis is everyone's responsibility. 'Today there is a golden opportunity; we have a new president and a new government,' he underlined. Addressing the people of the South, the Bekaa and Beirut's suburbs, he said: 'You are partners in this opportunity, and without you, it cannot be achieved. But you must break any previous impression that you are a force of obstruction and weapons&#8230;You are partners in opening bridges of relations with our Arab brothers and partners in reconstruction, and most importantly: you are strong partners in restoring the state's reputation, which alone, with its army, security forces, and institutions, protects the Lebanese, all the Lebanese.' Hariri recalled Martyr Rafik Hariri's project based on the Taif Constitution, building the state, developing its institutions, and preserving its sovereignty. 'We support the president, the government, and every effort to build a normal state to restore Lebanon's role in the world. We are with the army and the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation from all the villages in which it is present,' he underlined. Hariri considered that the problem with the Israeli enemy's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is 'escaping responsibility, escaping from peace to war, a problem of occupation, killing, and displacement of a people,' adding that this 'cannot be solved at the expense of Egypt, Jordan or the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.' 'We will remain with you in all national milestones, and everything will be good in its own time,' Hariri asserted.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2338932	2025-02-14T06:56:45-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00155430017395449974.jpeg
Allies Often Worse Than Enemies': Trump Announces Reciprocal Tar...	US President Donald Trump today announced sweeping 'reciprocal tariffs' hitting both allies and competitors, in a dramatic escalation of an international trade war that economists warn could fuel inflation at home. Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said he decided to impose reciprocal duties, telling reporters that US allies were often 'worse than our enemies' on trade issues. The levies would be tailored to each US trading partner and consider factors including value added tax (VAT). Trump has announced a broad range of tariffs targeting some of the biggest US trading partners since taking office, arguing that they would help tackle unfair practices — and in some cases using the threats to influence policy. The president has referred to tariffs as a way to raise revenue, remedy trade imbalances and pressure countries to act on US concerns. Trump's announcement came hours before he was due to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington. It remains unclear when exactly the tariffs would take effect, if imposed. Analysts have warned that reciprocal duties could bring a broad tariff hike to emerging market economies such as India and Thailand, which tend to have higher effective tariff rates on US products. Countries such as South Korea that have trade deals with Washington are less at risk from this move, analysts believe.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2338899	2025-02-14T06:30:38-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2020/11/manar-02037370016046496872.jpg
Architect of So-called Generals’ Plan: 'Israel Failed Miserably i...	The architect of the Israeli so-called Generals' Plan retired General Giora Eiland said the Zionist entity 'failed miserably in the Gaza war.' The Israeli newspaper Maariv has quoted the retired general and the former head of the so-called Israeli National Security Council as saying that ‘Israel’ failed in Gaza. Eiland, who masterminded the controversial plan for displacing Palestinians from northern Gaza, argued that the Israeli defeat can be assessed by examining which side achieved its objectives and imposed its will. He pointed to the recent developments in Gaza, stating, 'Look at the agreement—Israel opened the Rafah crossing and withdrew from the Netzarim axis, while thousands of Palestinians returned to the north.' Eiland noted that 'Hamas can dictate to us in phase two an agreement.' Although admitting the importance of recovering Israeli detainees currently held in Gaza, he said that Israel 'will also pay with the mass release of hundreds of prisoners.' In his remarks, Eiland advocated for the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, stating that 'if you occupy the Strip and the civilians remain, Hamas will remain too. Apart from receiving terrible attacks against the occupying force, you will not gain anything.' Israeli occupation army in Jabalia in northern Gaza Strip (November 5, 2024). Earlier in a comment piece for Ynet, described the Israeli war on Gaza as an 'absolute failure'. 'Israel has failed in three-and-a-half out of the four goals of the war: we have not demolished Hamas’ military power; we have not overthrown Hamas’ rule; we are not managing to return the residents&#8230; safely to their homes [in settlements], and as for the return of the abductees, the fourth goal – we have partially succeeded,' he wrote. He said Hamas had, conversely, 'achieved all of its goals, chief among them: continuing its rule in Gaza.'

At its simplest, this plan involves ethnically cleansing the northern Gaza Strip of people; and then besieging the region, including stopping the entry of humanitarian supplies, to starve out anyone left, including Palestinian fighters. The original plan, also known as the Eiland Plan after its creator, was seen by Palestinians and rights groups as part of a long-term project of ethnic cleansing that would result in the reestablishment of Zionist settlements in Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2338866	2025-02-14T06:06:06-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07800290017395417976.jpg

Al-Houthi stressed that Yemen stands by Palestine, and the US will witness the full extent of the Yemeni military prowess, which he said the US has not experienced so far. He warned that the missiles and forces dispatched by the US to Palestinian territories will fail to displace the people of Gaza. The senior Yemeni official also pointed to the recent collision of the US aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman with a large merchant vessel in the Mediterranean, saying the incident exposes the anxiety and distress that the US Navy is enduring as a result of battles with the Yemeni armed forces. Al-Houthi reiterated Yemeni people's unwavering support for the Palestinian nation, adding that their million-man marches over the past 15 months attest to such a stance. He stressed that all options are on the table, and Yemeni armed forces stand fully prepared for any possible scenario, especially after recent remarks by Ansarulalh leader Abul-Malik al-Houthi that Yemen will intervene, even militarily, if the US and Israel attempt to enforce the Gaza displacement plan by force or collude with Arab regimes to implement it.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2338756	2025-02-14T05:34:58-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00178670017395401224.jpg

Member of the Loyalty to Resistance parliamentary bloc, Dr. Ibrahim Al-Moussawi, called on all the Lebanese parties to condemn the Israeli violations of the national sovereignty and loudly hold the international competent institutions responsible for stopping the Zionist attacks against the Martyr President Rafik Hariri International Airport. In a statement issued to comment on on the crisis of Lebanese citizens stranded abroad as a result of the Israeli threat to target the Iranian plane that will transport them from Iran, MP Al-Moussawi said, 'the Lebanese who are optimistic about the reactivation of the work of constitutional institutions are holding the government responsible and demanding that it take the necessary measures to guarantee Lebanon’s sovereignty at all its public facilities, most importantly the airport, so that the enemy does not think that it is free to practice aggression and violate sovereignty as it pleases.' 'The Lebanese state, with all its apparatuses, must assume its responsibilities to end this matter and work to return its citizens to their country immediately and not comply with Israeli threats under any name or circumstance.' At the same time, Al-Moussawi called on the honorable citizens and all those who are keen on the interests of their country and families to be deeply aware and rational and to make room for solutions to this emerging crisis, stressing that the expression of rejection of these Israeli violations and infringements of our sovereignty to be peaceful and responsible.

Sayyed Houthi: We Will Militarily Confront Trump’s Gaza Displacem...	Head of Yemen’s Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi vowed a military action if 'Israel' or the US proceed with a plan to displace the Gaza Strip residents into other countries. 'Our position concerning support for the Palestinian nation and their fighters is firm and principled, and we will resolutely stand by their side,' he said in a televised speech from Yemeni capital Sanaa on Thursday. 'If the US manages to advance its plot against Gaza, we will take military action to prevent it, and act within the framework of our religious duties. We will not sit idly by.' He added that 'Israel' has not yet fulfilled its commitments under the Gaza ceasefire agreement by preventing the entry of aid, basic commodities and tents into the Strip. Houthi took a swipe at the Zionist regime for violating the terms of the ceasefire in Gaza due to the encouragement of the deceitful US administration, which denies all rights. The Ansarullah chief also rejected the US president’s call for the cancellation of the Gaza ceasefire unless the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas frees all remaining Israeli captives by Saturday, stating that 'Hell is for you (Donald Trump) and people of your kind like tyrants, criminals and oppressors.' Houthi emphasized that Trump’s Gaza displacement plan is more like a joke and naive talk from the president of a country that proclaims to be civilized. 'Trump's plan to displace the Palestinian people from their homeland is a confiscation of a right from which many other rights are derived. Trump is a criminal and accustomed to making careless and ridiculous remarks.' Houthi underlined that Trump's plan to displace Palestinians from Gaza reflects his insistence on the criminal plan to deny Palestinians’ rights and justice for them. A drone view captures Palestinians, forcibly displaced to southern Gaza by IOF, making their way back to their homes in the north after a ceasefire took effect in central Gaza (Reuters: Jan 27, 2025) 'Trump's plan for Gaza is evil and cruel. It appears that he is serious about implementing the scheme, and is putting pressure on some Arab countries to accept it. We are not surprised by the US president’s plot as it shows the tyranny and criminal record of his country. There are no boundaries to the ambitions of Trump, who believes in the aggressive and unjust Zionist plan and seeks to realize it,' he stated. The Ansarullah leader stated that Trump, who unveiled the so-called 'Deal of the Century' during his term in office, is now poised to perpetrate the 'Crime of the Century' during his second term. 'Through his plan, Trump seeks to obtain what the Israeli aggression on Gaza failed to achieve, namely, displacing the Palestinians from their land. When the Americans raise the issue of displacing the Palestinian people from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, they seek to completely liquidate the Palestinian cause,' Houthi said. He warned that the plan to forcibly relocate Palestinians is part of the Zionist project that seeks to expand the occupying entity’s influence and is aimed at holy sites, especially the al-Aqsa Mosque. 'Trump’s Gaza plan cannot succeed as long as Arabs, especially the Arab countries neighboring Palestine, do not accept it. A great responsibility lies with Arab and Muslim countries to clearly reject it, and more importantly express their vehement opposition. 'The US seeks to entrap Arab regimes in a major scandal and act against the interests of their countries and peoples,' Houthi noted. He warned that approving the American plan would have very serious consequences for the national security of Arab countries, and the entire West Asia region.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2338382	2025-02-13T11:54:43-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01327440017394764775.jpg

The US President Donald Trump did not disclose a secret scheme when he raised the issue of forcibly displacing Gaza residents in order to turn it into an American real-estate project.

Escalating Israeli Assault on the West Bank The Israeli occupation army launched its ongoing assault on the northern West Bank on January 21, starting with an invasion of Jenin city, its refugee camp, and surrounding towns, leading to the martyrdom of 25 Palestinians, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.

On February 2, Israeli occupation forces launched another military operation in the town of Tammun and the Al-Fara’a refugee camp in Tubas governorate, withdrawing from Tammun after seven days and from Al-Fara’a after 11 days. Mass Arrest Campaign Israeli occupation forces carried out a large-scale arrest campaign, detaining dozens of Palestinians across various areas in the West Bank. According to local sources, the Zionist forces stormed the town of Abwein, northwest of Ramallah, rounding up dozens of civilians, blindfolding and handcuffing them before subjecting them to physical assaults. The arrests extended to multiple locations, including the city of Nablus, Balata refugee camp, the town of Atil northeast of Tulkarm, Shu'fat refugee camp in the occupied city of Jerusalem, and Aida refugee camp north of Bethlehem. Al-Aqsa TV reported that Israeli occupation forces also arrested the wife of prisoner Ihab Al-Shouli after raiding their home in the town of Asira Al-Shamaliya, north of Nablus. Deportation of Palestinian Prisoners Earlier on Wednesday, Israeli Interior Minister Moshe Arbel ordered the expulsion of three Palestinians from East Jerusalem, including a former prisoner released in the recent swap deal and a currently imprisoned detainee. The decision was based on their alleged 'familial ties' to what Israel labels as 'terrorists.' Since the launch of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood on October 7, 2023, Israeli occupation forces and settlers have intensified their attacks across the West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem. According to official Palestinian figures, these assaults have resulted in the killing of 911 Palestinians, the injury of nearly 7,000 others, and the arrest of approximately 14,500 people.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2337964	2025-02-13T03:39:00-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-009063800173944665710.png
Imam Khamenei Highlights Iran’s Military Power Feared by Foes	Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei has hailed the participation of people in Monday rallies across the country on the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, saying President Masoud Pezeshkian’s 'clear and decisive' speech complemented the great popular movement. The Leader made the remarks during a Wednesday meeting with scientists, specialists, and officials from Iran’s defense industry, as well as several families of martyrs from the country’s defense sector. 'This recent Bahman 22 (February 10) was one of the most outstanding celebrations of the [Islamic] Revolution – one of the most significant ones,' Ayatollah Khamenei said, describing the rallies as a 'popular uprising' in the face of the enemy’s massive propaganda campaign against the Islamic Revolution. 'The people indeed rose up on Monday; they took to the streets, chanted slogans, expressed their views in the media, and this happened across the entire country. It was a popular uprising, a great national movement,' he said. ‘Rallies conveyed message of unity’ The Leader further said the participation of young people and the broad turnout across the country, including in villages despite bitterly cold and highly unfavorable weather, conveyed a 'message of unity' from the Iranian nation. Emphasizing the significance of the huge turnout, Ayatollah Khamenei noted that Iranians had done something 'extraordinary' by showcasing their 'identity, dignity, strength, and resilience' in the face of 'foolish threats' repeatedly made against them. 'Complementing this great popular movement on Bahman 22 were the clear and decisive remarks of the esteemed president, who voiced the people’s concerns and articulated what needed to be said,' he said. 'I always reiterate to my audience, to the dear young people to whom I am deeply attached and devoted, that actions must be taken at the right time. The Iranian nation acted at the right time on Monday; they did what needed to be done exactly when it needed to be done. They showed themselves at the right moment.' Prior to the meeting, Ayatollah Khamenei visited the Eghtedar-1403 exhibition for an hour, which showcased the latest achievements and capabilities of the country’s defense industry scientists and specialists. The exhibition featured advanced equipment and new technologies used in air defense, ballistic and cruise missiles, smart munitions, space technology, drones and aviation, naval vessels, and energy systems. Referring to the exhibition, the Leader described the issue of defending the nation and ensuring the country’s security as extremely important, stating that Iran’s defensive power is now widely recognized – admired by the 'friends of the Revolution' and feared by its enemies – making it a significant asset for the country. Ayatollah Khamenei recalled a time when global bullies refused to sell Iran essential defense equipment, even at heavy prices. He noted that those same powers now demand that Iran refrain from selling military equipment to others, emphasizing the vast gap between their past stance of 'we won’t sell to you' and their current plea of 'don’t sell to others,' a gap that has been bridged through the 'efforts of Iranian scientists and the sharp minds of young specialists.' Highlighting Iran’s remarkable defense advancements despite ongoing sanctions, the Leader said that the country’s defense industry has reached a point where if any part or equipment is withheld, Iranian youth produce an even better version domestically.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2337667	2025-02-12T13:39:46-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-014585500173939637610.jpg

Sheikh Yazbek: Israeli Withdrawal Deadline Approaching, Hezbollah...	Head of Hezbollah’s Juristic Council Sheikh Mohammad Yazbek issued on Wednesday a statement which tackles the latest developments and affirms that the Resistance is the fortress of Lebanon. Sheikh Yazebk started his statement by felicitating the nation on the anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, saying: 'In these days, the days of the victorious and blessed Islamic Revolution, the triumph of the oppressed over the oppressors, these are the days of authentic Mohammadan Islam. We extend our warmest congratulations to the Imam of our time and to the nation on this blessed occasion&#8230;' Sheikh Yazbek added: 'Today, we have experienced great crises and tragedies, particularly when we lost the lover of Imam Mahdi, the lover of Allah, the inspired leader, the martyr of the nation, His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah—may Allah sanctify his pure soul—who was an entire nation in one man. He was the one who proclaimed: 'We will never abandon you, O Hussein,' and he never did. Instead, he attained martyrdom on the very path laid down by Imam Hussein. Peace be upon you, upon your supporter and brother, and upon our brother, His Eminence Sayyed Hashem Safieddine—may Allah sanctify his pure soul—who was your steadfast supporter, just as Al-Abbas was to Imam Hussein, in this blessed journey to lift oppression from the oppressed, in victory for the truth, and in defense of Palestine and Al-Quds. You both, along with those who stood with you on this sacred path to Al-Quds, dedicated your efforts to supporting and assisting Gaza. You gave your lives for this cause, driven by divine duty, human responsibility, and noble values, for the dignity of the oppressed. You did not ignore the cries and pleas of the children, women, and men of Gaza; rather, you answered their call. Yes, this is how you established this blessed Resistance, which has now entered its fourth decade, evolving from one era to the next. This dear and honorable Resistance has brought dignity to the entire nation, not just Lebanon. It has been the shield and the guardian of this homeland’s freedom. You and all the leaders and martyrs, every single one of you who has stood in the battlefield against the 'Israeli' enemy, have ensured that despite 64 days of battle, the enemy was unable to advance. Instead, the fighters of this Resistance stood firm, like the supporters of Imam Hussein, as the men of Allah and Imam Mahdi—men who insisted on confrontation, who fought for a dignified life for their nation, their people, and their homeland.' Sheikh Yazbek pointed out, 'When we agreed to the ceasefire, it was to protect this homeland and preserve others. However, this enemy has no covenant or pact. What it failed to achieve in war, it now seeks to accomplish by violating the ceasefire—wreaking havoc on our land and our people, destroying buildings, and assaulting civilians, while the United States backs it. The supervisory committee has failed to fulfill its role. We gave an opportunity for all to understand the situation. The state must implement what was agreed upon and take responsibility.' 'However, after 60 days had passed without action, our people in the south rose up and advanced toward the villages occupied by the enemy. They breached the barriers and made sacrifices, offering martyrs and wounded in their struggle to return. This return is a victorious one—a triumph after triumph. This Resistance belongs to the people. We congratulate our people on their return, their steadfastness, and their unwavering will. The enemy sought to break their resolve but failed. Yes, we are the followers of the Islamic path—the path of honor and dignity, the path drawn for us by our Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him).' Sheikh Yazbek addressed the Southerners, 'You, the honorable, the resistors, the people who do not fear the enemy, those who face death with courage—this Resistance is yours. You are its backbone and at its forefront. You are the ones who teach the enemy a lesson, just as our people in Gaza have done by achieving victory and denying the enemy any of its objectives. The enemy failed to accomplish anything in Lebanon, just as it failed in Palestine and Gaza, his eminence added. 'And now, those who seek to bargain today—such as Trump, who believes he can turn Gaza into real estate for sale—let them be disgraced along with all their allies. The entire world should know that as long as there are those who declare, 'There is no god but Allah,' the true owners of the land remain deeply rooted in it, just like our people in the south, in Jabal Amel, and across Lebanon. They have offered the dearest sacrifices and will never abandon the land they have watered with their blood.' Sheikh Yazbek called on the state to fulfill its responsibilities in confronting this occupation. We are approaching the end of the deadline that was granted. 'After that, as our Secretary-General, His Eminence Sheikh Naim Qassem, has stated: 'We will then reassess our actions moving forward.' We are fully prepared for whatever is necessary to preserve our dignity, our honor, and Lebanon’s sovereignty.The Resistance is defending Lebanon—it is the fortress of this nation. Lebanon needs those who will stand in its defense. When the state takes up its role in protecting the borders, we will stand with it and support it. This was evident when our people stood with the army as they advanced into the occupied villages. We all look forward to that day.' Sheikh Yazbek concluded, 'We also look forward to February 23, the day when the martyr of the nation, the sacred leader, His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, will be laid to rest. This national funeral will be a tribute to the homeland, for which he gave his blood, his very existence, and his Resistance. The Resistance will remain; its banner will never fall. As Sayyed promised, the flag will continue to be raised—it is a promise that will be fulfilled. We ask Allah Almighty to grant our nation honor and dignity.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2337579	2025-02-12T13:05:02-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07784730017393942971.jpg
Israeli War Jets Create Sonic Booms over Beirut as Lebanese Offic...	As the withdrawal deadline, stipulated by the ceasefire agreement, comes closer, the Israeli enemy escalated pressure to gain a new extension in order to continue its attacks and violations. The ceasefire took effect on November 27, 2024, ending a 66-day Zionist war on Lebanon. After the end of the 60-day withdrawal deadline, the bias US sponsor of the agreement supported the Israeli enemy to keep its occupation forces in South Lebanon till February 18, 2025. Few days before the deadline, the Israeli enemy started exerting various forms of pressures to delay the withdrawal. In this regard, the Israeli media quoted some officials as claiming that the Army would remain in South Lebanon for a longer term although some outlets reported the contrary. In this regard, Israeli Channel 14 mentioned that, under the ceasefire agreement, and unless there is any change, the 'Israeli' army will withdraw from Lebanon within a week. Al-Hadath TV Channel alleged that the Lebanese officials agreed a new extension of the withdrawal deadline till after next April. However, President Michel Aoun and House Speaker Nabih Berri categorically denied the Israeli-motivated rumors, reiterating the demand that the Israeli occupation forces withdraw from South Lebanon before February 18. Few hours after the Lebanese political stance confirmed rejection of the withdrawal deadline, the Israeli war jets created sonic booms over several Lebanese areas, including Beirut, for the first time since November 27. The Zionist mock raids were also carried out over Bekaa and Al-Matn.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2337524	2025-02-12T10:46:26-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01178340017393859748.png

Israeli Occupation Forces Escalate Violations in Southern Lebanon...	Israeli occupation forces persist in violating Lebanese sovereignty by maintaining a presence in several points within southern villages, where their troops are seen actively moving. These operations include frequent incursions by both foot and armored patrols, alongside ongoing sweeping operations and repeated explosions. The latest of these occurred last night in the town of Yaroun, which has recently witnessed multiple bombing and demolition operations. Additionally, the Israeli occupation army has set fire to homes and carried out explosive attacks in the town of Adaisseh. Tensions Rise on the Southern Border Zionist forces launched bursts of gunfire from the town of Maroun Al-Ras, targeting the outskirts of the city of Bint Jbeil. In the southern area near the town of Aita Al-Shaab, which borders the Blue Line with occupied Palestine, an explosion targeted a farm at the border. Lebanese Rejection of Israeli Request The Lebanese Ministry of Defense was informed today, Wednesday, by the UNIFIL ceasefire monitoring committee that the Israeli army has requested to remain at certain points in southern Lebanon until February 28. However, this request has been firmly rejected by the Lebanese authorities. Delays in Ceasefire Monitoring Discussions A scheduled meeting of the committee overseeing the implementation of the ceasefire agreement was postponed from Thursday to Friday for further consultations on the fate of the ceasefire, which is set to expire next Tuesday. Al-Manar's correspondent reported on Wednesday that Israeli occupation forces continue to set fire to several homes in the town of Adaisseh, while a Merkava tank remains on standby behind earthen barriers at the town entrances leading from Rab Thalatheen and Taybeh. Additionally, Israeli bulldozers are conducting earthworks at the outskirts of Al-Dhahirah, while Israeli artillery has targeted Wadi Al-Shebaa. Also on Wednesday, the acting Lebanese Army Commander, Major General Hassan Aouda, inspects army deployment centers in the eastern sector of southern Lebanon. Aouda arrived earlier at the François Hajj Barracks in Marjayoun, marking his first visit to the border region in southern Lebanon.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2337315	2025-02-12T06:11:35-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00807440017393678339.jpg

Egypt plans to 'present a comprehensive vision for the reconstruction' of the Gaza Strip that ensures Palestinians remain on their land, the Egyptian foreign ministry said in a statement. Egypt 'hopes to cooperate' with the administration of US President Donald Trump 'to reach comprehensive and just peace in the region.' وبحسب بيان صحفي صادر عن وزارة الخارجية المصرية تعتزم مصر تقديم 'رؤية شاملة لإعادة إعمار قطاع غزة على الأطراف المعنية بما يضمن بقاء الشعب الفلسطيني في وطنه'. pic.twitter.com/rs9d1nLiJa — (هِمّه) Himma (@Himma0099) February 12, 2025 The statement comes as Trump continues to press for his scheme to take over the Gaza Strip and displace its population to neighboring Egypt and Jordan despite rejection from Arab states. For his part, US Secretary of State Rubio said Washington is open to hearing alternative plans from Arab allies who oppose Trump’s proposal to take over Gaza. 'If people don’t like the Trump plan for Gaza — right now it’s the only plan. It’s now incumbent upon the Arab countries… if they think they’ve got a better plan, we need to hear it,' the top US diplomat said in an interview with the Fox News on Tuesday. On the other hand, Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said he rejects any displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and West Bank, calling it 'unacceptable' for the region. 'The focus today is on Gaza and tomorrow it will shift to the West Bank with the objective of emptying Palestine of its historical inhabitants,' he asserted at the World Governments Summit in Dubai on Wednesday. وبحسب بيان صحفي صادر عن وزارة الخارجية المصرية تعتزم مصر تقديم 'رؤية شاملة لإعادة إعمار قطاع غزة على الأطراف المعنية بما يضمن بقاء الشعب الفلسطيني في وطنه'. pic.twitter.com/rs9d1nLiJa — (هِمّه) Himma (@Himma0099) February 12, 2025 'It’s unacceptable for the Arab world, which has fought this idea for 100 years.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2337205	2025-02-12T03:47:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/07/manar-08474550017211428969.jpeg

Palestinian media reported the IOF arrested two women from their homes in Tulkarm early on Wednesday. Wafa news agency said that residents trapped in an eastern neighborhood of the city were calling for help, including the delivery of food and medical assistance. The agency quoted residents as saying that the IOF have turned three buildings there into military barracks and that snipers have taken position there, preventing them from leaving their homes 'or even appearing at their windows and on their balconies'.

Ongoing Israeli Violations of South Lebanon Ceasefire Reflect Sch...	The Israeli occupation forces continued on Tuesday their attacks, explosions and various violations of the ceasefire in South Lebanon. Meanwhile, Israeli reports indicated that the Zionist Army is planning to keep its occupation of five to seven positions for a longer period. In this context, a Zionist force, accompanied by a Merkava tank, advanced into the western outskirts of Aita Al-Shaab, raising an earthen berm that blocks the way into Al-Hadab Hill which leads to a Lebanese military outpost, where the Army wanted to redeploy troops after the enemy has withdrawn. An Israeli tank also incurred into Yaroun outskirts, while the enemy continued its explosions in the border towns and attacked the residents returning to them. Al-Manar correspondent, Ali Shoeib, indicated that the Israeli enemy kept razing lands and executing explosions in Yaroun, Maroun Al-A-Ras, Aitaroun Markaba, Tallousa and Kfarkila. On the other hand, the Israeli media outlets unveiled the Zionist scheme of keeping troops in South Lebanon after the withdrawal deadline of February 18. In this regard, the Israeli Channel 14 would not withdraw from five to seven positions. After the end of the 60-day withdrawal deadline stipulated by the ceasefire which took effect on November 27, 2024, the US sponsor of the indirect agreement claimed that a further extension is needed to implement the 'terms of the deal.' The Israeli enemy has been utilizing the withdrawal deadline to detonate buildings, raze lands, scrape roads, burn forests, cut trees and attack the civilians returning to their villages.

On Anniversary of Humiliating US Marines Escape from Yemen, Sayye...	Head of Yemen’s Ansarullah Movement Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi on Thursday extended praise and thanks to God on the great victory with the humiliating escape of the American Marines from Sanaa On the anniversary of the escape of the US marines from Yemen, Houthi said that the American defeat in Sanaa is a great blessing from God, a great victory, and a great achievement for the Yemeni people The escape of the Marines from Sanaa was a failure for the American project to completely control our country with all its consequences and was a great and important fruit of the September 21 Revolution, he added. 'Getting rid of American hegemony and American control preserved the human dignity of our dear people,' Sayyed houthi said, 'No people in the whole world can be free while America controls them in all their affairs.' According to Sayyed Houthi, those who view the American as a benefactor and a reliable destination to achieve interests and gains have a stupid and wrong view. Houthi underscored the US greed and ambitions as explicit in Trump's hostile remarks while addressing even non-Islamic countries, adding that the US administration does not deal with others respectfully. The program of the Americans was to lead Yemen to the brink of collapse in all areas, Houthi said. 'The American-Israeli project is an aggressive, destructive project that seriously targets our nation with the aim of occupying a large geographical area of our nation's countries.' The American-Israeli project seeks to confiscate the sanctities, not only Al-Aqsa Mosque, but Mecca and Medina are part of the Zionist project, Houthi affirmed, adding that the enemy seeks to rob the nation of everything moral from principles and values, from all the divine guidance that can build it to be at the level of confrontation. 'The American approach poses a danger to our entire nation without exception, although the danger targets certain countries more, but it postpones targeting the rest to future stages. The Zionist project is destructive and aggressive and cannot be adapted to, and it will lose any people who want to adapt to it in this world and the hereafter.' Sayyed Houthi emphasized our firm, principled, humanitarian, moral and religious position in supporting the #Palestinian people and their mujahideen at all levels, militarily, politically and in the media The Yemeni leader affirmed readiness even for military intervention in any round of escalation against Gaza at any time 'We saw the fruit of steadfastness and reliance on God in the position of the Palestinian people in Gaza Strip, despite the extremely difficult circumstances. The capital of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip was faith in God and their cause and adherence to their legitimate rights, so the result was in their favor.' - The second day in the Gaza Strip was a day of Palestinian victory, an enthusiastic day, in which the Qassam Brigades and the Palestinian factions appeared with all pride and dignity, Houthi confirmed. 'The Islamic Revolution in Iran was victorious because the Muslim Iranian people moved and carried the will to be saved from American hegemony through the Shah, who was practically for America and 'Israel', he added. The Israeli enemy was defeated in 2006 in a humiliating manner, and through that confrontation it wanted to completely eliminate Hezbollah and subject Lebanon to it and to the Americans.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2336754	2025-02-11T13:03:43-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-08587280017393078162.jpg
Gaza Under Siege: Aid Cut off as US President Trump’s Remarks Thr...	As the drained Gaza Strip faces severe restrictions on humanitarian aid, including the blocking of vital fuel supplies, US President Donald Trump’s recent statements add further tension to an already volatile situation. An article in the Israeli Haaretz newspaper describes Trump’s recent statements and interventions as 'tempting fate', warning that they could derail the ceasefire agreement in Gaza and disrupt the prisoner exchange process. Zionist analyst Amos Harel, writing for Haaretz, refers to Trump as an 'unpredictable force' whose actions risk intensifying the crisis. Trump’s call for the release of prisoners in a single batch, diverging from the previously agreed incremental approach, represents a radical shift in negotiations that could have dangerous consequences. While many in the Zionist entity, particularly those supporting the prisoner exchange deal, had placed their hopes on Trump, Harel notes that they now share the 'painful frustration' previously felt by critics, especially those from the right-wing factions. Trump threatens to withhold aid from Jordan and Egypt if they refuse his proposal to transform Gaza into a tourism hub, amid ongoing tensions over Palestinian relocation. pic.twitter.com/fROjKGckWI — News Now (@NewsNowUS) February 11, 2025 Rising Right-Wing Optimism and Potential Fallout The article further highlights how right-wing factions in the Zionist entity have embraced Trump’s remarks, seeing them as an opening for Zionist Prime Minister Netanyahu to retract his commitments and take military action against Hamas. However, Harel cautions that such action could lead to the deaths of dozens of prisoners still held in Gaza. In conclusion, Harel dismisses the right-wing optimism surrounding Trump’s intervention, stressing that military force is unlikely to change Hamas’s stance, particularly as the group has nothing left to lose. He suggests that Trump’s motivations may include securing a significant regional achievement, such as ending the Gaza conflict, facilitating normalization with the Israeli enemy's regional neighbors, or even securing a Nobel Peace Prize. Limited Aid and Severe Shortages In a blatant escalation of restrictions, Israeli occupation forces have blocked the entry of commercial fuel into Gaza, despite clear stipulations in the humanitarian protocol. Sources within Gaza confirmed to Al-Jazeera that the occupation has also halted the supply of fuel for essential services, including civil defense and municipal vehicles required for crucial road repairs and debris removal. Additionally, no commercial fuel has been allowed to enter the enclave, exacerbating the ongoing humanitarian crisis. The same sources revealed that only around 53,000 tents have been allowed into Gaza out of the agreed 200,000, and none of the 60,000 caravans required for shelter have been delivered. They also noted that only 4 heavy vehicles have been permitted to enter for debris removal and body retrieval, despite the sector’s need for 500 such vehicles. In addition, the Israeli occupation has prevented the entry of construction materials needed for rebuilding hospitals and civil defense centers. Gaza’s Rashid Street remains closed to vehicles, and crossing checks continue on Salah Al-Din Street following the expiration of the 22-day deadline.

Lebanon’s Berri Condemns Netanyahu’s Proposal on Establishing Pal...	House Speaker, Nabih Berri, on Tuesday denounced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s call for a Palestinian state on Saudi land as a blatant attack on the kingdom’s sovereignty and part of Israel’s cross-border aggression. Berri warned that this scheme aims to eliminate the Palestinian cause and undermine Palestinian rights. Moreover, the House Speaker stressed that defending Palestine is a matter of Arab national security, urging Arab states and the international community to take decisive action against such threats before it is too late. Berri also reaffirmed solidarity with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan in safeguarding Palestinian rights and regional stability. Saudi Arabia has condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s suggestion that the kingdom’s land be used to establish a Palestinian state. In a statement on Sunday, the Saudi Foreign Ministry accused Netanyahu of attempting to 'divert attention' from Israel’s ongoing 'crimes' in Gaza, including 'ethnic cleansing'. 'The kingdom affirms that the Palestinian people have a right to their land, and they are not intruders or immigrants to it who can be expelled whenever the brutal Israeli occupation wishes,' said the Foreign Ministry.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2336622	2025-02-11T08:10:51-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-07687950017327071093.jpg
New Lebanese Cabinet Holds First Session, Forms Committee Tasked ...	The new Lebanese government held on Tuesday its first session at Baabda Palace after a meeting between President Joseph Aoun, House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam. President of the Republic, Joseph Aoun, who chaired the session, emphasized that Lebanon was not bankrupt but was suffering from 'failed management,' urging reforms to revive the country. 'If Lebanon were bankrupt, it must rise through reforms, which we, as ministers and the government, will work tirelessly to implement. Lebanon, as a state, must protect all its sectors and institutions,' Aoun said. The President then stressed the importance of loyalty solely to the state, clarifying that ministers are there to serve the people, not the other way around. 'Our focus will be on reforming and developing ministries, with the significant international support we’ve received. The opportunities are available to seize this support once the necessary reforms are carried out,' Aoun added. The President went on to underscore that 'forming a government was not enough; restoring trust is essential through actions such as fighting corruption, making key appointments, and addressing pressing issues.' He highlighted the need to tackle urgent matters, including the national budget, municipal elections, and the implementation of Resolution 1701. Aoun also called for Israel's withdrawal by February 18, despite ongoing challenges. Furthermore, the President urged the government to refrain from criticizing friendly and brotherly nations, stressing that Lebanon should not be used as a platform for such criticism. Minister of Information, Paul Morcos, on Tuesday announced the decisions of the cabinet session, stating that President Joseph Aoun urged new ministers to prioritize national interests and focus on governmental reforms with international support. Morcos then confirmed the formation of a ministerial committee to draft the government's policy statement. Led by Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, the five-member committee includes Yassine Jaber, Tarek Mitri, Ghassan Salameh, Fayez Rasamny, and Joe Issa El-Khoury.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2336567	2025-02-11T06:35:44-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-04974150017392845364.png

Trump Threatens ‘Hell’ if Israeli Captives Not Released	In a high-stakes diplomatic showdown, United States President Donald Trump has issued a stern warning to the Palestinian authorities, threatening to 'let all hell break loose' if Israeli captives being held in the Gaza Strip are not released by noon on Saturday. Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump made it clear that the decision ultimately rests with the Israeli government, stating, 'I'm speaking for myself. ‘Israel’ can override it.' This is not the first time the president has made such a threat, having previously warned of bringing 'hell to Gaza' if the captives were not freed by January 20, 2024. US President Donald Trump stated that Palestinians would not have the right of return under his proposed plan for Gaza. When asked by Fox News Channel’s Bret Baier whether Palestinians would be granted this right, Trump responded, 'No, they wouldn’t, because they’re going to… pic.twitter.com/D6w8iEXzVh — The Cradle (@TheCradleMedia) February 10, 2025 When asked about specific measures the US would take to enforce his demand, Trump responded, 'You’ll find out. And they’ll find out too. Hamas will find out what I mean.' 'These are sick people,' he added, referring to the movement’s members, despite their having treated the captives humanely and provided them with all necessary foodstuffs and medical attention by the captives’ own admission. Trump, meanwhile, threated that the US would cut off its aid to Jordan and Egypt if they did not take in Gaza’s Palestinians. 'I would conceivably withhold it [the US aid],' he said. His administration has pushed for the mass displacement of Gaza’s entire two-million-plus Palestinians, a plan denounced by many regional and global states and legal experts as ethnic cleansing. However, the Trump administration had previously approved a ceasefire agreement that would allow for the gradual release of Israeli captives and Palestinian detainees over multiple phases. This time, the Trump is demanding a 'one-go' release of 'all hostages,' refusing to accept a 'trickle' of releases. The ceasefire was initiated last month between the Israeli regime and Hamas in the hope of ending a ferocious war of genocide by the regime that had claimed the lives of at least 17,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children. Ever since its onset, the deal has witnessed numerous Israeli violations that have claimed the lives of hundreds more Palestinians. The agreement has mandated phased release of the Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Earlier on Monday, Hamas announced that it was suspending the process, citing Israeli violations of the agreement. 'The door remains open for the [captive/] prisoner exchange batch to proceed as planned, once the occupation complies,' the group said in a statement. In response, Tel Aviv ordered the military to prepare for 'any scenario in Gaza.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2336094	2025-02-10T23:56:41-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07169730017387823318.jpg
Trump Says Palestinians Displaced by U.S. Proposal Would Not Retu...	Palestinians displaced from Gaza to neighboring countries under a 'U.S. proposal' would not have the right to return to the enclave, US President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox News about his proposal to 'own' the Gaza Strip and develop real estate there. 'Think of it as a real estate development for the future. It would be a beautiful piece of land,' Trump said of the proposal, which he first floated last week during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Washington. Hamas said it would delay the release of three Israeli hostages scheduled for Saturday 'until further notice.' Hamas military spokesman Abu Obeidah indicated that the enemy’s violations of the ceasefire and failure to fulfill its obligations under the agreement are behind Hamas decision. Though the number of trucks carrying humanitarian aid and fuel has surged since the ceasefire went into effect last month, aid groups have said that some key aid has not been allowed entry to Gaza. Last week, the United Nations pointed to goods related to agriculture, telecommunications, reconstruction and education that remained restricted by Israeli occupation authorities. In response, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz called the delay 'a complete violation of the ceasefire agreement and the hostage release deal.' Katz said he has instructed Israel’s military to 'prepare at the highest level of readiness for any possible scenario in Gaza and to defend the communities.' An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a consultation with senior defense officials after the Hamas statement and would move Tuesday’s security cabinet meeting to the morning. In a statement, a group representing the families of hostages taken to Gaza in the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, said it has 'urgently requested' help from mediating countries to restore and implement the existing deal.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2335995	2025-02-10T11:33:37-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2020/12/manar-07429450016081960808.jpg
Over Israeli Violations of Gaza Ceasefire Agreement, Hamas Suspen...	The military spokesman for the Palestinian Resistance Movement Hamas announced on Monday the suspension of the Israeli prisoners release operations until a further notice. Abu Obeidah indicated that the enemy's violations of the ceasefire and failure to fulfill its obligations under the agreement are behind Hamas decision. 'Over the past three weeks, the resistance leadership has monitored the enemy's violations and failure to fulfill its obligations under the agreement; including the delay in allowing the return of the displaced to the northern Gaza Strip, targeting them with direct shelling and gunfire in various areas across Gaza, and denying relief supplies of all kinds to enter as agreed, while the resistance has implemented all its obligations.' Therefore, the release of the Zionist prisoners next Saturday, Feb. 15, 2025, will be postponed until further notice, and until the occupation commits to and provides compensation for the entitlements of the past weeks retroactively, Abu Obeidah added. 'We reaffirm our commitment to the terms of the agreement, as long as the occupation remains committed to them,' Abu Obeidah concluded. On Saturday, February 8, the 21st day of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, the 'Al-Qassam Brigades', Hamas military wing, handed over three Israeli captives to the Red Cross in Deir al-Balah. This handover marked the 'fifth batch' in the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, exchanged for the release of dozens of Palestinian prisoners by ‘Israel’.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2335973	2025-02-10T08:57:58-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2019/07/manar-09143510015639613673.png
Israeli Aggression Escalates Across Southern Lebanon: Tank Advanc...	The Israeli enemy continues its widespread violations across southern Lebanon on Monday, with bombings, explosions, and ground incursions involving tanks and armored personnel carriers. The southern border town of Yaroun is bearing the brunt of these attacks, facing a series of explosions carried out by the Israeli occupation army after advancing into the eastern part of the town. According to Al-Manar correspondent Hashem Al-Sayyed Hasan, a heavily armed Israeli occupation force advanced toward an eastern neighborhood of Yaroun on Sunday, located near the town center and overlooking its main square. The Israeli occupation forces proceeded to rig numerous houses with explosives, demolishing nearly nine homes. 'Three to four houses were destroyed in a single explosion on Sunday, and this area has been subjected to five violent explosions in the past week or ten days, executed by the Israeli occupation army. This brings the total number of homes destroyed in just one week to approximately twenty-five,' Al-Manar's correspondent added. Israeli Tank Advances in Yaroun Later on Monday, Al-Manar's Hashem Al-Sayyed Hasan reported that an Israeli tank advanced toward the northeastern outskirts of Yaroun. Israeli occupation tank advances in Yaroun, south Lebanon (Feb. 10, 2025) He further stated that following this, an armored personnel carrier moved toward the Al-Sawwana neighborhood on the town's northeastern edge. Video: Israeli Occupation Forces Invading Houses Additionally, Zionist forces opened fire directly on a house in the same neighborhood of Al-Sawwana, coinciding with the invasion of the house by several soldiers. Lebanese Army’s Limited Presence in Yaroun Earlier, the Lebanese army deployed in the western part of the town but did not advance toward the town center or the eastern section, allowing Israeli forces to push further into the area. It is important to note that the homes destroyed in recent hours and over the past week are large properties, amplifying the scale of destruction left by the Israeli occupation in Yaroun. Overnight Airstrikes In addition to the ongoing ground violations, the Israeli enemy carried out a series of airstrikes last night, targeting deep southern Lebanon, including the Al-Jabour area and the Rihan Heights, where Israeli warplanes launched multiple raids. Two explosive operations were also carried out in the town of Mays Al-Jabal, alongside another explosion in the town of Kfarkala during the early hours of the evening.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2335764	2025-02-10T06:10:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00023800017391965707.jpg
46 Years On: Hezbollah Lauds Iran’s Islamic Revolution as Histori...	Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance in Lebanon extended its warmest congratulations to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, and the Iranian nation on the 46th anniversary of the victory of the blessed Islamic Revolution. Led by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the revolution reshaped history, overturned a regime of tyranny and oppression, and laid the foundations of a strong and independent Islamic state—one that refuses to bow to global hegemonic powers and instead relies on the will of its people and its religious and humanitarian principles. A Model of Resilience and Sovereignty In a statement issued on Monday, Hezbollah reaffirmed that, under its visionary leadership, the revolution has steered the Iranian nation toward establishing a formidable and pioneering state—one that has attained political sovereignty, scientific innovation, and industrial advancement across multiple domains, despite enduring persistent sanctions, hostilities, and subversive plots. 'More than forty years later, the Islamic Republic stands as a deeply entrenched regional power, solidifying its influence on the international stage and asserting itself as a key force in shaping regional and global affairs.' 'Since its founding, the Islamic Republic of Iran has been a pillar of resistance for just causes across the region. It has unwaveringly supported oppressed nations, emerged as a cornerstone of strength for resistance movements, and remained a resolute advocate for the Palestinian cause—now facing intensified attempts by imperialist forces to eradicate it. This is particularly evident in the policies of the current US administration, which continues to advance schemes designed to erase Palestine from the consciousness of the Muslim world,' the statement continued. An Unwavering Ally in Victory Hezbollah also underscored Iran’s vital role in backing resistance movements, particularly in Lebanon. Since Hezbollah’s inception in 1982, the Islamic Republic has stood firmly by its side, offering extensive support to facilitate the liberation of occupied territories and the defeat of aggressors. This steadfast commitment has been instrumental in shifting power dynamics and securing pivotal victories that have redefined the region’s strategic equation. Late Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Khomeini’s powerful quote in unwavering support of the righteous Palestinian cause Upholding the Revolution’s Core Values Hezbollah concluded its statement by extending its best wishes to the Islamic Republic, under the leadership of Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei, for continued strength, progress, and stability. It reaffirmed that the revolution’s foundational principles—rejecting domination by imperialist powers, championing the Palestinian cause, and fostering unity within the Muslim world—remain the essential safeguards for the future of the nation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2335654	2025-02-10T05:06:35-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-02494310017391924926.jpg

The owners of the demolished homes and lands have appealed to national, human rights, and international institutions to intervene and put an end to these barbaric practices and the ongoing attacks by settlers against Palestinians and their property in the area. Israeli Settlers Rampage against Palestinians Amid Ongoing Raids In the wake of the recent Gaza ceasefire, the occupied West Bank has descended into chaos, with Israeli settlers launching a campaign of violence against Palestinian communities. This 'all-out war' on the Palestinian people continues unabated, according to the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem. 'Since the ceasefire began on January 19, we have been seeing more military raids on cities and villages in the West Bank, so far killing dozens of people,' B'Tselem said in a statement on Sunday. 'This is not what ceasefire looks like.' The group reported that settlers have 'attacked communities almost every night last week, sometimes with soldiers standing by.' In the latest incident, Israeli settlers physically assaulted Palestinians and destroyed olive trees in the town of Khirbet al-Marajem, south of Nablus. The escalating aggression comes as the Israeli occupation military launched a major offensive in the occupied West Bank on January 21, just two days after the Gaza ceasefire took effect. ‘Israel’ claimed the raids were targeting 'resistance fighters,' but the crackdown has resulted in the deaths of at least three Palestinians on Sunday alone.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2335533	2025-02-10T04:40:46-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-03354770017391912404.jpg

It is worth to noted that the Israeli military radio indicated that the Army is going to withdraw from eastern sector of South Lebanon completely.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2334928	2025-02-09T08:58:01-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-06490180017391201767.jpeg
Israeli Occupation Forces Withdraw from Netzarim, Enemy’s Scheme ...	The Israeli occupation military has completed its withdrawal from Gaza’s Netzarim Corridor – a requirement under phase one of the ceasefire deal between 'Israel' and Hamas agreed last month. 'Israeli forces have dismantled their positions and military posts and completely withdrawn their tanks from the Netzarim Corridor on Salaheddin Road, allowing vehicles to pass freely in both directions,' a Hamas official said on Sunday, referring to Salah al-Din Street. The so-called Netzarim Corridor refers to a strip of land that cut off northern Gaza from the rest of the Strip. According to the ceasefire agreement, the deadline for withdrawal was February 9. The full withdrawal of Israeli troops from the corridor took place a day after Hamas and 'Israel' conducted their fifth captive-prisoner swap, which saw the Palestinian group release three Israeli captives in exchange for 183 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. In a statement, Hamas said Israel’s complete withdrawal from the corridor signals a 'continuation of the failure of the goals of the war of extermination against the Palestinian people'. It said the return of displaced Palestinians to their homes and the continuation of the exchange of captives and prisoners refutes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s 'lie' about achieving victory in the 15-month war on the enclave. 'Gaza will remain a land liberated by the hands of its people and its fighters, and forbidden to the occupying invaders and any external force,' it said. Israel created the corridor at the beginning of its war on Gaza. It is a closed-off military zone that stretches from Israeli settlements boundary with Gaza to the Mediterranean Sea and is about 6km (3.7 miles) wide. More than half a million Palestinians were obliged by the Zionist occupation forces to depart norther Gaza in the first month of the war under the pretext of having safer areas in southern Gaza; however, the Israeli massacres chased them across the Strip.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2334873	2025-02-09T03:57:45-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07008640017391022592.jpg
Israeli Enemy Expands Aggression on Occupied Tulkarm, West Bank	The Israeli occupation's aggression on the city of Tulkarm and its refugee camp has entered its 14th day, with Israeli forces escalating their offensive to include Nour Shams refugee camp, located to the east of the city. This escalation has led to widespread destruction of infrastructure and forced residents to flee their homes. Early on Sunday morning, Israeli occupation forces deployed large military reinforcements, including heavy machinery and bulldozers, to Nour Shams camp. They conducted raids on dozens of homes surrounding the camp, accompanied by heavy gunfire and massive explosions, while reconnaissance planes flew at low altitudes overhead. بالفيديو | تعزيزات لقوات الاحتلال برفقة جرافات عسكرية باتجاه مخيم نور شمس شرق #طولكرم pic.twitter.com/Xp2vJASig1 — قناة المنار (@TVManar1) February 9, 2025 The occupation forces also imposed a strict siege on the camp, sealing off all access points and seizing residential buildings in the nearby neighborhoods of Dhannaba, Iktaba, and Al-Salam. In these areas, residents were evicted from their homes, their vehicles taken, and they were forced to walk out of the city under harsh, perilous conditions in the freezing cold. The Israeli forces converted these homes into military outposts and sniper positions. Furthermore, eyewitnesses reported that Israeli forces raided homes in the Al-Nasr and Al-Salihin neighborhoods in the Nour Shams refugee camp. Residents were forced to leave under threat of gunfire and were directed toward the nearby town of Kafr al-Labad. These areas were also transformed into military outposts, and a curfew was imposed. The situation worsened as bulldozers began demolishing roads leading to the camp, including the Nablus Street near the entrance to the camp. They also destroyed the already damaged infrastructure from previous incursions, and deliberately interfered with local internet networks to disrupt communication. The Palestine Red Crescent Society reported that Israeli forces prevented its medical teams from entering the camp, despite receiving alerts about casualties. Israeli forces also detained several residents in the Iktaba neighborhood after raiding their homes. Meanwhile, in Tulkarm refugee camp, Israeli troops continue to deploy large numbers of infantry throughout the area, raiding homes that have mostly been vacated or destroyed after the residents were expelled. The military continues to seize high-rise buildings and convert them into sniper positions while indiscriminately firing live ammunition. Additionally, Israeli infantry forces have spread along Nablus Street, which runs parallel to the entrances of Tulkarm camp, conducting thorough searches in agricultural lands, between homes, and around local facilities. They have also seized a residential building in the area and turned it into a military outpost. In the city of Tulkarm itself, Israeli occupation forces intensified their presence in the eastern district of the city. They raided dozens of homes, particularly in the Al-Diab, Al-Maslakh, and Al-Muqataa neighborhoods, looting contents, inspecting the identities of residents, and seizing surveillance camera footage. Meanwhile, the siege on Thabet Thabet Governmental Hospital remains in place, with Israeli soldiers stationed at both of its entrances, obstructing the movement of ambulances and medical staff. A 23-year-old Palestinian woman, Sundus Jamal Shalabi, and her unborn child were killed today by Israeli occupation forces during their assault on Nour Shams camp east of Tulkarm. The Ministry of Health reported that Sundus, who was eight months pregnant, was killed alongside her baby, and her husband sustained critical head injuries from live gunfire. Israeli occupation forces have continued their assault on the city of Jenin and its refugee camp for the 20th consecutive day, leaving behind 25 fatalities and dozens of injuries since the beginning of the assault.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2334763	2025-02-09T01:20:12-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-09291680017390928051.jpg
Israeli Occupation Forces Conduct Airstrikes in Bekaa, Burn House...	In a blatant violation of ceasefire agreement, the Israeli occupation aircraft carried out on Saturday an airstrike on the outskirts of the eastern Lebanese mountain range in the 'Al-Shaara' area within the villages of Baalbek district. Six people were martyred and two others were injured, in a new Israeli aggression on Lebanon, in an Israeli drone raid on the outskirts of Janta, in the eastern region of Bekaa. The village of Janta area lies close to the Syrian border and the area was already hit by Israeli strikes on January 31st. Additionally, Israeli enemy forces carried out an operation involving the explosion and burning of houses in the town of Adaisseh, South Lebanon. Al-Manar correspondent shared a video showing the so-called UNIFIL peacekeepers patrolling near Israeli occupation forces as they burn civilians' houses in the town of Adaisseh: The skies over the south witnessed intensive flights of Israeli warplanes at medium altitude. This repeated Israeli aggression against Lebanon raises many questions directed at the international committee overseeing the ceasefire agreement, as well as the guarantor countries, specifically the United States and France.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2334565	2025-02-08T09:35:54-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00033750017390361253.png

Netanyahu Office Threatens ‘Action’ as Hamas Conveys 'Tough Messa...	Israeli Prime Minister’s office threatened an 'action' on Saturday as Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades conveyed 'tough messages' during the handover of three Israeli captives held in Gaza for 16 months. In exchange of the three Israeli captives, 183 Palestinian prisoners are due to be released throughout the day. Saturday’s swap is the fifth under the truce agreement, which took effect on January 19, and is part of the first phase of the truce, which lasts for 42 days and runs until early March. Handover Ceremony Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades set up a stage for the handover to the Red Cross in Deir al-Balah, decorated with a sign declaring 'total victory,' the catchphrase used by Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu throughout the war. Banners on the stage read: 'We are the flood, we are the war’s day after.' The three captives appeared on the stage ahead of the handover, surrounded by Al-Qassam Brigades fighters and holding up release certificates. Scenes from the handover of the Israeli captives in Gaza pic.twitter.com/HbIEHRFA7f — The World War (@TheWorldWar12) February 8, 2025 Two of them wore brown outfits declaring them to be prisoners while the third was dressed in an approximation of an Israeli military uniform in reference that he was a military serviceman. As has now become a regular part of the proceedings, representatives of the International Red Cross sat at desks on the stages to sign the handover documents produced by the Palestinian resistance group. 'Tough Messages' Commenting on the handover ceremony, Hamas Spokesman Hazem Qassem said: 'Today’s handover carries a clear message by Al-Qassam that the people and resistance are the ones who shape 'the day after' not any external force.' On the other hand, Israeli Channel 13 quoted sources as saying that the Israeli side conveyed a 'tough message' that 'today’s scene won’t go unnoticed.'

'The shocking images we saw today will not pass without response,' the statement said. 'The government, together with security officials, will support them and their families. Israel is committed to bringing back all the hostages and missing.' A second statement, released a short time later by Netanyahu’s office, said ‘Israel’ would take unspecified actions in response to the conditions of the three Israeli captives. 'Due to the harsh condition of the three hostages and the repeated violations of the Hamas terror groups, the prime minister has ordered that Israel will not gloss over this and will take action as needed,' the statement read.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2334037	2025-02-08T05:32:11-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-065527900173902121610.jpg
Imam Khamenei Hails Gaza Victory, Calls for Continued Resistance	In a meeting with a senior Hamas delegation, Iran's Supreme Leader Imam sayyed Ali Khamenei Khamenei praised the Palestinian resistance for defeating ‘Israel’ and the United States in the recent Gaza war, describing the ceasefire agreement as a 'great achievement.' Imam Khamenei received Hamas Shura Council chairman Muhammad Ismail Darwish and other members of the group's political bureau in Tehran on Saturday. He told the visiting delegation that 'God Almighty granted you and the people of Gaza honor and victory' against the Zionist regime and the US. Ayatollah Khamenei receives senior Hamas delegation — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) February 8, 2025 'You overcame the Zionist regime and, in fact, the US and by the grace of God, you did not let them achieve any of their goals,' the Leader added. He called on the Palestinian resistance to stay resolute, saying it is 'necessary to plan for cultural works and continue the current path of PR works alongside military affairs and the reconstruction of Gaza.' Imam Khamenei highlighted the 'suffering of the Gazan people for a year and half of the Israeli war,' stating that the ultimate result is 'the victory of right over wrong.' He described faith as the main 'asymmetric weapon' of the resistance front against the enemy. The Supreme Leader also praised the Hamas negotiators, saying their ceasefire deal forcing ‘Israel’ to halt its 'brutal war on Gaza and release thousands of Palestinian prisoners is a 'great achievement.'' The first phase of the agreement calls for the release of 33 Israeli captives and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Imam Khamenei stressed that the issue of Palestine is a 'resolved' matter for Iran, and the 'ultimate victory belongs to the Palestinian people.' He urged the resistance to move forward with the 'strength of faith and hope for divine assistance' despite any challenges. On Thursday, the United States imposed its first sanctions on Iran after Trump revived his so-called maximum pressure strategy against the Islamic Republic. Imam Khamenei said there is no question in the minds of the Iranian people about defending Palestine and supporting the Palestinian people, and the issue is a 'resolved' matter. 'Palestine is a major issue for us and the victory of Palestine is also a definite issue for us,' the Leader said. The Shura Council is the main consultative body of Hamas that elects the resistance movement's politburo. The visit to Tehran by Darwish and his team is part of their regional tour which has already taken them to Egypt and Turkey.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2333894	2025-02-08T04:16:57-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00635950017390170057.jpg

On the 21st day of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, the 'Al-Qassam Brigades' handed over three Israeli captives to the Red Cross in Deir al-Balah.

Meanwhile, the Israeli army warned Palestinian families against celebrating the release of their relatives, with the occupation forces summoning the families of Jerusalemite prisoners for investigation. In the same context, Red Cross vehicles arrived in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, to receive the three Zionist prisoners from the 'Al-Qassam Brigades' (the military wing of Hamas). Regarding the place of handover, the Israeli 'Channel 12' pointed out that 'Hamas chose a populated area this time, perhaps as a signal to Trump, who claimed that the Strip is completely destroyed and uninhabitable.' Earlier, Palestinian sources indicated that the occupation forces opened fire along the Salah al-Din axis in the central Gaza Strip.

The enemy army said that its air force had completed its preparations to receive the prisoners returning to the occupied territories from the Strip. According to the Prisoners' Information Office, the occupation is supposed to release 18 prisoners with 'life sentences', 54 prisoners with high sentences, and 111 prisoners from the Gaza Strip who were 'not involved', according to the enemy's description, in the events of October 7, 2023. According to the list published yesterday evening, 7 of the prisoners will be deported outside Palestine. 38 of those included in the fifth batch belong to Hamas, 30 to Fatah, one to Islamic Jihad, and 3 do not belong to organizations. The prisoner exchange process has been a point of contention, with the Israeli government threatening to prevent West Bank celebrations. This comes as the Israeli delegation is expected to head to Doha to discuss the implementation of the ceasefire agreement's second phase. Hamas has expressed its commitment to the agreement, while warning that the failure to bring equipment into Gaza will make it impossible to retrieve the dead Israeli prisoners from under the rubble of destroyed buildings. The swap deal has also sparked political tensions, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commenting on the establishment of a Palestinian state, calling it 'a huge prize for terrorism.' The Mossad chief is expected to lead the Israeli delegation to the negotiations, with reports suggesting Netanyahu may seek to postpone the implementation of the second phase.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2333751	2025-02-08T02:41:48-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-05641850017390112992.jpg
US Approves Massive $7 Billion Arms Deal with ‘Israel’ Amid Gaza ...	The US State Department has approved a major $7 billion arms sale to ‘Israel’, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) announced on Friday. The sale includes a wide range of munitions, guidance kits, fuzes, and related support equipment. Additionally, the US has approved the sale of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and related equipment to Israel, valued at approximately $660 million. The approval follows continued US military support for the Israeli occupation amid its ongoing aggression on the Gaza Strip and occupied Palestine, in addition to Lebanon and Syria. This latest arms deal comes as the Biden administration had previously suspended a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs due to concerns over Israel's expected assault on Rafah. Trump Calls for Mass Expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza The approval of the arms deal coincides with former President Trump's recent endorsement of Israel's war on Gaza. In remarks aboard Air Force One last month, Trump described Gaza as a 'demolition site' and called for the mass expulsion of its population. Israeli army ‘seriously doubts’ success of Trump’s plan to ethnically cleanse, control Gaza — The Cradle (@TheCradleMedia) February 7, 2025 'I'd like Egypt to take people. And I'd like Jordan to take people. We just clean out that whole thing,' Trump stated, framing this forced displacement as a step toward 'Middle East peace.' This position was echoed by Trump's son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner, who suggested Gaza's waterfront would be 'very valuable' if its Palestinian residents were removed. Continued Bipartisan Support The sales are subject to congressional review, but approvals of such deals have historically faced little resistance. This latest arms deal follows an earlier $8 billion weapons package initially proposed under the Biden administration. Although some Democratic lawmakers have attempted to delay its approval, Washington's military support for Israel has remained unwavering.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2333729	2025-02-08T01:00:26-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07169730017387823318.jpg
Israeli Enemy Blatantly Violates Ceasefire Agreement, Conducts Ai...	The Israeli enemy further blatantly breaches the ceasefire agreement with Lebanon, conducting airstrikes across southern areas and Beqaa, and explosions, leaving casualties. Israeli enemy warplanes carried out an airstrike targeting the town of Al-Baissaria in southern Lebanon. According to the National News Agency, two martyrs and two injured individuals were reported following an explosion at a house in the town of Tayr Harfa in the Tyre district. The explosion was believed to have been caused by an Israeli bomb planted in the house. In addition, Al-Manar’s correspondent in the south reported several significant developments. He mentioned that an Israeli tank and an armored personnel carrier infiltrated the Khallat Ashour area on the eastern outskirts of the town of Yaroun. Al-Manar's correspondent also reported that the outskirts of Kfar Shouba town came under heavy gunfire from the Israeli military position at Rweisat Al-Alam. Furthermore, the correspondent highlighted that three explosions targeted civilian homes in the town of Kfar Kila, which were carried out by the Israeli enemy on Friday evening. Later on Friday, Israeli enemy carried out bombings in the southern town of Mays Al-Jabal. Continued Israeli Aggression in the South and Bekaa The Israeli air force also launched a series of airstrikes on Thursday evening, targeting areas between Azza and Roumin in southern Lebanon, as well as the Bekaa Valley, including the outskirts of the towns of Brital, Nabi Sheet, and Al-Khareiba. On both Thursday evening and Friday morning, Israeli enemy warplanes and drones were seen conducting low-altitude flights over the Bekaa Valley and the Lebanese capital, Beirut.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2333454	2025-02-07T11:47:02-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-03691310017389574344.jpg
Hezbollah Strongly Denounces Trump’s Call for Displacing Palestin...	Hezbollah strongly denounced former US President Donald Trump’s call for the forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, describing it as 'a blatant expression of racist, fascist ideology that threatens humanity at its core.' In a statement issued on Friday, the group asserted that 'the right of people to their land is a fundamental principle enshrined in all international laws and conventions—an inalienable right that cannot be revoked, violated, or relinquished under any form of coercion.' US History of Settler Colonialism The statement further criticized the 'arrogance and delusions of grandeur' guiding US policies, arguing that Trump and his administration believe they can replicate 'the dark history of the US' founding—built on the organized extermination of Indigenous populations and the replacement of native peoples with settlers.' Hezbollah warned that the same model is now being pursued in Palestine through forced displacement, stating that 'after the US-Israeli war machine, backed by Western powers, failed to break the will of the Palestinian people, Trump and his allies now seek to uproot them entirely and hand their land to the Zionists.' However, the group emphasized that 'the resilience of the Palestinian resistance and the people of Gaza has proven that they will not be erased.' ‘What the Israeli enemy Failed to Achieve Through War, It Will Not Achieve Through Deception’ Hezbollah asserted that 'what the enemy could not seize through war, it will not obtain through deceptive slogans about offering Gazans a ‘better life’ outside their homeland.' The party described Trump’s proposal as 'a dangerous scheme that defies logic and nature, revealing the extent of ongoing conspiracies against the Palestinian people.' Call for Unified Resistance Hezbollah reaffirmed its belief that 'those who thwarted the war of extermination will also defeat the war of ethnic cleansing.' The party warned that 'Trump and his backers will come to realize that this sacred land will never yield to American madness.' It called on 'all honorable people across the Arab and Muslim world, and beyond, to stand together in rejecting this disgraceful plot.' Warning to Arab and Muslim Nations Hezbollah urged Arab and Muslim countries to take concrete steps to counter 'this colonial project,' warning that 'if this scheme succeeds, it will bring catastrophic consequences—no independence, no resources, and no sovereign nations.' The party cautioned that 'any leniency in confronting this plan will pave the way for the mass expulsion of West Bank residents and, eventually, all Palestinians in the occupied 1948 territories.' ‘Gaza Will Remain for Its People, Palestine Will Remain for Its People’ Concluding its statement, Hezbollah declared that 'this latest aggression against Palestine and its people is doomed to total failure.' It stressed that 'the Palestinian people, alongside all those who stand for justice, will remain steadfast in their land.' The group asserted that 'neither Trump’s power nor his conspiracies will break Palestinian resolve—rather, his plan will collapse, while Gaza and Palestine will remain in the hands of their rightful people.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2333366	2025-02-07T10:20:26-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-04165050017056142612.png
Hezbollah MP Slams US Envoy Ortagus’ Remarks as ‘Blatant Interfer...	The head of Hezbollah’s loyalty to resistance parliamentary bloc, MP Mohammad Raad, denounced the remarks made by US Deputy Special Envoy to the Middle East, Morgan Ortagus, during her visit to Baabda Palace, calling them 'a blatant interference in Lebanese sovereignty' and 'a violation of diplomatic norms and international protocols.' He described her statements as 'filled with hatred and irresponsibility' and an attack on 'a national political entity that is an integral part of Lebanon’s political and national consensus.' Commenting on the official response from the Lebanese Presidency, which distanced itself from Ortagus’ remarks, MP Raad said, 'The Presidential Palace’s statement distancing itself from her remarks is sufficient. There is no need to dwell further on her words.' Criticism of US, Israeli Enemy Policies Hezbollah's Raad went on to criticize the US stance, stating, 'Those who claim to fight corruption should not be harboring terrorism. The 'Israeli' regime, which enjoys US political backing, undermines the very credibility of the democracy that Washington claims to uphold.' 'The atrocities committed by the Israeli enemy in its wars on Gaza and Lebanon are more than enough for the world to judge who truly supports, funds, and arms terrorism—who displaces people from their land and deprives them of their rights, all while violating international law and global humanitarian standards,' Raad added. MP Raad dismissed further discussion on those who openly express hostility toward Hezbollah, emphasizing, 'The true victor is the one who has exposed the brutal reality of the aggressor, a regime engaged in genocide—targeting civilians, destroying homes, hospitals, and entire neighborhoods. This is an occupying force that has no legitimate right to claim self-defense.' Defending the Resistance Concluding his remarks, MP Raad reaffirmed Hezbollah’s commitment to Lebanon’s defense, stating, 'We place our trust in the will of our people, who remain steadfast in their choice of resistance. This is the reality that safeguards Lebanon’s sovereignty through the equation of the army, the people, and the resistance—a formula Lebanon can take pride in as a means of protecting its sovereignty.' During her visit to Baabda, Morgan Ortagus voiced US support for Lebanon, linking growing American and diaspora interest to what she called 'Hezbollah’s defeat by Israel.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2333223	2025-02-07T09:03:20-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01890960017389475937.png

'We are grateful to our ally Israel for defeating Hezbollah,' Ortagus said in a press conference, following a meeting with President Aoun. 'It is thanks to the Lebanese President Aoun and the Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam and everyone in this government who is committed to an end of corruption, who is committed to reforms and who is committed to making sure that Hezbollah is not a part of the new government in any form,' the US diplomat added.

For his part, President Aoun, emphasized that 'permanent stability in south Lebanon is closely linked to the completion of the Israeli withdrawal from the territories it occupied during the last war, and the full implementation of Resolution 1701, including the provisions of the November 27 ceasefire agreement.' 'The release of Lebanese prisoners is an integral part of this agreement,' the president added, as cited by Lebanon’s National News Agency.

Gallant made on Wednesday his first interview since being sacked in November. The ex-DM accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet of delaying a ceasefire deal that would have led to the return of more living captives.

'I think that the Israeli government did not do everything it could have to return the hostages,' Gallant told the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper in the interview, was to be published in full on Friday. Gallant said the framework of the current ceasefire-captive deal looks nearly identical to an earlier proposal, on the table in April and finalized over the summer. If it had been accepted then, he insisted, ‘Israel’ could have brought back more living hostages while releasing fewer Palestinian security prisoners. 'In practice, we could have gotten the same deal with more hostages, and at a lower price, because 110 terrorists serving life sentences were not in discussions then,' Gallant said, referring to Palestinian prisoners who were freed by the Israeli occupation authorities as part of the swap deal.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2333014	2025-02-07T04:03:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-09840080017389293224.jpg

Imam Khamenei Warns: Any US Threat to Iran’s Security Will Be Met...	On the anniversary of the historic 'Homafaran Allegiance' in which Iranian Air Force commanders pledged loyalty to Imam Khomeini, Imam sayyed Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, issued a stern warning to the United States. In a meeting with senior military commanders on February 7, 2025, Khamenei made it unequivocally clear that Iran will not hesitate to respond forcefully if the U.S. threatens Iran's security. 'If the US threatens our security, we'll respond by threatening its security,' Khamenei stated. Leader dismissed past negotiations with the US as futile, noting that 'Negotiating with the United States is not smart, not wise, nor honorable, and experience has proven this.' Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei warns of a tit-for-tat move against the US, in case Washington violates the Iranian nation’s security. Follow us on Telegram: pic.twitter.com/YXFMolUvLk — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) February 7, 2025 Imam Khamenei accused the US of arrogantly attempting to 'redraw the map of the world,' dismissing such rhetoric as empty posturing. However, he made it plain that Iran will defend its sovereignty at all costs. 'If they threaten us, we will threaten them in return. If they carry out their threat, we will act on ours. If they attack our nation's security, we will attack their security without hesitation.' The Iranian leader's remarks come against the backdrop of the US withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal, which Khamenei said saw Iran making 'generous concessions' that were ultimately disregarded by Washington. This experience has left Iran deeply skeptical of future negotiations with the United States. Imam Khamenei's uncompromising stance sends a clear message that any attempt by the US to undermine Iran's security will be met with a swift and decisive response. The war of words between Tehran and Washington appears to be escalating, raising concerns about the potential for a dangerous confrontation in the region.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2332948	2025-02-07T03:06:06-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07130110017389263593.jpg
Israeli Air Raids Target South Lebanon, Bekaa	The Zionist enemy launched late Thursday a large-scale aerial aggression on Lebanon in a flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement in accordance with the UN Resolution 1701. In this context, Al-Manar TV correspondent reported that 'the Zionist warplanes raided the area between Azza and Rumin in southern Lebanon.' The Israeli enemy's warplanes also launched a series of raids targeting the Bekaa region, and intensive flights of the Zionist warplanes at low altitude were recorded in the skies of Bekaa, Beirut, and other coastal cities. It is worth to recall that the United States and France sponsor the ceasefire in South Lebanon, but do not take any measure to prevent the Israeli enemy from attacking Lebanon. Two people were martyred and ten others were injured early on Friday, in a new Israeli aggression on Lebanon, this time of the eastern region of Bekaa.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2332651	2025-02-06T14:04:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-03385510017388794585.jpg
Gaza Faces Cold Threat due to Israeli Hindrance of Aid Flow	The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) warned today that heavy rains and strong winds in the Gaza Strip are putting hundreds of thousands of Palestinian citizens at risk of severe cold. This comes after their homes were destroyed during Israel's 15-month-long genocidal war. In a post shared on X, the agency stated that many Palestinian families are still living in temporary shelters due to the widespread destruction across the Gaza Strip, with the recent intense weather, including torrential rain and harsh winds, significantly exacerbating the situation. 'Heavy rain and strong winds in Gaza have left hundreds of thousands exposed to cold and wet conditions in the past 24 hours. Many families remain in makeshift shelters due to widespread destruction,' said the UNRWA. UNRWA further noted that its teams are continuing to provide much-needed urgent assistance, including tents, mattresses, blankets, and clothing for the displaced population throughout the region. The agency also released a video showing strong winds ripping apart the makeshift tents of the displaced, made from cloth and nylon, scattering their belongings in the Al-Mawasi area, northwest of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. It is worth noting that the Israeli hindrance of the aid flow to Gaza has exacerbated the humanitarian conditions in the Strip. Medical sources announced Thursday that the death toll in the Gaza Strip has risen to 47,583, the majority of whom are children and women, since the beginning of the Israeli occupation war on October 7, 2023. The same sources added that the death toll has risen to 111,633 since the beginning of the aggression, while a number of victims are still under the rubble and on the roads, and ambulance and civil defense crews cannot reach them. They affirmed that 31 martyred Palestinians and four injuries arrived at Gaza Strip hospitals during the past 24 hours.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2332618	2025-02-06T13:38:45-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00522540017388778988.jpg
Israeli Occupation Forces Continue Military Offensive in Tulkarm,...	Israeli occupation forces detained several young men from the outskirts of Tulkarm this evening, continuing their aggressive offensive against the city and its refugee camp for the 11th consecutive day. According to local sources, Israeli occupation forces detained four young men from the Dannaba neighborhood east of Tulkarm after raiding several homes. Witnesses reported that the forces assaulted a fifth detainee, leaving him bleeding. At the same time, the occupation forces deployed additional military reinforcements, including infantry units and vehicles, towards Tulkarm and its refugee camp. They also continued to impose a siege on the Thabet Thabet Government Hospital, while taking control of the adjacent Al-Adawiya commercial complex, turning it into a military outpost and surveillance point. Furthermore, the Israeli occupation forces seized the Al-Burhan building in the eastern neighborhood of the city, located near the southwestern entrance to the Tulkarm refugee camp. They also raided several homes in the area, conducting searches, checking the identities of residents, and interrogating them on the spot. Witnesses reported that the soldiers forced the residents of the building to leave under the threat of weapons, exposing them to the freezing cold, and proceeded to bring in their military equipment. In addition to the ongoing offensive in Tulkarm city, the Israeli occupation forces continued their siege on the adjacent Tulkarm refugee camp, deploying snipers inside buildings surrounding the camp and raiding homes to turn them into military posts. Meanwhile, Israeli occupation forces also stormed the town of Attil, north of Tulkarm, where they raided and searched several homes. They patrolled the main streets connecting Attil with the neighboring villages and towns. Moreover, a separate Israeli force broke into the town of Kafr al-Labad, east of the governorate, and conducted similar raids, although no detentions were reported. Meanwhile, Palestinian resistance fighters targeted Israeli occupation forces in southwestern Jenin with an IED explosion. The Palestinian resistance fighters also detonated a large explosive device in Al-Faraa camp, south of Tubas, occupied West Bank, according to local reports.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2332596	2025-02-06T13:24:11-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/11/manar-08176640016686074273.png
US-Israeli Circles Describe Trump’s Gaza Plan as Unrealistic: Sav...	An overwhelming joy pervaded in the Zionist entity after the shocking remarks of the US President Donald Trump about the displacement of Gaza residents and the American control of the Strip. However, considerable statements were issued in Washington and Tel Aviv to cast doubts on the unrealistic approach of the American proposal. NYT paper quoted Trump's advisers as saying that Gaza displacement plan is not applicable despite the celebratory polls in the occupation entity which showed that most of the Israelis favor the scheme. The newspaper also quoted the former US ambassador to the occupation entity Dan Shapiro as considering that Trump's plan is not serious and endangers the release of the rest of the Zionist captives in Gaza. US sources, according to NYT, added that the plan even shocked the Trump administration's officials, noting that it lacks a feasibility study. The former Israeli military intelligence commander Amos Yadlin said that the chance for the implementation of Trump's plan is very low. Moreover, Maariv newspaper mentioned that security chiefs in 'Israel' considered that announcing the plan during the ceasefire and the prisoner swap deal is problematic. Based on all the given data, observers wonder about the real motives behind Trump's plan. Among the basic interpretation's of the US President's move is saving Netanyahu's coalition from further collapses in light of the implementation of Gaza ceasefire. Trump says 'Israel' will hand over Gaza to US after fighting ends 'The Gaza Strip would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting,' Trump said on Thursday. He reiterated that the idea would mean resettling Palestinians, and that no US soldiers would be needed. Trump's resettlement idea has prompted accusations that he is planning ethnic cleansing, and has drawn condemnation from the UN, human rights groups and Arab leaders. Analysts doubt it will ever happen. After Trump's first comments on the issue, his officials suggested any relocation would be only temporary. Under his plan, Trump wrote on Truth Social, Gazans 'would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region'. The US would then be part of an effort to redevelop the enclave, he said. His post did not make clear whether the two million residents of the Palestinian territory would be invited to return. Under international law, attempts to forcibly transfer populations from occupied territory are strictly prohibited. Netanyahu 'This is the first good idea that I’ve heard,' Netanyahu said in an interview with Fox News. 'It’s a remarkable idea. And I think it should be examined, pursued, and done because I think it will create a different future for everyone.' 'I don’t think he talked about sending US troops,' he said. 'I also don’t think he said he’s going to fund it. He said that neighboring states, wealthy states, would do it.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a video message issued June 19, 2024. Katz Israel's defense minister said Thursday that he had instructed his military to prepare a plan to allow Palestinians to voluntarily leave the Gaza Strip. Welcoming what he called Trump's 'bold initiative,' Israel Katz said in a statement Thursday that Palestinians in Gaza 'should be granted the freedom to leave and emigrate, as is customary everywhere in the world.' He said the plan would include 'exit options' for Palestinians to leave Gaza via land crossings, with the possibility of 'special arrangements' for departures by sea and air. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz (image from archive), Opposing Stances Britain will oppose any attempts to forcibly remove Palestinians from Gaza, a Foreign Office minister has said, confirming for the first time that the government will block Donald Trump’s controversial plans for the enclave. Development minister Anneliese Dodds said the future of Gaza must be determined by Palestinians with the support of neighboring countries and the international community. And, in a rebuke to the US president, Ms Dodds said: 'We would oppose any effort to move Palestinians in Gaza to neighboring Arab states against their will.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2332519	2025-02-06T13:11:09-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-05221510017388762573.jpg

It is unprecedented in Lebanon that the President of the Republic hosts the Speaker of the Parliament and the prime minister-designate in addition to other officials concerned with the cabinet formation at Baabda Palace, and the meeting ends before the new government is born. On Thursday, President Jospeh Aoun welcomed House Speaker Nabih Berri and PM-designate Naw3af Salam to announce the governmental line-up; however, their meeting withered before any breakthrough is reached. Before the end of the tripartite meeting, Speaker Berri left. Five minutes later, Salam left Baabda Palace without making any statement. According to Al-Manar reporter, Salam insisted on naming the fifth Shiite minister, rejecting the proposal of choosing one from a list proposed by the national duo (Hezbollah and Amal Movement). Hezbollah and Amal Movement named four of the five Shiite ministers and provided a list of suggestions for the PM-designate to choose the fifth member of the cabinet in accordance with the Constitution and the political norms. The reporter noted that the consultations are underway for the sake of announcing the new government on Friday or Saturday.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2332409	2025-02-06T08:24:33-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-09635610017388590635.png

Two Israeli occupation soldiers were killed and eight others injured after a crane collapsed in the northern Gaza Strip on Thursday. The Israeli occupation military announced the accident, stating that one of the deceased was a lieutenant colonel serving in the reserves with the 51st Battalion of the Golani Brigade. According to the official Israeli Broadcasting Authority, the crane collapsed due to strong winds and fell on a tent where the occupation soldiers were stationed. The military said it is investigating the 'serious incident that reflects a lack of preparedness for weather conditions.' This incident comes as the Gaza Strip and nearby areas are experiencing a low-pressure system accompanied by rain and strong winds.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2332090	2025-02-06T01:52:52-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-05489260017388355663.jpg

Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem wrote a letter to the wounded fighters of the Islamic Resistance, describing them as living martyrs. Sheikh Qassem stressed that the wounds of the Islamic Resistance fighters have broken the Israeli enemy's aspirations, defeated its goals, and become voices that resound with the truth. His eminence also affirmed that the resistance would continue and become stronger. What follows is the text of the letter: In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful My beloved wounded mujahideen, men, women and children. Greetings to you, living martyrs, who have attained the status of martyrs and have not yet passed on to the eternal home, to complete your role in advancement and elevation on the path of faith, jihad, guardianship and resistance. You are more afflicted than those who strive in the way of Allah, because your painful wounds accompany you at every moment, without deterring you from continuing to give and sacrifice. You are the followers of Abu al-Fadl al-Abbas (peace be upon him), the protector of the march, led by the Master of Martyrs, Imam Hussein (peace be upon him), at the peak of self-sacrifice in Allah and sacrifice for His sake, in Karbala, martyrdom and support for religion and truth. How wonderful is this description in the visit of Abu al-Fadl al-Abbas, which applies to you: 'The best patient, struggling, supportive advocate and brother defending his brother, the one who responds to the obedience of his Lord, the one who desires that no one else has neglected in terms of the abundant reward and beautiful praise, and may God join you to the level of your fathers in the gardens of bliss.' Your enemy is the Israeli entity and its supporter America, and it is the most brutal tyrant in our world today, but with your wounds you have broken its aspirations, defeated its goals, and become voices that resound with the truth, you are the loyal ones to the master of the martyrs of the nation, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah (may God be pleased with him), and to all the martyrs, prisoners, wounded and believers in this line, and God Almighty has kept you alive so that you can complete your mission and carry out your role as much as you can. The march of resistance and liberation continues, and it will be stronger with the mujahideen, the wounded, the prisoners and the loyal and honorable people, this is the biography of the prophets and imams, the biography of the Imam Al-Mahdi (may Allah hasten his reappearance), the biography of Imam Khomeini (may his shadow be prolonged), the Master of the Martyrs of the Nation, Sayyed Hassan (may Allah be pleased with him) and Sayyed Hashemi (may Allah be pleased with him), and the martyrs, the Almighty said: 'And We desired to bestow favor upon those who were oppressed in the land and make them leaders and make them heirs.' Your reward is reserved with Allah, as Imam Zayn al-Abidin (peace be upon him) said: 'May Allah have mercy on Abbas, for he preferred and sacrificed his brother with his life until his hands were cut off, so Allah the Almighty replaced them with two wings with which he flies with the angels in Paradise, as He made for Ja’far ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon him), and Abbas has a status with Allah the Blessed and Exalted that all the martyrs will envy him for on the Day of Resurrection.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2331903	2025-02-05T14:44:22-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/05/manar-07421790016847652706.jpeg

Israeli Occupation Forces Expel Hundreds of Families from Norther...	Israeli occupation forces Wednesday detained eight Palestinians in the course of the ongoing aggression on Tammun town, south of the northern occupied West Bank city of Tubas, according to the Palestine Prisoner’s Society (PPS). Kamal Bani Odeh, Director of the PPS Office in Tubas, said that the occupying forces rounded up eight residents from the town since the morning hours. He added that the gun-toting soldiers were still conducting house-to-house raids in the town, arresting civilians and subjecting them to interrogation. The Zionist Occupation Army announced on Wednesday it expelled around two thousand residents of Tulkarm camp, during the ongoing offensive in northern West Bank. The occupation forces have continued a massive onslaught on Tammun town and al-Faraa refugee camp for the fourth consecutive day, maintaining a tight siege and causing a shortage of water, a lack of essential supplies such as infant formula, diapers, and medicine. They deliberately ploughed through infrastructure, destroying main water pipelines, leading to a water shortage and causing a power outage in parts of the town and the camp.

This comes as the occupation forces tightened military measures across the occupied West Bank hours after the release of 90 Palestinian prisoners as part of the Gaza ceasefire went into effect, dismembering and isolating cities and governorates one from the other using military gates, barriers and concrete blocks. The Israeli military measures are in parallel with ongoing attacks by Israeli colonists across the West Bank to terrorize Palestinians and displace them from their lands to seize them and build illegal Jewish colonies that separate Palestinian communities. Closures besides to other measures, taken under the guise of security, are intended to entrench Israel’s 58-year-old military occupation of the West Bank and its settler colonial project which it enforces with routine and frequently deadly violence against Palestinians.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2331815	2025-02-05T12:21:23-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-08796390017387866845.jpg
Global Stance on Trump Remarks Highlights Widespread Rejection of...	US President Donald Trump’s statements regarding 'taking over' Gaza and 'relocating' its population have stirred worldwide condemnation, highlighting the widespread rejection of any forced displacement of Palestinians. Leaders from across the political spectrum, human rights organizations, and international institutions have reaffirmed the necessity of upholding international law and ensuring Palestinians’ right to remain in their homeland, an international law that also respects their right to armed resistance against a blatant occupier. Western Countries Beginning with the US’ closest ally in Europe, the United Kingdom, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that the Palestinians of Gaza 'must be allowed a home, they must be allowed to rebuild, and we should be with them in that rebuilding on the way to a two-state solution.' For their part, EU Member state leaders also had their own comments to make. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the Gaza Strip belongs to Palestinians and their expulsion would be unacceptable and contrary to international law. 'It would also lead to new suffering and new hatred&#8230;There must be no solution over the heads of the Palestinians.' French Foreign Ministry Spokesman Christopher Lemoine said that 'France reiterates its opposition to any forced displacement of the Palestinian population of Gaza, which would constitute a serious violation of international law, an attack on the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians, but also a major obstacle to the two-state solution and a major destabilizing factor for our close partners Egypt and Jordan as well as for the entire region.' On the other hand, the Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares Bueno, stated: 'I want to be very clear on this: Gaza is the land of Gazan Palestinians and they must stay in Gaza. Gaza is part of the future Palestinian state Spain supports and has to coexist guaranteeing the Israeli state's prosperity and safety.' At a news conference with Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington on Tuesday, Trump declared that the US 'will take over Gaza, level it and create the Riviera of the Middle East,' after brazenly calling the whole territory a 'demolition zone'. ⚡️🇺🇸BREAKING: Donald Trump announces that the U.S will take over Gaza: 'The US will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too.

(@SuppressedNws) February 5, 2025 Russia, China, Other Countries Commenting on Trump’s remarks, Russia believes a settlement in West Asia is the only possible basis of a two-state solution. 'This is the thesis that is enshrined in the relevant UN Security Council resolution, this is the thesis that is shared by the overwhelming majority of countries involved in this problem. We proceed from it, we support it and believe that this is the only possible option,' Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the matter as well: 'China hopes all parties will take ceasefire and post-conflict governance as an opportunity to bring the Palestinian issue back on the right track of political settlement based on the two-state solution.' 'Trump's comments on a plan to take over Gaza are unacceptable. Any plans leaving Palestinians 'out of the equation' would lead to more conflict'. Turkey’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva expressed shock at Trump’s supposed plan: 'It makes no sense &#8230; Where would Palestinians live? This is something incomprehensible to any human being&#8230;Palestinians are the ones who need to take care of Gaza.'

Any idea of displacing the people of Gaza anywhere else would be in clear contradiction with UN Security Council resolutions.' Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese supported a two-state solution similar to the statements of his European counterparts. 'Australia's position is the same as it was this morning, as it was last year. The Australian government supports on a bipartisan basis a two-state solution.' Int’l Organizations Human rights organizations also condemned Trump’s statements across the board, the UN human rights office stated that, 'It is crucial that we move towards the next phase of the ceasefire, to release all hostages and arbitrarily detained prisoners, end the war and reconstruct Gaza, with full respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights law. 'Any forcible transfer in or deportation of people from occupied territory is strictly prohibited.' 'It would be a moral abomination,' said Omar Shakir, Director of Human Rights Watch's 'Israel' and Palestine branch. 'International humanitarian law forbids the forced displacement of the population of an occupied territory. When such forced displacement is widespread, it can amount to a war crime or a crime against humanity.' 'Any plan to forcibly deport Palestinians outside the occupied territory against their will is a war crime, and when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack on the civilian population, it would constitute a crime against humanity' – Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2331760	2025-02-05T11:06:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07169730017387823318.jpg
Hezbollah Leader’s Advisor: World Witnessing Unprecedented US Tyr...	The political advisor to the Secretary-General of Hezbollah, Sayyed Hussein Al-Moussawi, commented on the US President Donal Trump's remarks on the displacement of Gaza residents. Al-Moussawi said that, today, the world is witnessing an unprecedented tyrannical behavior by American officials in their dealings with the states and peoples, especially their neighbors in North and South America, highlighting the criminal orders they are directing 'to our people in Gaza and the West Bank, which require them to be expelled from the land of their ancestors and grandfathers to Egypt and Jordan'. 'The silence and indifference of the free Americans and Europeans as well as the entire free world that filled the streets chanting for Palestine and denouncing the war of extermination declared on Gaza may disappoint those who were optimistic about the voices of the free, which we must hear loudly in the face of the new ongoing American-Zionist aggression that the monsters denounce.' As for the cowardly Arabs, they have made us lose all hope in their return to the nation of their noble Prophet (PBUH), which was the best nation brought forth for mankind, Sayyed Al-Moussawi concluded.

Iran to Trump: Another Maximum Pressure, Another Defeat for Washi...	Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has asserted that another round of deployment of the 'maximum pressure' policy on the part of the United States against Iran will only lead to another defeat. 'The policy of maximum pressure has already proven to be a failure, and any attempt to revive it will only lead to another defeat,' the top diplomat told reporters on the sidelines of a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. ‘Doomed to fail again’: Iran dismisses renewed U.S. ‘maximum pressure’ policy pic.twitter.com/5M60vSaWCr — IRNA News Agency (@IrnaEnglish) February 5, 2025 Araghchi was referring to the policy that the US adopted during Donald Trump’s former tenure, as part of which Washington quit a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and world powers, returned the sanctions that the agreement had lifted, and piled up even more illegal and unilateral bans against the Islamic Republic. Retaliating against the measures, Iran took legitimate nuclear steps that have featured its operationalizing advanced centrifuges among other things. The country also explored various means to skirt the sanctions and boost its economy by fostering foreign trade and enhancing domestic production, causing Washington to suffer 'maximum defeat' in adoption of such policy. On Tuesday, Trump promoted new 'tough' measures aimed at, what Washington has called, 'deterring' Iran from obtaining a 'nuclear weapon.' Trump also signed a presidential memorandum, authorizing stricter illegal actions against Iran, while saying, 'They can’t have a nuclear weapon, we’d be very tough if they insist on doing that.' Washington’s adversarial stance comes despite Tehran’s repeated assurances that its nuclear activities remain in full compliance with international regulations, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)’s invariable verification of the peaceful nature of the Islamic Republic’s nuclear energy program. Reacting to Trump’s remarks, Araghchi said, 'If the main issue is that Iran should not pursue nuclear weapons, this is achievable and not a difficult matter.' 'Iran's stance is clear, and it is a member of the NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty), and there is also the fatwa (religious decree) of the Leader, which has clarified the matter for us,' he added. Leader of the Islamic Revolution Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei’s has prohibited pursuance, attainment, and storage of such non-conventional arms through an official decree as per religious and moral grounds. 'The Leader’s fatwa has made Iran’s position crystal clear,' Araghchi concluded. 'Iran has never had, will never have nuclear weapons program' Also on Wednesday, Mohammad Eslami, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), likewise reacted to Trump’s remarks, saying, 'Iran has never had, does not have, and will not have a nuclear weapons program. Iran's approach in this regard is absolutely clear.' He added, 'Iran's peaceful nuclear program is being implemented within the framework of Safeguards [Agreement] and the NPT.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2331375	2025-02-05T03:18:56-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-08391110017387543318.jpg
Palestinian Leaders Fiercely Condom Trump’s Proposal to Seize Con...	Palestinian officials and factions have roundly condemned former US President Donald Trump's recent remarks about a potential US takeover of the Gaza Strip. Senior Hamas leaders described Trump's comments as a reflection of 'ignorance' and an 'unwavering alignment' with Israeli interests. Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri dismissed the remarks as 'ridiculous' and 'absurd', warning they could inflame tensions across the region. BREAKING | Trump: 'The US will take over the Gaza Strip.' pic.twitter.com/N1NzzUCvcC — The Cradle (@TheCradleMedia) February 5, 2025 Izzat al-Rishq, a member of Hamas' political bureau, went even further, calling Trump's proposal 'reckless and uninformed.' He stressed that 'Gaza is not an open land for any party to decide its fate' and that any resolution must be based on ending the Israeli occupation, not the 'mindset of a real estate mogul obsessed with power and dominance.' Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif al-Qanou echoed these sentiments, describing Trump's rhetoric as 'dangerous' and aligned with the agenda of Israel's far-right government. He warned that it was part of a broader scheme to 'eliminate the Palestinian cause' and vowed that Palestinians would never accept forced removal from their homeland. 'The people who have withstood the most brutal military assaults for 15 months, facing the world's most lethal army, will not surrender,' al-Qanou said. 'No matter the cost, they will remain steadfast on their land.' Notably, senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk signaled a potential openness to dialogue with Trump's administration, telling Russian media that the group is 'ready to communicate and hold discussions' with the former president's team. However, he emphasized that Hamas remains committed to establishing a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour also reaffirmed Palestinians' unwavering attachment to their homeland, rejecting any suggestion of relocation. 'Our homeland is our homeland,' he stated firmly. 'If part of it is destroyed—the Gaza Strip—the Palestinian people selected the choice to return to it.' Across the board, Palestinian leaders have issued a clear and resounding rejection of Trump's proposal, vowing to resist any attempts at forced displacement or external control over Gaza. The international community has been called upon to uphold Palestinian self-determination and reject the former president's divisive rhetoric.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2331232	2025-02-05T01:27:17-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-01242310016624655728.jpg
Trump Says Palestinians Have no Alternative but to Leave Gaza Str...	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Palestinians have no alternative but to leave Gaza and he would like to see neighboring countries Jordan and Egypt take the displaced Palestinians. 'I do not necessarily support Israeli settlement in Gaza,' Trump said before his meeting with the Zionist prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem rejected the statements of American officials regarding the displacement of Palestinians in from Gaza, saying that the American statements are racist, medieval, and reflect the absence of moral and humanitarian standards. 'Instead of holding the occupation accountable for the crime of genocide and displacement, it is being rewarded, not punished. The extent of the destruction in Gaza is large and unprecedented, and we need a lot for reconstruction.' -'We are being subjected to a psychological war aimed at pushing Palestinians to emigrate by talking about long times for reconstruction,' he said. US completely backed a 15-month Israeli war on Gaza, which left more than 47 thousand Palestinians dead and over 110 thousand of others injured. The war also cause a massive destruction. Trump signed a presidential memorandum reimposing a tough policy on Iran meant to 'block the country from achieving a nuclear weapon and to limit its oil exports'. Speaking at the Oval Office in the White House, Trump said Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and that the U.S. has the right to block the sale of Iranian oil to other nations.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2330979	2025-02-04T12:42:10-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2019/10/manar-079064800156999861810.jpg

Lavrov: 'Israel’ Not Intending to Leave Territories It’s Occupyin...	The Russian foreign minister on Tuesday accused Western nations of attempting to push Russia, China, and Iran into secondary roles in Syria, warning that such efforts are not driven by good intentions. Speaking at the 14th Middle East Conference of the Valdai Discussion Club in Moscow, Sergey Lavrov said these moves reflect the West’s broader goal of diminishing its geopolitical competitors. 'Attempts to remove Russia, China, and Iran from the process of externally supporting a Syrian settlement are hardly motivated by goodwill. Instead, they expose the West’s intention to push its competitors into secondary positions,' he said. Lavrov also accused Western nations, particularly the US, of creating crises and observing the outcomes from a distance. 'The West is used to destroying something, creating crises, and then watching what happens, especially the Americans, who find it interesting to observe from across the ocean,' he said. 'But the Middle East is not a playground, and it should not be treated as one.' Lavrov welcomed the ceasefire agreement between 'Israel' and the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza, acknowledging the efforts to reach an agreement after prolonged negotiations at the UN Security Council. 'Of course, it is good that a ceasefire has been achieved after almost a year of efforts,' he said, noting that despite the truce, casualties continue to rise. He further accused 'Israel' of not intending to leave the territories it is occupying in Lebanon and Syria, saying there are also many 'credible leaks' that, in addition to expelling Palestinians from Gaza, 'Israel' plans to take full control of the northwest bank of the Jordan River. Lavrov stressed the creation of a Palestinian state as 'the key to all the numerous problems' in the Middle East. He also expressed that the US, under President Donald Trump, has not yet clearly stated its position on the topic of a two-state solution in the region. Moscow is receiving signals that there will be problems in the implementation of the second stage of the ceasefire in Gaza, Lavrov added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2330748	2025-02-04T06:15:10-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/09/manar-09607150016947106646.jpg
Hezbollah Denounces Australia’s Unjust Sanctions on Secretary Gen...	Hezbollah issued on Tuesday a statement to condemn the unjust decision by Australia to impose sanctions on Hezbollah's Secretary-General, His Eminence Sheikh Naim Qassem, affirming that this move once again exposes the true face of this state and proving that it is nothing more than a submissive tool serving the American-Zionist project. 'This oppressive decision lacks any legal or moral basis and represents a blatant bias in favor of the Zionist entity, providing cover for its aggression and terrorism,' the statement read. 'The peoples of the world have witnessed the massacres and crimes committed by the Zionist enemy against innocent civilians in Gaza and Lebanon. They now fully understand who the real terrorist is, who engages in genocide and war crimes, and who provides political and legal cover for these massacres, sharing responsibility for them.' The Australian state should have punished the Zionist murderers and stood by the oppressed people of Lebanon and Palestine, according to Hezbollah statement. Hezbollah affirmed that this decision will not affect the morale of the loyal resistance people in Lebanon, nor will it impact Hezbollah's stance, its natural right to resist, defend its country and people, and stand with the just cause of the Palestinian people. Instead, it will only strengthen its determination and steadfastness to continue the path of confronting the occupier, Hezbollah statement concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2330704	2025-02-04T05:11:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-04165050017056142612.png
Gaza Ceasefire Talks at Crossroads as Zionist PM Benjamin Netanya...	The Gaza ceasefire agreement entered its 17th day on Tuesday, as all eyes turn to the outcome of Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s meeting with US President Donald Trump in Washington. The discussions are expected to influence the second phase of the ceasefire negotiations. Netanyahu continues to adopt a strategy of ambiguity and maneuvering regarding the talks, a stance reflected in Israeli media reports. According to Maariv, citing security sources, Netanyahu is considering removing the Shin Bet chief from the negotiating team due to a lack of trust and is attempting to block the second phase of the ceasefire deal. Meanwhile, the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation reported that Netanyahu’s office announced plans to send a delegation to Doha, Qatar next weekend for further negotiations. Netanyahu is also set to hold a ministerial meeting upon returning from Washington to assess the deal's status, with discussions expected to include Trump. His office described his meeting with US National Security Advisor Michael Waltz and special envoy Steve Witkoff as 'positive.' The former Israeli ambassador to the US told Army Radio that Washington is pushing for the second phase of the prisoner exchange agreement and is waiting for progress on a post-war plan for Gaza. However, Avigdor Lieberman, leader of the 'Yisrael Beiteinu' party, claimed that Netanyahu’s primary goal in Washington is to derail the second phase of the deal. He accused Netanyahu of prioritizing his political survival over national interests, stating that his only concern is preserving his governing coalition. Hamas Ready for Next Phase According to sources within the movement, Hamas has informed mediators of its readiness to begin negotiations on the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. A senior Hamas official told AFP that talks were scheduled to start on Monday, emphasizing that Hamas is prepared and fully committed to implementing the deal. The second phase of talks will focus on securing a permanent ceasefire, preventing a return to war, and ensuring a full military withdrawal, including from the Philadelphia Corridor. Discussions will also address the terms for releasing Palestinian prisoners. Hamas stressed that its armed wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, along with other resistance factions, holds several high-ranking Zionist officers and soldiers captive. The agreement also includes provisions for the continued entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. This includes food, medicine, relief supplies, 200,000 tents, 60,000 caravans, materials to restore hospitals and water facilities, bakery operations, and fuel and heavy equipment for rubble removal and body recovery. Meanwhile, Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif Al-Qanou reaffirmed the movement’s commitment to the agreement but warned that its implementation depends on the Israeli enemy fulfilling its obligations under the first phase. He accused the Zionist entity of deliberately delaying the entry of shelters and relief aid, calling it an attempt to pressure and break the will of the Palestinian people. ⚡️🇵🇸JUST IN: 32 trucks carrying tents and tarpaulins have entered the northern Gaza Strip.

(@SuppressedNws) February 4, 2025 'Hamas will not allow the Israeli enemy to obstruct relief efforts or sabotage the agreement,' he stated, adding that the group remains in constant communication with mediators to ensure 'Israel' abides by its commitments, particularly regarding humanitarian aid. Al-Qanou described Gaza’s humanitarian crisis as a 'new Nakba' caused by Israel’s failure to uphold the deal. He urged the international community and mediators to pressure Israel into complying with the ceasefire and ensuring aid reaches those in need. Hamas Warns of Consequences Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan revealed that mediators have proposed measures to enforce the Israeli enemy's compliance with the agreement, with further details expected soon. He warned that if the Zionist entity fails to meet its obligations, Hamas will take its measures. 'Our priority is a permanent end to aggression and Gaza’s reconstruction,' Hamdan emphasized. 🔴 Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan: 'The second phase of negotiations will be significant, as it will include the release of prisoners from all categories: Those serving life sentences, long-term prisoners, Hezbollah prisoners, and Nukh’ba fighters detained after October 7.' pic.twitter.com/EM3SZ67p0V — Voice From The East (@EasternVoices) February 4, 2025 Hamdan stated that the best approach for governing Gaza post-war is establishing a national unity government. Speaking at a political studies forum, he stated that if such a government cannot be established, Hamas remains open to any framework leading to a national administration for the enclave. He also highlighted that the second phase of the ceasefire and prisoner exchange deal will be critical, as it involves negotiations on prisoners with life sentences, high-security detainees, Hezbollah captives, and those from Gaza arrested after October 7. Regarding prisoners released under the 'Operation Al-Aqsa Flood' deal who were deported, Hamdan confirmed that Hamas is in talks with several countries to host them. While the process may take time, he affirmed that a solution is underway. Ceasefire Deal and Diplomatic Efforts Mediated negotiations are set to resume, aiming for the release of all Israeli captives in Gaza and an end to the war. The three-phase ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement stipulates a halt in hostilities and the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces from populated areas. The first phase, lasting six weeks, includes the release of 33 Zionist prisoners (excluding Thai nationals) in exchange for approximately 1,900 Palestinian detainees. Later this week, US envoy Steve Wietkoff is scheduled to meet with Qatar’s Prime Minister and senior Egyptian officials involved in mediation efforts. Meanwhile, on February 11, US President Donald Trump is set to host Jordan’s King Abdullah II as part of ongoing discussions. On Sunday, Trump stated that negotiations involving 'Israel' and other regional players were making progress. He added that Netanyahu’s visit to Washington includes 'major meetings,' with Israel-Saudi normalization being a key agenda item. Netanyahu’s Priorities: Securing Political Survival Over Gaza Talks Israeli Channel 13 reported that during his meeting with US' Donald Trump, Zionist PM Netanyahu aimed to secure more time to maintain his governing coalition. According to the report, Netanyahu intends to stress that confronting Iran is a higher priority than advancing the second phase of Gaza ceasefire negotiations. The Israeli broadcaster noted uncertainty over Netanyahu’s commitment to the Gaza agreement, suggesting he plans to propose a shift in Middle East priorities during his talks with Trump. Meanwhile, The Washington Post, citing a Zionist official, reported that Netanyahu is seeking assurances from Trump that Hamas will not be part of Gaza’s future. The same official claimed that the new US administration is focused on a different regional goal—ending the conflict in Gaza—while discussions about striking Iran are no longer on the table. Before his meeting with Netanyahu, Trump stated that there are 'no guarantees' the Gaza ceasefire will hold. However, his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Wietkoff, who was seated beside him, quickly added that the truce 'remains in place for now,' expressing hope that more hostages will be released and that a peaceful resolution will be achieved. Notably, Netanyahu, who arrived in Washington on Sunday, is the first foreign leader to be received by Trump since his inauguration.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2330682	2025-02-04T05:01:20-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-03098510017386717093.jpg

Two Israeli occupation soldiers were killed and six others were injured in a shooting attack targeting an Israeli occupation military force at the Tayasir checkpoint near Tubas in the northern Jordan Valley, the Israeli ambulance service announced on Tuesday morning.

The Israeli occupation forces have carried out extensive raids and arrests, closed all entrances to Tamoun, and bulldozed and destroyed infrastructure in both locations. Hamas blessed the heroic and qualitative shooting operation, stressing that Israel's crimes and aggression against the northern occupied West Bank will not go unpunished. The Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine also praised the heroic operation as an affirmation of the Palestinian people's determination to resist the criminal occupation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2330572	2025-02-04T01:28:09-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-08097990017386612839.jpg
Iranian Top Military Advisor: Hezbollah Advances Toward Victory a...	General Yahya Rahim Safavi, the senior advisor to the Supreme Leader of Iran for Armed Forces Affairs, stated that Hezbollah’s trajectory across Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria is advancing toward victory. Speaking at a ceremony commemorating the birth of Imam Hussein (PBUH), General Safavi discussed the shifting dynamics in the region and stressed the failure of American policies. US Miscalculations General Safavi pointed out that while the United States believes it has achieved victory in the region, they are gravely mistaken. He drew comparisons to the US defeat in Afghanistan, where, after 20 years, American forces were forced to retreat. 'Just as they were defeated in Afghanistan and fled, they will also be forced to retreat from Iraq,' Safavi remarked. He emphasized that Palestinian resistance significantly challenged the US-Israeli enemy and their allies. Israeli Enemy's Military Struggles Safavi further commented on the Israeli war on Gaza, asserting that the Zionist regime endured its longest war in over 75 years. 'The Zionist entity is now going through the longest war in more than 75 years of its ill-fated life. Its classical wars from 1948 to 2000 with the governments of Egypt, Syria and Jordan did not last more than a few days. However, the unlimited operations and non-classical wars with Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Palestinians after 2000 lasted from 33 to 50 days,' General Safavi continued. Strategic Failure of Netanyahu’s Government According to Safavi, the war between Hamas and Israeli occupation has evolved into a prolonged war of attrition, significantly weakening Israel’s security and the moral standing of its military. He criticized Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for failing to achieve his stated goals, which were the destruction of Hamas in Gaza and the liberation of hostages. Safavi added that the political and military strategy of the Israeli occupation regime had utterly failed. The senior Iranian military advisor concluded by saying that after more than 455 days of indiscriminate killings of children and innocent civilians, the only outcome, he argued, was the Israeli enemy conceding to Hamas' demands. He pointed out that the international community witnessed how the Israeli occupation, after committing atrocities, was forced to accept a ceasefire and comply with Hamas' demands for a prisoner exchange. IRGC Admiral: Iranian Naval Warships to Visit UAE In another context, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy Commander, Admiral Alireza Tangsiri, announced that four warships from the IRGC and the Iranian Army will depart for the UAE to visit the Emirati Navy. 'This is the first time such a meeting is taking place,' he stated, emphasizing that regional countries are fully capable of ensuring their security. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the 14th Malik Ashtar Festival, Admiral Tangsiri reiterated Iran’s stance that foreign presence in the region is unnecessary. Joint Exercises and Maritime Security Regarding military drills with neighboring nations, Tangsiri confirmed that joint exercises with regional countries, including Iraq, are on the agenda. 'We have already engaged in naval cooperation with Oman and participated in joint exercises with the Omani Navy,' he noted. Highlighting the strategic importance of the Strait of Hormuz, Tangsiri stressed that Iran has been safeguarding its security for years and has taken significant measures in this regard. 🔴🇮🇷 IRGC Navy Commander, Alireza Tangsiri: In the near future, a multi-purpose drone carrier will be added to the IRGC Navy pic.twitter.com/HNcTiFrWMG — Observer Report (@Observer1514) February 3, 2025 On Iran’s growing naval capabilities, Tangsiri revealed that the IRGC Navy possesses drone carriers and vessels capable of carrying helicopters and unmanned aircraft.

He called on judges to balance the rights of the state with the rights of citizens, urging them to remain 'self-independent and not resign from their duties and responsibilities.' During his meeting on Monday with the President of the State Shura Council, Judge Fadi Elias, and a high-level delegation of judges, President Aoun reaffirmed his commitment to being 'the protector of judges who defend and apply the law' and urged them not to wrong the innocent nor exonerate the guilty.

Saudi Arabia, UAE Seen as Possible Venues for Trump-Putin Summit:...	Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are seen by Russia as possible venues for a summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, two Russian sources with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters on Monday. Trump has said he will end the war in Ukraine as soon as possible and said he is ready to meet with Putin. Putin congratulated Trump on his election and stated he is ready to meet Trump to discuss Ukraine and energy. Russian officials have repeatedly denied any direct contacts with the US about preparations for a phone call between Trump and Putin, which would precede an eventual meeting later this year. However, senior Russian officials have visited both Saudi Arabia and the UAE in recent weeks, according to the Russian sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation. One source said there was still some opposition to the idea in Russia as some diplomats and intelligence officials were pointing to the close military and security links that both the Kingdom and the UAE have with the United States. Saudi Arabia and the UAE did not respond to requests for comment and the Kremlin declined comment, Reuters reported, noting that both Trump and Putin have developed friendly relations with rulers of Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Trump said on Sunday that his administration had 'meetings and talks scheduled with various parties, including Ukraine and Russia.'

He explained that Sayyed Nasrallah was martyred during critical circumstances, which prevented an immediate funeral. His eminence further clarified that Sayyed Hashem Safieddine will be honored with a funeral in his capacity as Secretary General, following his election to the position after Sayyed Nasrallah's martyrdom.

Resistance is the People's Choice Hezbollah's Sheikh Qassem addressed the resilience of the Lebanese people in the face of Israeli occupation, stating, 'Our people understand that while they have won in some aspects and lost in others, true victory was achieved through steadfastness, breaking the Israeli invasion, and preventing the enemy from ending the resistance.'

We are witnessing extraordinary resilience, rarely seen in the history of resistance movements,' His Eminence asserted. Lebanese residents of Kfar Kila gather in Deir Mimas, holding a banner featuring the image of the late Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah (February 2, 2025).

He also stressed that those with principles do not surrender under pressure, stating, 'Dependence on the United States does not tempt us.' Regarding the Israeli ceasefire violations and aggression, Sheikh Qassem emphasized that 'the Lebanese state bears full responsibility for following up and pressuring international sponsors to halt the Israeli violations and attacks, which are no longer mere violations but have become an initial act of aggression that requires a firm stance.' Palestinian Great Achievements Sheikh Qassem extended his condolences and congratulations to the Palestinian people for the martyrdom of the Al-Qassam Brigades' Chief of Staff, Commander Mohammad Deif, and his deputy, Commander Marwan Issa. He also congratulated the Palestinians for the release of prisoners and the achievements they have made. The Struggle Continues Despite Counter Campaigns Sheikh Qassem affirmed that the resistance will persist based on its strategic evaluations and battlefield conditions, pointing to a 'counter campaign sponsored by the United States, Israeli enemy, and foreign countries, alongside an internal team promoting defeat.' 'We have never claimed absolute victory. This battle involves both gains and losses, but the choice of resistance is firm and will not change, his eminence added. Regarding the motorbike incident outside Beirut's southern suburbs, Sheikh Qassem clarified that Hezbollah has no connection with the motorbikes that entered some Lebanese areas, highlighting that this act is rejected and those who carried it out have no relation to us.' 'We are against such forms of expressing joy or sorrow, and we call on the security forces to punish those who fired gunshots or entered areas in a provocative manner,' his eminence concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2329461	2025-02-02T10:40:58-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-011779400173852142410.jpg

Elsewhere in his remarks, Imam Khamenei praised Iran’s progress in various domains, saying the country has grown in all directions over the past 40 years.

The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) continue their gradual deployment in the southern border towns, allowing the residents to return and assess the conditions of their communities on Sunday. Meanwhile, attacks by the Zionist occupation army persist. Since the early morning on Sunday, large numbers of Lebanese southerners have flocked to towns in the eastern sector, where occupation forces have been staying, in clear violation of the ceasefire agreement, particularly in Mays Al-Jabal, Houla, and the outskirts of Markaba. Citizens spread throughout the area, reaching the farthest accessible points permitted by LAF at the entrances to these towns. مواكبة | مراسل المنار : احتشاد اهالي بلدة حولا في الحي الغربي بالقرب من إجراءات الجيش اللبناني حيث تتواجد دبابات ميركافا على بعد مئة متر من تجمعات المواطنين من دون تسجيل حوادث تذكر pic.twitter.com/h1nIiLravz — قناة المنار (@TVManar1) February 2, 2025 At the same time, families of the martyrs gathered, holding up pictures of their fallen sons to affirm their presence and unwavering connection to the land.

Jradi explained that resistance is a universal humanitarian principle, with its foremost cause being the defense of humanity wherever it is needed. He affirmed that the eighteenth of this month is a decisive date with no turning back and called for it to be a moment of national unity—a symbolic Lebanese wedding.

Meanwhile, several other residents spent the night among the ruins of their destroyed homes, in valiant resistance to the occupier. The enemy also fired bursts of gunfire at a camera set up to cover the events in the area. The camera, installed on the roof of a destroyed house, appeared to be deliberately targeted in an attempt to intimidate both the residents and anyone else seeking to document the situation, Al-Manar correspondent repored. In Maroun Al-Ras, residents gathered on the road directly facing the Zionist occupation forces, standing just 50 meters away from their position. LAF Enters Aitaroun as Attacks on Other Towns Continue A force from the Lebanese army successfully entered the neighborhoods of Aitaroun amid ongoing enemy attacks on other towns, particularly Taybeh. Following relentless assaults by the enemy and its continued refusal to withdraw from Aitaroun’s southern neighborhoods, the LAF moved into the town via Al-Saluqi Valley road. Their mission was to lift the siege on a group of army personnel who had been trapped in their battalion center by the occupation forces while carrying out their deployment tasks the previous Sunday, as issued in the agreement. The army also sought to reopen the road for residents. Army units reached the vicinity of Aitaroun pond and several other locations vacated by the occupation.

China, Canada and Mexico Vow Response to Trump Tariffs	Canada, Mexico and China have vowed to respond to sweeping new tariffs to their exports to the US announced by President Donald Trump. Trump said a levy of 25% on Canadian and Mexican imports as well as an additional 10% tax on Chinese goods would come into force on Tuesday. Canadian energy faces a lower 10% tariff. The US president said the move was in response to his concerns about illegal immigration and drug trafficking - two of the main promises on which he was elected. In response, both Canada and Mexico said they were preparing similar tariffs on US goods, while China added it would take 'necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests'. The implementation of tariffs and the subsequent retaliation could mark the start of a new era of global trade wars, according to the BBC, which quoted economists as warning that the introduction of the import taxes by the US, and the responses from other countries could lead to prices rising on a wide range of products, from cars, lumber, and steel to food and alcohol.

'Today's tariff announcement is necessary to hold China, Mexico, and Canada accountable for their promises to halt the flood of poisonous drugs into the United States,' the White House said in a statement on X on Saturday. Trump posted on his Truth Social platform: 'This was done through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl.' Together, China, Mexico and Canada accounted for more than 40% of imports into the US last year. Canada, Mexico and the US have deeply integrated economies, with an estimated $2bn (£1.6bn) worth of manufactured goods crossing the borders daily. In its announcement, the White House accused Mexico's government of having 'an intolerable alliance' with Mexican drug trafficking organizations. Mexico Reacts In her response, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called allegations that the Mexican government had alliances with criminal organizations 'slander'. Sheinbaum called on the US to do more to clamp down on the illegal flow of guns south to arm the cartels.

'Problems are not resolved by imposing tariffs, but by talking.' She has instructed her economy minister to respond with tariff and non-tariff measures. They are expected to include retaliatory tariffs of 25% on US goods. Canadian Response For his part, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country will also respond. 'We don't want to be here, we didn't ask for this,' he said at a news conference late on Saturday. 'But we will not back down in standing up for Canadians.' His government will impose 25% tariffs on $155bn worth of American goods - $30bn will come into force on Tuesday and another $125bn in 21 days. The Canadian prime minister pushed back on the suggestion the shared border posed a security concern, saying less than 1% of fentanyl going into the United States comes from Canada. 'Tariffs are not the best way we can work together to save lives,' Trudeau said. He also said he had not spoken to Trump since the inauguration, but would keep lines open with US counterparts. Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil. According to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November last year came from Canada. China to File Lawsauit On the other hand, China said in a statement that it was strongly dissatisfied with the levies and 'firmly opposes' them. The 10% tax will be added over and above tariffs already imposed on China by Trump in his first term and by President Joe Biden. It added that it would file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization against the US for its 'wrongful practice'. 'Trade and tariff wars have no winners,' said a spokesperson at China's Washington embassy. China's Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month that his country was looking for a 'win-win' solution to trade tensions and wanted to expand its imports.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2328867	2025-02-02T04:26:31-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-03197880017384988932.jpg
Newly Appointed Israeli Chief of Staff Faces Tough Task of Rebuil...	New Israeli chief of staff will face the immense challenge of rebuilding the occupation army after months of intense combat, Israeli media reported on Sunday. Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir, the Defense Ministry director general, was tapped by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz on Saturday to become the next chief of staff of the Israeli military. He is to take up the post on March 6, becoming the Israeli 24th chief of staff, following the resignation of Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi. Halevi announced his departure last month after only two years in the role rather than the traditional four. The outgoing chief of staff had long been expected to step down once the war in Gaza began winding down over the 'military failures that enabled the disaster of the October 7, 2023,' the Times of Israeli reported. Palestinian resistance fighters after they captured Israeli soldiers during heroic Op. Al-Aqsa Flood on October 7, 2023. Commenting on Zamir's appointment, Ynet’s Yoav Zitun considered that Zamir 'faces tough task' of rebuilding military amid war. In a report on Sunday, the Israeli journalist elaborated on the challenges facing the newely appointed chief of staff. 'Zamir will face the immense challenge of rebuilding the IDF after months of intense combat, implementing a long-term restructuring plan and preparing the military for multi-front conflicts rather than the traditional two-front model,' Zitun wrote, referring to Israeli occupation forces (IOF).

In his latest speech, Sheikh Qassem hailed the popular rallies which took place last Sunday (January 26), when the deadline for the Israeli enemy forces to withdraw from Lebanon expired. The epic rallies forced the occupation forces to withdraw from several border towns that Israeli troops advanced towards after the ceasefire took effect on November 27, following 66-day Israeli aggression on Lebanon.

Trump: Nothing Canada, Mexico or China Can Do to Delay Feb 1 Tari...	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he would impose hefty new tariffs of 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada and 10% on imports from China, and nothing could be done by the three countries to forestall them. Trump did, however, reference a potential carve out for oil from Canada, saying that rate would be 10% versus the 25% planned for other goods from the United States' northern neighbor. But he indicated wider tariffs on oil and natural gas would be coming in mid-February, remarks that sent oil prices higher. Trump has been threatening the tariffs for weeks, saying they would be imposed on Feb. 1 and remain in place until the countries did more to stem the flow of both migrants and fentanyl over the U.S. border. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office as he was signing executive orders, Trump said he understood the duties could result in higher costs being passed on to consumers and acknowledged his actions may cause disruptions in the short term. Most economists estimate such sweeping import taxes, and the likely retaliation, would disrupt economic activity around the globe. Asked if there was any opportunity at this stage for the three top U.S. trading partners to win a delay, Trump said: 'No, no. Not right now, no.' He brushed away the notion his threats for levies have been a bargaining tool. 'No, it's not &#8230; we have big (trade) deficits with, as you know, with all three of them.' 'It's something we're doing, and we'll possibly very substantially increase it, or not, we'll see how it is,' Trump said. 'But it's a lot of money coming to the United States.' And more tariffs are on the way, the Republican president said, saying import taxes were being considered on European goods as well as on steel, aluminum and copper, and on drugs and semiconductors. 'We're going to be putting tariffs on steel and aluminum, and ultimately copper. Copper will take a little longer,' he said. Financial markets have been whipsawed by the rapid-fire but still not fully clear developments on Trump's tariff plans, with currency trading showing particular volatility. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both weakened while Treasury bond yields rose, and stocks ended the day lower. Still, he said he was not concerned about the reaction of financial markets to his plans to impose tariffs. 'The President will be implementing tomorrow 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada, and a 10% tariff on China for the illegal fentanyl that they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country, which has killed tens of millions of Americans,' White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told a press briefing.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2328471	2025-02-01T10:55:45-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-04207890017384360988.jpg

Israeli occupation authorities released the fourth batch of Palestinian detainees today as part of the prisoner exchange deal under the ceasefire agreement (Al-Aqsa Flood Deal) in Gaza. According to the Palestinian Commission for Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoner's Society, 183 detainees were released including 111 from the Gaza Strip, who were detained after October 7, 2023. Ahead of the release, Israeli forces declared the area near Ofer Prison a closed military zone, preventing families from gathering to welcome their loved ones. The occupation soldiers further fired sound bombs towards them. Hundreds of local residents and detainees' families gathered since the early morning hours in the Mahmoud Darwish Museum Square in the city of Ramallah to receive the released detainees, raising the Palestinian flags. The release marks a significant development in the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, with emotions running high among families and supporters celebrating the return of their loved ones. The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, handed over two Israeli prisoners to the International Red Cross in Khan Yunis, south of the Gaza Strip, on Saturday morning, as part of the fourth batch of the first phase of the 'Al-Aqsa Flood' deal. The Al-Qassam Brigades released the prisoners 'Ofer Calderon' and 'Yarden Bibas' from Khan Yunis, and the prisoner 'Keith Shmonsel Segal' from the Gaza port, west of the city.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2328284	2025-02-01T07:01:31-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07351920017384220456.jpg
Lebanese Army Deploys Troops in More Border Villages as Israeli E...	The Lebanese army deployed its troops in Aitaroun border town, South Lebanon, as the Israeli enemy resumed its withdrawal after a recent escalation. According to media reports, the military units advanced into tho western and northern neighborhoods of the town in order to remove the unexploded munitions left by the enemy before withdrawal. Aitaroun municipality issued a statement which calls on the locals to avoid returning to the town before the Lebanese Army secures this moves and gives a formal permission in this regard. On Sunday, January 26, 2025, a popular movement erupted in face of the Zionist occupation of a number of Lebanese border towns, including Aitaroun where a number of returnees to the town were either martyred or injured in the confrontation. The Lebanese Army also continued deploying troops in Yaroun town. It is also expected that the LA deploys its units in Blida town. Meanwhile, the Israeli enemy continued its violations, demolishing houses and sabotaging the infrastructure in Yaroun town. Itis worth noting that the enemy is still occupying the eastern sector of Yaroun, which the Lebanese Army advanced into its western neighborhoods. It is worth to mention that that the large numbers of southerners have returned to their towns and villages, like Taybeh, in order to search for the bodies of the martyrs, inspect their houses and contribute to the process of removing debris. The Israeli enemy also burnt and demolished houses in the two towns of Adaisseh and Rub Al-tlateen.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2328196	2025-02-01T06:39:45-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-03143140017384207685.jpg
First-Ever Shooting Attack on Israeli Occupation Forces Al-Qunait...	A group of fighters opened fire at Israeli occupation forces operating in southern Syria near the village of Turnejeh in the Al-Qunaitra countryside, located north of the demilitarized zone, late on Friday night. The Israeli occupation army confirmed the incident, stating that 'gunfire was heard and detected in the area where our forces are deployed in the Syrian buffer zone.' 🇸🇾🇮🇱⚡- Scenes from Turnejeh, al-Qunaitra direction, southern Syria.

(@GlobeWarReport) February 1, 2025 The Israeli occupation army added that the forces in the area responded by returning fire at the source of the gunfire, emphasizing that no injuries were reported and that the IOF continued their operations without interruption. Zionist military radio described the incident as the first of its kind, marking the first such event since the Israeli enemy's ground operations began in the demilitarized zone and southern Syria. The Israeli occupation army has been conducting ground incursions into Syrian territory since early December 2024. The radio noted that, although no casualties occurred, it was too early to determine whether this incident marked the beginning of organized armed resistance against Israeli operations in Syria. The report emphasized 'the need to assess the security of Israeli forces and their readiness for similar events in the future.' Armed Group Claims Responsibility Later, a group calling itself the 'Islamic Resistance Front in Syria' issued a statement on social media claiming responsibility for the attack. In their statement, they announced the launch of their operations against Israeli occupation forces, stating, 'For the first time, we targeted the Israeli occupation army in the Al-Qunaitra countryside and forced them to retreat and withdraw.' The Israeli research center, Alma, reported that this group was formed in early December 2024, following the collapse of the Syrian regime, 'in response to the silence of the new Syrian government and its failure to take action against Israeli forces.' Following the incident, Israeli enemy forces stormed the village of Turnejeh in the Al-Qunaitra countryside and detained two young men, according to local social media networks. -Syria- The Israeli army arrested at least two people in the town of Taranja in the Quneitra region.

IOF Set Al-Qunaitra Governorate Building on Fire In related developments, local Syrian sources reported that representatives from the new Syrian government conveyed a promise they received through the United Nations from the Israeli enemy, which committed to withdrawing from the governorate building located on the western area of the city. However, rumors surfaced Friday suggesting that Israeli occupation forces set the governorate building on fire. Activists on social media circulated videos they claimed documented the building being set alight. Sources have expressed skepticism about the sincerity of the UN-mediated promise, stating that the ongoing actions of the occupying forces indicate that the promise is unlikely to be fulfilled. They pointed out that Israeli enemy forces continue to detonate landmines planted by the former Syrian army along the demilitarized zone, which once marked the boundary with the occupied territories before the regime's collapse.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2328185	2025-02-01T05:31:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-03358990017363640798.jpg

Tulkarm: Six Days of Israeli Aggression Leaves Trail of Destructi...	Israeli occupation forces have been wreaking havoc across the occupied West Bank, with a particularly intense focus on the city of Tulkarm and its refugee camp. For the past six consecutive days, these forces have pressed their assault, leaving a trail of widespread devastation in their wake.

The Martyr Thabet Thabet Governmental Hospital and Al-Israa Specialized Hospital remain under siege, severely disrupting the work of ambulances and medical teams. In the Tulkarm refugee camp, Israeli occupation units have enforced a tight blockade, deploying foot patrols in every alley and stationing snipers on surrounding buildings. Eyewitnesses have reported that Israeli occupation soldiers are forcing Palestinians from multiple neighborhoods to leave their homes, further exacerbating the climate of fear and forcible displacement. The Israeli escalation has not been limited to Tulkarm. Across the occupied West Bank, the occupation military continues its aggression, sending additional reinforcements to Jenin in the north and destroying civilian properties and infrastructure. In Jenin, the occupation forces have completely emptied the camp, forcing out its residents, estimated at more than 22,000 people, amid mass detainments.

Zionist PM Netanyahu Faces Pressure as Gaza Ceasefire Holds: Four...	On the 13th day of the Gaza ceasefire, Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu finds himself stuck between the relentless pressure of resistance and mounting criticism from his allies while facing serious challenges to his political future. After over 15 months of devastation and the martyrdom of numerous senior Hamas leaders, Gaza's fighters have emerged from their neighborhoods stronger than ever, still armed and standing firm in the areas that saw the most brutal battles and destruction. They have made one thing clear to their enemy: Israeli captives will return only on their terms, as set by the unyielding resistance. Netanyahu Faces Intense Scrutiny This dramatic turn of events, coupled with the contents of the ceasefire agreement itself, has placed Netanyahu in a difficult position, sparking a key question from day one: What actual objectives has the Israeli enemy achieved? A recent survey by the Hebrew newspaper Maariv revealed that only 4% of Zionists believe 'Israel' has fully achieved its war goals. Many observers see this as part of an American-Israeli effort to contain the growing wave of questions and criticisms facing the occupying government. In response, Netanyahu’s office announced that a security meeting is held on Friday to discuss the possibility of resuming fighting immediately if the Gaza ceasefire agreement collapses. This announcement coincides with the visit of US envoy Steve Witkoff to the occupied city of 'Tel Aviv,' who stated on Thursday evening that he believes Netanyahu is 'committed' to upholding the ceasefire agreement, which he estimates will take 10 to 15 years for full reconstruction. Second Phase of Prisoner Exchange Deal Meanwhile, the Israeli news website Walla reported, quoting the Coordinator of Prisoner Affairs Gal Hirsch, that Netanyahu’s upcoming meeting with US President Donald Trump next week will be crucial for the second phase of the prisoner exchange deal. Preparations are reportedly underway to begin negotiations for this next phase. Israeli Channel 12, citing sources, reported that while 'Israel' does not expect the next phases of the prisoner swap deal to fail, it has not ruled out any potential scenarios. Meanwhile, Channel 14 stated that the Israeli entity’s war goals—namely, the destruction of Hamas' military capabilities and the overthrow of its rule in Gaza—have not been achieved at all. Security Concerns Over Deal's Impact In a related development, the Jerusalem Post reported that Zionist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called the ceasefire deal 'catastrophic and dangerous to Israeli security.' He claimed that he remained in the government only after being convinced that Netanyahu and Trump were committed to removing Hamas as Gaza's ruling force. Smotrich expressed his belief that the Israeli entity would return to battle after the first phase concludes in early March, warning he would push to dissolve the government if the second phase of the agreement ends the war without achieving its objectives. At the same time, hundreds of Israelis protested outside the US Embassy in 'Tel Aviv,' demanding the full implementation of all stages of the agreement. Fourth Phase of Prisoner Exchange Abu Ubaida, spokesperson for the Martyr Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, announced that the group will release three Israeli prisoners tomorrow, Saturday: Ofer Calderon, Keith Shmonsel Sigal, and Yarden Bibas. In exchange, the Palestinian Prisoners' Information Office confirmed that nine Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences, along with 81 others with lengthy sentences, will also be released as part of the fourth phase of the prisoner swap. Prisoners’ Media Office reported that 9 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and 81 prisoners with high sentences will be freed on Saturday as part of the fourth batch of the prisoner exchange deal between the resistance and Israel. pic.twitter.com/HW4rCxq3Tf — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) January 31, 2025 The Israeli Army Radio reported that Netanyahu's office confirmed the three Zionist prisoners set to be freed by Hamas on Saturday are alive. Yedioth Ahronoth cited Israeli sources saying that 'the list we received from Hamas is acceptable and aligns with the agreed-upon terms.' Meanwhile, Israeli Channel 12 reported that sources expect the release of prisoners to begin in the morning, following the same timeline as previous exchange operations. Israeli occupation authorities on Thursday released 110 Palestinian prisoners, including Zakaria Zubeidi, one of the six escapees from Gilboa Prison in the 'Freedom Tunnel' break. This release came as part of the third phase of the ongoing prisoner swap under the ceasefire agreement, with Hamas releasing three Israeli detainees in return. Rafah Border Crossing Open Israeli public broadcaster, citing Palestinian sources, reported that the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt opened on Friday, instead of Sunday as previously planned. The sources indicated that approval had been granted for the exit of injured Al-Qassam fighters for medical treatment, with the condition that they return afterward. However, they cautioned that the opening could be halted if the prisoner exchange doesn’t proceed smoothly tomorrow. Yedioth Ahronoth reported, citing an EU official, that European forces will play a key role in the Gaza ceasefire. The plan is to reopen Rafah during the first phase to allow people to leave Gaza. The source added that Palestinian Authority border officers would manage the crossing, although no official statement has been made by the resistance. The EU is reportedly deploying up to 100 border officers with new security arrangements. Since May 24, humanitarian aid has been entering Gaza via the Karam Abu Salem crossing, controlled by the Israeli enemy, after the Israeli occupation military took control of Rafah and destroyed parts of it during its offensive in May. Humanitarian Aid Numbers and Shortages According to Al Jazeera, 7,926 trucks have entered Gaza since the ceasefire began, with about two-thirds carrying food supplies. However, only 208 trucks of tents have entered, far below the needed amount, and no temporary housing units have been delivered to either the north or south of Gaza. Additionally, 197 fuel trucks have entered, but the Civil Defense, municipalities, and power companies have not benefited from them. In a separate incident, a Palestinian fisherman was martyred by fire from Israeli naval vessels off the coast of Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. 19-year-old Palestinian fisherman Saher al-Qaran was killed in an Israeli attack on a fishing boat in Gaza's Nuseirat Refugee Camp, violating the ceasefire His body was taken to Al-Awda Hospital, where grieving relatives gathered pic.twitter.com/F6C9tVuOUo — Anadolu English (@anadoluagency) January 31, 2025 The ceasefire, which began its first phase on January 19, stipulates that 600 trucks of humanitarian aid will enter Gaza daily, and Rafah will reopen seven days after the agreement’s implementation. The ceasefire and prisoner swap are set to unfold over three phases, each lasting 42 days.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2327547	2025-01-31T11:30:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-03224260017378138647.jpg
Ceasefire Monitoring Committee Adheres to Israeli Demands in Sout...	The five-member ceasefire monitoring committee is adhering to Israeli demands regarding inspection operations in south Lebanon Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar reported on Friday. Deputy US Middle East envoy Morgan Ortagus began her first visit to Lebanon yesterday with a meeting in the US Embassy with General Jasper Jeffers, head of the ceasefire supervision committee, Al-Akhbar’s Amal Khalil reported. However, the committee's meeting, which has been suspended for nearly two weeks, remains unscheduled. Moreover, no assurances have been provided to compel Israeli occupation forces (IOF) to withdraw by February 18 or halt their ongoing attacks. Ortagus, who openly expresses her allegiance to the Zionist entity, and is repeatedly seen donning a Star of David necklace, agreed with Jeffers to initiate 'an intensive work program' in coordination with the Lebanese Army, the report added. This initiative aims to inspect approximately 30 locations allegedly suspected of housing Hezbollah resistance facilities north of the Litani River, particularly in the Zahrani and the Bekaa region. Morgan Ortagus, Deputy US Middle East envoy (image from archive). The committee had previously informed the Lebanese Army command that it possessed intelligence regarding buildings, warehouses, valleys, and forests allegedly used by Hezbollah to store weapons and ammunition—claims that originate from the Zionist entity, according to the report. In this context, sources noted a significant increase in the presence of Israeli reconnaissance drones over several areas in recent days, ranging from the Bekaa to Beirut, Iqlim Al-Kharroub, Zahrani, and the South. Despite protests from Lebanese military officers regarding the committee’s pro-Israel bias and its failure to address the expanding occupation of border towns as well as the murder and kidnapping of residents, their objections have been ignored by both the US and French embassies. Instead, this stance has seemingly emboldened Israeli threats to extend its occupation further under the pretext that the Lebanese Army is 'incapable of enforcing the agreement and UN Resolution 1701,' Al-Akhbar reported. The US on the other hand seeks to use its influence to appoint officers in the Lebanese Army and security forces who align with its interpretation of the ceasefire agreement and have no ties to Hezbollah. The paper quoted sources as saying that Ortagus intends to pressure Lebanese authorities into approving military and security appointments favoring officers endorsed by the US and France. This move is meant to suppress the popular uprising that led to the partial liberation of several towns last Sunday (January 26), and facilitated the Lebanese Army’s deployment. However, despite commitments from the Supervisory Committee and UNIFIL to deploy Lebanese forces in Aitaroun, Blida, Houla, and Mays Al-Jabal earlier this week, these promises have not materialized. Meanwhile, the IOF has expanded its occupation of newly reclaimed areas after being forced out by local resistance last Sunday. Israeli forces continue to carry out systematic demolitions, bulldozing homes, setting fires, and resuming airstrikes, Al-Akhbar’s Khalil added.

The sources suggest, according to the Lebanese journalist, that these developments have led 'Israel' to tighten its grip in southern Lebanon due to growing discontent among settlers in the north. In this context, sources doubt that 'Israel' will adhere to the remaining 18-day deadline, warning that the five positions the Zionist entity initially declared it would retain may increase further. Yesterday, Israeli forces launched two interceptor missiles over the Khiam, claiming to have shot down a Hezbollah drone following sirens in Ghajar and Metula. However, sources believe this may have been a staged incident designed to portray Metula’s security as fragile, justifying Israeli continued occupation of Hamames, Awida, Azzieh, Khiam plain, Adaisseh, and Kfar Kila. Additionally, occupation forces continued targeting vehicles involved in clearing rubble from border villages in search of martyrs’ bodies, using gunfire and drone-dropped bombs to impede their work, the report concluded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2327437	2025-01-31T08:36:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-04232500017382448008.jpg
