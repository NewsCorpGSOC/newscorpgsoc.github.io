The Red Cross vehicles left Gaza City and handed over the Israeli captives to the occupation military. In Tel Aviv, families of Israeli captives gathered in the Hostages Square, with their eyes on a screen that was installed to follow up on the prisoner exchange. Israeli media commented on the scenes of the captives in Palestine Square, with the Times of Israel describing the parade there as a show of force. For its part, the Israeli army could not hide annoyance over the handover ceremony. Military Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari slammed Hamas’s parade as 'cynical'. 'Hamas is a murderous terror group. In the last few hours Hamas proved its cruelty by organizing a cynical ceremony,' he said, as quoted by Israeli media. Hamas 'presented a misrepresentation of treatment and care for the hostages, while in reality, it is cruelly holding innocent civilians for 477 days,' Hagari said allegedly referring to the four female Israeli soldiers.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2321013	2025-01-25T02:53:34-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-01947220017378017393.jpg
US Calls for Urgent Extension of Ceasefire in South Lebanon as ‘I...	US National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a statement Friday that 'a short, temporary ceasefire extension is urgently needed' and the U.S. will work with 'regional partners' to secure it. 'President Trump is committed to ensuring Israeli citizens can safely return to their homes in northern Israel, while also supporting President Aoun and the new Lebanese government,' Hughes said. The Israeli occupation military will not complete its withdrawal from southern Lebanon within the 60-day period set out in the ceasefire deal that ended its war with Hezbollah, the Israeli prime minister's office said Friday. It is worth noting that the deadline will end on Sunday, January, 26, 2025, at 4 a.m. Thus, few hours separate the border area from dramatic developments if the Israeli enemy insists on keeping its troops occupying territories in South Lebanon. The Lebanese statesmen have repeatedly voiced concern over the Israeli occupation plots, calling on the United States, France and the United Nations sponsoring the ceasefire agreement to press 'Israel' to withdraw before the deadline. Hezbollah issued on Thursday a statement which underlines the necessity of the full and comprehensive implementation of the ceasefire agreement as outlined in its terms since the 60-day period for the Israeli enemy to completely withdraw from Lebanese territories is nearing its end. It is also important to note that, unlike Lebanon, the Zionist entity did not respect the obligations of the ceasefire during the 60-day period, launching air raids which left martyrs and injuries, demolishing buildings, scraping lands and roads, and destroying environmental features in several south Lebanon towns. The latest reports indicated that the Israeli occupation forces, guarded by Merkava tanks, advanced from Houla town into Wadi Slouki area. Moreover, the occupation forces carried out an incursion into Aitaroun town and cut its main highway which leads to Bint Jbeuil City. In addition, the Israeli enemy had intensively violated Lebanon's sovereignty and the stipulations of the ceasefire in South Lebanon.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2320760	2025-01-24T13:10:35-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-09347800017377530126.jpeg
Russia is Ready for Talks with Ukraine, but Kiev Stands against I...	Russia is still ready to hold negotiations on the Ukrainian conflict settlement, including with the United States, but the Kiev authorities are against it, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday. 'We have been always saying this, and I want to reiterate it, that we are ready for such negotiations on the Ukrainian issue,' he said in an interview with VGTRK journalist Pavel Zarubin after his visit to the Moscow State University commenting on US President Donal Trump’s one of the recent statements to launch talks with Russia on the Ukrainian conflict settlement. 'However, we are faced with some particular issues here that require special attention,' Putin continued. 'As you may all know well, for instance, the current head of the regime in Kiev, when he was still a fairly legitimate head of state, inked a decree banning all negotiations with Russia.' Russian President Putin earlier set forth the conditions for resolving the situation in Ukraine, which included Ukraine withdrawing troops from Donbass and Novorossiya and abandoning plans to join NATO. Moscow also believes that all Western sanctions on Russia must be removed and Ukraine’s non-bloc and non-nuclear status must be guaranteed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2320661	2025-01-24T10:14:12-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/06/manar-06264890016876045856.jpg

Israeli Ceasefire Violations in Lebanon Continue Despite Imminent...	Israeli occupation forces continue to violate the ceasefire agreement with Lebanon, despite the 60-day deadline for the withdrawal of Zionist troops set to expire this Sunday. These breaches represent a blatant and deliberate violation of both the ceasefire agreement and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. They raise significant questions about the responsibility of the parties overseeing the agreement and the international body tasked with monitoring its implementation. The violations also place the Lebanese state and UNIFIL forces under increasing pressure to protect Lebanon's sovereignty from Israeli transgressions. This Friday, Israeli enemy forces carried out a series of incursions into several southern border towns. According to Al-Manar correspondent reports, 'IOF infiltrated the town of Bani Hayyan at dawn, setting several homes on fire,' and also 'entered the town of Al-Qantara late Thursday night, burning cars and vandalizing the local mosque.'

Trump Highlights Ceasefire in Gaza US President Donald Trump underscored the importance of preserving the Gaza ceasefire, cautioning that its breakdown could cause serious problems. Speaking at the Davos Forum, Trump claimed that his administration had been instrumental in facilitating Middle East ceasefire negotiations, asserting that the agreement would not have been achieved without his team's efforts. Meanwhile, Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed his commitment to securing the return of all Israeli prisoners held in Gaza. During a video call with the families of three Israeli women recently released as part of the first phase of the prisoner exchange deal, Netanyahu vowed to continue efforts to ensure the release of the remaining detainees.

Protests in Tel Aviv Over Prisoner Exchange and Judicial Reforms Hundreds of Zionists gathered outside the Ministry of War in the occupied city of Tel Aviv to demand the completion of all phases of the prisoner exchange deal to secure the return of detainees from Gaza. The demonstration also voiced strong opposition to recent actions by the so-called Justice Minister Yariv Levin, who has resumed efforts to implement controversial judicial reforms. Protesters argued that the reforms undermine the principle of separation of powers and weaken the judiciary’s independence. The demonstrators pledged to continue their protests until all Israeli prisoners held in Gaza are returned.

Among voters for Likud, Religious Zionism, and Shas, 59% expressed support for the agreement. The survey also found that 52% of respondents attribute the success of the deal to former US President Donald Trump. However, only 33% of Religious Zionism Party supporters favor a return to war, while just 31% of Likud voters support resuming hostilities after the first phase of the deal. Overall, only 17% of Israelis are restarting the conflict after the first phase is completed. The poll further indicated that the Religious Zionism Party, led by Bezalel Smotrich, would fail to cross the electoral threshold if elections were held today. In contrast, the Democratic Alliance is projected to secure 12 seats in the Knesset, marking a surprising surge in its popularity.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2320254	2025-01-24T04:19:47-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-06424900017377208875.jpg
Prominent Israeli Officials Resign Amid Gaza Defeat, IRGC Chief S...	The chief commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) has declared that the resignations of prominent Israeli officials are a clear indication of the regime's defeat in Gaza. 'All of Gaza was destroyed, but hearts remained strong; in 'Israel', there was less destruction, but hearts were shattered,' Major General Hussein Salami told a local event in the central Iranian city of Kashan on Thursday evening. 'Look at Israeli officials, they are all depressed and disturbed, handing over their resignations. This is a clear sign of defeat as they confess to it.' IRGC Chief Commander Major General Salami: The resignation of Israeli military officials after the end of the Gaza war is a clear sign of their defeat in this war. — IRNA News Agency (@IrnaEnglish) January 24, 2025 ‘Israel’ was forced to agree to a ceasefire in Gaza on January 19 after failing to achieve its objectives in the besieged territory. Palestinians celebrated the ceasefire as a victory, with some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners set to be released from Israeli prisons in exchange for Israeli captives held in Gaza. 'Those who kept their hearts strong emerged victorious, singing songs of triumph amidst the ruins of their homes,' Salami said, noting that despite Israelis, Palestinians are 'joyful' as they 'resisted under fire, in hunger and thirst, but never abandoned God.' The remarks come as the largest Israeli daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth has listed the most high-profile figures from the Israeli military who have resigned over failures in the run-up to the Gaza war and after that. The list includes the chief of the general staff, the commander of the southern region, the commander of the Gaza division, the head of the military intelligence division, the commander of intelligence unit 8200, and the commander of the northern brigade in the Gaza Strip. Salami noted that the United States, Israel and Britain colluded with each other to crush a defenseless nation, but Palestinians withstood the scheme, held firm and emerged victorious. 'Recent events have shown that blood triumphs over the sword, and the Palestinian nation won the battle against the Zionists,' the IRGC chief commander said. He went on to note that arrogant powers, spearheaded by the US and Israel, are sowing the seeds of sedition in the Muslim world. 'All wars that enemies, led by the United States and the Zionist regime, have waged have been in Muslim lands. They destroyed Muslim’s houses, killed men and women and decimated women and children,' said Salami. He went on to praise the steadfastness of Muslim women and women, stressing that enemies would have taken full control of Muslim countries in case Muslims had not put up spirited resistance.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2320265	2025-01-24T04:10:35-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-044897600173772062210.jpg

The dire situation in Gaza is further compounded by the severe damage to the region's education system. The UN agency UNRWA reported that close to 660,000 children are currently out of school, and over 14,500 children have been killed in the ongoing aggression on Gaza. UNICEF has also sounded the alarm over a looming mental health crisis affecting nearly all 1.1 million children in Gaza. The relentless bombardment, loss of loved ones, and worsening humanitarian crisis have left many children grappling with nightmares, severe anxiety, and paralyzing fear. Experts warn that the profound psychological effects of the war could haunt these children for generations.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2320221	2025-01-24T02:37:07-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/08/manar-03094710017251206154.jpg

Markets of Northern Gaza Filled with Joy Again	The Israeli occupation forces violated on Thursday the ceasefire in Gaza, launching an air raid on a house in Rafah, which left a number of Palestinians dead or injured. Meanwhile, the Palestinian locals continued moving back from South Gaza to the Strip's North. However, the massive destruction and the slow flow of humanitarian aid turn the return to be gradual. In Jabalia camp, for example, the locals are exerting much efforts to cope with the cold temperature and the rainfall, amid features of social solidarity. Markets in northern Gaza were filled with joy with the arrival of basic goods, such as food supplies, vegetables, fruits and meat, knowing that the locals were deprived from such products for 15 months. The ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip officially came into effect on Sunday morning, marking the end of 471 days of relentless military aggression by Israeli occupation forces on the besieged enclave.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2319957	2025-01-23T12:49:30-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-09952370017376653613.jpg

Hezbollah issued on Thursday a statement which underlines the necessity of the full and comprehensive implementation of the ceasefire agreement as outlined in its terms since the 60-day period for the Israeli enemy to completely withdraw from Lebanese territories is nearing its end. Certain leaks suggesting that the enemy intends to delay its withdrawal and prolong its presence in Lebanon call on everyone—foremost the political leadership in Lebanon and those pressing the agreement's sponsoring nations—to act decisively, the statement maintained. 'It is essential to closely monitor the final days of this timeline to ensure the complete withdrawal, the deployment of the Lebanese Army to every inch of Lebanese territory, the swift return of residents to their villages, and the prevention of any pretexts or excuses for prolonging the occupation.' 'Any breach of the 60-day timeline constitutes a blatant violation of the agreement, an attack on Lebanese sovereignty, and the beginning of a new chapter of occupation,' the statement added, 'This demands that the state confront it using all means and methods sanctioned by international conventions to reclaim the land and wrest it from the grip of the occupation.' As we continue to follow developments, which are expected to culminate in a full withdrawal in the coming days, we affirm that any breach of the agreement or attempt to evade commitments under weak pretexts will not be tolerated, the statement confirmed. Finally, Hezbollah called for strict adherence to the agreement, without concessions.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2319825	2025-01-23T07:31:19-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-027725400166239486010.jpg
Ansarullah Dismisses US ‘Terrorist’ Designation, Calling it a Bad...	Yemen's Ansarullah resistance group has firmly rejected the United States' recent decision to designate it as a 'Foreign Terrorist Organization', calling it a misguided effort that only serves to highlight their unwavering support for the Palestinian people. Nasr al-Din Amer, the deputy head of Ansarullah's press service, stated that being included on the US list of allies would have posed a greater threat than being labeled a terrorist organization. 'Being on the US list of friends is far more provocative than being designated as a terrorist group,' he asserted. Amer emphasized that the US is targeting Yemen due to its support for Gaza, which he described as a 'great honor' for the Yemeni people and integral to their ongoing struggle. He added that Ansarullah's members do not have any investments, bank accounts, or businesses in the United States, nor do they travel to the country. The Palestinian Mujahideen Movement echoed Ansarullah's sentiments, describing the US designation as an 'attack on the Yemeni people' and a 'badge of honor' that confirms Ansarullah is on the right path. The movement highlighted the Yemeni forces' crucial role in supporting Palestinians, characterizing their actions as honorable and essential in the fight against Israel's 'genocide' in the Gaza Strip.

It stressed that the real perpetrators of terrorism are the Israeli leaders, specifically Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet, who stand accused of committing genocide in Gaza. The US President Donald Trump officially designated Ansarullah as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) on Wednesday, threatening to mobilize its regional proxies against Yemen in an attempt to pressure the Yemeni people to abandon their support for Gaza. The designation came in response to the Yemeni army's military operations on Israeli-occupied territories and assaults on US Navy warships and Israel-linked vessels in the region since November 2023, launched in support of Palestinians being killed by Israel in Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2319616	2025-01-23T03:49:40-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/01/manar-06980580016429597565.jpg

The latest attacks come amid a new Israeli military operation dubbed 'Iron Wall' that was launched in Jenin on January 21, following a decision by the Israeli cabinet to include the West Bank among the targets of the ongoing war.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2319440	2025-01-22T23:56:39-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-02065920017355558258.jpg
Israeli Carries Out More Ceasefire Violations in South Lebanon Fe...	The Israeli occupation forces continued on Wednesday violating the ceasefire stipulations in South Lebanon, executing big explosions in several towns. The Zionist occupation forces intensified its violations, especially in Taybeh, Aita Al-Shaab, Yaroun and Mays Al-Jabal, few days before the end of the 60-day deadline stipulated by the ceasefire agreement pertaining to the withdrawal of the enemy troops from South Lebanon. In this regard, the Israeli enemy executed explosions in Aita Al-Shaab, Hanin, Mays Al-Jabal, and Markaba. NNA reported that the body of the citizen Mohammad Tormos was found in Tallousa town few days after he had been killed by the occupation forces.

Imam Khamenei: Gaza Emerged Victorious, Thanks to Mythical Steadf...	Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei called on Iranian officials to seize the opportunity provided by the country’s membership in BRICS, stressing the need to eliminate dependence on the US dollar. As the Iranian officials have organized the 'Pioneers of Progress' event, a group of domestic manufacturers and private sector owners met with Ayatollah Khamenei at the Imam Khomeini Hussainiyah of Tehran on Wednesday, January 22. In remarks at the meeting, the Leader described Iran’s membership in BRICS as one of the great opportunities that should be thoroughly used to counter the sanctions and contribute to Iran’s economic growth. Calling on Iranian diplomatic officials to assist the economic sector, Ayatollah Khamenei described the financial system of BRICS as a great opportunity for Iran. He said trade exchanges among the BRICS member states in their own currencies will be of great help to Iran, saying one of Iran’s problems at present is dependence on the US dollar. The Leader said a number of the BRICS members do not dare to scrap the US dollar because of political reasons, stressing the need to encourage them to do so through diplomatic activities. 'The purpose is for them (BRICS members) to omit (the US) dollar from the trade exchanges as far as possible. This would be a great and important job. In the economic campaign, this is a very decisive and determining move,' Ayatollah Khamenei stated. Warning against the reactions to the elimination of the dollar from the trade transactions, the Leader said Iran’s economy will gain advantages once the program is implemented and the Central Bank of Iran paves the way for the use of foreign currencies other than the US dollar. 'Today, our war is the economic war,' Ayatollah Khamenei added, emphasizing the need for Iran’s production growth with the help of the private sector. The duty of a country that has been sanctioned is to rely upon its own internal capacities, the Leader noted. He also called on the Iranian government to assist the private sector and remove the obstacles in its way. His Eminence also praised the progress made by the private sector despite years of illegal US-led sanctions targeting the country’s economy. The Leader also pointed to the studies carried out by working groups on the materialization of an 8 percent economic growth in Iran, saying the experts have detected the capacities and capabilities, defined the investment plans, and determined the solutions. Ayatollah Khamenei finally urged the officials to seriously pursue and carry out those solutions to ensure the 8-percent economic growth rate in Iran. Imam Khamenei reiterated that resistance is alive and will endure, and Gaza has emerged victorious, adding that what happened in the war is mythical. Without the US support, the Zionist entity would have been defeated in the first weeks, Imam Khamenei maintained.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2319187	2025-01-22T07:48:09-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-011444700173756087710.jpg
Israeli Media: IOF Plunges into Internal Crisis as Halevi Resigns...	Military analysts in Israeli media on Wednesday described the Israeli occupation army as being 'mired in a severe crisis,' a direct consequence of the events of October 7, 2023. They highlighted that the selection of a new Chief of Staff to replace Herzi Halevi, who announced his resignation on Tuesday, would hinge on the impact of October 7 and the candidate's loyalty to Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Halevi Held Accountable for Intelligence Failures Amos Harel, the military analyst for Haaretz, noted that Halevi, 'as a professional military officer, not only recognized the operational failure during his tenure but also bore significant responsibility for it.' Harel emphasized that Halevi, alongside Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, had convened discussions on the night of October 6-7 based on intelligence indicators suggesting Hamas militants were preparing for an operation after activating Israeli SIM cards on their phones. However, Halevi decided neither to mobilize forces nor issue directives to the Military Intelligence Directorate (Aman) to investigate Hamas' actions further. According to Harel, the outcome of Hamas' attack could have been different. He attributed Halevi's misjudgment to his military upbringing in elite units like the General Staff Reconnaissance Unit and special operations forces. These units, Harel explained, typically operate with a cautious approach, relying on gathering maximum intelligence while minimizing exposure to sensitive sources. 'The special operations personnel are accustomed to preparing for missions over months, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the intelligence picture before making decisions. This caution, rooted in a fear of prematurely exposing intelligence coverage to the enemy, may have contributed to the IOF's inadequate response to the October 7 events,' Harel elaborated. Despite military investigations, Harel noted that the full extent of the failure remains unclear. Internal tensions at various levels of the IOF persist, exacerbating the ongoing crisis. He further highlighted severe challenges within the middle ranks of the permanent officer corps, where many have left the army without being replaced. This has placed an unsustainable burden on reserve forces, compounded by public anger over government policies. Among these policies is a controversial draft exemption law favoring Haredim Zionists, which critics view as entrenching inequality. Top Contenders for IOF Chief of Staff The leading candidates for the position include Eyal Zamir, Director-General of the Ministry of War, who previously served as Deputy Chief of Staff and was a contender for the role currently held by Halevi; the current Deputy Chief of Staff, Amir Baram; and the Northern Command Chief, Uri Gordin. A fourth candidate, backed by right-wing politicians, is Netanyahu's military secretary, Ruman Gofman. However, Gofman is considered to lack sufficient military experience for the role, having been promoted to the rank of general only a year ago. Palestinian resistance fighters as they capture Israeli occupation soldiers during an attack on a militray post in Gaza envelope as part of Op. Al-Aqsa Flood (October 7, 2023). Delayed Resignations of IOF Commanders Deepen Crisis Amid the resignation of IOF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Southern Command Chief Yaron Finkelman, military analyst Yossi Yehoshua from Yedioth Ahronoth described their departures as 'long overdue and irrationally delayed.' Yehoshua emphasized that the nearly 500-day delay following the October 7 events severely damaged both internal trust within the army's senior leadership and public confidence. He stated that the Zionist public still lacks a full understanding of the catastrophic failures of that night and the following day. 'The grim truth will eventually emerge, exposing how the collapse of the IOF’s morale resembled a house of cards. Many disillusioned officers either left the army or retreated to less impactful roles, discouraged by tainted investigations and appointment processes designed to cover up failures,' Yehoshua wrote. He also highlighted Halevi’s statement that there was no 'internal betrayal' on October 7, countering accusations from right-wing factions. However, Yehoshua asserted that what occurred was an unparalleled collapse of command structures, starting with Halevi, Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar, and other top commanders. 'Those who haven’t yet resigned must do so soon, and the sooner, the better,' he stated. Strategic Failures, Tensions Within the IOF Military analyst Yehoshua also pointed out that the war itself carries significant failures for which outgoing Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi must take responsibility. 'While the Israeli army achieved gains in Gaza, it failed to secure a decisive military victory. Political factors played a role, but serious errors were made in the management of battles and operations,' Yehoshua noted. He further criticized Halevi for running the war with a reduced command structure that excluded Deputy Chief of Staff Amir Baram, highlighting the toxic dynamic between the two leaders that surfaced within the occupation army. The Israeli army releases image of the two occupation soldiers killed in Gaza (January 7, 2024). Ceasefire and Military Disappointment Yehoshua concluded by describing the Gaza ceasefire agreement as merely the starting point of fulfilling the moral obligation toward the hostages and their families. However, he also saw it as emblematic of military disappointment, stating, 'The sheer amount of ammunition and forces deployed in Gaza, considering its size, marks an unprecedented event in history—but it failed to deliver the expected results.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2319077	2025-01-22T04:27:44-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-09980910017044580712.jpg
Google Aiding Israeli Occupation Military with AI Technology, Was...	The Washington Post has revealed that Google has been working to provide the Israeli occupation military with the latest artificial intelligence (AI) technologies since the early weeks of the 2021 war on Gaza. According to the report, Google's cooperation with the Israeli Ministry of Defense began in 2021, when the Israeli government requested to expand its use of Google's 'Vertex' AI service for military applications. The Post notes that a Google employee even warned that the Israeli military would turn to Amazon's services if it could not obtain the desired AI capabilities from Google. ⚡️🇮🇱BREAKING: Google provided Israel with AI technology which was used in Gaza and the West Bank.

(@SuppressedNws) January 22, 2025 The newspaper states that the Israeli occupation military sought access to Google's 'Gemini' AI technology to develop its own AI assistant for processing documents and audio. Documents show the military continued utilizing Google's latest AI tools even as the 2021 airstrikes reduced large parts of Gaza to rubble. The Post reports that over 100 Google employees urged the company to reconsider its work with the Israeli military, but Google largely ignored their concerns. While Google claims to distance itself from the Israeli government's national security operations, the company did fire over 50 employees last year who protested the 'Nimbus' cloud computing contract, which they feared would enable military and intelligence uses harmful to Palestinians. Google maintains the Nimbus contract, valued in the billions, does not involve 'highly sensitive, secret, or military functions related to weapons or intelligence.' However, Israeli officials have stated the deal would include collaboration with the military. The Washington Post was unable to determine precisely how the Israeli occupation military employs Google's AI capabilities. But the report cites previous statements from an Israeli cybersecurity official confirming the Nimbus contract directly supports combat applications, stating 'Amazing things happen during combat, and these things play a major role in victory.' The article notes the Israeli occupation military has been expanding its use of AI for years to expedite intelligence processing and target selection, including deploying an internally-developed AI tool called 'Hepsora' during the 2021 Gaza war to identify bombing targets. While some Israeli leaders have raised concerns about Hepsora's accuracy, the military's reliance on advanced AI technologies like those from Google appears to be growing.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2319011	2025-01-22T01:40:49-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-05880190017375388422.jpg

Halevi Announces Resignation, Calls on Netanyahu to Take Similar ...	Israeli Chief of Military Staff Herzi Halevi announced on Tuesday his resignation, calling on the Prime Minister Benhjamin Netanyahu and the rest of the members of the Security Cabinet to take a similar action. In his resignation letter, Halevi indicated that he would assume the responsibility for the failure on October 7, 2023, affirming that the Army failed to defend 'Israel'. He acknowledged his failure to protect Israel's security on October 7, which led to great human and material losses. He stressed that he bears full responsibility for this failure, which will haunt him throughout his life. We suffered heavy casualties and the war left many of our soldiers and their families with wounds and scars, Halevi said. Halevi explained that the goals of the war have not yet been fully achieved, stressing the continuation of efforts to dismantle Hamas' capabilities and return all the kidnapped. He pointed out that he has begun extensive investigations to learn lessons and strengthen the army's capabilities, stressing that these investigations are proceeding accurately and comprehensively. According to Israeli media, Halevi's resignation will take effect on March 6. Following the resignation of the Chief of Staff, Yisrael Beiteinu Party Chairman Avigdor Lieberman called on the Prime Minister and the rest of the members of the Security Cabinet to resign 'I call on the Prime Minister and the rest of the members of the Security Cabinet to take responsibility and leave their positions.'

Watch: Palestinian Surgeon Censures Sky News Host over Oct. 7	Mainstream media goes ahead with its war of information aimed at disinforming the people in the West over the reality of the Israeli genocide which lasted for more than 15 months in Gaza. An operation which killed few hundreds of Israeli colonizers (many of them were killed by their own army) on October 7, 2023, justifies the brutal killing or injuring of more than 146,000 people in Gaza! That’s the equation by the mainstream media. However, many activists, including Palestinians with dual nationalities, counter such propaganda. Palestinian-British surgeon Dr. Ghassan Bu Sitta appeared via Sky News on Sunday, just few hours after the ceasefire in Gaza took effect. He lashed out at the pro-Israeli narrative propagated by mainstream media. 'The UK media refers to Israelis as ‘hostages’, while to Palestinians illegally held by Israel, including children, as ‘prisoners’.' When asked by the Sky News host: 'Do you wish [Oct 7] had never happened?', he gave her a rocket by saying: 'I wish 1948 had never happened.' 🚨British-Palestinian surgeon Dr Ghassan Abu Sittah has blasted Sky News for 'racially othering' Palestinians.

Trump Reverses Sanctions on Israeli Settlers in West Bank	US President Donald Trump has rescinded sanctions imposed by the previous Biden administration on far-right Israeli settler groups and individuals accused of violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. The White House website stated that Trump signed an executive order to rescind Executive Order 14115, which had authorized sanctions on 'Persons Undermining Peace, Security, and Stability in the West Bank.' This marks a reversal of a key decision by the Biden administration, which had slapped sanctions on numerous Israeli settler entities and individuals, freezing their US assets and barring Americans from dealing with them. Israel expects President Trump to lift the Biden administration's hold on the supply of 2,000-pound bombs in his first days in office, outgoing Israeli ambassador to the U.S. Mike Herzog told Axios. — Axios (@axios) January 20, 2025 The move comes as violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank and ongoing land grabs in the occupied territory have raised concerns among some of Israel's Western allies. The decision to lift the sanctions is seen as a significant victory for the pro-settlement lobby and a blow to efforts to rein in settler violence and illegal land seizures in the occupied Palestinian territories.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2318120	2025-01-21T00:20:28-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-09048410017374475824.jpg

Canal 'Is And Will Remain' Panamanian: Panama’s President Tells T...	President Donald Trump on Monday cast himself as a peacemaker in his second inaugural address, but immediately vowed that the United States would be 'taking back' the Panama Canal. Trump issued the threat without explaining details after weeks of refusing to rule out military action against Panama over the waterway, which the United States handed over at the end of 1999. 'Above all, China is operating the Panama Canal, and we didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama. And we're taking it back,' Trump said after being sworn in inside the US Capitol. Panama maintains control of the canal but Chinese companies have been steadily increasing their presence around the vital shipping link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino swiftly denied that any other nation was interfering in the canal, which he said his country operated with a principle of neutrality. 'I must comprehensively reject the words of President Donald Trump,' President Jose Raul Mulino said in a statement published on social media. 'The canal is and will remain Panama's,' he added, dismissing Trump's claim that China is operating the canal. 'There is no presence of any nation in the world that interferes,' Mulino said. The canal was built by the United States and opened in 1914. It was handed to Panama on December 31, 1999, under treaties signed some two decades earlier by then-US president Jimmy Carter and Panamanian nationalist leader Omar Torrijos.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2317911	2025-01-20T12:47:15-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-08249160017374060238.png
Trump Delivers Inauguration Speech, Pledges to Restore 'Trust in ...	US President Donald Trump took office Monday as the nation’s 47th leader, portraying himself and his incoming administration as one that will immediately spring into action to take the country back. With a series of promised executive orders — some of which were designed to undo the executive orders of former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama — Trump moved from the presidential oath to the first actions of his second term. 'The golden age of America begins right now,' Trump said. 'From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world.' In a roughly 30-minute address from the U.S. Capitol Rotunda, where the inauguration was moved due to frigid temperatures, he outlined his vision for the country and plans that will shape his presidency and legacy. Here are the biggest takeaways from Trump’s inaugural address. Trump pledges to restore trust in government Trump began his speech with an optimistic tone while seeming to acknowledge that many Americans’ faith in government institutions has waned in recent years. He mentioned the federal response to hurricane victims in North Carolina last fall and the ongoing response to California wildfires as areas he saw trust broken. 'As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust,' Trump said. 'For many years, a radical establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay completely broken and seemingly in complete disrepair.' This statement appears similar to former President Joe Biden’s warning of an 'oligarchy' during last week’s farewell address. Executive orders Trump came out swinging with his promise to crack down on illegal immigration and crime, promising sweeping executive action right away. The list of his priorities included sending military troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to address a surge of migrants, formally designating Mexican cartels supplying illegal drugs as terrorist organizations and invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to 'eliminate' criminal gangs operating in the U.S. Other executive orders Trump announced would declare a national energy emergency, and rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America, and Alaska’s Denali, the highest mountain peak in North America, to Mount McKinley. Outreach to the Black, Hispanic communities Trump thanked the increasing number of Black and Hispanic voters who carried him to victory, vowing he 'will not forget' their support. According to Associated Press exit polls, Trump received support from about 16% of Black voters and 43% of Hispanics — both record numbers for Republican candidates in the modern era. He recognized Monday as Martin Luther King Jr. Day and vowed to fight to 'make his dream a reality,' referring to King’s famous 'I Have a Dream…' speech in 1963. Going to Mars Trump said he will revitalize the American space program by sending astronauts to Mars. 'We will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the stars and stripes on the plant Mars.' Trump ally Elon Musk could be seen smiling and giving a thumbs-up when Trump declared his intention to go to Mars. Tech and media leaders as VIPs It wasn’t just the American people Trump was addressing on Monday. He had some of the most powerful and influential leaders in VIP seats, including tech leaders like Musk and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, as well as Fox News magnate Rupert Murdoch and podcast host Joe Rogan, among others. Additional supporters sat in the Capitol’s Emancipation Hall, which was set up as an overflow viewing room, and included artificial intelligence billionaires Sam Altman and Alexandr Wang, YouTube influencers and brothers Logan and Jake Paul, indicted New York Mayor Eric Adams, former NASCAR driver Danica Patrick and more. Wealthy tech leaders, such as Amazon owner Jeff Bezos, getting better seats than Cabinet nominees and elected lawmakers is unusual for inaugurations. However, many top business leaders have a long and deep history of lobbying presidents and members of Congress.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2317834	2025-01-20T11:01:09-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-05225220017373996544.jpg
Sayyed Houthi Congratulates Palestinian People: We Are Observing ...	Leader of Yemen’s Ansarullah movement, Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi,described on Monday Gaza victory as great and historic, expressing gratitude to Allah over this bless of supporting the fighters, strengthening their resolve, and granting steadfastness to the Palestinian people. Sayyed Houthi warmly congratulated the Palestinian people and all the resistance factions in Gaza, especially Al-Qassam Brigades and Al-Quds Brigades. 'Al-Aqsa Flood operation was a pivotal, significant, and transformative event that advanced the Palestinian cause to a new stage.' Cooperation among the Palestinian factions was pivotal in achieving these remarkable results, granted by Allah, Sayyed Houthi said. 'The fighters in Gaza, despite limited capabilities and an intense blockade, stood firm against the heavily armed enemy, which mobilized its forces in Gaza, with American and British support, aiming to destroy resistance activities and eliminate any jihadi movement.' Despite significant sacrifices, including the martyrdom of leaders like Ismail Haniyeh, Al-Arouri, and Al-Sinwar, may Allah have mercy on them, the fighters’ determination remained unbroken, he affirmed. 'Despite widespread Arab official betrayal and negative stances from certain Arab regimes and the Palestinian Authority, Allah granted the fighters success and steadfastness,' Houthi added, 'Despite genocide, total blockade, and destruction of life’s essentials, the steadfastness of the Palestinian people achieved meaningful outcomes.' Sayyed Houthi noted that the negotiations and their intervals were true arenas for political confrontation against immense American and Western pressures. This round of confrontation with the Israeli enemy marks a pivotal chapter in the history of the struggle against the 'Israeli' occupation, Houthi added. Sayyed Houthi vowed resumption of military attacks if the Zionist attacks on Gaza are resumed, saying ''We are observing the ceasefire with our finger on the trigger.' 'Hezbollah contributed significantly to striking the Israeli enemy, participating in major operations and comprehensive confrontations, and inflicting substantial depletion on the enemy.' Hezbollah's role in inflicting severe losses and damages during its jihadi efforts and resistance against 'Israeli' aggression on Lebanon is remarkable, Sayyed Houthi affirmed. The support front in Iraq continued its operations until recently, as some factions persisted until victory was achieved, he added. The Yemeni leader indicated that the Islamic Republic of Iran consistently provided unwavering support despite pressures and temptations, along with its unprecedented major operations, exemplified by the 'True Promise.' Sayyed Houthi confirmed that Yemen's support front amazed the world with its steadfastness, popular momentum, and high-level commitment to the cause. Speaking about Yemen's contributions is not for boasting but rather fulfilling a sacred duty and religious responsibility, he noted. 'The Yemeni experience is significant for building on its achievements for the present and future. The Yemeni stance stemmed from an authentic faith-based launch and a Quranic orientation of the noble Yemeni people.' The US and its allies failed to influence Yemen's position which sincerely reflected the people's will and aspirations, he added. 'The Yemeni people expressed their desire to actively participate alongside the Palestinian fighters in direct combat. However, some governments, regimes, and countries between us and Palestine did not respond to requests for safe land routes to access Palestine.' The Americans sent us a message of threats, warnings, and intimidation. However, by Allah's guidance, we responded decisively and carried out the first operation when the 'Israeli' enemy committed the major crime of targeting Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, Sayyed Houthi clarified. Houthi noted that the operation targeting Umm Al-Rashrash and southern Palestine marked the first phase of our military support operations, utilizing our maximum available capacity. 'The Americans and their allies were shocked by Yemen's unprecedented use of ballistic missiles in naval operations. For the first time in history, ballistic missiles, typically used for fixed land targets, were employed to strike moving targets at sea.' The use of ballistic missiles in naval operations resulted from the missile forces' technical expertise and innovation, Houthi confirmed. 'Our armed forces succeeded during that phase in halting the Israeli enemy's direct maritime activities in the Red Sea using its own ships. The American and Israeli enemies were greatly disturbed by the complete halt of the export and import of goods through the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab.' Sayyed Houthi emphasized the maritime blockade on the 'Israeli' enemy had a direct impact on its economy. Aggressive operations against our country were accompanied by extensive aerial surveillance using satellites and all types of reconnaissance aircraft, he added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2317801	2025-01-20T09:40:51-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-062354000173739453710.png
Hezbollah Expresses Pride in Gaza’s Victory, Reiterates Support f...	Hezbollah congratulated, in a statement issued on Monday, the great Palestinian people as well as their valiant resistance, all the resistance forces that supported Gaza, the Arab and Islamic nation, and the free people of the world on this great victory that came as a culmination of the legendary and historic steadfastness, over more than 15 months since the start of the Al-Aqsa Flood epic, which constituted an example to be followed in confronting the Zionist-American aggression the whole region. On this great occasion in the history of the Palestinian cause and the struggle against the Zionist enemy, the statement added, Hezbollah is concerned to emphasize the following: 1- This historic victory confirms once again that the option of resistance is the only choice capable of deterring the occupation and frustrating its aggressive plots. It represents a new strategic defeat for the Zionist enemy and its supporters and confirms that the time of imposing dictates is over, and that the will of free peoples is unbreakable, and even stronger than all the machines of Zionist and American war and terrorism. 2- Reaching a ceasefire agreement by imposing the conditions of the resistance and without giving up the rights of the Palestinian people represents a political victory added to the military achievement, and indicates that the occupation was unable to achieve any of its goals by force or break the will and steadfastness of the Palestinian people. 3- The Palestinian resistance has proven during this battle that it is strong and capable of breaking the arrogance and tyranny of the Zionist enemy, despite all its crimes and brutal aggression. It stressed that this temporary entity is a fragile entity that has no ability to survive and continue, and that it will not enjoy security or stability as long as it continues its aggression against our people, our land and its sanctities. 4- This victory was achieved thanks to the resistance, steadfastness, perseverance and patience of the Palestinian people, children, women, elderly and men, and thanks to the blood of the martyrs who rose in the most honorable and greatest battle, foremost among them the martyr leaders, martyr Ismail Haniyeh and martyr Yahya Sinwar, who led the fields of honor and redemption, embodied the highest meanings of sacrifice and giving, and wrote with their blood epics of heroism that thwarted the enemy’s goals and projects. This blood will remain a beacon that guides our nation towards victory and freedom. 5- What the Zionist occupation did during this war by committing the most heinous crimes and genocide, which targeted civilians, children, women and the elderly, will remain a historical witness for the barbarism of this entity and its supporters and will remain engraved in the memory of generations, and a stigma on the forehead of the silent and indifferent international community. 6- The United States of America is a full partner in the crimes and genocide committed by the enemy against the Palestinian people, and it bears full responsibility due to its continuous and ongoing support for this occupation militarily, security-wise, intelligence-wise, politically and diplomatically. 7- We hail the efforts of the forces of the support fronts, who are partners in the great victory and have played a pivotal role in supporting the resistance and strengthening its steadfastness and presented a constellation of righteous martyrs all the way to Al-Quds. We salute the Islamic Republic of Iran, which has been a fundamental pillar of the resistance's steadfastness and has endured all the pressures and risks for the sake of Palestine. We salute the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, whose drones and missiles have not stopped and have overcome all obstacles in support of Gaza. We salute the strength and courage of our mujahid brothers in Yemen who imposed a siege on the Zionist entity and challenged the fleets of major countries in order to support Palestine. 8- Hezbollah expresses its pride and honor in this blessed victory of the Palestinian people and their resistance, which it has been a partner in achieving through the steadfastness, perseverance and sacrifices of the resistance and its people in Lebanon, which sacrificed for this purpose the most precious of what it possesses, the master of the Ummah’s martyrs, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallahb along with Sayyed Sayyed Al-Hashemi Hashem Safieddine, a large number of leaders and mujahidin, and martyrs from its loyal and faithful people who carried the banner of defending Palestine with all strength and faith. Hezbollah renews its confirmation of its permanent support for the Palestinian people and their resistance in the battle of liberation and dignity until the end of the occupation.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2317746	2025-01-20T07:25:06-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/09/manar-027725400166239486010.jpg
Israeli media: Hamas Emerges Strength and Civil Rule in Gaza Afte...	Israeli media outlets have reported that the emergence of Hamas resistance group during the recent ceasefire in Gaza has demonstrated the group's military strength and signs of its civil rule in the territory. #فيديو | ⭕ 'كل الفخر بالمقاومة.. إحنا معهم قلبا وقالبا'&#8230; كلمات شاب فلسطيني خلال تسليم الأسيرات الإسرائيليات يوم أمس وسط مدينة غزة. pic.twitter.com/mIK5PvOKC0 — وكالة شهاب للأنباء (@ShehabAgency) January 20, 2025 Criticisms continue within ‘Israel’ regarding the ceasefire, which went into effect on Sunday. As residents of Gaza returned to their homes, the Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, was seen among the people. According to Amir Bohbot, a military analyst for the Israeli website Walla, the survival of Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida represents 'a failure of the Israeli security and military establishments.' Bohbot said the Israeli authorities have neglected the importance of 'awareness and psychological warfare' in the digital age. Amos Harel, a military affairs analyst for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, commented on the appearance of hundreds of Hamas fighters just kilometers from where Israeli forces were stationed until recently. Harel said this display showed Hamas' military strength and signs of civil control in Gaza. Harel noted that Hamas' presence is already being felt in the northern part of the Strip, including Gaza City, Jabalia and Beit Hanoun - areas from which the Israeli army withdrew only at the end of the latest war. The analyst predicted that 'crowds will begin to flow north' once the Netzarim axis southwest of Gaza City is evacuated, estimating that over a million people will return. Haaretz also reported that the 'full details of the Israeli concessions have begun to emerge,' including the release of Palestinian prisoners, which is 'provoking strong reactions among Israelis.' The newspaper stressed that 'Israel was required to make major concessions' to complete the prisoner release deal. Harel concluded that 'Israel largely lost the war on October 7, 2023,' and that everything since then has been 'an attempt to minimize some of the damage.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2317625	2025-01-20T02:57:38-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-07025520017373706501.jpg
Hamas: Hezbollah Decision to Support Gaza Written in Gold in Hist...	Hamas top official Osama Hamadan on Sunday laud Hezbollah for its decision to back the resistance in Gaza, as he hailed support fronts in Yemen and Iraq. In an interview with Al-Manar, hours after the ceasefire in Gaza took effect, the Hamas official said the Israeli occupation announced major slogans for the war, but it backed down from all these titles. 'The Israeli occupation 'wanted to eradicate the resistance, but it was forced to sit at the negotiating table. It wanted to release the captives by force, but it could only achieve that through negotiations. Meanwhile, the resistance remained steadfast in the battlefield by the will of its people,' he said. The Hamas official hailed the support fronts for backing Gaza its resistance and people in face of the Israeli genocidal war throughout 471 days. 'The international community realized the existence of a latent force within the nation, represented by the fronts which did all it can in a bid to support Gaza.' 'Our brothers in Yemen blocked the sea in face of the enemy, while the brothers in Iraq broke down the distance barrier. As for Lebanon, Hezbollah advanced and offered support despite sacrifices,' Hamdan told Al-Manar. 'It must be written in gold in history the decision of the Hezbollah leadership, led by the Master of the Martyrs of the Nation, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, to support and back the Palestinian resistance since the first day of the war, even before the coordination meetings between the Lebanese and Palestinian resistance. This decision represented the unity of the nation and its determination to confront the occupation.' Late Hezbollah S.G. Sayyed Nasrallah in a meeting with Islamic Jihad and Hamas leaders (October 2023). He noted that the battlefield was Gaza, 'but it was not a battle for Gaza alone, but a battle to liberate Palestine and Al-Quds (Jerusalem). The war was a prelude for the great operation of liberation.' 'When the battle is this big, it is natural for the resistance leaders to lead the ranks of martyrs and sacrifices. These leaders have carried the banner of resistance for decades, and their peoples and masses have trusted them.' Hamdan said that Netanyahu thought he could end the resistance in Gaza. 'Netanyahu failed, while the resistance remained steadfast in the battlefield, and secured achievements.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2317471	2025-01-20T01:10:39-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-05332710017373640346.jpg

In a recorded message on Sunday, Abu Obeida, the spokesperson for the Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, addressed the public following the implementation of the ceasefire in Gaza. During his speech, Abu Obeida discussed the ceasefire agreement and the course of the battle that Palestinian resistance forces fought against the Israeli occupation over the past 15 months. He highlighted the transformative impact of 'Operation Al-Aqsa Flood' in the region, emphasizing the new dynamics it has established in the ongoing struggle against the occupier.

He extended his gratitude to Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance in Lebanon, Ansarullah in Yemen, and the Islamic Resistance in Iraq for their unwavering support of the Gaza resistance, describing them as 'companions in arms' who paid a heavy price during the battle.

'While we struck the enemy's forces, they resorted to new and horrific methods of brutality against our people,' he added. He highlighted the leadership of the resistance, pointing to the sacrifices of figures such as Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, and Saleh Al-Arouri, who led the battle alongside the countless martyrs. Popular Support Abu Obeida also touched on the widespread popular support for the Gaza resistance, noting that they receive millions of messages of solidarity from across the Arab and Islamic nations.

Senior IRGC Commanders: Gaza Ceasefire Agreement ‘Greatest Defeat...	Since the onset of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, the Islamic Republic of Iran has emerged as a steadfast pillar of support for the Palestinian cause, playing a crucial role in Gaza's victory that forced the Israeli enemy to cease its aggression. Massive public demonstrations across Iranian cities, along with unwavering military and diplomatic efforts, have showcased genuine solidarity with Palestinians.

Iran has even lost martyrs in the fight for Gaza, symbolizing its deep-rooted dedication to the resistance. On the international stage, key figures, including martyrs President Ibrahim Raisi and Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, alongside President Masoud Pezeshkian, led a robust diplomatic campaign, advocating for an end to the Israeli aggression and amplifying Gaza’s voice globally.

He described the Zionist entity as a 'bloodthirsty entity and a child killer,' stating that its acceptance of the ceasefire reflected its humiliation and loss. He emphasized that the agreement represented a forced acknowledgment of Palestinian strength. 'This agreement was imposed on 'Israel,' demonstrating the strength of Palestinian resolve,' Brigadier General Qaani concluded. Revolutionary Guards’ Deputy: Israeli Enemy’s Collapse and the Road to Jerusalem Meanwhile, General Mohammad Reza Naghdi, Deputy Coordinator of the IRGC, emphasized the Israeli enemy's failure on multiple fronts. He stated that the imposed ceasefire is evidence that 'Israel' can no longer resist, as it was forced to accept all the red lines set by Gaza’s steadfast resistance. 'The martyrs of the resistance have dealt fatal blows to the Israeli body, and only one step remains toward Jerusalem. We, the Basij forces, are ready to take that step, Brig. Naghdi asserted. He concluded by reiterating that, under the command of the Supreme Leader, Iran is prepared to return to the battlefield and 'cleanse the region from the disgrace of the Israeli enemy.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2317031	2025-01-19T08:17:04-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/05/manar-09782740016848369817.jpg

Israeli so-called 'National Security' Minister Itamar Ben Gvir officially resigned from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government on Sunday, along with his three party ministers, following his earlier threats to withdraw if the controversial prisoner exchange deal and ceasefire agreement with Hamas were approved. The ceasefire took effect Sunday morning. Ben Gvir's party, Otzma Yehudit, announced its withdrawal from the governing coalition in a strongly worded statement, condemning the agreement as a 'shameful capitulation' to Hamas.

It also decried the ceasefire, claiming it undermined the military gains achieved during the recent conflict, marked by the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces from Gaza.

Israeli Supreme Court Rejects Petitions Against Prisoner Exchange In a related development, the Israeli enemy’s Supreme Court dismissed petitions filed against the prisoner exchange agreement with Hamas, part of the ceasefire deal. The petitions, submitted by organizations Bechirot BeChayim and Almagor, as well as families of Zionists, sought to prevent the release of Palestinian prisoners. The court ruled it could not intervene, citing a lack of legal grounds, as reported by the Zionist public broadcaster KAN. The petitioners had argued that releasing security prisoners, many of whom were involved in past attacks, could harm the Israeli occupation security and enable their return to armed resistance. Under the terms of the agreement, the Israeli occupation will release 1,904 Palestinian prisoners, including 737 detainees held in Israeli prisons and 1,167 from Gaza detained during recent ground operations. In return, 33 of the 98 Zionist captives held by Gaza resistance factions will be freed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2316822	2025-01-19T03:37:05-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/06/manar-03423360016866602357-e1686660305798.jpg
Aoun to Guterres: Lebanon Insists on Israeli Withdrawal from Sout...	President of the Republic, General Joseph Aoun, informed UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres during their meeting this morning at Baabda Palace that 'Lebanon is committed to the need for Israeli forces’ withdrawal from its occupied territories in the south within the deadline set by the agreement reached on November 27.' President Aoun underlined that 'the continued Israeli land and air violations, particularly in bombarding houses and destroying border villages, completely contradict with the ceasefire agreement and is considered a continued breach of Lebanese sovereignty and the will of the international community to restore stability to southern Lebanon.' Aoun considered Guterres' visit to Lebanon a week after his election as President of the Republic 'a message of hope to the Lebanese,' thanking the United Nations organizations for the support provided to Lebanon in all fields, hailing the role of the international peacekeeping forces operating in the south and the steadfastness of its members in the face of the Israeli attacks that targeted its centers, saluting the souls of the 'UNIFIL' martyrs and stressing full coordination with the Lebanese army. Additionally, President Aoun raised the issue of Israel's burning of agricultural lands in the south, aspiring for the help of the United Nations especially the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), for farmers to restore the investment status of their lands once again. Aoun also touched on the readiness of the Lebanese army to replace the Israelis immediately after their withdrawal, and requested the assistance of the United Nations to secure the return of displaced Syrians to their country, now that the political and security reasons that led to their displacement are no longer in place. Israeli Violations The Israeli occupation forces continued on Saturday violating the ceasefire in South Lebanon, delaying their withdrawal from the area and the deployment of the Lebanese military units in the border towns. In this regard, the Zionist occupation forces advanced into Bint Jbeil outskirts, Wadli Slouki, Houla, Mais Al-Jabal and Al-Khiam barrens, bulldozing lands, opening fire, detonating houses and looting collectibles. من عمليات التوغل العدوانية التي نفذتها قوات الاحتلال في حي 'الدبش' في أطراف مدينة بنت جبيل استغلالا لقرار وقف اطلاق النار . pic.twitter.com/Hl1bF6h8Aw — شعيب 🇱🇧 (@cheib1970) January 18, 2025	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2316448	2025-01-18T12:23:10-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-03311400017372317791.png

Countdown to Gaza Ceasefire: Hope Amidst Devastation	The countdown to the ceasefire, set to take effect on Sunday, is filled with a mix of anticipation and fear for Gaza's residents. As airstrikes by the occupation forces continue relentlessly, many fear becoming the conflict's final casualties. Al-Akhbar War Journalist Youssef Fares reports the details from Gaza. Talks of post-ceasefire plans dominate conversations. In northern Gaza, displaced residents, forced from their homes over 100 days ago, are preparing to return to areas ravaged by bombing. Mohammad Salha, displaced from Tal Al-Zaatar, expressed his priorities: 'The first thing I will do is search for my relatives, whom I haven’t been able to contact for 60 days. If they have been martyred, we will honor them and bury their bodies, and then we will check on the state of our homes, if nothing is left then we’ll have to look for shelter again.' Many displaced families face an uncertain future. Ahed Ali, who is staying with relatives in southern Gaza, shared his concerns: 'We are happy, by God, that the war is over, but our concerns are great. My family and I are staying in the home of our displaced relatives in the south. When the ceasefire takes effect, we will have to search for a new shelter. Our house in Jabalia is destroyed, and we must leave the house to its owners, may God bless them for having us.' Others, like Samah Hijazi, are focused on finding loved ones. 'The first thing I will do immediately after the ceasefire begins is to search for the body of my brother Mohammad, then honor him by burying him to calm his grieving mother’s heart,' she said. Sources told Al-Akhbar that hundreds of bodies still lie in the streets of northern Gaza. Palestinian Civil Defense and medical teams are coordinating efforts to recover them and clear unexploded ordnance left behind by the Israeli occupation before residents return to their neighborhoods. Meanwhile, the violence continues. Journalist Amer Sultan's family home in Jabalia Al-Balad was bombed by 'Israel' on Friday, killing his family, including his wife, children, and parents. Rescue efforts were delayed until the next afternoon. Palestinian journalist Amer al-Sultan lost 9 members of his family: his mother, his brothers, and his sisters in an Israeli strike that targeted their family home in the northern #Gaza Strip.

In a statement released on Saturday, the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas declared that the recent war with ‘Israel’, referred to as 'Operation Al-Aqsa Flood,' has exemplified the unity and triumphant resistance of the Palestinian people. Hamas stated that this battle has 'brought us closer to the demise of the occupation, liberation, and return, God willing.' The group asserted that ‘Israel’ 'failed to achieve its aggressive goals and succeeded only in committing war crimes that disgrace humanity.' According to the statement, Hamas 'forced the occupation to halt its aggression against our people and withdraw, despite Netanyahu's attempts to prolong the war and commit more massacres.' The group vowed that the blood of the martyrs who died during the conflict 'will not be in vain,' and that 'the enemy's leaders and soldiers will be pursued and held accountable for these crimes, no matter how long it takes.' 'The occupation failed to achieve its aggressive goals, and only succeeded in committing war crimes that would make humanity blush.' Looking ahead, Hamas emphasized that the immediate priority is the lifting of the Israeli siege on Gaza, providing relief to the Palestinian people, facilitating the return of the displaced, and initiating the reconstruction of the devastated enclave. The group indicated that this has been a focus of their leadership since the start of the conflict. Regarding the humanitarian aid protocol agreed upon under the supervision of mediators, Hamas noted that it ensures the implementation of relief, shelter, and reconstruction measures for the people of Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2316217	2025-01-18T05:13:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/05/manar-081753800171534147910.jpg

He urged the families of Israeli captives to demand that the Israeli occupation military refrain from heavy airstrikes in the remaining hours before a ceasefire takes effect. Abu Hamza cautioned that such airstrikes could 'result in the killing of your sons while the resistance makes final field arrangements for their release.' He emphasized that the families of the enemy's captives must demand the Zionist army halt the intense bombardment of the final hours, as it could lead to the death of the hostages while the resistance completes arrangements for their release.

Sheikh Qassem Hails Gaza Legendry Steadfastness, Calls on ‘Israel...	Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem congratulated Gaza, its people and resistance over the ceasefire deal with the Zionist entity, hailing them over their epic steadfastness in face of the Israeli genocide. In a televised speech addressing an international conference in support of Gaza entitled: 'Gaza Icon of Resistance,' Sheikh Qassem stressed that the resistance in Lebanon is persistent stressing that any scheme to exclude Hezbollah from the political scene in Lebanon is doomed to fail. He stressed that the Israeli violations to the ceasefire in Lebanon 'can’t go on,' calling on the Israeli enemy 'not to test our patience.' Al-Aqsa Flood and Gaza Ceasefire Sheikh Qaasem stressed that Op. Al-Aqsa Flood restored momentum to the Palestinian cause. In this context, he pointed to major shift in the international stance towards Palestine, citing the mass protests across the world, especially the West in support of Gaza. 'The war on Gaza is a US-Israeli genocidal scheme aimed at wiping out Palestine of the map,' the Hezbollah S.G. said. Palestinian resistance fighters near a rocket launcher in Gaza (photo from archive). However, the Palestinian resistance has foiled this dangerous plan, his eminence stressed, in remarks carried by Al-Manar. 'The great sacrifices along with the legendary steadfastness prove that the great people of Palestine are worthful of regaining their land and they are capable of doing so. Steadfastness now is the foundation of the future.' He stressed that the people in Gaza came out glorious and the resistance hasn’t laid down its arms, hailing Hamas, the Islamic Jihad and other Palestinian resistance groups over their epic steadfastness. 'Congratulations to the Palestinian people, to the people of Gaza and to the resistance fighters, for this agreement that has not changed from what was proposed in May 2024. This indicates the steadfastness of the resistance, and that it achieved its demands while the Israeli enemy was not able to impose its terms.' Isolation of ‘Israel’ and Support Fronts Meanwhile, Sheikh Qassem pointed to the isolation which the Zionist entity have been witnessing in the latest months. 'Israel is now an international pariah; its image is bleak. The condemnation of the International Criminal Court is enough to know the extent of this great impact that the resistance of the Palestinian people has had and how it has exposed this Israeli entity. The Israelis won’t embrace stability in occupied Palestine. Wait for the coming days and months to see the repercussions. As for the internal disputes within the Zionist entity, they will increase, God willing, and there is no solution except for Palestine to return to its people.' The Hezbollah S.G. then hailed all those who stood by Gaza and Palestine, specifically naming the Islamic Republic of Iran, led by the Supreme Leader Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei. 'History will record, as the field did, those who supported Gaza with sacrifices and contributed to foiling the Israeli enemy’s project. The most prominent contributors are the Islamic Republic of Iran, led by Imam Khamenei who has not missed an opportunity to emphasize standing with the Palestinian people to liberate it from the sea to the river, and has provided all kinds of military, moral, material and political support.' Sheikh Qassem also praised the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran IRGC and its external branch Al-Quds along with the arm’s former head Hajj Qassem Suleimani who was 'truly the martyr of Al-Quds.' Iran has been punished for decades because it directed its compass towards liberating,' his eminence said, saluting the Iranian nation for supporting Palestine. 'Lebanon Offered Master of the Nation’s Martyrs' As for Lebanon, Sheikh Qassem stressed that the country has offered 'its all' via Hezbollah, Amal Movement and the Lebanese people during the last Israeli war. 'Lebanon and Hezbollah offered the master of the nation’s martyrs Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah along with the Hashemite cleric Sayyed Hashem Safeiddine and many other leaders, commanders, fighters, martyrs and injured people.' 'The confrontations against Hezbollah in Lebanon contributed to the victory of Gaza. The resistance fighters stood as an impregnable barrier against the Israeli advance on the front in legendary battles, and their honorable families protected, supported and backed them. Hezbollah and the resistance fighters have thwarted the Israeli goal of ending the resistance in Lebanon, which emerged proud and with its head held high.' 'Hezbollah Won’t Be Excluded from the Political Scene' On the other hand, Sheikh Qassem stressed that Hezbollah won’t be excluded from the political scene in Lebanon. 'The resistance in Lebanon will remain resistant to the American-Israeli project. It is persistent, strong and ready to preserve the blood of the martyrs in a bid to liberate the land and to liberate Palestine.'

'Right after the terrorist act, an attempt was made to arrest the gunman, who then quickly committed suicide,' the judiciary's statement read. The statement said an investigation had been launched to identify and arrest those behind the assassinations. Over the past year, the Iranian judiciary has taken measures to prosecute agents and elements affiliated with Israel, the U.S. and terrorist groups. Razini, 71, held several important positions in Iran's judiciary and was previously targeted in a 1998 assassination attempt.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2316052	2025-01-18T03:27:18-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-08165400017371996322.jpg

The Lebanese President Joseph Aoun hosted, on Friday at Baabda Palace, his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron who had arrived earlier in Beirut. 'I hope you will bear witness to the entire world that the Lebanese people's trust in their country and state has been restored, and that the world's confidence in Lebanon must fully return because the true and genuine Lebanon has revived,' Aoun told Macron. President Aoun also underlined the importance of maintaining the ceasefire deal and the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon, underscoring the liberation of the prisoners and the reconstruction project. President Aoun hoped that Macron 'instruct Total to return to continue oil exploration operations in the offshore oil blocks.' For his part, Macron affirmed France’s steadfast support for Lebanon, commending Aoun's efforts in ending the political vacuum and steering Lebanon toward recovery. 'France has stood by the Lebanese people over the past years,' Macron said, highlighting his country’s commitment to Lebanon’s stability and sovereignty. Moreover, Macron underscored the importance of Lebanon remaining immune to foreign interference, describing it as a vital condition for the continued implementation of the ceasefire. Macron further reiterated France’s support for the Lebanese Army, particularly in their deployment in southern Lebanon. 'We will continue to support the army to ensure it can extend its presence and maintain security in the south,' Macron stated. Additionally, the French President expressed France’s readiness to collaborate with Lebanon in demarcating its borders along the Blue Line. Later on, House Speaker Nabih Berri and the caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati arrived at Baabda Palace, where a bilateral meeting was held between and Berri. President Aoun also met with Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam at the Baabda Presidential Palace to tackle the cabinet formation. The two statesmen agreed on a speedy process and a preliminary lineup. Salam also stated that he informed Macron that any delay of the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon threatens the regional stability.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2315667	2025-01-17T10:02:16-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-033762800173713692410.jpg

After the meeting, Salam stated, 'Speaker Berri and I are on the same page, following the constitution. I will remain in contact with him until the government is formed,' adding that parliamentary consultations did not conclude yesterday. 'I am continuing them today. There is a consensus among parliamentary blocs on the urgent need to revive the country and work toward its recovery, and I pledge to achieve this,' Salam noted, affirming there is no alternative to dialogue and understanding. 'No one will obstruct or be allowed to obstruct the government formation process,' asserted Salam, revealing an initial plan to present to the President. 'There are no hurdles hindering the government formation,' Salam concluded, pledging to ensure its success. In turn, Speaker Berri commented briefly, describing the meeting with the PM-designate as 'promising'. Salam was designated on Monday by President Joseph Aoun on the basis of binding parliamentary consultations. However, lack of coordination among the parliamentary blocs pushed the 'Loyalty to Resistance' and 'Development and Liberation' to boycott the non-binding parliamentary consultations held by the PM-designate. The latest political contacts eased the tensions and led to Berri-Salam meeting which would enhance the new government formation on the basis of national consensus.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2315535	2025-01-17T07:07:56-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-00419080017371264665.png

On the same day, the US-Israeli-UK coalition conducted airstrikes on Yemen’s capital, Sana’a, coinciding with a nationwide march supporting Gaza’s resistance. The coalition also bombed the Hizyaz power station in Sanhan District with eight airstrikes, severely damaging vital infrastructure. These attacks are a direct response to Yemen’s unwavering solidarity with Gaza in its fight against Israeli genocide. Since November 2023, the Yemeni Armed Forces have successfully targeted Israeli-linked vessels in the Red Sea using missiles and drones, as well as striking vital Israeli targets in occupied territory. In response, Washington and London began airstrikes on Yemen in early 2024. Backed by the US, the Israeli enemy’s genocidal campaign in Gaza since October 7, 2023, has killed or injured over 157,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, with 11,000 missing. The atrocities have caused mass destruction, famine, and one of the worst humanitarian crises in modern history.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2315183	2025-01-17T00:55:18-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-09107490017371039398.jpg
Yemen’s Ansarullah Leader Warns: Gaza Ceasefire Hinges on Israeli...	The leader of Yemen’s Ansarullah movement, Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi, outlined Yemen’s stance on the Gaza ceasefire agreement, asserting that military operations will continue if Zionist violations persist. Speaking on Thursday evening, Sayyed Al-Houthi stressed that Yemen’s position aligns with that of Palestinian resistance factions and will remain steadfast throughout the implementation of the ceasefire. Al-Houthi stated that Yemen’s support for Gaza is unwavering, warning that any Israeli regression or massacres will prompt renewed military action in solidarity with the Palestinian people. He further emphasized Yemen’s commitment to enhancing military capabilities for more effective support of the Palestinian cause, reiterating that 'the path to supporting Palestine remains ongoing.' Yemen’s Military Strikes Shake Israeli Enemy Defense Discussing Yemen’s role in Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, Al-Houthi highlighted the remarkable impact of Yemen’s resistance, which surprised the world with powerful strikes against the Israeli enemy and its US and British allies. Despite the challenging conditions facing the Yemeni people, Ansarullah forces carried out 1,255 operations, including ballistic missile launches, drone attacks, and naval operations. Aftermath of a Yemeni drone strike targeting Yavne in occupied Palestine, Monday, December 11, 2024. Al-Houthi praised the success of Yemeni Armed Forces in undermining the effectiveness of US naval fleets, rendering them incapable of safeguarding Israeli shipping routes. He noted that the Israeli occupation now faces significant challenges in intercepting Yemeni attacks, which have exposed vulnerabilities in its defense systems. Escalating Impact on Zionist Economy The Ansarullah leader emphasized the escalating military operations' profound impact on the Israeli enemy, particularly in aviation and economic sectors. Yemeni strikes on Israeli vessels have led to disrupted trade routes, forcing airlines to reconsider using Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport. He pointed to the Israeli enemy’s failure to achieve its objectives, with Yemeni operations severely affecting the morale of Israeli forces and its economy. These setbacks have compelled the Israeli enemy to explore political solutions after exhausting military options. Criticism of Arab Inaction, International Complicity Al-Houthi condemned the lack of Arab action in supporting the Palestinian cause, noting that this inaction has emboldened the Israeli enemy's crimes against Palestinians. He also criticized the complicity of some Arab regimes and highlighted the United Nations' failure to hold the Israeli occupation entity accountable despite claims of neutrality. Hezbollah’s Role and Regional Resistance Sayyed Al-Houthi commended Hezbollah for its significant contributions to supporting the Palestinian resistance, acknowledging its sacrifices and pivotal role in confronting the Zionist enemy. He also praised the Iraqi resistance's involvement, noting its support for the Palestinian cause through various means. Call for Mass Mobilization The Ansarullah leader called on the Yemeni people to participate in a massive demonstration planned for Friday, emphasizing its importance as a culmination of continuous public mobilization over the past 15 months. He stressed that such displays of solidarity underscore Yemen’s unwavering support for Palestine and readiness to confront any Israeli escalation. Al-Houthi concluded by highlighting Yemen’s sacrifices, with 106 martyrs and 328 injured, as a testament to the nation’s steadfast commitment to defending Palestinian rights. Yemen’s support, he said, transcends rhetoric and includes military, political, and popular dimensions, rooted in the country’s deep faith and principles.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2315029	2025-01-16T12:42:32-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-01108620017291797507.png
Starbucks Shuts Down Second Beirut Branch Amid Boycott Pressure, ...	Starbucks Corporation, the renowned American multinational coffeehouse chain, has closed its branch in Beirut's Raouche area, following the earlier shutdown of its location at ABC Verdun Mall. These closures, which leave both key areas without a Starbucks presence, highlight a noticeable decline in the company’s footprint in the Lebanese market. A security officer at the Raouche branch confirmed that the space will soon be occupied by a new coffee brand. Starbucks ABC Verdun Mall branch (April 2024) Global Decline and Financial Struggles The closures come amidst a global downturn in Starbucks' sales, despite efforts to implement administrative changes aimed at improving performance. Similarly, Americana Restaurants, a major food service operator, announced a 48.2% drop in profits over the past year, reflecting broader financial difficulties faced by companies that have been the target of popular boycott campaigns.

Speaking to Al-Manar, she stated, 'Our opposition to colonialism is a principled stance and an ongoing battle that will only end with the eradication of this colonial entity.' Mrs. Karaki referenced recent Israeli economic reports warning of a 'spiral collapse,' citing the exit of over 40,000 companies from the market and the suspension of numerous projects. She argued that continued global corporate support for the Zionist economy amounts to 'artificial life support for a dying system.' 'Boycotts are not merely an economic tool; they embody widespread popular rejection of any form of normalization or support for the occupation,' she added. Tangible Results of Boycott Campaigns Mrs. Karaki highlighted the tangible impact of global economic boycotts in reducing support for the occupation. For example, she noted that Puma ended its sponsorship of the Israeli Football Association after sustained boycott efforts. She also reassured that local economies can remain resilient, as domestic investors are capable of finding alternatives that strengthen local markets without supporting entities complicit in violence and oppression. Call to Intensify Boycott Efforts Mrs. Karaki concluded by urging greater efforts to support boycott campaigns. She emphasized that 'boycotts are a vital form of resistance, no less important than any other form of struggle.' She called for heightened public awareness and stronger community support to challenge systems and corporations that directly or indirectly enable the occupation.

Israeli Ceasefire Violations Escalate Along Lebanon Border: Milit...	In an alarming escalation of violations, Israeli occupation forces have conducted a series of military incursions along the Lebanon border. These include tank deployments, explosions in border villages such as Aita Al-Shaab, Maroun Al-Ras, and Al-Taybeh, as well as extensive drone activity and deforestation. The developments come amid a prolonged delay in the Lebanese army’s deployment to border areas due to the Israeli enemy's refusal to withdraw. Explosions and Military Incursions On Thursday afternoon, Aita Al-Shaab witnessed its fourth explosion of the day, carried out by Israeli enemy forces. Between morning and 1:15 PM, a heavily armed convoy of three tanks, an armored vehicle, and a personnel carrier advanced toward the northern outskirts of Maroun al-Ras, extending to the northeast near Bint Jbeil. The Zionist military reportedly targeted homes, destroying gates and firing at private properties. Additionally, Israeli occupation forces pushed into Al-Taybeh, firing weapons along the town’s edges toward Deir Seryan. Explosions rocked Al-Taybeh as Zionist soldiers set fire to several homes. Similar violations were reported in Hula, where heavy gunfire echoed across the area, and near Mays Al-Jabal, where Israeli troops conducted extensive searches. Since early morning, armed drones have been flying extensively across the border area at various altitudes, reminiscent of wartime operations. Al-Manar correspondent captured footage of Israeli tank, personnel carrier, and infantry movements in Houla, accompanied by heavy machine gun fire throughout the day. In Beirut's southern suburbs (Dahiyeh), Israeli enemy drones were flying at low altitude throughout the entire day. Lebanese Army Deployment Delayed Despite scheduled plans to enter border villages like Yaroun, Ayta Al-Shaab, Maroun Al-Ras, Blida, Mays Al-Jabal, and Adaisseh, the Lebanese army has yet to deploy. For over ten days, Israeli enemy forces’ refusal to withdraw has prevented the army from assuming control, leaving the area vulnerable to ongoing violations. Deforestation and Time Exploitation Israeli occupation forces continue to exploit the stalled situation by carrying out explosions and large-scale deforestation in border regions. In recent days, ancient trees in the Yaroun forest near the occupied Palestinian border have been uprooted. Today, Israeli bulldozers persisted in leveling the forest, causing irreversible environmental damage.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2314820	2025-01-16T11:07:43-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-07897610017370541879.jpg
From Netanyahu’s 'Absolute Victory' to Hamas Ceasefire Terms: Bit...	When the mighty fighters of Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas military wing, launched their attack on the Gaza envelop settlements on October 7, 2023, the Zionist entity was dealt the most powerful blow since its emergence. Experts, analysts, scholars, historians, academics, and journalists do know that the strike changed the course of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and even the Arab-Zionist one. The Zionist entity had either to 'digest' the new reality in which the settlements may be invaded by the 'enemies' or take a certain action that alters the dark facts of 'Al-Aqsa Flood'. Since the Zionist government is formed of a group of extremists, the second choice certainly turns to be the Israeli long-term strategy. PM Benjamin Netanyahu immediately occupied the scene and heralded his war aimed at achieving the 'absolute victory'of crushing Hamas, liberating the prisoners by force, displacing the Gazans into various countries, and establishing Zionist settlements in the Strip. The Zionist army was commanded to commit the worst war crime throughout the human history. The order was that achieving the 'absolute victory' justifies all forms of criminality and barbarism, despite the public opinion condemnation and the legal agencies convictions. Around 450 days, hundreds of thousands of war criminals armed by the most sophisticated and lethal weaponry in the world, failed to achieve any of the strategic Israeli targets. The Israeli prisoners have remained held by the Palestinian resistance; Hamas and all the factions are still operating powerfully in the Strip; the displaced Gazans will return to their houses; the Zionists have failed to establish any settlement in Gaza. Nevertheless, the Zionist nose has been rubbed in the dirt of Gaza whose negotiators imposed their terms on the Israeli side. An honorable prisoner swap will accompany the ceasefire and Israeli withdrawal from the Strip. In details, the agreement will be implemented in three stages. The first phase will last for 42 days and include a temporary stop of hostilities, IOF withdrawal from the residential areas, reopening of Rafah crossing to let 600 aid trucks into the Strip, and release of 2000 Palestinian prisoners in return for 33 Zionist captives. In the second and third phases, the reconstruction of Gaza and the announcement of the permanent truce will take place. In brief, none of the Zionist conditions were observed in the deal, which reflects the outcomes of the battle. The Zionists managed only to kill, injure, capture, and destroy, but in vain. The Zionist media has reflected the case of frustration in the entity because of the strategic Israeli failure in the war. Israeli Channel 12 considered that the return of the Zionist settlers to northern Gaza highlights the Israeli failure and Palestinian victory. The Channel even went on to say that the Palestinian prisoners, to be freed, are expected to be the new leaders of the Palestinians, describing them as educated and powerful. -	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2314710	2025-01-16T09:19:15-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2017/02/manar-02792890014872330091.jpg

Over the past 10 years, despite the fact that pirates were making international waterways unsafe, these naval fleets have been the ones that have helped 'our commercial and oil vessels safely pass through dangerous areas' more than hundreds of times, he added.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2314556	2025-01-16T06:40:10-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/05/manar-00891400016855293234.jpg
President Aoun: Ongoing Israeli Violations in South Lebanon Under...	President of the Republic, Joseph Aoun, on Thursday welcomed a fresh ceasefire agreement in Gaza, hoping that the deal will 'end the tragic reality' the battered Strip, and appreciating the international efforts in that respect. President Aoun reiterated the right of the Palestinians to establish their sovereign state under the international legitimacy resolutions. Regarding the situation in South Lebanon, President Aoun said, 'Israel’s serious commitment to the clauses of the agreement requires a follow-up by the sponsoring states and the United Nations, because the Israeli enemy has always evaded its commitments and ignored the international resolutions.' Al-Manar reporter Ali Shoeib affirmed that the Israeli occupation forces carried out two operations of blowing up houses in Aita Al-Shaab town, adding that Zionist tanks advanced from Maron Al-Ras town into the outskirts of Bint Jbeil City and raided houses there. The Zionist occupation troops also stormed houses in Taybeh town for the sake of vandalizing detonating them. The reporter noted that such violations have been behind the delay of the deployment of the Lebanese military units in the border villages, including Aitaroun and Mais Al-Jabal. The Israeli drones also flew at a low altitude over Beirut's Dahiyeh.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2314490	2025-01-16T02:55:33-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-018448300173643361510.jpeg

Following his meeting on Tuesday with President of the Republic, Joseph Aoun, and House Speaker, Nabih Berri, at Baabda Presidential Palace, Prime Minister-Designate, Judge Nawaf Salam, expressed gratitude to Lebanese citizens for their trust, pledging to tackle the challenging mission of serving Lebanon. 'It is time to embark on a new chapter rooted in justice, security, progress, and equal opportunities, making Lebanon a nation of free individuals with equal rights and responsibilities,' Salam stated. The PM-Designate highlighted the dire need for reconstruction efforts, emphasizing the plight of citizens in the Bekaa, the south, and Beirut whose homes and institutions remain devastated. 'Rebuilding is not just a promise but a commitment,' Salam affirmed. The PM then called for extending the authority of the Lebanese state across all its territories and urged the government to implement a comprehensive plan to build a productive economy and create job opportunities for future generations. Advocating for the adoption of expanded administrative decentralization, Salam stressed the importance of reforming Lebanon’s patronage-based administration and achieving justice for the victims of the Beirut Port explosion, as well as fairness for depositors who lost their savings. 'I am not for exclusion but for unity, not for marginalization but for national partnership,' Salam declared, extending his hands to all parties to initiate reforms and ensure that no citizen feels sidelined.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2313478	2025-01-14T09:19:33-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-06402000017368751614.png
Israeli Procrastination Delays Lebanese Army Deployment in South ...	The Lebanese Army delayed the deployment of the military units in the border villages of Aitaroun, Mais Al-Jabal and Houla because of the ongoing Israeli procrastination represented by more ceasefire violations. In this regard, the Israeli enemy executed more explosions in Aitaroun, Mais Al-Jabal, and Aita Al-Shaab towns, destroying and incinerating more houses. According to Al-Manar reporter, the occupation forces stormed the villages and fired gunshots, shells, and grenades at the houses, delaying the deployment of the Lebanese Army. The same Zionist scheme occurred in Hamames Hill area where the Lebanese Army intended to deploy troops, but the Zionist violations prevented the move. It is worth noting that the Israeli drones flew on Tuesday at a low altitude over Beirut's Dahiyeh.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2313445	2025-01-14T09:16:10-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-04113150017368749649.jpeg
Critical Hours Ahead for Gaza Ceasefire Negotiations: What to exp...	As the Israeli enemy's war on Gaza enters its 466th day, the besieged enclave stands as a symbol of resilience against an unprecedented campaign of destruction and genocide, carried out with global complicity and silence. Despite relentless attacks, Gaza has refused to surrender. The Palestinian resistance has engaged the Israeli occupation forces at close range, inflicting heavy losses and proving that its resolve cannot be broken. Over 46,000 Palestinians—children, women, men, and fighters—have been martyred, yet the resistance continues to strike back. Every time Israeli occupation forces believe they've secured a foothold, new resistance emerges, keeping them locked in a costly cycle of attrition. Northern Gaza: A Testament to Failure In northern Gaza, the Israeli enemy’s aim of 'zero confrontation' through systematic genocide and forced displacement has also faltered. Last week in Beit Hanoun, the Israeli occupation forces faced significant setbacks, acknowledging their failure even as they tried to regroup their forces. The Question of Prisoners One of the Israeli enemy’s primary objectives has been the retrieval of its captives. However, its strategy of annihilation has failed to achieve this. Any resolution remains contingent on agreements dictated by the Palestinian resistance, which, despite enduring immense hardship, has maintained its strength and thwarted Israel’s attempts to establish full control, even over small areas of the enclave. Ceasefire Talks Spark Internal Tensions As reports emerge of a potential ceasefire agreement in the coming hours or days, tensions within the Zionist government are boiling over. Far-right ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich are threatening to resign if the agreement moves forward. Ben Gvir criticized the deal as a 'surrender,' urging Smotrich to join him in pressuring Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Meanwhile, Israeli Channel 12 reported that Smotrich is consulting with senior rabbis over the prisoner exchange deal. The right-wing minister, who previously called the agreement a 'disaster for Israel’s national security,' hinted at issuing an ultimatum to Netanyahu in the coming hours. He condemned the proposed terms, which reportedly involve releasing high-profile Palestinian prisoners, ending the war, and nullifying Israel's so-called achievements. Admission of Defeat Through the voices of its leaders, the Zionist entity has effectively acknowledged its failure. The narrative of invincibility is crumbling as the war shifts from conquest to survival for an occupation increasingly entangled in its miscalculations. Positive Progress in Doha Negotiations Spokesman for the Qatari Foreign Ministry, Majed bin Mohammad Al-Ansari, announced today that discussions in Doha have entered the final stages. He described the talks as 'productive and positive,' focusing on the last remaining details, and hinted that an official announcement of the agreement is imminent. 'We have overcome the primary obstacles in the disagreements between the parties,' Al-Ansari stated, adding, 'When the agreement is announced, it will also mark the start of the ceasefire implementation.' He further noted that draft agreements have been submitted, and negotiations are now centered on resolving the final details regarding the Gaza ceasefire. Urging both sides to finalize the deal, Al-Ansari emphasized the need to end the humanitarian tragedy in Gaza. Latest Developments in Negotiation Talks Amid these updates, US President-elect Donald Trump, in an interview with Newsmax, expressed optimism, saying he believes a deal on hostages and a Gaza ceasefire could be finalized by the weekend. Observers have noted that the negotiations are now entering critical hours. ISRAEL, HAMAS NEAR HOSTAGE DEAL?: 'We are very close to getting it done,' President-elect Donald Trump tells 'Rob Schmitt Tonight.' 'There's been a handshake.' pic.twitter.com/lRO9Ul1zHh — NEWSMAX (@NEWSMAX) January 14, 2025 Additionally, the deputy foreign minister of the Israeli occupation entity confirmed that Trump has pushed for the agreement to be concluded before his inauguration on January 20. 'I cannot disclose details of the deal, as we want to avoid statements that could affect the morale of the hostages’ families,' she said. A Closer Look at the Proposed Gaza Ceasefire Agreement According to leaks from Israeli enemy sources, the initial phase of the agreement will see the release of 33 Zionist prisoners, including women, children, and the wounded. In exchange, Palestinian prisoners will be freed according to a specific mechanism, and a ceasefire in Gaza will be enacted. Second Phase to Begin After 16 Days An official from the Israeli occupation revealed that, 16 days after the agreement is implemented, negotiations will begin for the second phase. This will include the release of remaining live hostages—male soldiers and men of military age—along with the return of the bodies of those who died during captivity. Gradual Israeli Withdrawal and Security Arrangements The agreement outlines a gradual Israeli withdrawal, though forces will remain near the border. It also includes security arrangements for the 'Philadelphi Corridor' (Salah Al-Din) on the southern edge of Gaza, with Israeli enemy withdrawal from parts of the area within days of the agreement's enactment. Return of Civilians and Restrictions Civilians from northern Gaza will be allowed to return, with mechanisms in place to prevent weapon transfers. The Israeli enemy will also withdraw from the 'Netzarim' area in central Gaza, which had previously been rejected in negotiations. Prisoner Release Details The deal includes the release of Palestinians convicted of killings or attacks resulting in death, although the number will depend on the number of remaining live hostages—still unknown. However, prisoners involved in the Operation Al-Aqsa Flood on October 7, 2023, will not be included in the release list. This marks a significant victory for the resistance, as the Israeli occupation had previously refused to release those it categorized as 'convicted murderers' or sentenced to life imprisonment. Progress Towards Final Agreement These developments coincide with reports from inside Gaza that Zionist forces have begun dismantling some of their positions in the Netzarim area. Sources from the 'Jerusalem Post' suggest that, barring last-minute changes, an announcement on the deal could come today. Recent Diplomatic Efforts Earlier on Monday, Axios reported that Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had agreed to concessions regarding withdrawals from the Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors and new terms for releasing Palestinian prisoners. This comes as Netanyahu consults with security leaders. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden spoke with Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, reaffirming that a deal is imminent. Qatar's emir also met with a Hamas delegation, who expressed their positive stance on the ongoing negotiations in Doha. Palestinian Resistance: No Compromise on Red Lines A Hamas official told CNN on Monday that several points of contention remain in the ongoing negotiations. Key issues include Hamas’s demand for the Israeli occupation’s withdrawal from the Philadelphi Corridor and a call for a permanent ceasefire instead of a temporary halt to military operations. Qatar Presents Final Draft An informed source involved in the prisoner swap negotiations in Doha stated that Qatar has delivered a 'final draft' of the ceasefire and prisoner release agreement aimed at ending the war. According to Reuters, a breakthrough occurred in Doha after midnight, following talks between Israeli intelligence chiefs, US President-elect Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witztkopf, and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. The coming hours will be crucial in determining the outcome of the discussions. Resistance forces emphasize that the final agreement must reflect the sacrifices and resilience of Gaza's people.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2313390	2025-01-14T06:52:43-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-01552600017307483156.jpg
Iran Unveils Cutting-Edge Zagros Destroyer, Showcasing Naval Prow...	The Iranian Navy is set to receive a new state-of-the-art indigenous destroyer, the Zagros. The announcement was made by Iranian Navy Commander Rear Admiral Shahram Irani, who hailed the vessel as a 'unique' and 'distinctive' addition to the country's naval forces. 'This week, a unique military vessel called Zagros, [which is developed] with Iranian knowledge and capabilities and [enjoys] distinctive features, will be launched into the water to start operating in the region,' Irani said on Monday. He described the Zagros as the 'newest and the most state-of-the-art destroyer' in the Iranian Navy, designed for both combat and intelligence missions.

He praised the high quality of Iran's vessel manufacturing industry, noting that the '86th fleet of Iran's Navy' has showcased the country's maritime capabilities to the world. Highlighting Iran's self-sufficiency in surface and sub-surface vessel production, Irani said the country's naval forces have increased their presence in international waters to protect naval routes and provide security for merchant vessels and tankers. He also mentioned the Iranian Navy's participation in joint military drills with countries like Russia, China, and Pakistan in recent years, aimed at enhancing combat readiness. Irani's remarks reflect Iran's determination to bolster its naval prowess and demonstrate its technological advancements to the international community. The introduction of the Zagros destroyer is seen as a significant step in Iran's efforts to enhance its maritime capabilities and assert its presence in the region and beyond. The Iranian naval forces have also staged several military drills with different countries, including Russia, China and Pakistan, over the past years to promote combat readiness. They have also been involved in joint efforts aimed at countering piracy and maritime terrorism, exchanging information in naval rescue and relief operations as well as sharing operational and tactical experience to enhance the security and stability of international maritime trade.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2313258	2025-01-14T03:33:53-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-02244100017368544197.jpg

Yemeni Armed Forces Earlier on Tuesday, Israeli media reported that a missile launched from Yemen disrupted air traffic at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv. In recent weeks, the Yemeni Armed Forces have intensified their pro-Palestinian operations, targeting Israeli military sites in the occupied territories with advanced hypersonic ballistic missiles. In response, the United States and United Kingdom have conducted indiscriminate airstrikes on Yemen to counter these operations and support the Israeli enemy military. Despite these sustained attacks, Yemeni forces have remained steadfast, continuing to target vessels linked to Israel in the Red Sea. Since the war began in October 2023, Israeli actions have killed at least 46,584 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured over 109,731 others in Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2313236	2025-01-14T03:31:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/12/manar-04186610017330712743.jpg

West Bank | Palestinian Authority Clashes in Jenin as IOF Conduct...	The Palestinian Authority's security forces continue their 40-day siege of Jenin Camp in the occupied West Bank, collaborating with the Israeli occupation against resistance fighters who are bravely defending against both. On Monday morning and at dawn, Israeli occupation forces launched a series of raids and incursions across the West Bank, resulting in arrests in various areas. Israeli enemy bulldozers also demolished a house, two commercial structures, and an agricultural room while also tearing down walls and stone fences in Hazma, northeast of occupied Jerusalem. A house and an agricultural facility were also destroyed in Qalqilya under the pretext of unlicensed construction. BREAKING: Palestinian Authority (PA) forces have besieged the house of a Palestinian resistance activist in the town of Tubas, north of the occupied West Bank, seeking his detention.

A child was injured by shrapnel in the foot, and intense gunfire broke out on Mahyoub Street. This followed the PA's failed attempt the previous night to infiltrate the camp through the Al-Damj neighborhood. Resistance fighters successfully targeted a military armored vehicle belonging to PA forces in the Al-Damj area, causing it to catch fire and forcing the occupants to flee. The PA's aggression also led to power outages in the Al-Damj area and widespread damage to surrounding streets and houses. In the past two days, PA security forces intensified their use of grenades and RPGs, which hit homes in the camp, injuring several residents. The Jenin Brigade confirmed that resistance in the camp remains unified, with no distinction between Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, all standing as one. Arrests and Ongoing Raids In the latest wave of raids and arrests, PA forces detained Abu Diyaa Salama, the father of a martyr, while he was being transferred by an ambulance to Jenin Government Hospital after being shot in the foot. The PA also arrested Majdi Al-Saydali from Jenin and brothers Aseed and Hamouda Al-Hamshari from Jenin camp while they were en route to Tulkarem. Additionally, Israeli occupation forces arrested five Palestinians during their raids on Nablus city and Ein camp. The forces entered the city’s Al-Ta'awon Street, raiding multiple homes, searching them, and tampering with their contents, resulting in the arrest of two individuals. In Ein Camp, west of Nablus, Israeli enemy forces blocked traffic from nearby streets, raided several homes, and arrested three Palestinians. During the raid on Ein camp, a Zionist soldier reportedly beat a young man, according to a Red Crescent medic. In Salfit province, Zionist forces detained dozens of Palestinians from the town of Deir Istiya. The Prisoners’ Club reported that around 70 Palestinians, including elderly individuals with chronic illnesses, were arrested after their homes were raided. The Israeli occupation forces have also blocked the main entrance to Deir Istiya with dirt mounds for several days, preventing entry and exit from the town. Military checkpoints have been tightened around the area, and frequent incursions continue. Clashes and Raids in Hebron In Hebron province, Israeli enemy forces carried out several incursions across various areas, simultaneously setting up military checkpoints and harassing Palestinians. They raided the city of Halhul early on Monday, storming dozens of homes, ransacking them, and conducting hours-long field interrogations with residents. Additionally, a military checkpoint was set up under the Beit Kahil bridge, where Israeli forces began inspecting Palestinian vehicles. Ground troops also raided 'Jabal Al-Rahma' in Hebron city, deploying sound bombs in the area. Israeli enemy forces also stormed the town of Dura, firing sound bombs and toxic gas canisters, though no injuries or arrests were reported. Demolition Operations and Arrests in Jerusalem Israeli occupation forces continued their demolition operations, targeting the foundation of a house belonging to the Abdul Salam Faza’ Al-Omari family, a carpentry workshop owned by the Mohammad Khaled Al-Khati family, and an agricultural room.

Additionally, the IOF demolished a house under construction, an agricultural facility, and leveled farmland in the eastern area of Qalqilya in the occupied West Bank today. Military reinforcements stormed the village of Al-Funduq, where they demolished a 150-square-meter house under construction belonging to the Hamouda Muhaysen family, citing lack of building permits. The Zionist forces also destroyed an agricultural facility that included a shed, a greenhouse, and a water tank, belonging to the Mohammed Amin Tayem family. The facility, located on approximately four dunams of land, incurred significant material losses. Recently, Israeli occupation forces established an iron gate at the entrance of the village, connecting the cities of Qalqilya and Nablus, causing severe disruptions to Palestinian movement.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2312697	2025-01-13T05:41:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-02688310017367756402.jpg

Military officials say the drones will enhance Iran's special operations, surveillance, border control, and long-range strike capabilities. Jointly developed by military scientists, the Ministry of Defense, and knowledge-based companies, these UAVs are produced in the Army's drone manufacturing facilities and will be deployed to necessary bases and regions. The Iranian Army's fleet was expanded in January of last year with a large number of homegrown unmanned aerial vehicles suitable for various military operations. The UAVs, designed by Defense Ministry experts, include multipurpose strategic Ababil-4 and Ababil-5 drones that can be used for reconnaissance, patrol missions, electronic warfare, data collection, and aerial combat. The Army has also received new Arash drones, which can carry out long-range suicide missions with pinpoint accuracy. The drone deployment comes just a day after the Iranian Army unveiled a new laser-based air defense system, dubbed 'Seraj (Light),' during military exercises near the Fordow uranium enrichment facility. Authorities described the system as one layer of the site's multilayered air defenses.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2312664	2025-01-13T04:46:13-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-06005010017367723565.jpg
Gaza’s Hospitals Turned into ‘Mass Graves’ Amid Hellish Israeli O...	Gaza's health ministry has described the situation in the northern Gaza Strip as 'literally like hell,' as ‘Israel's’ ongoing ground offensive and siege have turned hospitals into 'mass graves.' 'The situation is literally like hell,' said Munir al-Barsh, the director general of the Ministry of Health in Gaza, on Sunday. He said daily Israeli attacks and the regime's ban on food deliveries to medical staff trapped in the north's hospitals have created a dire humanitarian crisis. Several civilians were injured early this morning in an Israeli airstrike targeting a house in the Shujaiya neighborhood of Gaza City, according to local sources. pic.twitter.com/EATlg1zs1f — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) January 13, 2025 'Hospitals in northern Gaza have turned into mass graves,' al-Barsh added, noting that the offensive and the destruction of hospitals, infrastructure, and any sign of life in the north are aimed at emptying the region of its residents. According to al-Barsh, 5,000 people have been killed or gone missing, while 9,500 others have been injured since the start of Israel's offensive on the north of Gaza in early October 2024. The regime's forces have also abducted about 2,300 people, including 65 medical staff, during the ongoing Israeli agression. Another morning of grief and tears in Gaza as Israel's genocide campaign continues for the sixteenth month in a row. pic.twitter.com/TKgXZxn9bl — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) January 13, 2025 Al-Barsh slammed the 'disgraceful' silence of the international community on 'Israel's' atrocities, which he said have 'deepened the suffering of innocent civilians.' ‘Israel’ launched a brutal war on Gaza on October 7, 2023, after the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas waged the surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Flood against the occupying entity in response to the Israeli regime's decades-long campaign of bloodletting and devastation against Palestinians. The regime's bloody onslaught on Gaza has so far killed at least 46,565 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured more than 109,660 others. Thousands more are also missing and presumed dead under rubble, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Despite talks of a ceasefire agreement around the corner, Israel continues to perpetrate massacres against innocent civilians in Gaza. This was the scene a couple of minutes ago following an Israeli airstrike on the al-Daraj neighborhood of Gaza City. pic.twitter.com/2QrEgipc4u — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) January 13, 2025 However, a study by the UK's Lancet medical journal estimates the actual number of deaths in the war is much higher than the official toll, suggesting the ministry's figures likely undercounted the death toll by 41 percent in the first nine months of the conflict as Gaza's healthcare infrastructure unraveled.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2312631	2025-01-13T04:34:59-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/10/manar-09111270017298671932.jpg
Lebanese President Aoun Kicks Off Parliamentary Consultations to ...	Lebanon’s new president, Joseph Aoun, has initiated binding parliamentary consultations to nominate a prime minister-designate for the next government. The consultations began at 8:00 AM on Monday at Baabda Palace, where President Aoun is holding successive meetings with parliamentary blocs. The name of the prime minister-designate will be announced at the conclusion of these discussions. A significant number of MPs backed Judge Nawaf Salam. Among his supporters were Adib Abdul Massih, Osama Saad, Michel Daher, Charbel Massaad, Paula Yacoubian, Ibrahim Mneimneh, Cynthia Zarazir, Melhem Khalaf, Halima Kaakour, Najat Saliba, Elias Jaradeh, and Firas Hamdan. Mneimneh emphasized the strategic importance of Salam’s nomination to foster consensus and seize a rare opportunity. Zarazir and Khalaf underscored Salam’s independence and the need for fresh leadership outside the traditional political class. Najib Mikati also garnered notable support. MPs Jean Talouzian, Abdul Rahman Bizri, Jihad Al-Samad, Bilal Al-Hashimi, Ghassan Skaff, Haidar Nasser, and Abdul Karim Kabbara endorsed him, with many citing his role in ensuring stability and continuity. Skaff described Mikati as the ideal figure to lead the first government under the new presidential term. MP Elias Bou Saab refrained from naming any candidate, expressing concerns about escalating political divisions. Meanwhile, Jamil Al-Sayyed adopted a conditional stance, stating he would vote for Mikati only if his tally matched Nawaf Salam's; otherwise, he would abstain. The first round of these binding parliamentary consultations concluded with Nawaf Salam receiving 12 votes, while Najib Mikati secured 8 votes, including the vote from MP Jamil Al-Sayyed. One vote cast was recorded for 'no one.' The second and final phase will begin at 2:00 PM Beirut time.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2312576	2025-01-13T03:44:37-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-05305120017367686389.jpg

The strikes on Sunday were followed by further violations on Monday morning, with occupation forces combing the southern town of Khiam with medium and heavy weapons, National news Agency reported. Earlier on Sunday more Israeli violations were reported across south Lebanon, as the Lebanese Army deployed in the South’s Western Sector. On Sunday, Israeli and Lebanese media reported that the US Special Envoy Amos Hochstein told Lebanon during a visit last week that the United States guarantees full Israeli withdrawal before the end of the 60-day deadline of the ceasefire.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2312191	2025-01-12T22:44:10-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-02919560017367505996.jpg
Israeli Cyberwarfare Targets Lebanese Netizens	Since cyberwarfare has become a major aspect of the military confrontations in the world, the Israeli enemy has been using social media in order pervade misleading ideas and carrying out spy missions against individuals and groups. Lebanon's Internal Security Forces warned a few days ago about one of the new accounts, and warned against entering and browsing an account via the 'X' application named (@payameabi), which contains posts in Persian supporting the Israeli enemy A post was published in Arabic addressed the Lebanese people, calling on them to disclose information pertaining to Hezbollah. This account is managed by Israeli intelligence with the aim of recruiting agents, and its center is Tel Aviv. Legal experts spoke to Al-Manar about the penalties in Lebanon for dealing with the enemy, which depend mainly on the type of crime and its severity, but the most prominent penalties include: - Execution: in the case of espionage or providing sensitive information to the enemy. - Life imprisonment: in the case of cooperation with the enemy without causing direct harm that threatens security. - Imprisonment for a specified period: in cases limited to providing non-sensitive information or less important threats. In the event of a war with the enemy, the penalties may become more severe, as anyone proven to have dealt with the enemy will be treated as a 'traitor' to the homeland. Since the ceasefire took into effect on November 27, 2024, the Israeli enemy carried out an invasion of the Lebanese cuber system, sending messages, dialing phone numbers and publishing posts with fake job offers. The Lebanese security agencies warned the citizens against interacting with such posts and messages, wowing a serious confrontation with the enemy's cyber invasion.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2312048	2025-01-12T09:44:18-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-05134760017367038508.jpg
Intensified Diplomatic Efforts Seek Gaza Deal as ‘Israel’ Admits ...	Israeli media reported that an agreement on a prisoner swap between Israel and Hamas is nearly finalized. In this regard, Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported, based on political sources, that 90% of the details have been agreed upon. Neither Hamas nor the mediating countries, Egypt, Qatar and the US, have made an official statement confirming the agreement. The main point of disagreement is said to be Hamas' demand for guarantees from 'Israel' regarding the implementation of the second phase of the agreement related to the halt of the Zionist war. Although the exact details of the first and second phases of a potential agreement have not been fully disclosed, sources from the newspaper suggested that the first phase involves the release of elderly and sick prisoners for humanitarian reasons, while the second involves the release of military personnel. Following progress in negotiations, Steven Witkoff, a representative of US President-elect Donald Trump, is reported to have made a surprise visit Saturday to 'Israel', where he met Netanyahu. Witkoff expressed optimism to Netanyahu, saying they believe a deal could be reached soon. Israel's state television, KAN, citing foreign sources, reported Friday that Tel Aviv agreed to advance negotiations on the second phase of the agreement while the first phase is being implemented, to ensure the continuation of the process until all prisoners are released. The prisoner swap and cease-fire talks, mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the US have been interrupted several times due to new conditions imposed by Netanyahu. Families of prisoners in 'Israel' accuse Netanyahu of obstructing the cease-fire and prisoner swap agreement. Israeli military attacks on Gaza, meanwhile, continue without pause. Health Ministry in Gaza updated the toll of Israeli war since October 7, 2023, recording 46,565 martyrs and 109,660 injuries. The Zionist military reports indicated that 835 officers and soldiers have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the war, including 400 since the beginning of the ground offensive, as the Palestinian resistance continues to confront the occupation forces, targeting them in the various cities and towns of the Strip. The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants in November for Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. 'Israel' also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2311938	2025-01-12T05:13:48-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-04707930017366876232.jpg

'Critical fire-weather conditions will unfortunately ramp up again today for southern California and last through at least early next week,' the National Weather Service said. 'This may lead to the spread of ongoing fires as well as the development of new ones.' Row The Palisades fire was 11 percent contained Saturday but had grown to 23,600 acres (9,500 hectares), while the Eaton Fire was at 14,000 acres and 15 percent contained. Official figures show more than 12,000 structures burned, but Cal Fire's Todd Hopkins said not all were homes, and the number would also include outbuildings, recreational vehicles and sheds.

One Year of US-UK Failure: Yemen’s Resilience and Support for Gaz...	It has now been a year since the US and UK launched their aggression against Yemen on January 12 of the previous year, aiming to secure Israeli shipping in the Red Sea. However, the operation has ended in failure. The primary goal of the US and UK's direct involvement was to deter Yemen and halt its support for Gaza. Over time, however, the aggression became a significant burden for Washington, as Yemeni strikes targeted US and UK warships, naval vessels, and commercial ships across the Red Sea, Arabian Sea, and Indian Ocean. The outcome of this year-long aggression has transformed Yemen into a formidable military power, partially breaking America’s naval dominance. US aircraft carriers, warships, and destroyers were forced to retreat from the Red Sea while Yemen asserted control over its turbulent waters. Yemenis stand on the beach as the Galaxy Leader commercial ship, seized by Yemen’s revolutionaries in November, is anchored off the coast of Al-Salif, Yemen (photo by Reuters). Yemen’s Support for Gaza In support of Gaza, Yemen’s armed forces began targeting vessels associated with the Israeli enemy in the Red Sea. This intervention comes as Gaza faces an Israeli-led genocide and an unprecedented siege. Yemen set one condition for halting its operations: the cessation of aggression and the lifting of the blockade on Gaza. In a historic speech three days after Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, Abdulmalik Al-Houthi declared that Yemen would not remain passive in the face of Gaza's suffering. He famously stated, 'You are not alone,' reaffirming Yemen’s commitment to defend Gaza if the US backed the Israeli occupation entity. What a GREAT Yemen! Hezbollah leader praises Yemeni resistance against the Israeli regime, comparing the impoverished Arab country to the wealthy Arab states for their inaction in the face of Israeli genocide. pic.twitter.com/eC8XKYajp4 — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) January 4, 2025 Israeli Concerns Over the US-UK Aggression Against Yemen Many within Zionist circles have expressed concern over the failure of the joint US-UK aggression against Yemen. They have called for reigniting Yemen’s internal conflict to distract the country from supporting Palestinians. Could the US-UK Alliance Turn the Tide for the Israeli Enemy? This crucial question has circulated among Zionist officials following the recent aggression against Yemen. Most responses have cautioned against relying on this alliance to break Yemen’s resolve or force its retreat. This uncertainty led the Israel enemy to place its air defense systems on high alert, anticipating a Yemeni response that would expose the failure of Israeli expectations. Zionist experts have reviewed the nature of the recent aggression, focusing on how the coalition partners shared roles in the operation. They emphasized the message the Israeli occupation hoped to send during the large Palestinian solidarity protests in Sanaa's Tahrir Square. Moreover, these experts have reiterated the importance of provoking internal conflict in Yemen, hoping factions within the country would resume fighting against the Yemeni government in Sanaa, thus diverting attention from Yemen’s external support for Palestine. Yemeni Armed Forces Target Key Site in Occupied Jaffa with Hypersonic Missile 'Palestine-2' United States' Strategic Missteps Washington should have focused on halting the war and lifting the Israeli siege on Gaza rather than rallying nations to attack Yemen, a country legally justified under international law to intervene in support of Gaza. The United States likely hoped that forming this alliance would intimidate Yemen into ceasing its support for Gaza, leaving the Arab world as passive spectators to the US-Israeli genocide in Gaza.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2311674	2025-01-11T11:10:25-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/01/manar-02168500017050333731.jpg
Lebanese Army Deploys Across Southern Lebanon Amid Ongoing Israel...	The Lebanese Army has initiated deployment in towns across southern Lebanon, including Al-Qouzah, Yater, Beit Lif, and the outskirts of Ramya in the Bint Jbeil district, following the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces. Units also moved into Al-Naqoura and Al-Bayyada in the Tyre district, establishing a presence in these areas. The army announced on January 7th its deployment across several southern locations, such as Ras Al-Naqoura, Alma Al-Shaab, Tayr Harfa—Tyre, Beit Lif—Bint Jbeil, and other towns in the western and central sectors, reclaiming territory vacated by Zionist forces. In Al-Naqoura, specialized units continue operations to clear unexploded ordnance, remove debris, and reopen roads. These efforts are being conducted in coordination with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the five-nation committee overseeing the ceasefire agreement. Despite the ceasefire agreement, Israeli occupation forces launched stun grenades toward the town of Ayta Al-Shaab, attempting to intimidate civilians entering the area. The Lebanese Army had previously warned residents to wait for military clearance operations to be completed before returning. In the eastern sector, the army's planned deployment to the Al-Hammams Hill site faced delays due to Israeli enemy stalling. Meanwhile, Israeli occupation military vehicles were observed moving along the Abu Zainab-Tal Al-Nahhas road toward the Metula settlement, signaling ongoing activity in the area. Al-Manar correspondent toured the Wadi Al-Oyoun area, reaching the town of Hanin to assess its condition and the damage caused by Israeli aggression. Circulating video shows Lebanese Army vehicles entering Ramya town amid widespread destruction caused by Israeli attacks Israeli Violations Persist in Southern Lebanon Israeli occupation forces continue their violations in southern Lebanon, as reported by Al-Manar’s correspondent. The Zionist army carried out an explosion near the outskirts of Alma Al-Shaab and constructed additional earthworks along a newly established military road connecting the Al-Dhaira site to a new position west of the town. In the eastern sector, Israeli occupation forces were observed moving vehicles from Al-Hamames Hill towards the Metula area. While there had been discussions regarding the Lebanese Army repositioning at Al-Hamames Hill near Khiyam, Israeli delays have hindered progress. Drone Surveillance Intensifies IOF drones, including the Hermes 450 and Hermes 900 models, resumed high-altitude surveillance over border areas, coinciding with the ongoing deployment of Lebanese Army units along the southern border. Lebanese Army Deployment Progresses The Lebanese Army is set to establish military checkpoints as part of its initial deployment phase. This will restrict civilian access due to significant damage from recent Israeli airstrikes and bulldozer operations, as well as the presence of unexploded ordnance. Army engineering units will conduct thorough sweeps to secure the areas before civilians are allowed to return. تستكمل وحدات الجيش الانتشار في رأس الناقورة – صور وبلدات في القطاع الغربي علما الشعب، الضهيرة، عيترون، بنت جبيل، طيرحرفا، مجدل زون، الصالحني والقوزح بعد انسحاب العدو الإسرائيلي، وتعمل على تعزيز التمركز وتأمين النقاط المهمة، بالتنسيق مع قوة الأمم المتحدة المؤقتة في لبنان –… pic.twitter.com/61q04Sw5zS — الجيش اللبناني (@LebarmyOfficial) January 11, 2025 The deployment will expand to other villages, including Blida and Mays Al-Jabal, and will eventually cover the entire eastern sector.

Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najb Mikati arrived in Damascus on Saturday for talks with Syria's de facto leader, Ahmed Al-Sharaa, marking the first visit by a sitting Lebanese premier to Syria in over a decade. Mikati, accompanied by a senior delegation including Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib and top security officials, landed at Damascus International Airport aboard a Lebanese commercial flight. The visit follows a formal invitation from Al-Sharaa, extended during a phone call last week. In a joint press conference, Al-Sharaa stated, 'We are giving ourselves a chance to build a positive relationship in the upcoming stages based on the sovereignty of both Lebanon and Syria. We will maintain neutrality towards all parties in Lebanon and will try to resolve issues.'

In response to a question, Al-Sharaa added: 'We also raised the issue of border demarcation between the two countries.' Mikati, in turn, expressed optimism, stating, 'We affirmed that the good neighborly relations and mutual respect between our two peoples govern our relationship. It is our duty to activate these relations on the basis of national sovereignty for both countries and to work on preventing anything that might harm this relationship.' He also stressed the importance of addressing the refugee crisis, saying, 'It has become urgent for the benefit of both countries to address the issue of refugees' return to Syria, especially as this issue is putting significant pressure on Lebanon as a whole. I sensed understanding on this matter.' The leaders also focused on border security, ensuring that both countries remain safe from any harmful activities. Mikati concluded, 'This visit marks a positive start, and what I have sensed from Mr. Al-Sharaa regarding the relationship between the two countries reassures me.' The visit comes two days after Lebanese lawmakers elected the country’s army chief Joseph Aoun as president, ending a more than two-year vacancy.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2311443	2025-01-11T06:25:13-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-01921560017366051821.jpg
Gaza Endures 463rd Day of Zionist Occupation Crimes	The Israeli occupation forces have continued their crimes against the people of Gaza, carrying out a brutal and unrelenting assault for the 463rd consecutive day. This ongoing campaign of violence has resulted in a catastrophic humanitarian situation in the besieged Gaza Strip. The Palestinian Information Center reported that the occupation's aircraft and artillery have maintained a barrage of airstrikes and shelling, targeting civilian homes, gatherings of displaced persons, and streets across Gaza.

This has resulted in horrific massacres and the demolition of citizens' homes in the Jabalia refugee camp. Hundreds of martyrs have fallen as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens.

This has exacerbated the suffering of the population, as the ongoing violent bombing campaign continues to disrupt the work of the Civil Defense, leaving thousands without access to critical humanitarian and medical care. According to Palestinian sources, the occupation's forces have continued to target civilian infrastructure and populations, with drone strikes, airstrikes, and artillery shelling hitting residential areas and claiming more lives. The bodies of martyrs and wounded have been pulled from the rubble, as the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. The Government Media Office in Gaza has confirmed that the Zionist occupation has completely wiped out 1,600 Palestinian families, killing all of their members, as part of the ongoing genocide that has plagued the Gaza Strip for 15 months. This has resulted in the martyrdom of more than 5,600 Palestinians from these families, in addition to the annihilation of 3,471 other families, with only one person remaining in each. The total death toll from these atrocities has exceeded 9,000 martyrs.

The toll of the Israeli military aggression continues to rise, with the number of martyrs exceeding 46,000 since October 7, 2023, and the number of wounded reaching more than 109,000, including many very serious cases.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2311377	2025-01-11T04:26:33-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-06215470017359053815.jpeg
Hochstein Told Lebanon US Guarantees Full Israeli Withdrawal befo...	US envoy Amos Hochstein reportedly said Washington guarantees that the Israeli enemy will fully withdraw from southern Lebanon before the 60-day deadline stipulated in the November 27 ceasefire, both Lebanese and Israeli media reported. According to the Lebanon-based Al-Akhbar newspaper, Hochstein made the promise when he was in Beirut earlier this week. The US envoy was also reportedly updated on an agreement between the Lebanese army and on Hezbollah pulling its forces north of the Litani River — about 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the border — and dismantling any remaining military infrastructure in the south, as stipulated by the ceasefire agreement.

Under the terms of the deal that Hochstein helped to broker, the Lebanese army is to deploy alongside United Nations peacekeepers in the south as the Israeli occupation army withdraws. For its part, Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation, Kan in Hebrew, also reported that the United States had guaranteed a complete withdrawal of the Israeli army from southern Lebanon before the end of the 60-day ceasefire. The Israeli occupation army have been going ahead with its violation to the ceasefire since it took effect earlier on November 27. On Friday, 6 Lebanese people were martyred and wounded at least two others in an Israeli strike on a van n the southern town of Teir Dibba.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2311311	2025-01-11T03:24:07-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-00451270017320075923.jpg
