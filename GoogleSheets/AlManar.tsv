US Rejects Arab Leaders Plan for Gaza, Insists on Trump’s Displac...	The Trump administration has rejected a long-awaited plan for the reconstruction of Gaza endorsed by Arab leaders, saying the president stands by his own vision which includes expelling the territory’s Palestinian residents and transforming it into a 'riviera' owned by the United States. 'The current proposal does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance,' US National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement Tuesday night. 'President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas. We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.' Speaking in Cairo, PA President Mahmoud Abbas pledged that general elections will be held in the West Bank, Gaza and 1948 lands for the first time in nearly two decades 'if circumstances are suitable.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu still refuses to say what he envisions for Gaza’s post-war future, except to say that he endorses Trump’s plan for 'a different Gaza.' And he thinks neither the PA nor Hamas should govern Gaza. The $53 billion proposal by Arab nations calls for rebuilding Gaza by 2030. The first phase calls for starting the removal of unexploded ordnance and clearing more than 50 million tons of rubble left by Israel’s bombardment and military offensives. Jordanian officials told CNN earlier that the plan will be presented to President Donald Trump in the coming weeks. Although Arab states endorsed Egypt’s plan, the extent of its regional support remains uncertain. Notably, the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – wealthy Gulf nations whose financial backing would be vital for any postwar strategy – were absent from the summit. Meanwhile, Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune boycotted the meeting, citing 'imbalances and shortcomings' and criticizing it as being 'monopolized by a limited and narrow group of Arab countries.' Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters on Tuesday that the group’s arms were non-negotiable. 'The weapon of the resistance is a red line, and it is not negotiable,' he said. 'We will not accept (any deal) to trade it for reconstruction or the entry of aid.' Osama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official, said last month that the group will not disarm and may even grow after the war in Gaza. The current ceasefire in Gaza, in place since January, remains in doubt after its first phase expired on Saturday. 'Israel' has blocked the entry of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza to pressure the resistance to make concessions and has warned of additional consequences, raising fears of a return to fighting. An emergency Arab summit in Cairo on Tuesday adopted Egypt’s reconstruction plan to rebuild the Gaza Strip, as it rejected the displacement of Palestinians.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2354079	2025-03-05T05:38:36-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-00292800017411819127.jpg
Israeli Occupation Forces Escalate Violations, Drone Strike Injur...	In yet another flagrant violation of Lebanon’s sovereignty, Israeli occupation forces launched a series of drone strikes on the southern town of Ras Naqoura this afternoon, wounding two civilians. According to Al-Akhbar newspaper, an Israeli drone targeted two vehicles belonging to brothers from the Jahir family while they were inspecting their land, leaving them injured. The National News Agency reported that multiple drone strikes hit a car near a waste dump south of a UNIFIL site in Ras Al-Naqoura. The two injured brothers, who had been collecting scrap metal, were rushed to the hospital for treatment. The agency further revealed that as Lebanese Army personnel and civilians attempted to reach the site, Israeli drones launched another strike to prevent access. This attack follows an Israeli drone strike in Rashkananiyeh, Tyre district, just a day earlier, which killed one person and wounded several others. Later, Al-Manar's correspondent reported that Israeli drones renewed their assault on the targeted vehicle in Ras Al-Naqoura, striking again as the Lebanese Army attempted to evacuate the wounded.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2354068	2025-03-05T05:18:00-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-02208130017411802012.png
Shin Bet Acknowledges Historic Failure in Preventing Oct. 7 Attac...	The Zionist entity's domestic security agency Shin Bet acknowledged on Tuesday its failure in preventing Hamas's attack on Oct. 7, 2023, saying that if it had acted differently the deadliest day in 'Israel's' history could have been averted. The Internal Security Agency, as it is formally known, said that an internal probe 'reveals that if the Shin Bet had acted differently, both in the years leading up to the attack and on the night of the attack &#8230; the attack could have been prevented.' The acknowledgment comes days after an Israeli military investigation noted similar failings in protecting Israelis during the attack, which left hundreds dead and was followed by a devastating Israeli war on the Gaza Strip, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed. In the opening lines of the summary of findings from the Shin Bet investigation, the agency's chief Ronen Bar takes responsibility for failures, saying that 'as the head of the organization, I will bear this heavy burden on my shoulders for the rest of my life.' However, he added that in order to truly understand how the unprecedented attack was not stopped, there needed to be a broader probe into the role of the Israeli security and political elements and the cooperation between them. According to the summary, the investigation focused on two key areas – the direct reasons that led to the Shin Bet's failure to recognize the immediate threat from Hamas, and the developments preceding the attack. It noted that 'the investigation found no indication that the Shin Bet underestimated the enemy,' the Palestinian group Hamas. 'On the contrary, there was a deep understanding of the threat, initiatives, and a desire to neutralize the threat, particularly targeting Hamas leadership,' the summary said. The investigation found that prior knowledge of a Hamas attack plan was not treated as an 'actionable threat' and there was an overarching assessment that Hamas was more focused on 'inciting violence' in the occupied West Bank. Additionally, the investigation found that 'a policy of quiet had enabled Hamas to undergo massive military buildup,' with financial aid from Qatar going directly to Hamas's military wing. In conclusion, the agency said in its summary, 'the Shin Bet failed to provide a warning regarding the scope of the attack and the large-scale raid by Hamas'. 'The warning issued on the night of Oct. 7 was not translated into operational directives, and the response given by the Shin Bet &#8230; was insufficient to prevent or thwart the large-scale attack.' Israeli media outlets disclosed on Monday more details from the probe into the military and security failure in face of the Palestinian resistance attack on October 7, 2023.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2354002	2025-03-05T04:15:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-00034900017411769238.jpg
Amnesty International Calls for War Crimes Investigation into Isr...	Amnesty International has urged the international community to investigate war crimes committed by the Israeli occupation military during the Israeli aggression on Lebanon. On Wednesday, the organization raised alarms over repeated attacks targeting health facilities, ambulances, and paramedics in Lebanon, which they say violate international law. In a comprehensive report, Amnesty International emphasized the urgent need to probe the Israeli military's actions during the war, particularly noting that health facilities and personnel are afforded special protections under international humanitarian law. The organization revealed a shocking series of incidents, stating that between October 3 and 9, four Israeli attacks on healthcare sites in Beirut and southern Lebanon resulted in the deaths of 19 medical workers and injuries to 11 others, alongside significant damage to ambulances and medical facilities. .@amnesty : Israel’s unlawful attacks on medical facilities and personnel in #Lebanon are not only serious violations of international humanitarian law and likely #WarCrimes , but also have devastating consequences for civilians more broadly. — Avner Gidron (@AvnerGidron) March 5, 2025 'Given the scale of these attacks, it is imperative for the Lebanese government to involve the International Criminal Court,' the report urged, highlighting the need for accountability and justice for victims. Amnesty International called for Lebanon to grant jurisdiction to the ICC to investigate these crimes committed on its territory and to demand compensation for the violations incurred. Former Lebanese Health Minister Firas Abiad indicated a grim picture of the humanitarian crisis, reporting 67 attacks on hospitals, including 40 direct hits, which have collectively resulted in the deaths of 16 individuals and injuries to many more. The chaos has extended to rescue operations, with 238 attacks on emergency services accounting for 206 fatalities, as well as damage to 256 emergency vehicles, including ambulances and fire trucks. Amnesty's investigation concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that the health facilities or vehicles targeted were being used for military purposes at the time of the attacks. 'The Israeli occupation military has yet to provide adequate justification for its actions,' the report stated, reiterating that the attacks have severely compromised Lebanon's already fragile healthcare system. Despite reaching out to the Israeli occupation military for comments regarding their findings, Amnesty reported they have yet to receive a response. The ongoing Israeli aggression has had devastating consequences, with Lebanese authorities estimating over 4,000 lives lost and extensive destruction across southern and eastern Lebanon, including the southern suburbs of Beirut.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2353969	2025-03-05T03:51:01-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-05507020017411753983.jpg

Arab Summit in Cairo Adopts Egypt’s Gaza Reconstruction Plan, Rej...	An emergency Arab summit in Cairo on Tuesday adopted Egypt’s reconstruction plan to rebuild the Gaza Strip, as it rejected the displacement of Palestinians. The summit’s final statement stipulated 'the adoption of the plan submitted by the Arab Republic of Egypt—in full coordination with the State of Palestine and Arab countries, and based on studies conducted by the World Bank and the UN Development Fund—regarding early recovery and the reconstruction of Gaza as a comprehensive Arab plan.' It affirmed the rejection of the displacement of Palestinians from their land 'under any pretext or circumstances.' The summit highlighted that it assigned an Arab legal committee to study the classification of Palestinian displacement as part of the crime of genocide.

Additionally, it expressed rejection of the Israeli occupation’s use of a siege and starvation of civilians as a 'means to achieve political objectives.' The statement also condemned Israeli aggression against Syria and its incursion into Syrian territory, calling on the international community and the UN Security Council to take immediate action to force Israel to withdraw.

The final statement further called on the UN Security Council to deploy international peacekeeping forces in the West Bank and Gaza, with the goal of supporting the political horizon 'for the embodiment of a Palestinian state.' The statement emphasized the highest priority of completing the implementation of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza, focusing on its second and third phases. It also warned that any attempts to displace the Palestinian people or annex any part of Palestinian land would plunge the region into conflict and undermine opportunities for stability.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2353892	2025-03-05T02:03:01-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-04071420017411689166.jpg
Trump’s Historic Congressional Address: From Egg Prices to Flag o...	In a lengthy Congressional address, former President Donald Trump declared, 'America is back,' setting the tone for a speech that touched on a multitude of hot-button issues including soaring egg prices, the fight against 'wokeness,' and even aspirations for a flag on Mars. This unprecedented address drew significant attention not only for its length but also for the charged political atmosphere as Democrats disrupted proceedings, leading Speaker Mike Johnson to denounce the interruptions as a 'breach of decorum' and ultimately remove Congressman Al Green from Texas. 100 minutes of the world according to Trump — Axios (@axios) March 5, 2025 Trump outlined sweeping policy reversals, including a freeze on federal hiring, regulations, and foreign aid. He highlighted his decision to terminate what he called the 'ridiculous Green New Scam,' boasting of withdrawing from international agreements that he deemed detrimental to American interests, including the Paris Climate Accord and the World Health Organization. Turning to domestic economic issues, Trump placed the blame for skyrocketing egg prices squarely on President Biden, vowing to combat inflation as a key priority of his administration. He proclaimed, 'We’re working hard to get it back down,' while promising a national energy emergency to tap into America's vast energy resources. 'It’s called drill, baby, drill,' he enthused, pledging to enhance production of critical minerals and rare earths. The former president also outlined a bold trade policy, announcing a 25% tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber, and steel, stating that this would not only protect American jobs but also safeguard 'the soul of our country.' He expressed a commitment to reshaping U.S. foreign trade dynamics, pledging to address what he called long-standing injustices suffered at the hands of trade partners like Canada and Mexico. As the address wrapped up, Trump even touched on ambitions that reached beyond Earth, hinting at plans for a US flag on Mars—a symbolic nod to the nation’s goals in space exploration. As the speech unfolded, the partisan divide in Congress was palpable, yet Trump's message resonated with many supporters keen on his vision of a resurgent America, free from what he describes as the shackles of bureaucracy and social issues. The implications of this address will likely continue to dominate discussions throughout the political landscape as the nation moves forward.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2353738	2025-03-05T01:13:09-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-04049230017411659282.jpg
Trump’s Administration Blatantly Supports Netanyahu’s War Schemes...	Unlike his predecessor, Joe Biden, the US President Donald Trump conspicuously announces his administration's support for the Israeli war schemes in Gaza. In this regard, the Zionist media revealed that the US administration backs Netanyahu's steps to halt the humanitarian aid flow to Gaza, knowing that the Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has threatened to cut off the water and power supply to Gaza. The Zionist barbarism justifies such barbaric steps by pushing the Palestinian resistance to surrender and release the Zionist captives. Zionist analysts mentioned that the Palestinians are given the two choices of either death or surrender. Smotrich indicated that the decision to cut off the water and power supply is aimed at Hamas surrender, warning that the hell's gates will be opened with a military offensive that leads to the re-occupation of Gaza Strip. Similarly, the Israeli defense minister Israel Katz said that he discussed with his US counterpart Pete Hegseth the 'importance of teh release of teh Zionist captives in Gaza' in the context of the threats to resume the genocidal war on the strip. Those developments took place while the clash between the government and the opposition was intensified at the Knesset over the formation of panel tasked with the probe into October 7 failure. Israeli media outlets disclosed on Monday more details from the probe into the military and security failure in face of the Palestinian resistance attack on October 7, 2023.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2353606	2025-03-04T10:45:42-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-09041620017411138717.jpg

House Speaker Nabih Berri indicated, in a press interview on Tuesday, that the Israeli occupation army established again a buffer zone in the Lebanese border area with a depth of one to two kilometers. Lebanon will never accept a new Zionist de facto occupation in the South, Berri confirmed. Speaker Berri called for a unified national stance that confronts the new Israeli de facto, urging the international community to put an end for the repeated Israeli violations of Lebanon's sovereignty. Speaker Berri also stressed that Lebanon would never accept any political terms, pertaining to the resistance weaponry, in return for the reconstruction and aid programs. 'Reconstruction must be a national priority without forfeiting the sovereign rights.' Zionist Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Thursday that Israeli occupation forces were 'staying indefinitely' in a buffer zone on the border with Lebanon, adding their deployment there was 'situation-dependent.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2353562	2025-03-04T09:44:59-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-01503220017411102895.jpg

'Lebanon has taught me that Palestine is a cause of right which requires might.' President Aoun reminded the conferees that 'Israel’ was still occupying Lebanese territories and holding Lebanese captives. For the Palestinian cause to be the epitome of a universal human right, we shall open our countries up to the entire world, rather than isolate them, he added. 'In my country, just as in Palestine, Israel continues to occupy lands, to launch daily aggressions, and to claim innocent lives every day, leaving people martyred or wounded, destroying properties, and causing rivers of blood and tears to flow. I bow before their suffering.' There can be no peace without the restoration of the legitimate and full rights of the Palestinians, President Aoun affirmed.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2353507	2025-03-04T09:16:59-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-00633420017411086079.png

Concurrently, local Syrian sources revealed that Israeli occupation forces had infiltrated Quneitra, advancing to the town of Mashara and severing the road between Mashara and al-Tayha. This maneuver occurred amidst ongoing reconnaissance flights by Israeli aircraft. Additionally, Israeli Air Force jets targeted military sites in Qardaha, hitting equipment associated with the regime of former President Bashar al-Assad, including an air defense base. This follows last week’s aggressive actions in Tartous, western Syria, and a series of raids on military positions in southern Damascus and Daraa. At the same time, the Prime Minister of the occupation government, Benjamin Netanyahu, announced that 'Israel' will not 'allow the forces of Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham or the new Syrian army to enter the area south of Damascus,' and demanded 'the complete evacuation of southern Syria - in the provinces of Quneitra, Daraa and Sweida - from the forces of the new regime.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2353265	2025-03-04T04:53:54-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-06415860017410928237.jpg
Israeli Occupation Army Admits Failure to Defend 'Kfar Aza' as Se...	An internal investigation by the Israeli occupation military revealed a massive failure in defending the Kfar Aza settlement during the Palestinian resistance’s Operation Al-Aqsa Flood on October 7, 2023. The attack resulted in 62 deaths, 18 injuries, and the capture of 19 Zionist settlers. The report highlighted severe coordination and communication issues among Israeli occupation forces dispatched to the settlement, leading to hesitation in engaging the 250 Palestinian fighters involved in the assault. According to the findings, six members of Al-Qassam Brigades managed to infiltrate the center of Kfar Aza settlement using motorized paragliders without being detected. The Israeli occupation army only regained control of the settlement the following morning, after Palestinian fighters had already withdrawn to Gaza. Furthermore, Israeli airstrikes near Kfar Aza reportedly had no significant impact on the battle’s outcome. A Decade of Military Failure Israeli Channel 14 described the investigation’s findings as merely the 'tip of the iceberg' in what it called an overwhelming military failure. The channel reported that only 10% of the full list of failures had been disclosed to the public, with the rest being too shocking to reveal. The report further noted that this failure was not confined to the events of October 7 but was built over the past decade, becoming deeply entrenched within the Israeli military establishment. The occupation's Military Intelligence Directorate (Aman) admitted that even after extensive investigations, it still lacks full knowledge of armed factions in Gaza. Senior intelligence officials acknowledged that the army entered the war in the south without a comprehensive understanding of its adversary—an alarming reality that explains why Hamas remains operational. Total Breakdown in Security The Zionist military’s investigation concluded with a stark acknowledgment of its 'complete failure' to prevent the October 7 attack on settlements near Gaza. In an official summary shared with the media, the occupying army admitted to failing in its fundamental duty of protecting Israeli settlers. The report stated that the military’s Gaza Division was overwhelmed in the early hours of the attack, allowing Palestinian resistance factions to establish control on the ground. A senior Israeli military official conceded that the army had been 'overconfident' and severely underestimated Hamas’ capabilities before the attack. The investigation detailed that the assault was executed in three waves, involving approximately 5,000 fighters. The first wave consisted of over 1,000 elite Hamas commandos who infiltrated under heavy artillery cover. The second wave involved 2,000 fighters, followed by a third wave of hundreds of combatants accompanied by thousands of civilians. Settlers Reject the Investigation: 'They Left Us to Die' Zionist settlers, particularly those from Kfar Aza, have fiercely criticized the army’s report, arguing that it failed to address fundamental security flaws. 'How can we trust an investigation led by someone who was directly involved in the October 7 events?' they argued. The settlers expressed outrage at the findings, stating that the report merely detailed what happened on the morning of the attack but failed to explain how the situation deteriorated to such a catastrophic level. 'This investigation does not address the collapse of security; it only exposes the army’s arrogance and negligence,' they added. Their frustration boiled over as they recalled the events of that day. 'When you hear the details, you simply cannot believe that the Israeli army operates this way—without leadership, without control,' one settler said. 'When we heard this, we felt sick. They left us to die. They just left us to die.' The settlers are now calling for all military and political leaders in charge on that Black Saturday to take full responsibility and resign.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2353221	2025-03-04T04:14:11-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/04/manar-076749600171378292010.jpg
US President Trump Halts Military Aid to Ukraine Amid Escalating ...	In a move that further escalates tensions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, US President Donald Trump ordered the suspension of all military aid to Ukraine just days after their White House confrontation, Bloomberg reported. A senior US defense official confirmed to the agency that 'all current military assistance to Ukraine has been halted until President Trump determines that the country’s leaders are demonstrating a good-faith commitment to peace.' The official added that 'all US military equipment not yet in Ukraine will be temporarily withheld, including weapons being transported by air and sea, as well as those currently in transit hubs in Poland.' Meanwhile, The Washington Post also reported that the Trump administration is considering ending intelligence-sharing agreements and military training programs with Ukraine. #Trump, #Zelensky engage in a shouting match pic.twitter.com/UlJV6C4RkN — ManarWeb (@WebManar) February 28, 2025 US Vice President: Zelensky Will Eventually Join the Peace Process US Vice President J.D.

'I don’t really care what President Zelensky says about me or anyone else, but he has clearly refused to engage in the peace process that President Trump has stated is the policy of the American people and their leader,' Vance told Fox News in an interview. 'I don’t think he’s there yet,' he added, 'but I believe he will get there eventually—he has to.' Hope is not a strategy to bring peace to Ukraine.

On Monday, Trump warned that the US would 'not tolerate Zelensky’s stance on ceasefire negotiations with Russia for much longer,' following strong European support for the Ukrainian leader. When asked on Fox News whether the White House was still open to Zelensky, Vance responded, 'President Trump has made it clear that the door remains open as long as Zelensky is serious about discussing peace.' 'But you can’t walk into the Oval Office—or anywhere else—and refuse to discuss the details of a peace agreement,' he added, stressing that 'both sides of the war—Russia and Ukraine—will have to make concessions in negotiations to reach a deal.' Vance reaffirmed that when this stance changes, 'as President Trump has said, when they are ready to talk peace, he will be the first to pick up the phone.' Speaking to Fox News, Vance also took another jab at European allies, urging them to be 'realistic' and emphasizing that 'this war cannot go on indefinitely.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2353111	2025-03-04T03:21:56-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-01291970017410868928.jpg
Occupation Forces Unleash Violent Crackdown Across West Bank	In a continued campaign of brutality, Israeli occupation forces have carried out a series of violent raids and attacks across the occupied West Bank, leaving several Palestinians wounded, including two children. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society reported that Israeli forces handed over the body of slain Palestinian Jihad al-Alouna to his family in Jenin. Meanwhile, occupation forces stormed the eastern neighborhood of Jenin, surrounding a house and threatening to bomb the family home if residents did not evacuate. Israeli armored vehicles were also deployed throughout Jenin, sealing off the city's entrances as the destruction of infrastructure in the eastern neighborhood continued, further exacerbating the dire conditions faced by local residents.

Several individuals, including a 13-year-old and a 15-year-old, were wounded by live ammunition fired by the occupation forces, according to the Red Crescent. The relentless Israeli aggression across the occupied West Bank has led to a rising frequency of injuries and assaults against Palestinians. The regime has continued to carry out extensive raids and mass arrests, targeting dozens, including women, and raiding numerous homes, subjecting residents to abuse, assault, and the destruction of their properties.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2353023	2025-03-04T01:34:03-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-08764070017361619573.jpg
Nahal Oz Base Represents Catastrophic and Painful Systemic Failur...	Israeli media outlets disclosed on Monday more details from the probe into the military and security failure in face of the Palestinian resistance attack on October 7, 2023. 'The organization of commanders and some operatives for the October 7 operation began on Friday at 18:30 and was not detected by any Israeli intelligence agency—not Unit 8200, the Shin Bet, nor the Gaza Division responsible for gathering information within one or two kilometers of the border,' the reports mentioned. 'The operation was swift and coordinated: dozens of armed fighters in the first wave were already in their vehicles, fully prepared near the border by around 6:00, waiting for the green light—a coordinated barrage of 960 rockets and mortar shells launched at 6:29 at Israeli army positions in the Gaza envelope, aiming to paralyze them.' The Israeli media pointed out that the rocket fire served as a signal for Hamas fighters to breach the security fence, which was penetrated in the area opposite Kibbutz Kfar Aza through three infiltration points at 6:35, 6:41, and 6:43. 'Simultaneously, Hamas deployed six elite unit members inside the kibbutz using gliders,' the reports added. 'Hamas gathered intelligence on the Nahal Oz base in the Gaza envelope through drones it regularly launched, in addition to utilizing videos uploaded by soldiers from inside the base on the internet.' The Israeli media added the Nahal Oz camp had been pre-divided, with each elite unit knowing exactly which area it was responsible for capturing. 'The first wave, between 6:30 and 7:00, included 65 of Hamas' top fighters. They were joined by around 50 more in the second wave by 9:00, followed by an additional 100 fighters by 10:00. At the peak of the attack, approximately 250 armed fighters were inside the Nahal Oz camp, which has a perimeter of just 1,200 meters.' Hamas forces that reached the Nahal Oz base were highly equipped, not only enjoying numerical superiority but also possessing more lethal combat capabilities, according to the Israeli reports which added that, while the Israeli army did not see the need to routinely equip its soldiers with grenades or shells, and machine guns were stored in warehouses, Hamas entered the battle with a large number of RPGs, various explosive devices, and significant quantities of Kalashnikov rifles and other weapons. According to the Israeli media reports, five officers from the Golani Brigade's command fled to the military operations room at the Nahal Oz base on October 7th and did not go out to fight. 'Along with them were 17 soldiers. A fire broke out inside the room, killing most of them, and a few managed to escape by breaking a window and fleeing.' Israeli media reports concluded that the battle at the Nahal Oz base represents a catastrophic and painful systemic failure that strikes at the core of the military values of the Israeli army. 'We have lost fundamental principles in defense. Despite the clashes inside the base, there were soldiers and commanders who did not seek to engage with the enemy.' The Israeli occupation army has acknowledged its 'complete failure' to prevent the October 7 attack by Hamas, admitting that it had, for years, underestimated the Palestinian group’s capabilities.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2352891	2025-03-03T10:34:55-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-07523550017410268886.jpg

Israeli Violations Continue in Attempt to Impose New De Facto on ...	The Israeli enemy continued on Monday violating the Lebanese sovereignty in an attempt to impose a new de factor situation based on unlimited Zionist aggression on Lebanon banned by the ceasefire agreement from responding. Al-Manar correspondent indicated that a Lebanese citizen was shot by the Zionist enemy in the town of Kfarkila while he was inspecting his destroyed home near the occupied buffer zone. An Israeli occupation patrol incurred into the plain of the border town of Abbasiyeh and arrested a farmer, yet released him later. The occupation forces also raised a new earthen barrier on the Adaisseh road to prevent residents from reaching their properties. The Israeli drones flew over Bekaa and south Lebanon, broadcasting provocative slogans. Zionist Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Thursday that Israeli occupation forces were 'staying indefinitely' in a buffer zone on the border with Lebanon, adding their deployment there was 'situation-dependent.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2352671	2025-03-03T05:16:22-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-06501280017410077697.png

Israel’s Reported Violations in Gaza Reach Alarming Levels	A comprehensive report by Al-Risala newspaper has revealed that the Israeli occupation has committed a staggering 962 violations of the ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip over a 42-day period since its implementation began on January 19, 2025. The report details a disturbing series of incidents that have resulted in the deaths of 98 individuals and injuries to 490 others, calling into question the sustainability of the fragile truce. The documented violations include 77 incidents of gunfire, 45 vehicle incursions into restricted areas, 37 shelling and targeting operations, and numerous air flights by Israeli aircraft. Furthermore, there have been reports of at least five detentions of drivers and fishermen in direct contravention of the agreement’s stipulations. Israeli military vehicles open fire in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip. pic.twitter.com/v9F5yqJka0 — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) March 2, 2025 Despite the ceasefire agreement's intent to foster peace, the report indicates that ‘Israel’ has continually sought justifications to breach the terms, engaging in these actions from the moment the agreement took effect. Significant violations have included the ongoing advancement of military vehicles beyond agreed withdrawal lines, particularly along the Philadelphi axis, resulting in civilian casualties, home demolitions, and land bulldozing. Key areas impacted by these violations include Sultan Junction, Al-Awda neighborhood, and East Al-Maghazi, among others. Additionally, the report highlights a troubling pattern of enforcement against local fishermen, who have faced gunfire and detentions while attempting to work in designated fishing zones. Palestinian Prisoners and Humanitarian Aid Under Siege The report also reveals significant delays in the release of prisoners, a critical aspect of the ceasefire agreement. Palestinian prisoners have endured physical abuse, humiliation, and starvation leading up to their release. Among the many affected, 70-year-old Siham Musa Abu Salem remains imprisoned, highlighting the plight of vulnerable detainees. Families of West Bank prisoners have also faced restrictions, being denied travel to meet their sons deported abroad. The report further emphasizes critical humanitarian violations as the early recovery process remains stalled. The entry of essential fuel has been grossly inadequate, with only 978 trucks allowed into Gaza over 42 days—just 46.5% of the agreed daily amount of 50 trucks. Furthermore, the humanitarian agreement stipulated the entry of 200,000 tents, but only 132,000 have been allowed, with heavy equipment material needed for rubble clearance being severely restricted. Israel has been accused of using starvation as a weapon of war against Palestinian civilians in Gaza following its decision to block all humanitarian aid from entering the enclave. Here’re some reactions to Israel’s move. — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) March 3, 2025 Medical supplies and building materials necessary for the rehabilitation of Gaza’s infrastructure have also been denied entry, compounding the humanitarian crisis. Despite the dire needs, just five ambulances have made it into the region, and the ban on essential goods, including poultry and livestock, persists. Violations extend to the critical Rafah Crossing, where civilian movement has been further restricted. The agreement’s provisions for easing travel and trade have not been implemented, leaving many sick and wounded travelers stranded and without assistance. In the Philadelphi Corridor, promised reductions in Israeli occupation military presence have not materialized, with forces continuing to penetrate deeper into Palestinian territory rather than withdrawing as they committed to do. Politically, there has been a noticeable delay in beginning the second phase of negotiations, despite stipulations in the agreement requiring these discussions to commence 16 days post-signing. Netanyahu rejected the next phase of the ceasefire deal, blocked Gaza aid, and threatened severe consequences. With 962 violations recorded, 116 Gazans killed, and ongoing attacks.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2352440	2025-03-03T00:52:15-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/01/manar-06424900017377208875.jpg

Leader of Yemen’s Ansarullah revolutionary movement Sayyed Abdul-Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi warned the Zionist entity of significant retaliatory actions if the war in Gaza resumes. In a televised address late on Saturday for the start of Ramadan holy month, Sayyed Houthi said that renewed Israeli military operations in Gaza would trigger a military response from Sanaa against Israeli territories, with a special emphasis on targeting Tel Aviv. 'We stand firmly committed through religious, humanitarian, and ethical obligations to support our Palestinian brothers and sisters, along with resistance forces, particularly the Qassam Brigades,' Sayyed Houthi said, referring to military wing of Hamas Palestinian resistance movement.

Yemeni Armed Forces stood by Gaza throughout 15 months of brutal Israeli war, targeting Israel-bound vessels and staging missile and drone attacks on the Zionist entity. On Saturday, the 42-day initial phase of the three-stage ceasefire agreement between Hamas and the Zionist entity expired, with the Israeli occupation ditching the truce.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2352308	2025-03-02T07:29:01-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-00126780017409291771.jpg

Kremlin Says Rapid US Foreign Policy Shift Largely Aligns with It...	The Kremlin said that the United States’ dramatic shift in foreign policy largely aligns with its own vision. 'The new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations. This largely coincides with our vision,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a reporter from state television. 'There is a long way to go, because there is huge damage to the whole complex of bilateral relations. But if the political will of the two leaders, President Putin and President Trump, is maintained, this path can be quite quick and successful,' Peskov added. The Kremlin in Moscow (image from archive). Peskov made the comments on Wednesday, but the remarks were only made public today, AFP news agency reported. US President Donald Trump has sought to build ties with Moscow since taking office in January, reaching out to President Vladimir Putin and siding with Russia at the United Nations. Trump has since even further aligned himself with Moscow, rebuking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a stunning televised confrontation at the White House on Friday.

‘Israel’ Disavows Gaza Ceasefire Deal, Blocks Entry of Aid into S...	The Israeli occupation has been ditching ceasefire deal in Gaza as it blocked the entry of humanitarian aid into the besieged strip on Sunday. The occupation reneged on the truce after the first phase of the ceasefire deal ended without agreement on continuing into a second phase. The office of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Sunday it was imposing a blockade on Gaza because Hamas would not accept a plan which it claimed had been put forward by the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to extend phase one of the ceasefire, and postpone phase two, which envisaged an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. 'With the end of phase one of the hostage deal, and in light of Hamas’s refusal to accept the Witkoff outline for continuing talks – to which Israel agreed – Prime Minister Netanyahu has decided that, as of this morning, all entry of goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will cease. Israel will not allow a ceasefire without the release of our hostages,' it said in a statement. 'If Hamas continues its refusal, there will be further consequences.' Remember how many months Biden officials spent telling you Israel wasn’t deliberately blocking aid to Gaza? Yet, somehow, Israel can turn the switch on and off whenever they choose. This is an open, public declaration of the intent to commit a war crime. pic.twitter.com/QyR0aRYY4S — Assal Rad (@AssalRad) March 2, 2025 'Cheap Blackmail' Earlier, the Israeli occupation regime announced it would adopt a US-backed proposal for the extension of the ceasefire in Gaza throughout Ramadan and Passover, in exchange for the release of half of the remaining captives in the enclave. The existence and details of a Witkoff plan had not been confirmed by Washington by Sunday morning. Insisting to adhere to the agreement signed in January, Hamas responded with demands to implement phase two of the deal to reach a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. A statement from Hamas called the suspension of aid a 'war crime' and a violation of the ceasefire agreement. It said Netanyahu’s 'decision to suspend humanitarian aid is cheap blackmail, a war crime and a blatant coup against the [ceasefire] agreement'. 'Israel Bears Responsibility for Captives’ Fate' Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said 'bears responsibility' for the fate of Israeli captives held in Gaza.

Israeli 'Buffer Zone' in South Lebanon is Much More than Five Occ...	After the Israeli enemy completed its withdrawal from South Lebanon on February 18. 2025. in accordance with the ceasefire agreement in addition to the extended withdrawal timeline, it kept occupation forces in five locations in South Lebanon. The Israeli enemy claimed that the five positions are aimed at securing the Zionist settlements close to the borders with Lebanon. However, the Israeli circles considered that the five posts may be a source of fear for the Zionists because of the expected Hezbollah attacks. Zionist Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Thursday that Israeli occupation forces were 'staying indefinitely' in a buffer zone on the border with Lebanon, adding their deployment there was 'situation-dependent.' Katz use of 'buffer zone' does not match with mere five occupation posts. Thus, Al-Manar reporter Ali Shoeib inspected the border area in order to uncover the aspects of the Zionist remarks. Al-Manar reporter identified swathes of Lebanese territories off the Zionist settlements of Misgav Am, Margaliot and Al-Metula controlled by the enemy through placing earthen barriers and constructing or scraping roads. The reporter located Hounin valley, outskirts of Adaisseh and Kfarkila, and west of Hamames Hills in Khiam barrens. It is worth noting that there are residential buildings in some of the Israeli-held territories. Accordingly, Katz remarks about the 'buffer zone' is much more than mere five posts. It is a major aggression that requires a Lebanese official move to liberate the occupied territories.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2351934	2025-03-01T10:47:29-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-01793870017408548357.jpeg

Minister of Public Works and Transport, Fayez Rasamny, reflected in a post published via the ministry's X account on his Friday's inspection tour with Prime Minister Nawaf Salam in South Lebanon. 'We witnessed firsthand the immense destruction in the war-ravaged villages of southern Lebanon. The scale of devastation is staggering, yet equally powerful is the unwavering resilience of the people. Their dignified perseverance is the very foundation upon which we will rebuild and move forward.' 'The very air of the south carries the scent of history—one of resilience and pride,' he added, 'It stirs the soul and awakens within us a profound sense of belonging and responsibility.' In southern Lebanon, sacrifice and steadfastness are not just words but lived experiences, and patriotism is not an abstract notion but a tangible force that keeps this land standing tall despite its wounds, Rasamny said. 'We reaffirm our full commitment to standing by you, dedicating every available resource to support your recovery. You are the heartbeat of this land, and with your determination, it will rise again—stronger, more vibrant, and more beautiful than before. You will not face this journey alone; hope endures even in the face of adversity, and a brighter future awaits our beloved South and cherished Lebanon. Rasamny also called on all Lebanese to visit the south and witness its reality with their own eyes. 'A true understanding of the suffering and sacrifices of southerners comes only from standing among them.

In a personal and unprecedented interview, the family of martyred Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah shared memories of loss and pride in an exclusive episode aired by Al-Manar TV on Friday, hosted by Manar Sabbagh. Titled 'Sayyed,' the broadcast was more than a tribute—it was a testament to a leader whose presence shaped the very course of resistance. With raw emotion, Sayyed Jawad Nasrallah spoke of his father’s unwavering defiance against tyranny: 'Till his last breath, he fought for justice.' His voice carried both grief and pride, reflecting the sacrifice that defined Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah’s life. Through their words, his essence came alive—his strength, his tenderness, his unyielding resolve. With every memory shared, his towering legacy of resistance and sacrifice grew even more eternal, forever etched in the hearts of those who carry his cause forward.

Hamas Calls on Palestinians to Defend Al-Aqsa Mosque During Holy ...	The Palestinian resistance group Hamas has called on all Palestinians to mount a 'large mobilization' and resist Israeli restrictions on the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem during the holy month of Ramadan. In a statement published on the Palestinian resistance group's Telegram channel on Saturday, senior Hamas member Abdul Rahman Shadid issued a call to action, urging Palestinians to converge on the courtyard of the sacred site throughout the Muslim fasting month. He emphasized that Palestinians 'must not surrender to the restrictions of the occupiers. We must confront them with all our strength and adhere to our historical and religious right to the blessed mosque.' Shadid called for 'roaring crowds' to protect the al-Aqsa Mosque compound all through Ramadan. Hamas condemned the Israeli police's decision to limit the number of worshippers allowed to attend Friday prayers at Al-Aqsa to just 10,000, describing it as 'a new escalation against the Palestinian people and their holy sites' and a 'blatant violation of all conventions and religious laws.' The Gaza-based movement warned the Israeli regime against 'proceeding with such measures,' holding it fully responsible for any escalation that may occur. Hamas also called on the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the international community to 'take serious action to stop the crimes and violations of the occupation against Al-Aqsa Mosque.' The movement called on the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the international community to 'take serious action to stop the crimes and violations of the occupation against al-Aqsa Mosque and to ensure that the Palestinian people can freely practice their religious rituals there.' Hamas finally urged Palestinians across the West Bank, al-Quds and elsewhere in the occupied territories to 'intensify their presence at al-Aqsa Mosque, engage in worship and seclusion there during Ramadan, and confront all attempts by the occupation and extremists to desecrate or impose control over the mosque.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2351670	2025-03-01T05:05:49-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2022/05/manar-006365600165174177010.jpg
Kurdistan Workers’ Party Declares Ceasefire with Turkey After 40-...	The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has announced an immediate ceasefire, marking a significant step towards ending its four-decade-long insurgency against the Turkish state. The announcement came on Saturday, following a call by the group's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, for disarmament. Ocalan's appeal, which was triggered by an unexpected proposal in October from an ultra-nationalist ally of President Tayyip Erdogan, has been welcomed by the United States, the European Union, and other Western allies, as well as by Turkiye's neighbors, Iraq and Iran. 'In order to pave the way for the implementation of leader Apo's call for peace and democratic society, we are declaring a ceasefire effective from today,' the PKK stated, according to the Firat news agency. The group affirmed that it 'fully agree[s] with the content of the call and state[s] that, from our front, we will heed the necessities of the call and implement it.' #عاجل | حزب العمال الكوردستاني PKK يعلن وقف إطلاق النار مع تركيا، ويؤكد التزامه الكامل بمضمون رسالة أوجلان الداعية لنزع السلاح وحل التنظيم. pic.twitter.com/qFzkS5UDD1 — الوضع الكوردي ‎Rewşa Kurda (@rewsakurda) March 1, 2025 Who is Abdullah Öcalan? Abdullah Öcalan, also known as 'Apo,' is the founder of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). In 1979, he went to Syria to prepare for the Kurdish independence war. He established the PKK’s headquarters in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley. After the military coup in Turkey in 1980, many activists followed him to the PKK camps there. In 1998, Öcalan was forced to leave Syria under pressure from Ankara. This was followed by a journey in which no country was willing to accept him. Finally, he was arrested by Turkish intelligence in 1999 in the Kenyan capital Nairobi. In Turkey, Öcalan was sentenced to death for high treason and founding a separatist terrorist organization. The sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. Since then, Öcalan has been held in solitary confinement in a prison on the island of Imrali in the Sea of Marmara near Istanbul. His family and lawyers were rarely allowed to visit him. After nearly ten years, Ocalan received a delegation from the pro-Kurdish opposition party in his prison at the end of last year 2024. Ocalan is now 76 years old, and despite not appearing in public since 1999, he still enjoys great confidence among his supporters. The move marks a significant development in the long-standing conflict, which has claimed more than 40,000 lives since the PKK launched its armed campaign in 1984. The group, now headquartered in the mountains of northern Iraq, has expressed hope that Ankara would release Ocalan, who has been held in near-total isolation since 1999, so he could oversee the disarmament process. However, the Turkish government has reiterated that it will not engage in negotiations with the PKK and has insisted that all Kurdish armed groups, including those operating in Iraq and Syria, must disarm. The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which Ankara considers an extension of the PKK, have clarified that Ocalan's call does not apply to them. The initiative's success will hinge on the establishment of the necessary political and democratic conditions, as emphasized by the PKK. The pro-Kurdish DEM party has urged the Turkish government to take concrete steps towards democratization, stating that its response will be decisive. If the ceasefire holds and the disarmament process is successfully implemented, the move could have far-reaching regional implications, potentially bringing an end to a conflict that has long been a source of instability in the region.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2351604	2025-03-01T04:06:09-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-08901450017408307629.jpg
US Green Lights $3 Billion Arms Deal with ‘Israel’ Amid Stalled C...	The United States has approved a massive $3 billion arms sale to Israel, even as ceasefire negotiations remain stalled between the two sides. The deal, authorized by US. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, includes a wide range of military equipment, from munitions and warheads to bulldozers and other hardware. The largest portion of the agreement, valued at $2.04 billion, comprises 35,529 MK 84 or BLU-117 general-purpose bomb bodies and 4,000 I-2000 penetrator warheads. An additional $675.7 million package includes MK 83 and BLU-110 bomb bodies, along with JDAM guidance kits, with deliveries expected to begin in 2028. The State Department just approved $3.01 billion in Arms sales to Israel. $2.04 Billion in bombs $675.7 Million in bombs and weapon guidance kits $295 Million in bulldozers Congressional review was waived as 'an emergency exists that requires the immediate sale.' pic.twitter.com/z9oG3yhV95 — Sulaiman Ahmed (@ShaykhSulaiman) February 28, 2025 ‘Israel’ will also receive D9R and D9T Caterpillar bulldozers under the $295 million agreement, with deliveries scheduled for 2027. Rubio claimed an 'emergency exists' that requires the 'immediate sale' of these defense articles to ‘Israel’, waiving the usual congressional approval process. The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) stated that the sale is 'vital to US national interests' and will 'assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability.' This latest arms deal follows the US approval earlier this month of more than $7.4 billion in bombs, missiles, and related equipment for Israel, which utilized American-made weaponry during its devastating war on the Gaza Strip. The announcement comes amid growing concerns over civilian casualties and as former President Donald Trump recently floated his controversial 'Gaza takeover' scheme, which includes displacing more than two million Palestinians and turning the enclave into the 'Riviera of the Middle East' under US control.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2351417	2025-03-01T01:02:35-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/03/manar-06799360017408196984.jpg
Sayyed': Al-Manar Exclusive Interviews with Sayyed Nasrallah’s F...	With his eyes reflecting both loss and pride, Sayyed Jawad Nasrallah sat to an interview with Al-Manar, recalling late Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah. Entitled 'Sayyed' - a name the people of resistance used to refer to Sayyed Nasrallah- Al-Manar broadcast on Friday an exclusive episode that included interviews with the late secretary general’s son Jawad, daughter Zeinab and three of his grandsons. 'Till his last breath he fought for justice. He was martyred because he said ‘no’ to the tyrants,' Sayyed Jawad Nasrallah told Al-Manar’s host Manar Sabbagh. 'His character combined both boundless affection and extreme strength,' Sayyed Jawad added. In a 150-minute interview, both Jawad and Zeinab Nasrallah recalled major stops of Sayyed Nasrallah’s life till his martyrdom. Sayyed Nasrallah grandsons, Hadi, Hasan and Rabih, talked about their relations with Sayyed Nasrallah, their meetings, their grandfather’s advices and how his eminence was following up on their issues despite the tight security measures. Zeinab Nasrallah revealed that the last meeting with her father took place nearly 14 months before the martyrdom of the 'Sayyed' on September 27. She talked about Sayyed Nasrallah, the compassionate father, and the sincere and loyal leader. Zeinab Nasrallah, daughter of Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah in an interview with Al-Manar (February 2025). Sayyed Nasrallah Visited South Lebanon 'Sayyed Nasrallah used to go out. He visited south Lebanon: Tyre, Nabatiyeh, Iqlim Al-Tuffah, reaching Jizzine,' Sayyed Jawad told Al-Manar as he was dismissing claims that the late Hezbollah leader used to stick to underground hideouts. 'We even used to hang out with him and our mother,' Sayyed Jawad added. The video below shows the room which Sayyed Nasrallah used to wait in during Ashura at Sayyed Shuhada Complex when he used to address mourners there. Sayyed Nasrallah Cried after Pager Attacks Sayyed Nasrallah’s daughter told Al-Manar, citing her mother, that the Hezbollah leader cried following the Zionist entity’s pager attacks which killed or injured thousands of people on September 17, 18 last year, nearly a week before the Israeli war launched the last war on Lebanon. 'I called my mom in the next day. I asked about the reaction of the 'Sayyed'. She told me that he cried. Now, I recall his speeches while talking about Abu Al-Fadl Al-Abbas and how he was injured in his hands and his eyes, just like the resistance fighters. I remember how he once cried while recalling Abu Al-Fadl.'	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2351373	2025-02-28T14:00:49-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01617760017407798401.jpg
Trump and Zelensky Meeting Devolves into Shouting Match over Ukra...	A remarkable shouting match broke out in the Oval Office on Friday between President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, who was hoping to appeal to the US for continued security assistance during his trip to Washington. Raising their voices, Trump and Zelensky — along with the Vice President JD Vance — engaged in a tense back-and-forth about the nature of US support, and whether Zelensky had demonstrated enough gratitude. 'You’re not really in good position right now,' Trump scolded Zelensky, raising his voice. 'You’re gambling with World War III,' the US president went on. Vance called Zelensky 'disrespectful' for trying to litigate the conflict in public. Trump and Zelensky are expected to sign an agreement granting Washington access to Ukraine’s natural resources. The idea of a deal involving Ukraine’s rare-earths was first floated by Zelensky last autumn, and the US president took him up on the offer earlier this month. There was some back-and-forth over the past few weeks, with the Ukrainian leader apparently attempting to secure more favorable terms. The minerals deal is expected to provide a general framework and confirm the two nations’ intent to create a special joint fund to be followed up by a series of separate documents, stipulating the details. #Trump, #Zelensky engage in a shouting match pic.twitter.com/UlJV6C4RkN — ManarWeb (@WebManar) February 28, 2025	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2351296	2025-02-28T10:32:34-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-04735970017407675364.png

It was a remarkable step for the prime minister Nawaf Salam to start his local tours with an important visit to South Lebanon in order to personally inspect the massive destruction caused by the Zionist war on the country. However, his slip of missing the martyrs of the resistance upon hailing those of the Army and the UNIFIL provoked the locals. One citizen in Nabatieh City told Salam that the latter would not be able to visit south Lebanon if it were not for the Resistance. In Khiam where the resistance fighters engaged in heroic battles against the enemy troops who failed to occupy the City, a citizen addressed Salam and affirmed that diplomacy can never liberate the occupied territories. PM Salam traveled to the south aboard a military helicopter, accompanied by Environment Minister Tamara Al-Zein, According to the National News Agency.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2351197	2025-02-28T09:32:56-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07318280017407639618.jpg

Hezbollah and the massive crowds of the resistance supporters held a solemn funeral to mourn 130 martyrs in the two border towns of Aitaroun and Aita Al-Shaab. The convoys of trucks carrying the holy coffins set off from various Lebanese towns where the pure bodies were temporarily buried due to the Israeli war circumstances. بالفيديو | قافلة شهداء بلدة #عيترون تنطلق من #بيروت إلى جنوب #لبنان pic.twitter.com/SUgsNypWNE — قناة المنار (@TVManar1) February 28, 2025 Funeral prayers were held in the two towns for the pure bodies of the martyrs before they were laid to rest. Moreover, mourners held the flags of the resistance and chanted slogans which underlined allegiance to its path. Member of Loyalty to Resistance parliamentary bloc, Dr. Hasan Fadlallah, underlined the heavy sacrifices made by the border villages, adding that the government is now responsible for the liberation of the occupied territories and the protection of the Lebanese towns from the Zionist aggression. MP Fadlallah stressed that the fight of the border villages against the Israeli enemy has protected the entire country, adding that the enemy could have reached Baabda Palace again without that resistance. For his part, the former minister Mustafa Bayram hailed the sacrifices of the martyrs who sustained the national dignity, adding that the Resistance may never be weakened. The enemy planned to crush the resistance that steadfastly fought and made heavy sacrifices in order to confront the aggression, Bayram added. Bayram stressed that Hezbollah wants the independent government to assume its responsibilities and the Lebanese army to be powerful and fight the enemy. Head of Hezbollah Juristic Council Sheikh Mohammad Yazbek deplored the absence of the state officials from the funeral of the 130 martyrs in Aitaroun and Aita Al-Shaab. Addressing Hezbollah ceremony of receiving condolences on the martyrdom of Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and Sayyed Hashem Safieddine in Baalbek City, Sheikh Yazbek underscored rejection of any intention to naturalize ties with the Zionist entity at whatever cost.

Israeli Army Probe Reveals ‘Complete Failure’ in Preventing Octob...	The Israeli occupation army has acknowledged its 'complete failure' to prevent the October 7 attack by Hamas, admitting that it had, for years, underestimated the Palestinian group’s capabilities. The summary of an Israeli army investigation, published on Thursday, said it 'failed in its mission to protect Israeli civilians'. 'October 7 was a complete failure, the military failed in fulfilling its mission to protect Israeli 'civilians',' a senior Israeli army official told reporters following the publication of the investigation. 'Too many civilians died that day asking themselves in their hearts or out loud, where was the army?' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The probe said the perception that Hamas was not interested in a full-scale conflict and that 'Israel' would have ample warning in case of an attack went unchallenged for years, resulting in a lack of preparedness and ability to respond to an attack. It also found that 'Israel' had focused its intelligence and military efforts on other fronts, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, and relied too heavily 'on intelligence, barriers, and defensive measures alone', and was thus caught by surprise. There have been widespread calls for Benjamin Netanyahu to resign. The incident had already resulted in the resignation of Israeli spy chief Aharon Haliva in 2024. In January, Israeli top general Herzi Halevi also resigned, citing 'terrible' security and intelligence 'failures' that led to the attack. The Zionist army’s southern command Yaron Finkelman also resigned. 'I embrace it, the responsibility is mine, I was the commander of the army on October 7th, I bear my own responsibility, and I also bear the full responsibility for all of you. And I acknowledge in every subordinate of mine who made a mistake, as part of my own [mistake],' Halevi had said.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2351021	2025-02-28T03:54:12-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2023/10/manar-04948830016967569526.jpg

‘Israel’ Starts New Phase of Escalation in South Syria: Preparati...	The Israeli occupation has begun a new phase of escalation in Syria’s south, in preparation for indirectly annexing it, echoing the escalation taking place in the West Bank, Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar reported on Thursday. The paper said the escalation in south Syria has been through several paths, 'some under the pretext of 'protecting minorities,' and others through the de facto authority that it imposes by force.' The move comes after 'After destroying most of the Syrian Army’s capabilities following the collapse ex-president Bashar al-Assad’s regime on December 8, and after occupying the demilitarized zone in southern Syria, including its strategic heights and fresh water sources,' Al-Akhbar reported. If completed, this means that the Zionist entity will grab three governorates: Sweida, Daraa and Quneitra, according to the report. Meanwhile, the new Syrian administration, led by the transitional president Ahmad Al-Sharaa, keeps mum after the man repeatedly voiced unwillingness to engage in any confrontation with the Israeli occupation, the Lebanese daily added. The escalation comes as the Israeli occupation continues to carry out aerial attacks on Syria, with strikes being reported late Tuesday on Daraa, Sweida, and the outskirts of Damascus. On the other hand, the Israeli occupation has been building military outposts and bases in the so-called demilitarized buffer zone with Syria, amid several attempts of ground advance in the nearby area. In parallel with the direct and indirect military control over southern Syria, the Israeli occupation forces began expanding contact channels with the residents of those areas, offering financial incentives by securing job opportunities in the occupied territories, in an effort to link the economy of the south to the occupation authorities, and to strengthen the latter's control over this region, by all means, according to the paper. Meanwhile on Thursday, Zionist Defense Minister Israel Katz said that Israeli occupation forces were 'staying indefinitely' in the so-called buffer zones in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza. Earlier this week, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said that the Zionist entity will not allow Syria’s new army or the insurgent group that led the ouster of Al-Assad to 'enter the area south of Damascus.'

Israeli Troops Will Remain in Lebanon, Syria, Gaza 'Buffer Zones'...	Zionist Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Thursday that Israeli occupation forces were 'staying indefinitely' in a buffer zone on the border with Lebanon, adding their deployment there was 'situation-dependent.' 'There is a buffer zone (on the border with Lebanon), it wasn’t easy but I stood my ground, and we received a green light from the United States, we gave them a map, and we are staying indefinitely — this is situation-dependent, not time-dependent,' Katz said at a conference, according to a statement issued by his office. It is worth noting that the Zionist enemy completed its withdrawal from South Lebanon on February 18, 2025, keeping five occupation positions in Mount Jal Al-Deir (Aitaroun), Al-Hamames Hill (Al-Khiam), Mount Blat (between Ramyah and Marwaheen), Houla-Markaba Main Road, and Al-Labbouneh Hill (Outskirts of Naqoura and Alma Al-Shaab). Southern Syria Katz also pointed out that southern Syria must remain demilitarized at all costs — and that 'Israel' will ensure that it does. 'Joulani came to power in Syria, traded in his trousers for suits, and he speaks well. We don’t trust him. We trust only the IDF,' the minister stated. Gaza Israeli Defense Minister added that the Philadelphi Corridor on the border between Gaza and Egypt will remain a 'buffer zone.' 'The Philadelphi Corridor will remain a buffer zone just like the borders with Lebanon and Syria,' Katz said. 'Israel' is scheduled to start withdrawing from the 14-kilometer (8.69-mile) corridor on Saturday under a Gaza ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement with Hamas. An Israeli official, however, confirmed Thursday that Tel Aviv will not withdraw from the corridor on Saturday. 'We will not leave the Philadelphi Corridor,' the public broadcaster KAN quoted the official as saying. He said Israel will not allow Hamas 'to again roam our borders with pickup trucks and guns, and we will not allow them to rearm through smuggling.' The Israeli army captured the corridor during its genocidal war on Gaza, which has killed more than 48,300 people, mostly women and children, and left the enclave in ruins. The Israeli war was brought to a halt under the ceasefire agreement, which took hold in Gaza on Jan. 19. Last November, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. 'Israel' also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2350394	2025-02-27T05:32:48-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-05414040017322736387.jpg
Website Publishes List of Canadian Israelis who Served in the IOF	The non-profit news website The Maple published a list of 85 Canadians with Israeli citizenship who have served in the Israeli occupation army. The website announced that this is the initial list and that it intends to publish additional lists of additional Canadians that have joined the Israeli military. The article, entitled 'Meet 85 Canadians That Have Fought For Israel,' featured in online publication The Maple provides a link to the list.

The list has sparked anger by Israeli circles, with Israeli Channel 14 describing the move a 'scandal'. 'I don’t think it’s an acceptable thing to happen in Canada,' Rebecca Garner, who served in the IDF from 2011 to 2014, and whose name was enrolled in the list, told the National Post, a Canadian English-language broadsheet newspaper.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2350306	2025-02-27T02:08:57-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2024/11/manar-09000340017314003295.jpg

The Islamic Resistance movement Hamas announced that the path to further negotiations has been cleared, prompting the Israeli occupation government to embark on the second phase of talks. The statement highlights that the enemy’s false excuses have been rendered invalid, and now they 'have no choice but to commence.' Hamas charged that the Israeli government's efforts, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to obstruct a ceasefire deal, only exacerbate the suffering of captives and their families.

For the second consecutive day, Hezbollah continues to receive condolences and tributes for the martyred leader of the nation, Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, and the martyred Secretary General, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, at Ashura Square in Beirut’s southern suburb (Dahiyeh). The gathering has drawn a large turnout of political, religious, cultural, and military figures from Lebanon and abroad, alongside massive public crowds. Throughout the morning of Wednesday, high-ranking officials, diplomats, and military representatives arrived to extend their condolences and pay tribute to the fallen leaders. Among the prominent attendees were former Lebanese President Michel Aoun, caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, and a delegation of social and political figures. A large group of ambassadors in Lebanon also took part, along with a representative of Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei. Former Lebanese President Michel Aoun pens a message after offering condolences for the two martyred leaders (Feb 26, 2025) The ceremony saw the presence of current and former ministers and MPs, in addition to delegations from various Lebanese regions, including the South, Bekaa, Akkar, and Tripoli.

What’s Left of Sayyed Safeiddine Speech after Being Elected as Sa...	Here an image of what’s left of the speech written by martyr Sayyed Hashem Safeiddine after being elected as successor of Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah. Below is the text of the speech: 'Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent example for whoever has hope in Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah often. When the believers saw the enemy alliance, they said, 'This is what Allah and His Messenger had promised us. The promise of Allah and His Messenger has come true.' And this only increased them in faith and submission. Among the believers are men who have proven true to what they pledged to Allah.1 Some of them have fulfilled their pledge ˹with their lives˺, others are waiting ˹their turn˺. They have never changed ˹their commitment˺ in the least.' (Al-Ahzab, 21-22-23) First, I extend heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs and sympathy with those who have injured over their sufferings due to the Israeli aggression on our country, asking Allah to reward their patience. I address you O’ dear ones in our beloved country Lebanon as well as Arab and Muslim countries. I address the free people of the world and all those who refuse oppression and fight the tyrants. There is no doubt that sadness and grief dominate our hearts over crimes and massacres committed by the Israeli enemy. Such crimes have been carried out amid US cover and international silence that reaches the extent of incitation for nearly a year against the people of Gaza, and the Palestinian people in general, all the way to Lebanon, which has been subjected to these hideous and unjust attacks. Our grief is deep, great and indescribable for the loss of our leader, our master and our inspiration, our Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. His eminence led this blessed and victorious resistance, which achieved unprecedented victories and accomplished great events that were and will remain immortal, thanks to his leadership, wisdom and courage, and above all, due to his faith, sincerity and readiness to sacrifice everything he had for the sake of the cause. This cause, he believed in and has been committed to, along with his people, his family and the families of the martyrs and the wounded.' What's left of Sayyed Hashem Safeiddine's speech. Sayyed Safeiddine was to deliver the speech at the same day when he was martyred in an Israeli strike on Mraijeh area, in Beirut’s southern suburb, Dahiyeh, on October 4, a week after the massive strikes that killed Sayyed Nasrallah. Hundreds of thousands, including figures and activists from all over the world, bid farewell to the Hezbollah secretary generals last Sunday, in a mass funeral at Beirut's Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2349558	2025-02-26T03:16:54-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-02758960017405682681.jpg

Authorities claim the demolitions are necessary to clear the way for a new road linking the camp's agency area to the Balawneh neighborhood, but residents are left grappling with the destruction of their homes and the surrounding community infrastructure.

Israeli aircraft launched a wave of intense aerial strikes across Syria, coinciding with a ground invasion into key towns within the Quneitra countryside and the Daraa governorate. The overnight aggression targeted critical areas, including Daraa, al-Suweida, and the outskirts of Damascus. Witnesses reported seeing Israeli drones actively surveilling the Quneitra province, while Israeli warplanes executed bombings in the strategic al-Kiswah region and circled over the capital. Israeli warplanes have launched multiple airstrikes across southern Syria, hours after the conclusion of the Syrian National Dialogue Conference, which had issued a statement condemning Israel’s military actions. — Quds News Network (@QudsNen) February 25, 2025 Local media noted that at least six loud explosions echoed through the Suweida countryside, signaling the extent of the airstrikes. Israeli media sources claimed that military infrastructure, including weapons caches belonging to the former Syrian regime, were destroyed in the barrage. Furthermore, a Syrian Arab Army camp in the eastern Daraa countryside was reportedly among the targets hit. Israeli Security Minister Israel Katz confirmed the offensive, stating, 'The Israeli Air Force is striking hard in southern Syria,' emphasizing that the government 'will not allow Southern Syria to turn into Southern Lebanon.' Since the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime, Israeli occupation forces have launched an unprecedented military campaign, decimating strategic defenses including cruise missile systems, ballistic missile systems, and air defense mechanisms, alongside significant damage to the Syrian naval fleet and research facilities. This latest aggression is part of an ongoing ground offensive aimed at securing additional territory, specifically within the strategic Mount Hermon region and other southern provinces. Reports indicate that the current Israeli advance in northern Quneitra and Daraa marks the deepest penetration into Syrian territory since the new regime took power, with objectives focused on complete control of southern Syria.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2349206	2025-02-25T23:45:40-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-01888760017405559355.jpg
Israeli Drone Raid on Bekaa Leaves Casualties, Hezbollah Warns	Zionist drone raided late Tuesday the Shaara area in the eastern Mount Range above the town of Janta in Bekaa, leaving two martyrs and two injuries. Member of Loyalty to Resistance parliamentary bloc, Dr. Ibrahim Al-Moussawi, commented in a statement on the Zionist aggression, describing it as a serious violation and a blatant and explicit aggression that breaches the executive procedures of Resolution 1701. 'Once again in less than a month, the Israeli enemy forces are carrying out a criminal aggression deep inside Lebanese territory, which resulted in the martyrdom of two people and the injury of two others. This constitutes a serious violation and a blatant and explicit aggression that breaches the executive procedures of Resolution 1701, which places the responsible parties concerned and guarantors of the implementation of the agreement before their responsibilities in firmly confronting the enemy’s violations of Lebanese sovereignty.' MP Al-Moussaiw affirmed that his persistent and systematic escalation by the enemy without any serious and responsible action by the international guarantors shows their indifference or inability at best, and confirms the enemy’s disavowal of any serious obligations and its lack of respect for the international community as a whole. 'The Lebanese state, represented by the presidency, the government and the army, is requested to take immediate action by all available means to quickly put an end to the Zionist criminality and stop this ongoing aggression on the Lebanese and violation of the sovereignty of the state over its lands.' If the criminal attacks against Lebanon by the enemy continue without the international community taking deterrent punitive measures or condemning the enemy and obligating it to respect the approved agreements and understandings, it shall be considered an encouragement to it to continue its acts of aggression, according to MP Al-Mouusawi who added that this may turn to be an implicit acceptance and collusion with it in the policy of killing, destruction, bulldozing and violation of sovereignty, which is completely condemned and contradicts the simplest principles of respecting the sovereignty of states and protecting their peoples and properties. The Zionist border violations also included throwing flares at the outskirts of Naqoura and Alma Al-shaab.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2349151	2025-02-25T11:32:15-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00168520017405119261.jpg

Five Occupation Posts in South Lebanon Source of Fear: Israeli Ci...	The Israeli media covered up the issue of the northern settlements few days before the government decision to return the displaced settlers takes effect, highlighting the large-scale case of confusion and fear. Around 100 thousand settlers were evacuated from the North when Hezbollah started its border battle against the Zionist enemy in support of Gaza on October 8, 2023. March 1 is the set date for the return of the settlers who cast doubts on the government intention to rebuild the houses and infrastructure facilities in the northern settlements which lie zero to five kilometers away from Lebanon borders. The Zionist failure to eradicate Hezbollah threat during the all-out war on Lebanon exacerbated the situation of the northern settlements which witnessed a massive destruction caused by Hezbollah missiles. Talia Corland, a settler from Al-Manara settlement, said: 'I lost my house, and darkness prevails at night in Al-Manara. We are not sure if the government would help in the reconstruction of the many destroyed buildings.' Kiryat Shmona settler, Shern Ohaion, said that the Israeli government obliged her to return to the settlement despite her rejection and concerns about the future of her children in the area. Avichai stern, Kiryat Shmona mayor, said that the Israeli government is trying to return the settlers at any expense, wondering what would happen when the Zionist troops complete their withdrawal from Lebanon. The Israeli media indicated that discussions run by various circles in the Zionist entity estimated that Hezbollah would not give an open-ended chance for the Lebanese government to seek diplomatically the Israeli withdrawal. i24 Channel mentioned that Hezbollah would try to target the five Israeli occupation posts in South Lebanon and that no one know when that would happen. The Zionist media affirmed that the US administration has approved the Israeli occupation of the five posts in South Lebanon, adding that the Americans have granted 'Israel' the permission to strike any target inside Lebanon. It is worth noting that the Zionist enemy completed its withdrawal from South Lebanon on February 18, 2025, keeping five occupation positions in Mount Jal Al-Deir (Aitaroun), Al-Hamames Hill (Al-Khiam), Mount Blat (between Ramyah and Marwaheen), Houla-Markaba Main Road, and Al-Labbouneh Hill (Outskirts of Naqoura and Alma Al-Shaab).	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2349019	2025-02-25T09:52:24-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-07987610017405059369.png
Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah’s Funeral: A Farewell of Defiance, A Lega...	A massive sea of mourners flooded the streets of Beirut on the historic day of February 23, 2025, honoring the funeral of martyred Hezbollah Secretaries-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Sayyed Hashem Safieddine. The location: Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium. The numbers: over 1.4 million people from more than 80 countries, including numerous Arab and international delegations. They gathered to pay their final respects and express unwavering loyalty to the resistance and its fallen leader. Amid emotional scenes, the stadium and surrounding areas echoed with thunderous chants as clenched fists were raised toward the sky, reaffirming the covenant of loyalty. It was a moment where grief merged with resolve, and sorrow stood hand in hand with strength. Beirut’s Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium buzzes with devoted mourners (Feb. 23, 2025) 'Today, we bid farewell to an exceptional, historic leader, a national, Arab, and Islamic figure who has become a symbol of freedom for oppressed people around the world,' Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem told the massive crowd. He added, 'This gathering is an unparalleled expression of loyalty in Lebanon’s history.' 'Sayyed Hassan’s steadfast commitment to the resistance centered on Palestine and Jerusalem, and he played a pivotal role in revitalizing this cause, sacrificing his life on the front lines,' Qassem emphasized. 'We will honor his legacy, continue on this path, and uphold his will—no matter the cost.' The Hezbollah leader also stated that 'Israel' 'can no longer sustain its occupation and aggression,' declaring that the resistance is 'entering a new phase—one that requires new tools, strategies, and approaches.' Sheikh Qassem underscored that the armed resistance remains strong, ever-ready, and firmly rooted in international law—its legitimacy unshakable by any foreign power. He insisted that Israel must withdraw from all occupied territories, affirming that the resistance is 'written in blood, not ink on paper.' Addressing the enemy, he declared, 'Writhe in your anger. The resistance stands strong and unwavering.' The event drew numerous political, diplomatic, and religious figures from Lebanon and beyond, reflecting broad international participation. Among the attendees were Lebanese officials, including Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, as well as representatives of President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam. A high-profile Iranian delegation, led by Speaker Mohammad Qalibaf and Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, took part, along with a four-member team representing Iran’s Supreme Leader Sayyed Ali Khamenei. Iraqi and Yemeni delegations also played a prominent role, reaffirming their solidarity with Lebanon and its resistance. Palestinian resistance factions participated to renew their commitment to the struggle against Israeli occupation. Additionally, revolutionaries and supporters from countries spanning from Indonesia to Venezuela attended, demonstrating global solidarity with Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and the broader resistance movement. The blessed coffins of the two Secretary-Generals carried on a hearse made it through the great crowd, relaying messages unspoken by Sheikh Naim. Messages from the souls of millions to their enemy, who arrogantly laid claim to the sky in same fighter jets that committed the heinous act of murdering the two great leaders and their comrades in the midst of a crowded residential area still bustling with the same people that then stood in the stadium to tell them thus: 'We, without him, yet remain.' The message given by the people is one echoed by the many sacrifices that several groups of them gave, groups who were honored in the great event. First, without marking any sort of hierarchy, came the families of the thousands of martyrs that transcended to the beyond in this battle and all the battles that came before it. Their shoulders, adorned with sashes honoring their sacrifices glinted in the center of the stadium underneath the bright sun, signaling their acceptance of Allah’s great will and their readiness to continue giving all of what is most dear to them for this beautiful journey. Second, the many wounded fighters and civilians who literally and figuratively sacrificed life and limb to be there in that moment. Many of whom had their eyesight, hands and fingers stolen by the treachery of the enemy during the pager and handheld radio attacks that injured and killed both civilian and soldier. They, with eyes and hands concealed behind bands emblazoned with the revolutionary mottos of Karbala and the great Imam, Imam Hussein (as), were there to say that they would fight even if the battle took each of their five senses away.

In the Shia religion, respect for martyrs and veterans is an important principle pic.twitter.com/qwBAKOU0Aa — Abshar Tasnim (@Abshar_Tasnim2) February 24, 2025 Third, the warriors who faced the enemy at every valley, mountain peak, fjord and ravine stomped their boots against the ground in defiance as they carried their dearly beloved leader for one final time to his resting place. In their unwavering stance, in their covered faces and stern brows, in the folds of their tempered bodies lies the message they carry to the enemy and the responsibility they inherit from the great Sayyed Hasan and his comrades who came before him, a message of immortal vigilance over the people they are entrusted with. National, international, continental, heroic and self-sacrificial were the titles of the directives that littered the inside and outside of the stadium, messages from the masses and from individuals who dared not to miss those moments for the world. Moments which they all fought, struggled, traveled and patiently waited for, now a reality they all experienced together. As the sun set over Beirut, the funeral of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Sayyed Hashem Safieddine became more than a moment of mourning—it was a declaration of resilience, unity, and defiance. From Lebanon to the farthest reaches of the world, the presence of millions affirmed that the resistance is not tied to a single leader but is an undying force carried in the hearts of those who believe in its cause. The chants, the vows, and the steadfast gazes of the attendees sent a resounding unified message: the struggle continues, the legacy endures, and the path carved in sacrifice will not be abandoned.

'He was a man who led the resistance to the nation and the nation to the resistance, with his unwavering focus always on Palestine and Al-Quds,' his eminence added.

We support its liberation and will confront Trump’s displacement scheme. Lebanon is the final homeland for its people, and we are its people.' 'The sacrifices we have made are unparalleled, just as the level of Israeli criminality in Gaza and the region is unprecedented. The battle to support Gaza is part of our belief in liberating Palestine.' 'The Israeli enemy aimed to eliminate the resistance in both Gaza and Lebanon, but the scale of sacrifices was immense, and the resilience was unparalleled—this is a great achievement.' A New Phase Sheikh Qassem emphasized that the resistance remains strong in numbers and capabilities. 'Our people remain strong. Now, we have entered a new phase—one with different tools and methods,' his eminence declared. Sheikh Qassem sent a direct and clear message to Washington saying, 'Your project is doomed.

His eminence accused the Israeli enemy of repeatedly violating the ceasefire agreement while reaffirming Hezbollah’s commitment to it. 'We are facing a brutal occupation and relentless aggression. Yet, the resistance remains strong and unwavering. The inevitable victory is coming,' his eminence stated. Sheikh Qassem made a firm promise to Lebanese prisoners held by the Israeli occupation, vowing, 'We will not abandon you. We will exert all necessary pressure to secure your freedom.' Sheikh Qassem also outlined Hezbollah’s strategic approach to the confrontation. 'We have taken a clear step: the Lebanese state must assume its responsibilities. As for us, we will act according to circumstances—we will open fire when we see fit, and we will exercise patience when we see fit,' his eminence declared. Defying US Pressure, Challenging Sovereignty Advocates Sheikh Qassem directly addressed the United States, warning that its schemes would fail. He urged Washington to abandon its conspiracies, emphasizing that patience should not be mistaken for weakness, as Hezbollah would never accept occupation in silence. Turning to Lebanese advocates of sovereignty, he questioned their silence in the face of Israeli and US aggression. He challenged them to reflect on their inaction, asking, 'Where were you when an agreement was possible? Why do we hear no condemnation from you against the Israeli enemy?' Hezbollah’s Unwavering Commitment Reaffirming Hezbollah’s ideological roots, Sheikh Qassem declared the party’s allegiance to the path of resistance, tracing its lineage to Imam Khamenei, Imam Khomeini, Imam Sayyed Musa Sadr, Sayyed Abbas Al-Mousawi, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, Hajj Qassem Soleimani, and Hajj Imad Mughniyeh. He reiterated that resistance remains the foundation and will persist as long as occupation continues. At the same time, Hezbollah remains committed to building a strong and just Lebanese state under the Taif Agreement, upholding national unity, civil peace, and inclusive governance. He also reaffirmed Hezbollah’s unbreakable alliance with the Amal Movement, warning against attempts to divide them: 'Our bond is sealed with blood. We stand as one in position, choices, and politics.' A Final Farewell to Sayyed Nasrallah Concluding his speech, Sheikh Qassem bid a final farewell to the martyred leaders, saying, 'Rest in God's peace, O Sayyed Nasrallah, alongside your loyal companion, Sayyed Safieddine.

‘Israel’ Delays Release of Palestinian Prisoners After Hamas Hand...	The Israeli government has reportedly postponed the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, despite a recent prisoner swap with Hamas. According to reports, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to delay the release of the seventh group of Palestinian prisoners, citing the need for further consultations 'based on the goal of returning all of our hostages - the living and the dead.' The decision comes after Hamas handed over six Israeli captives to ‘Israel’ on Saturday, as part of the initial 42-day phase of the ceasefire agreement that took effect on January 19th. Under the agreement, 33 Israeli captives were to be released in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. However, with four Israeli captives still remaining to be released in the first phase, Netanyahu has now decided to hold off on the planned release of 602 Palestinian prisoners, pending further discussions. 🛑Breaking | The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office: 'We have decided to suspend the release of Palestinian prisoners until we ensure the liberation of the next hostages without provocative ceremonies.' pic.twitter.com/8UpzlY3UMJ — Eye on Palestine (@EyeonPalestine) February 22, 2025 The delay has angered the families of the Palestinian prisoners, who are now organizing protests to demand that Israel honor the terms of the ceasefire deal and proceed with the planned prisoner release.

He warned that the catastrophic situation in Gaza requires 'mediators to pressure the occupation to implement the humanitarian protocol and provide our people with shelter and relief supplies.' The Palestinian resistance group has previously warned that it could delay the release of Israeli captives if the Israeli occupation military violates the ceasefire deal.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2346027	2025-02-22T22:44:44-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-067688600174004439410.jpeg

Six Days in War Crowned Hashemite Martyr’s Decades of Hezbollah I...	The martyrdom of the great Islamic fighting leader, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, represents the pinnacle of sacrifice and a beacon for generations to continue on the path of resistance, the path walked by the great martyr leader His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah …' On October 23, Hezbollah issued the statement which eulogizes the second Secretary General Hashemite Martyr Sayyed Hashem Saffiedine in face of the barbaric Israeli war on Lebanon in 2024. Rarely do organizations, governments and various public bodies have their leaders on the top of sacrifice. Hezbollah has been presenting the brilliant sample of leaders who reject to hide behind in the rear lines of the military confrontation. The challenge of the martyrdom of Sayyed Nasrallah on September 27 was an extravagantly heavy load on Hezbollah command leading a historical war of defense against the Israeli war on Lebanon. Announcing the decision to hold the funeral of the two great martyrs on February 23, 2025, Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem said that Sayyed Safieddine would be mourned in his capacity as a Secretary General. Sheikh Qassem highlighted that after being elected to the position just four days following Sayyed Nasrallah’s martyrdom, Sayyed Safieddine was martyred on October 3, 2024. Thus, Martyr Sayyed Safieddine assumed the military responsibility to maintain the steadfastness of the resistance in the confrontation with the enemy by ensuring the missile fire. The grave danger did not lead the new commander to escape or hide in a safe position. His eminence insisted on leading the Islamic Resistance from the alternative operations chamber after the targeting the basic one and the martyrdom of Sayyed Nasrallah. Sayyed Safieddine had six days to lead the resistance before the treacherous Israeli warplanes targeted the alternative operations chamber. Member of Loyalty to Resistance bloc, Dr. Hasan Fadlallah, affirmed that Martyr Sayyed Safieddine rejected all the proposals which urged him to leave the operations room, adding that his eminence insisted on the importance of the leader's steadfastness. Institutional Resistance The Hashemite Martyr scribed numerous stories of success in the domain of Hezbollah's institutional resistance being the chief of the Party's Executive |Council, concerned with the social and economic institutions affiliated with Hezbollah. Hezbollah's main doctrine was based on protecting the people and securing their basic needs. Thus the Party struggled to attach the victory of the military resistance to a success in the domain of civil service. In this regard, Martyr Sayyed Safieddine followed the path of the martyred Secretary General of Hezbollah Sayyed Abbas Al-Moussawi, inspecting the poor neighborhoods in Beirut's Dahiyeh. On the basis of securing the people's needs, Martyr Sayyed Safieddine performed proficiently as the head of Hezbollah civil institutions in the fields of medicine, education, and finance. During his tenure, Hezbollah institutions witnessed a remarkable development, especially the medical sector which managed to successfully cope with the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in Lebanon. Upon the escalation of the economic siege on Lebanon in 2019, Hezbollah established Al-Sajjad cooperatives with a discount card that helps break the goods monopoly and provide the underpaid citizens with the needed commodities amid the great traces of Martyr Sayyed Safieddine. Educationally, Martyr Sayyed Safieddine contributed to the huge leap of Al-Mahdi Schools and the establishment of Al-Maaref University which also showed a steady and fast progress in the academic performance in Lebanon. Martyr Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah and Martyr Sayyed Hashem Safieddine attend the opening of Maaref University in 2015 The educated thinker and religious scholar spent half of 62-year lifetime fighting in defense of the Islamic Resistance and securing the needs of its supporters. The Hashemite martyr rejected to escape at the hardest moment of the 2024 Israeli war on Lebanon, showing unmatched bravery. This type of leaders that Hezbollah is proud of having continuously crowning the great jihadi journey, which descends from Karbala of Imam Hussein (A.S.) till either martyrdom or victory.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2345565	2025-02-22T07:58:03-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-00328420017402398482.jpg

Hamas has, however, refuted these allegations, calling them 'pure lies' and part of a 'war of extermination.' As the first phase of the exchange deal progresses, the negotiations for the second phase are ongoing, with the United States setting a two-week goal for Hamas and the Israeli occupation to reach an agreement. The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has stressed its commitment to the ceasefire agreement, emphasizing that the reconstruction of Gaza must be done with national consensus and without external interference.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2345312	2025-02-22T01:58:40-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2025/02/manar-09247860017402182992.jpg
Trump Was Ready to Stop Military Aid to Ukraine over Zelensky’s I...	US President Donald Trump was reportedly so fed up with Vladimir Zelensky’s recent impudence that he was ready to pull US military assistance from Ukraine, three US officials close to the situation told Axios. Six administration officials told Axios that Zelensky also rubbed Vice President Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz the wrong way with his recent behavior. The portal's sources in the White House explained what has caused America's about-face on Zelensky. Thus, he refused to sign an agreement with the United States on rare earth metals and, as Trump noted, 'was rude' to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant during his visit to Kiev. At a security conference in Munich, Zelensky 'surprised' Vance and Rubio by claiming he could not personally approve the rare earth metals deal, publicly refusing to pursue it. Zelensky caused even greater indignation among the US administration with his ill-advised comments about the Russian-American consultations in Riyadh and his assertion that Ukraine should be at the negotiating table. Trump later called Zelensky a dictator, saying that his popularity with Ukrainians had tanked to 4%, and that elections should be held in Ukraine. The last straw, according to the portal's sources, was when the head of the Kiev regime said that Trump had become a 'victim of Russian disinformation,' which the White House considered an insult. In an interview with the National Pulse edition Vance slammed Zelensky for making derogatory comments publicly, noting that this is not a good way to deal with President Trump. On February 19, Russian President Vladimir Putin noted that Kiev's hysteria about its absence at the Russia-US negotiations was inappropriate, since Moscow and Washington had bilateral issues to discuss	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2345180	2025-02-21T13:36:17-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2020/12/manar-07429450016081960808.jpg
Hezbollah Will Neither Abandon Resistance Nor Let Lebanon Return ...	Deputy Chief of Hezbollah Executive Council Sheikh Ali Daamoush stressed that the Resistance Party rejects Lebanon's subjection to US-Israeli dictates and threats to strike Beirut's airport as well as vital facilities. Delivering Friday sermon, Sheikh Daamoush called on the Lebanese government to tackle the Iranian flights file as it pertains to Lebanon's sopvereignty and dignity. 'US-Israeli ban on the landing of the Iranian flights at Beirut's airport confiscates the Lebanese decision, blatantly intervenes in Lebanon's international relations, and paves way for more dictates which may never end,' his eminence said. Sheikh Daamoush also underlined Hezbollah would neither accept Israeli occupation of even an inch of the Lebanese territory nor abandon the resistance path which would be the response to the Zionist aggression. Hezbollah official underscored that Hezbollah will never let Lebanon return to the time of weakness, stressing that the nation has the right to defend itself by all means and at whatever cost. 'We are powerful thanks to our faith, will, determination and the bravery of our resistance, army and people.' Sheikh Daamoush also affirmed, 'We are invited on Sunday to attend the funeral of an exceptional, historic leader in a civilized scene.' The funeral will be neither a referendum to measure the popular support for the resistance whose role obtains legitimacy when the occupation exists, nor a way to restore prestige because it has not been lost, according to Sheikh Daamoush. Sheikh Daamoush confirmed that the funeral will be attended by the loyal supporters of the resistance who will reiterate commitment to the path of the martyred leader who spent his honorable life defending Lebanon, its sovereignty and national dignity, achieved victories, thwarted the enemy’s goals, held the cause of Palestine and the causes of the nation, and ascended as a martyr all the way to Al-Quds, truly deserving the title: Master of the Martyrs of the Nation.

Al-Qanou stressed that Hamas remains 'committed to the ceasefire agreement as long as the Israeli occupation is committed to it.'

However, the talks on the second phase, which were supposed to begin on February 3, have yet to materialize. Netanyahu's Refusal to Negotiate Leads to Captives' Deaths The stalled negotiations come amid growing public outrage over the return of four Israeli captives, including a mother and her two children, who were killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza during the 15-month war. Hamas has accused Netanyahu of being responsible for their deaths, stating that the 'criminal Netanyahu is crying today over the bodies of his prisoners who returned to him in coffins.' The opposition has also blamed Netanyahu for the captives' deaths, arguing that he stalled the prisoner swap for months to avoid jeopardizing his fragile coalition, which includes far-right ministers pushing for the continuation of the war in Gaza. The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and his former minister of military affairs Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. Additionally, the International Court of Justice is considering accusations that Israel committed genocide in its war on Gaza. As the ceasefire talks remain in limbo, the people of Gaza continue to grapple with the aftermath of the devastating conflict, which claimed the lives of at least 48,319 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured 111,749 others.	https://english.almanar.com.lb/2344806	2025-02-21T02:25:51-08:00	https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2016/09/manar-07632360014745454023-e1698484116887.jpeg

Three Bus Explosions Rock Occupied Tel Aviv, Triggering Panic Amo...	Three buses exploded on Thursday evening at different locations in the 'Bat Yam' settlement, south of the occupied city of 'Tel Aviv,' sending shockwaves across the Israeli entity. According to Israeli media, the 'Shin Bet' has launched an investigation into the suspected placement of explosive devices inside the buses, which reportedly caused the blasts. Zionist officials also confirmed the discovery of two additional unexploded devices. In response to the explosions, train services in Bat Yam were entirely suspended. Israeli so-called security forces issued urgent instructions for all bus drivers in the 'Tel Aviv' area to inspect their vehicles, with media reports suggesting that a large-scale operation had been planned. Zionist Authorities Scramble to Contain the Situation The Bat Yam municipality confirmed that two of the explosions occurred at bus stops while the vehicles were unoccupied, resulting in no injuries. However, Zionist officials acknowledged that the full details remain unclear and that extensive search and precautionary measures are underway to rule out any further threats. Meanwhile, Israeli enemy police issued a statement confirming that they suspect a deliberate attack, citing the multiple bus explosions. A wide number of Israeli occupation security forces were deployed to the affected sites, launching a manhunt for possible suspects while bomb disposal teams examined suspicious objects in the area.

Fierce Clashes Erupt as Israeli Occupation Forces Raid West Bank,...	The Israeli occupation forces (IOF) stormed several cities and refugee campsin the occupied west bank, resulting in deadly confrontations with Palestinian resistance fighters. The raids began in the city of Nablus, where the IOF descended upon the vicinity of the National Hospital, the eastern district, the Askar refugee camp, and the town of Beita.

Supreme Leader Says Iran’s Definite Policy is to Expand Ties with...	Leader of the Islamic Revolution Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei has said expanding ties with neighboring countries remains the 'definite policy' of the Islamic Republic, as he received Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in Tehran. The Qatari Emir arrived in Tehran earlier in the day on an official visit and sat down for talks with President Masoud Pezeshkian before meeting Ayatollah Khamenei. 'One of the policies announced by the administration of Mr. Pezeshkian is the expansion of ties with neighbors,' Ayatollah Khamenei said during the meeting, which was also attended by President Pezeshkian. He noted that the Pezeshkian administration has already taken good measures to enhance relations with neighboring countries, achieving some level of progress thus far. Ayatollah Khamenei expressed hope that the agreements reached earlier in the day between Iranian and Qatari officials would benefit both countries, enabling them to fulfill their 'neighborly duties' more effectively. In his remarks, the Leader emphasized that Iran considers Qatar a 'friendly and brotherly country,' despite some 'unclear and unresolved' matters, including the issue of frozen Iranian assets. Approximately $6 billion in Iranian funds remain frozen under U.S. sanctions and are currently held in a Qatari bank after being released by South Korea in September 2023. The Leader criticized the United States for obstructing the agreement to return the funds to Iran. 'We know that the U.S. is the main obstacle to the implementation of an agreement that had been reached in this regard,' he said, adding that Iran expects Qatar to resist pressure from Washington and return Iran’s assets. For his part, Qatar’s Emir expressed satisfaction with his meeting with Ayatollah Khamenei and praised the Leader for Iran’s support of the Palestinian people. He acknowledged the ongoing tensions in the West Asia region, saying regional countries should cooperate more to address the current situation.

Archbishop Hanna: Palestine is Loyal to Martyr Sayyed Nasrallah’s...	Archbishop Atallah Hanna, Archbishop of Sebastia for the Greek Orthodox in occupied Palestine delivered a message in eulogy of the Nation’s Master of Martyrs, Hezbollah Secretary-General His Eminence, Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah. 'Dear beloved, in a few days, Lebanon will witness a great and exceptional event—the funeral of His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and the martyrs who were with him. From Al-Quds, we stand in reverence and honor for the sacrifices of His Eminence Sayyed Nasrallah, his companions, and his associates—those who stood with Palestine, defended Palestine, and paid a heavy price for Palestine. We are loyal to these sacrifices; all Palestinians are loyal to the sacrifices of His Eminence and his comrades,' he said. 'As we offer our condolences and send a message of sympathy from the heart of our sacred city, we affirm that we will never forget those who stood with Palestine and defended it in the darkest times and the most difficult circumstances. Today, there is a conspiracy against the Palestinian cause. Our enemies seek to displace our people and liquidate our cause, but Palestinians will not raise the flag of surrender. They remain steadfast in their rights, principles, and convictions. The word 'surrender' does not exist in our Palestinian vocabulary.' 'Dear beloved, we are all one family, one nation, standing against colonial projects that do not target Palestine alone but the entire nation. Our message has always been and will always be that Palestine is the compass. Those whose compass is Palestine are in the right place, and those whose compass is elsewhere are in the wrong place. We call upon them to correct their deviation and realign their compass in the right direction,' Archbishop Hanna added. 'Dear beloved, our message in these times is that we must be united as a nation—Christians, Muslims, and all sects and denominations. They want us to be fragmented and divided, to speak the language of sectarianism, and to be internally divided so that they can pass their projects under the well-known colonial strategy of 'divide and rule.' They seek to fragment us to facilitate their colonial plans that target Palestine and the entire nation.' 'We, Christians and Muslims in this East, will remain one nation. Our compass is Al-Quds, our cause is Palestine, and we must not allow anyone or any entity to advance their schemes aimed at further division and fragmentation. We are one family—this is how we were, and this is how we shall remain,' Archbishop Hanna concluded.
