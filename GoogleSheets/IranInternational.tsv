Emad Vakili - Intersection - Made by Luvan Akin, a joint production of Turkey and Georgia, tells an untold story: the search of a trans girl in Istanbul who escaped from the pressure of her family in a village in Georgia. From the moment the main characters arrive in Istanbul in search of him, the film becomes fully a work about this city, which it looks up to with admiration. Everything in this busy, very populated and large city forms the main part of the film, in which two Georgian travelers are engaged in walking and sightseeing in a small but attractive city, and we become observers along with them who go to different corners and urban areas. We travel, which are usually hidden from the eyes of countless tourists in this city.

Forwarded From Iran International Sport ┻ ISNA, citing Alireza Heydari, rejected the story of the world wrestling champion being kicked out of a live TV program after talking about Kimia Alizadeh: - The matter is not as it was raised in the virtual space. It was not the case that someone said that I am no longer in the program, I myself wanted to leave the program. - 🔹 ISNA also quoted Heydari and wrote: - I myself had requested the presenters and producers of the program to leave the live broadcast early. Because it was late and I was tired. If someone said that I will no longer be in the program, it was not true.
