Forwarded From Iran International Sport ┻ ISNA, citing Alireza Heydari, rejected the story of the world wrestling champion being kicked out of a live TV program after talking about Kimia Alizadeh: - The matter is not as it was raised in the virtual space. It was not the case that someone said that I am no longer in the program, I myself wanted to leave the program. - 🔹 ISNA also quoted Heydari and wrote: - I myself had requested the presenters and producers of the program to leave the live broadcast early.
