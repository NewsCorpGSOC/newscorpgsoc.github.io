Forwarded From Iran International Sports üîª After Alireza Heydari, the world wrestling champion, expressed his displeasure for Kimia Alizadeh's immigration in the program covering the closing of the 2024 Olympics, the Islamic Republic of Iran kicked him out of the program. This happened during the live broadcast. During the fight between Kimia Alizadeh and Nahid Kiani, the 57-kg Iranian taekwondo athletes who fought each other under the flag of Bulgaria and the other under the flag of Iran in the 2024 Olympics, they made statements against Kimia. They used Alizadeh, which faced a lot of criticism and the audience considered it an example of hate speech. Even Sed and Radio censored the scene of Nahid Kiani hugging Kimia Alizadeh. @iraninltvsport	https://t.me/IranintlTV/240986	2024-08-11T14:56:44-07:00

Murad Vaisi, Iran International: The absence of a Sunni minister in the cabinet proposed by doctors is a sign of discrimination and the continuation of a process that began at the beginning of the Islamic Revolution.
